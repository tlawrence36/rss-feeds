      "Taylor Swift is likely headed to her second straight Super Bowl",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- You could say that Taylor Swift's championship era is in its second consecutive season.",
      "The 14-time Grammy Award-winning superstar returned to Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday and watched her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and the rest of the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Buffalo Bills 32-29 for a spot in their third consecutive Super Bowl.",
      "Swift walked down the tunnel to her usual suite about 90 minutes before kickoff. And while she was decked out in Chanel for the divisional round against Houston, she opted for a sleek black-and-gold Louis Vuitton look for the AFC title game, including a jacquard knit jacket that retails for $5,000 and a stocking cap with a list price of $830.",
      "Modest fare compared to what suite prices for the Super Bowl will probably run.",
      "Swift will almost certainly be in New Orleans with her celebrity friends when the Chiefs go for an unprecedented third straight Lombardi Trophy against the Philadelphia Eagles on Feb. 9. They got a big game from Patrick Mahomes \u2014 no surprise there \u2014 and some key stops from their defense to get past the Bills.",
      "Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. And their relationship only seemed to blossom into the new year, with Swift eventually celebrating on the field with Kelce after the Chiefs had beaten the Ravens in Baltimore for the AFC championship.",
      "Then came the Super Bowl, and Swift's much-watched dash from a concert in Tokyo for kickoff of the big game in Las Vegas.",
      "She made it with plenty of time to spare, of course. And Swift became the focus of attention in her own right, winning what appeared to be a beer-chugging contest, partying with celebrity suite mates such as Blake Lively, Ice Spice and Lana Del Rey, and standing next to Kelce's mother, Donna, while he held aloft the Lombardi Trophy following the 25-22 win over the 49ers.",
      "The couple eventually locked lips again on the field at Allegiant Stadium.",
      "As confetti flew on the field, they kissed again in celebration at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday night. Swift gave Chiefs coach Andy Reid a big hug, and she celebrated with Donna Kelce and the rest of some 80,000 fans.",

      "NEW YORK -- Critics lambasted it and audiences didn\u2019t grade it much better. But despite the turbulence, Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cFlight Risk\u201d managed to open No. 1 at the box office with a modest $12 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "On a quiet weekend, even for the typically frigid movie-going month of January, the top spot went to the Lionsgate thriller starring Mark Wahlberg as a pilot flying an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) and fugitive (Topher Grace) across Alaska. But it wasn\u2019t a particularly triumphant result for Gibson\u2019s directorial follow-up to 2016\u2019s \u201cHacksaw Ridge.\u201d Reviews (21% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a \u201cC\u201d CinemaScore) were terrible.",

      "The weekend was also a small test as to whether the once more common Oscar \u201cbump\u201d that can sometimes follow nominations still exists. Most contenders have by now completed the bulk of their theatrical runs and are more likely to see an uptick on VOD or streaming.",
      "But the weekend\u2019s most daring gambit was A24 pushing Brady Corbet\u2019s \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d a three\u2013and-a-half-hour epic nominated for 10 Academy Awards, into wide release. Though some executives initially greeted \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which is running with an intermission, as \u201cun-distributable,\u201d Corbet has said, A24 acquired the film out of the Venice Film Festival and it\u2019s managed solid business, collecting $6 million in limited release.",
      "In wide release, it earned $2.9 million \u2014 a far from blockbuster sum but the best weekend yet for \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "The audience was downright miniscule for another best-picture nominee: RaMell Ross\u2019 \u201cNickel Boys.\u201d Innovatively shot almost entirely in first-person POV, the Amazon MGM Studios release gathered just $340,171 in 540 locations after expanding by 300 theaters.",
      "Coming off one of the lowest Martin Luther King Jr. weekends in years, no new releases made a major impact.",
      "Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cPresence,\u201d a well-reviewed horror film shot from the perspective of a ghost inside a suburban home, debuted with $3.4 million in 1,750 locations. The film, released by Neon and acquired out of last year\u2019s Sundance, was made for just $2 million.",
      "The top spots otherwise went to holdovers. The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d in its sixth weekend of release, scored $8.7 million to hold second place. After starting slow, the Barry Jenkins-directed film has amassed $626.7 million globally.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d the Keke Palmer and SZA led comedy from Sony Pictures, held well in its second weekend, dropping just 32% with $8 million in ticket sales. In recent years, few comedies have found success on the big screen, but \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d has proven an exception.",

      "Hermes illuminated a gloomy Paris afternoon with its fall 2025 men\u2019s collection, as Veronique Nichanian turned to the racetrack for inspiration",
      "PARIS -- Hermes illuminated a gloomy Paris afternoon with its fall men\u2019s collection Saturday, as Veronique Nichanian turned to the racetrack for inspiration. Jockeys\u2019 vibrant racing silks became her muse, a dynamic counterpoint to the French maison\u2019s storied equestrian roots. \u201cI wanted this collection to be strong and energetic,\u201d Nichanian explained, her palette pivoting from deep browns and dark teals to flashes of tomato red and lemon yellow.",
      "The collection radiated warmth, both in spirit and texture. Fuzzy mohair coats, velvet varsity jackets and plush sheepskin outerwear wrapped models in an embrace that seemed designed to counter winter\u2019s chill. Layering was less pronounced this season, a deliberate move to retain sleek, streamlined silhouettes. Even gray pinstripe suits \u2014 pared back to essentials \u2014 eschewed bulk, echoing Nichanian\u2019s vision of men unencumbered as they race through life.",
      "Sweaters emerged as the collection\u2019s unsung heroes. Their bold chevrons and geometric patterns were lifted directly from the vibrant stripes of racing silks, a playful nod to Palais d\u2019I\u00e9na\u2019s soaring, angular architecture. A standout turtleneck, with its patchwork of triangles, rectangles, and squares in canary yellow, seemed to channel a nostalgic love for trigonometry. Elsewhere, a jacket with a shawl collar mirrored the same graphical bravado, rendered in cool tones of blue, black and white.",
      "Though grounded in classic tailoring, the collection celebrated irreverence. Nichanian\u2019s juxtaposition of tradition and innovation captured Herm\u00e8s\u2019 ethos with a quiet confidence. Here, functionality was imbued with a touch of whimsy, proving once again that the maison\u2019s refinement can still surprise and delight. In a season steeped in nostalgia and geometry, Herm\u00e8s delivered a collection that was, quite literally, off to the races."

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Rose Byrne plays a mother in the midst of a breakdown in the experiential psychological thriller \u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You.\u201d",
      "Anticipation was high for the A24 film, which will be released sometime this year. Its premiere Friday at the Sundance Film Festival was easily the hottest ticket in town, with even ticketholders unable to get in. Those who did make it into the Library theater were treated to an intense, visceral, inventive story from filmmaker Mary Bronstein that has quickly become one of the festival\u2019s must-sees.",
      "Byrne plays Linda, who is barely hanging on while managing her daughter\u2019s mysterious illness. She\u2019s faced with crisis after crisis, big and small \u2014 from the massive, gaping hole in their apartment ceiling that forces them to move to a dingy motel, to an escalating showdown with a parking attendant at a care center. The cracks in her psychological, emotional and physical wellbeing are become too much to bear.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never seen a movie before where a mother is going through a crisis with a child but our energy is not with the child\u2019s struggle, it\u2019s with the mother\u2019s,\u201d Bronstein said at the premiere. \u201cIf you\u2019re a caretaker, you shouldn\u2019t be bothering with yourself at all. It should all be about the person you\u2019re taking care of, right? And that is a particular kind of emotional burnout state that I was really interested in exploring.\u201d",
      "Byrne and Bronstein went deep in the preparation phase, having long discussions about Linda with the goal of making her as real as possible before the quick, 27-day shoot. Byrne said she was obsessed with figuring out who Linda was before the crisis. The film was in part inspired by Bronstein\u2019s experience with her own daughter, but she didn\u2019t want to elaborate on the specifics.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s her story to tell,\u201d Bronstein said.",
      "Part of Linda\u2019s story involves her therapist, played by Conan O\u2019Brien, who joked that he didn\u2019t realize he was in a movie.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not looking out for movie scripts or anything. But when I got a call from A24 that they wanted me to read something, I\u2019m not stupid,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI showed it to my wife, who is one of the smartest people I know, and she read through it and she said, \u2018I didn\u2019t know they made movies like this anymore.\u2019\u201d",
      "He was particularly in awe of his director and co-star, saying he felt like a fraud standing beside them.",
      "\u201cIt was an amazing experience, one of the best experiences of my life, just to be with them and watch them work,\u201d O'Brien said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how (Byrne) did that and not check into a hospital afterwards, because I haven\u2019t seen any actor, man or woman, sustain that level for an entire movie.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like I have to go to a hospital now, because this was the first time I watched it,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m a mess.\u201d",
      "A$AP Rocky also co-stars, as a man Linda meets at the motel, but was not in Park City for the premiere. He is currently on trial, charged with firing a gun at a former friend.",
      "The film is full of ambiguity, metaphor and just plain artistic expression that Bronstein hesitated to explain, from the name itself to the hole in the ceiling, which takes on a somewhat supernatural quality.",
      "\u201cWhen we have nothing left to give, we have an emptiness inside of us,\u201d Bronstein said. \u201cAnd that emptiness is actually not empty: It\u2019s filled with all the darkness and self-hate and doubt and fear and dread and regret and everything. \u2026 That to me is what the hole is.\u201d",
      "Some of it, she said, she doesn\u2019t even fully understand. The point is the experience, and critics and Sundance audiences are already fully on board.",
      "Bronstein, a bit of a cult figure in the film world, made her directorial debut in 2008 at the SXSW festival with \u201cYeast,\u201d which featured a pre-fame Greta Gerwig and was hailed by by New Yorker critic Richard Brody as a \u201cmumblecore classic.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You\u201d is only her second feature.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time that anybody else has paid for me to make art,\u201d Bronstein said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say that this is the film that came directly from my head to the screen.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- To celebrate an upcoming milestone, Alyssa Math could think of nothing more fitting than front-row tickets to \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d author Rebecca Yarros' appearance at The Town Hall in Manhattan.",
      "\u201cI'm getting married next weekend, so this is my bachelorette party,\u201d said Math, an accountant who traveled with friends from her home near Annapolis, Maryland. She has been one of millions of admirers of Yarros' work and a year ago drove two hours to Reston, Virginia, to see the author.",
      "\u201cIt's a huge cult following,\u201d said Math, wearing a white veil in homage to one of Yarros' characters. \u201cThe drama (of her books) keeps you on the edge of your seat.\u201d",
      "Friday night at The Town Hall had the feel of a costume party, rock concert and family reunion as a capacity crowd of around 1,500 clapped, laughed and shouted, \u201cYes, Queen!\" The \u201cEmpyrean\u201d series has made Yarros one of the country's most popular and obsessed-about leaders of romantasy, a newly branded genre combinging romance and fantasy.",
      "\u201cOnyx Storm\u201d is the much-awaited third installment of a planned five centered on the lovers Violet and Xaden, and the first since the million-selling \u201cIron Flame\u201d came out in 2023. In its first week of publication, \"Onyx Storm\" has already topped the bestseller lists of Amazon and sold more than 300,000 copies just through Barnes & Noble, according to a spokesperson for the superstore chain.",
      "Yarros, interviewed for some 75 minutes by Olympic gymnast and avowed fan Laurie Hernandez, shared a few insights about her writings (she already knows how the series will end), spoke lovingly of her husband (\"He's 6'4\" and hot as hell with a baby strapped to his chest\"), swore casually and joked that hers was the \u201conly profession where you can have imaginary fiends\u201d and not be considered insane.",
      "She expressed relief and pleasure over completing \u201cOnyx Storm,\" noting she had to block out her own popularity to get the writing done.",
      "\u201cAs much as I love you guys, I kind of pretend you don\u2019t exist,\u201d she said. \u201cI kind of ignore you, but I love you at the same time.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnyx Storm\u201d isn't quite a Harry Potter-level phenomenon \u2014 the final Potter book by J.K. Rowling, \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\u201d sold more than 8 million copies in the U.S. in its first 24 hours \u2014 but it carries a similar feeling of obsession, identification and spontaneity.",
      "Like the Potter books, the release of \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d was welcomed with midnight store parties around the country, gatherings for which fans showed up in costume. Some fans at The Town Hall finished the 526-page \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d within hours of receiving it, others are in no hurry.",
      "\"This is a book I personally want to take my time with,\" said Scarlett Fuentes, who arrived with her friend Zy Bao-angan, both of them in black leather.",
      "\"I want to savor this moment,\" Bao-angan said.",
      "Like Potter, enthusiasm for the Yarros books extends well beyond any organized publicity campaigns. The Potter books helped inspire some of the first Internet fan sites for books. Yarros and such fellow romantasy authors as Sarah J. Maas have been favorites of the young readers on BookTok, a TikTok community that has emerged as publishing's most effective driver of sales. Countless fans on BookTok and other social media \u2014 some crying, some cursing in amazement \u2014 have been posting their responses to \u201cOnyx Storm.\"",
      "On Friday, Hernandez and the audience posed questions about her books as if gossiping about friends. If Violet and Xaden were at a bar, what would they order? Violet would go for a lavender lemon drop, Xaden is fine with a beer. And which music genres define them? Xenon is heavy metal, Violet harder to label.",
      "Asked what was the most important lessons she has learned from writing the books, Yarros reminded her fans that she wasn't only a writer or public figure.",
      "\u201cI can say plotting and I can say everything, but probably the most important thing I've learned is that real life is what happens in my house, and what happens around my kitchenette and what happens in my living room chairs and what happens when my kids are all together and my husband's together,\u201d she said. \u201cReal life is not what happens on the internet.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love you guys,\u201d she added. \u201cBut peace out.\u201d"

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- The Sundance Film Festival welcomed back three Oscar-winning documentary filmmakers to help kick off the annual independent film showcase in Park City, Utah.",
      "On Thursday night at The Ray Theater, \u201c20 Days in Mariupol\u201d filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov, who won the Oscar last year, debuted his latest dispatch from Ukraine, \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a harrowing journey to the front lines of a 2023 counteroffensive. A few hours later, at the Eccles, Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson, who won an Oscar for \u201cSummer of Soul\u201d in 2022, unveiled his Sly Stone portrait, \u201cSLY LIVES! (aka The Burden of Black Genuis).\u201d Earlier, \u201cOne Day in September\u201d filmmaker Kevin MacDonald also showcased his film \u201cOne to One: John & Yoko,\u201d which debuted last year at the Venice Film Festival and will get an IMAX release on April 11 before hitting Max later this year.",
      "Some critics reflected that \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a joint production between The Associated Press and PBS Frontline, was even more powerful than \u201c20 Days in Mariupol.\u201d \u201cSLY LIVES!\u201d (on Hulu Feb. 13) was called \u201csublime\u201d and \u201cilluminating\u201d in its examination of an underappreciated, shapeshifting genius.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been coming here since 2000 and I thought the coolest thing you could do would be to DJ an after party,\u201d Thompson said before the screening. \u201cI never dreamt this for my future, so this is really humbling.\u201d",
      "It was a full-circle end to a day that began with a slate of documentary Oscar nominations all connected to the Sundance Institute in some way. Some were supported by the Institute, some debuted at the festival as recently as last year.",
      "\u201cBlack Box Diaries,\u201d in which a Japanese filmmaker investigates her own sexual assault, had its premiere in Park City last year and was supported by the Institute\u2019s doc film program. \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d made by a Palestinian-Israeli collective, was also supported by the film fund. \u201cPorcelain War,\u201d about Ukrainian artists in wartime, debuted at the festival in 2024, where it won the grand jury prize. \u201cSoundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat,\u201d about the assassination of Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba in 1961, also launched last year and won a special jury prize. And, finally, \u201cSugarcane,\u201d a 2024 festival premiere investing abuse and missing children at an Indian residential school, was supported by a Sundance grant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really special,\u201d said Basil Tsiokos, a Sundance senior programmer. \u201cIt does speak to what Sundance brings to the artistic community and to the support that we show to artists out there.\u201d",
      "On Friday night, \u201cSugarcane\u201d filmmakers Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie are also being given an award at the Institute\u2019s fundraising gala. Newly anointed Oscar nominees James Mangold and Cynthia Erivo are also being honored.",
      "It\u2019s not lost on those who program for the festival and run the artists programs how crucial that initial support can be for someone trying to make a documentary.",
      "\u201cThe funding landscape is challenging, particularly in the nonfiction space,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cGetting early support from the artists programs, from the documentary feature programs is sort of a stamp of approval, of encouragement that helps other funders come in later on to take a seed of an idea and bring it into fruition.\u201d",
      "The Oscars and Sundance have long been connected, especially in the documentary space. For the past 25 years, there has been at least one Sundance movie every year that goes on to get an Oscar nomination. Some that have won the statuette include \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d \u201cMan on Wire,\u201d \u201cSearching for Sugar Man,\u201d \u201c20 Feet From Stardom,\u201d \u201cIcarus,\u201d \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d and \u201cNavalny.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe just provide a space for the films,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cThe films are from the artists. They\u2019re the ones with the vision to make these films possible. We provide them a platform to be able to meet their audiences. That\u2019s quite an important role that we take very seriously.\u201d",
      "This year, the festival has about 40 feature documentaries premiering across sections on everything from Marlee Matlin and Selena Quintanilla, to one about Nairobi women transforming a formerly whites-only library into a cultural hub, to another on Florida\u2019s stand-your-ground laws. While it\u2019s difficult to project what might be in the Oscar race next year, Tsiokos has observed one trend that might help audiences pick and choose.",
      "\u201cThe influence of the international voters is growing. In the last couple of years especially, most of the nominees for the Oscar race tend to be international titles,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cI would tell people to make sure to check out the World Cinema Documentary Competition. There are some real gems.\u201d",

      "Prosecutors say they won\u2019t charge rocker Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation into sexual assault and domestic violence allegations",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Prosecutors said Friday that they will not file charges against Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation of allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the allegations are too old under the law and the evidence is not sufficient to charge the 56-year-old shock rocker whose legal name is Brian Warner.",
      "\u201cWe have determined that allegations of domestic violence fall outside of the statute of limitations, and we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Hochman said. \u201cWe recognize and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences, and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation.\u201d",
      "Nearly four years after the investigation began, then-District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said on Oct. 9 that his office was pursuing new leads that added to the \u201calready extensive\u201d file that authorities had amassed.",
      "LA County sheriff\u2019s detectives said early in 2021 that they were investigating Manson for incidents between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood, where Manson lived at the time. The probe included a search warrant that was served on his West Hollywood home. The case was initially turned over to prosecutors in September 2021, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office requested more evidence-gathering and the investigation resumed.",
      "\u201cWe are very pleased that, after a thorough and incredibly lengthy review of all of the actual evidence, the District Attorney has concluded what we knew and expressed from the start \u2014 Brian Warner is innocent,\u201d his attorney, Howard King, said in a statement.",
      "The identities of the women police and prosecutors spoke to were not revealed, but \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Esm\u00e9 Bianco \u2014 who sued Manson in a case that has been settled \u2014 said she was part of the criminal investigation. Before the decision not to prosecute, she criticized how long the process was taking at a rally for Hochman, who was elected soon after.",
      "\u201cAlmost four years ago, I did what victims of rape are supposed to do: I went to the police,\u201d she said on Oct. 10. \u201cI described to them in agonizing detail how the rock musician Brian Warner \u2014 better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson \u2014 had raped and abused me over the course of our relationship.\u201d",
      "Bianco said she gave investigators \u201chundreds of pieces of evidence, including photos of my body covered in bites, bruises and knife wounds, emails and text messages, threats to my immigration status.\u201d",
      "In her lawsuit, Bianco alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, and said that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England for non-existent roles in music videos and movies.",
      "\u201cWhilst I am deeply disappointed by the decision of the District Attorney to not bring charges in the case against Brian Warner, I am sadly not surprised,\u201d Bianco said in a statement released by her lawyer. \u201cOnce again, our justice system has failed survivors. Not the individual prosecutors and detectives who worked for years on this case, but the system that made them do so with one hand tied behind their collective backs.\u201d",
      "In 2021 Manson's former fianc\u00e9e, \u201cWestworld\u201d actor Evan Rachel Wood, named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post.",
      "Wood and Manson\u2019s relationship became public in 2007 when he was 38 and she was 19, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.",
      "\u201cHe started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,\u201d Wood said.",
      "Manson replied on Instagram that these were \u201chorrible distortions of reality.\u201d He sued Wood, saying she and another woman fabricated accusations against him and convinced others to do the same. A judge threw out significant sections of the suit, then in November, Manson agreed to drop it and pay Wood's attorney fees.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they\u2019ve been sexually abused, unless they come forward publicly as Bianco and Wood have done.",
      "Other women sued Manson in the months after Wood came forward. Wood's representative did not immedately return a message Friday.",
      "Manson emerged as a musical star in the mid-1990s, known as much for courting public controversy as for hit songs like \u201cThe Beautiful People\u201d and hit album\u2019s like 1996\u2019s \u201cAntichrist Superstar\u201d and 1998\u2019s \u201cMechanical Animals.\u201d"

      "Junya Watanabe has opened his latest menswear show at Paris Fashion Week with beige hunting jackets paired with discreet shirts and ties",
      "PARIS -- Beige hunting jackets with oversized pockets, paired with discreet shirts and ties, opened Junya Watanabe\u2019s latest menswear show at Paris Fashion Week Friday.",
      "It was a deceptively classic start for the avant-garde Japanese designer, whose signature knack for subversive tailoring and patchwork soon disrupted conventions.",
      "What looked like classic Americana \u2014 thick denim jeans, caps, and check shirts \u2014 quickly morphed into something far less predictable. Exaggerated blown-up check pants in red with dramatic turn-ups injected a sense of whimsy, as did splashes of vivid color. A pale yellow jacket and a tactile padded coat in soft pastels softened the masculinity, reworking the rugged aesthetic into something gender-fluid.",
      "Flashes of bold hues, from vibrant red to bright blue checks, became a defining motif. The palette danced across reimagined hunting jackets and distinctly masculine silhouettes, which were disrupted by the designer\u2019s famed use of patchwork. Here, it wasn\u2019t just a technique but a conceptual statement \u2014 ideas and styles stitched together, creating contradictions.",
      "Hunting jackets might evoke tradition, but here they felt fresh, even irreverent, with their clever layering of fabrics and unexpected details. The collection demonstrated Watanabe\u2019s mastery in blending the familiar with the avant-garde, offering a \u201cbro\u201d aesthetic turned on its head by bursts of feminine color.",
      "The recurring themes of denim and disruptive tailoring felt polished yet safe, lacking the urgency or political edge that defined his earlier work."

    "story": [
      "Opening statements are beginning at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is accused of firing a handgun at a former friend",
      "A$AP Rocky is the celebrity in the room, but A$AP Relli will star at his trial.",
      "The hip-hop star, fashion maven and actor, whose legal name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers, is accused of firing a gun at his former friend Relli, born Terell Ephron, on whose testimony prosecutors are pinning their case.",
      "Opening statements are set to begin Friday at the trial after a jury of seven women and five men was selected over the course of three days. Rocky is charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm.",
      "He took a major risk by turning down a prosecution plea deal offer of just six months in jail and instead choosing to go to trial. If convicted, he could be sentenced to a term of up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The defense plans to paint Ephron as a money seeker and point out he has sued Rocky in civil court, seeking financial damages for the incident.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the witness that this case will rise and fall on, for sure,\u201d Rocky\u2019s lead attorney Joe Tacopina said after a recent pretrial hearing. \u201cWhether he\u2019s a star is something that remains to be seen.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s jealousy obviously, and he\u2019s made that clear. He became a hater,\u201d Tacopina said. \u201cThis is in large part about money, money, money.\u201d",
      "Rocky and Relli were part of a group of young creators in high school in New York who called themselves A$AP \u2014 for Always Strive and Prosper \u2014 and initially remained close as Rocky found wealth and fame through music. The relationship soured, coming to a head with the alleged shooting on Nov. 6, 2021, when Ephron says Rocky fired on him and grazed his knuckles.",
      "The defense plans to call witnesses to testify that a firearm seen on a security video is a starter pistol that Rocky carried as a prop for security.",
      "They likely will say that is why, despite a search of the spot by many police officers, no shell casings were found at the site near Hollywood and Vine. Police did not recover a gun in the case.",
      "Ephron went to the police two days later and brought 9 mm shell casings he had picked up himself, which are both points the defense will seize on. No fingerprints were recovered from the casings.",
      "The trial\u2019s celebrity goes beyond Rocky. The Grammy-nominated hip-hop star\u2019s longtime partner is Rihanna and the couple have two toddler sons together.",
      "Tacopina suggested it\u2019s unlikely Rihanna will show up in court and her name may not come up at all, though it did frequently during jury selection when many prospective jurors said they were fans.",
      "Rocky has been named one of the celebrity chairs of the Met Gala in May and has a major role in a Spike Lee-directed film with Denzel Washington to be released soon after. But his life could be upended with a conviction.",
      "In the deal from prosecutors he rejected, Rocky was to plead guilty to one of the two counts in exchange for a sentence recommendation of 180 days in jail, a seven-year suspended prison sentence and three years of probation.",
      "Beyond Ephron, the prosecution's witnesses primarily will be the police who worked on the case.",
      "They also will rely heavily on surveillance video that captured parts of the incident and the circumstances. Prosecutors at the 2023 preliminary hearing showed a still image taken from video with a man in a hooded sweatshirt whose face is not visible holding what appears to be a gun, along with another image showing the face of the man in the sweatshirt, with no gun visible. A detective testified that investigators established it was Rocky.",
      "Rocky himself could take the stand and his attorney has said he wants to, but the lawyers say they have not yet decided and he is legally allowed to avoid testifying."

      "Marlee Matlin gives an unflinchingly honest account of her experiences as a deaf actor in the funny and revelatory documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Marlee Matlin gives an unflinchingly honest account of her experiences as a deaf actor in the funny and revelatory documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d The film kicked off the 41st Sundance Film Festival Thursday, as the first major premiere in the Eccles Theater in Park City, Utah.",
      "After the screening audiences in the theater, some wiping tears away, greeted Matlin with a standing ovation when she took the stage.",
      "The film delves into all aspects of her life, personal and professional: Her childhood and how her family handled learning she had become deaf at 18 months; her experience winning the best actress Oscar for her first movie role in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d and her allegedly abusive romantic relationship with her co-star, the late William Hurt, which he denied; and her experiences in an industry not equipped to accommodate deaf actors.",
      "The film was directed by Shoshanna Stern, who also is deaf. Matlin specifically requested that Stern take on the project when American Masters approached her about doing a documentary.",
      "Matlin has written about her experiences before, including her volatile relationship with Hurt and drugs, in a memoir, \u201cI\u2019ll Scream Later.\u201d But before the #MeToo movement, she felt her allegations were largely dismissed or glossed over.",
      "Interviews from the book's press tour show journalists were more interested in the \u201camazing sex\u201d she said she had with Hurt than the stories of the alleged physical and verbal abuse. One interviewer asked her why she waited \u201cso long\u201d to come forward with the claims.",
      "The documentary isn\u2019t just a portrait of Matlin, but a broader look at deaf culture and how Matlin was thrust into the spotlight at a young age as a de facto spokesperson for all deaf causes.",
      "In addition to being the first, and until Troy Kotsur won for \u201cCODA\u201d in 2022, only deaf actor to win an Academy Award, she helped lobby Congress for closed captioning and delved into the Gallaudet University protest about hiring hearing people to preside over the university, which is the subject of another Sundance documentary, \u201cDeaf President Now!\u201d",
      "Matlin also faced backlash when she spoke while presenting the best actor Oscar the year after she won, an experience that she said made her distance herself from deaf causes.",
      "It features moving interviews from her longtime translator and other important figures in her life such as Henry Winkler, who met her when she was a student at age 12.",
      "Winkler watched her perform a song during a school production after she wrote him a fan letter. Later, she stayed in his home for two years after her breakup with Hurt and had her wedding there. In the film, Matlin said she never would have pursued acting if it weren\u2019t for Winkler, although he disagreed.",
      "The film is closed captioned and includes verbal translations for hearing audiences. In a unique approach, the subjects were interviewed by Stern with an earpiece, allowing them to hear translations from another room.",
      "Matlin said she has struggled occasionally to convince the industry to let her play roles that aren\u2019t necessarily written for a deaf actor. Aaron Sorkin, who wrote a part for her in \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d dispelled the notion it is difficult to write for deaf actors.",
      "When \u201cCODA\u201d came around, the studio wanted to cast an A-list, hearing male star opposite Matlin. She threatened to walk if it weren\u2019t a deaf actor and was gratified when Kotsur won the Oscar, hence the \u201cnot alone anymore\u201d subtitle. Her big disappointment was not being able to say a few words on stage during the event.",
      "Asked why this moment was the right time for a documentary, Matlin said, \u201cIt\u2019s never really the right time. So, why not?\u201d",

      "The couple, who rose to stardom on \u201cThe Hills,\" a spin-off of \u201cLaguna Beach,\u201d filed the lawsuit Tuesday along with more than 20 other property owners and residents who were affected by the Palisades Fire. The complaint blames Los Angeles and its municipal water department for the water issues that hampered firefighting efforts and says it ultimately led to the damage to their properties.",
      "The Eaton and Palisades fires, ignited by strong winds during one of the region's driest years on record, have killed 28 people and destroyed more than 12,000 structures, putting them among the most destructive fires in California history.",
      "There has been intense scrutiny over hydrants running dry and problems with water pressure, leading to a barrage of lawsuits against the city and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called for an independent investigation into the LA water utility over the issues.",
      "The complaint filed by the couple and others mentions that the Santa Ynez Reservoir, which services the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, was offline and had been out of commission since February 2024 while awaiting repairs. The hydrants in the neighborhood were connected to three tanks that held 1 million gallons (3.7 million liters) of water each and went dry within 12 hours, the complaint said, citing Janisse Qui\u00f1ones, the water utility's chief executive and chief engineer.",
      "Without water from the reservoir, firefighters had to primarily rely on the water tanks, which were not designed to fight such a large fire, the complaint said.",
      "The city and water utility did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "While the repairs to the reservoir were requested in January 2024, the water utility told the Los Angeles Times they would not be completed until April or May 2025.",
      "The lawsuit called the Palisades Fire an \u201cinescapable and unavoidable consequence\u201d of the water system operated by the city and water utility.",
      "\u201cThe system necessarily failed, and this failure was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs to suffer the losses alleged in this complaint,\u201d it said.",
      "The plaintiffs cite the principle known as \u201c inverse condemnation,\u201d which is the same mechanism that requires utilities to pay for wildfire damages caused by their equipment."

      "Opening statements at the Los Angeles trial of the 36-year-old hip-hop superstar and fashion maven will likely begin Friday after the 12 jurors were selected. Four alternates still need to be selected.",

      "He opted instead to risk trial on two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, charges that with conviction bring a penalty of up to 24 years in prison.",
      "It took the two sides 2 1/2 days to pick the jurors from a pool of more than a hundred candidates who packed into a downtown LA courtroom. Those chosen include a woman who is a podcast editor and actor, and a man who has worked for more than 20 years at Trader Joe's.",
      "Many were excused for cause, others sent away by one of the two sides. Each had 10 jurors they could excuse without a reason. The defense used seven of their challenges, the prosecution just two.",
      "One man questioned Thursday works as a civilian with the Los Angeles Police Department and has extensive ties to law enforcement including a cousin who was on the case's witness list but is not expected to be called.",

      "The film academy had plenty of surprise nominations Thursday for the 97th Oscars",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- In one of the more wide-open Oscar fields in recent history, there were plenty of nominations surprises Thursday.",
      "Not too long ago, it seemed that people like Angelina Jolie and Nicole Kidman were destined for best actress nominations, while general audience disinterest in the young Donald Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d might have indicated its awards chances were dead on arrival.",
      "But the members of the film academy had something different in mind. Here are some of the biggest snubs and surprises from the 97th Oscar nominations.",
      "The young Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d has been one of the bigger awards season question marks, especially after it failed to resonate with moviegoers in theaters. And yet both Jeremy Strong, for his portrayal for Trump lawyer Roy Cohn, and Sebastian Stan (who was also in the conversation for \u201cA Different Man\u201d ), for playing the future two-time president, made it in. Only Strong got nominated by the Screen Actors Guild.",
      "This will forever be one of the more confounding awards season oversights. Marianne Jean-Baptiste delivered one of the all-time great performances in Mike Leigh\u2019s \u201cHard Truths,\u201d as the perpetually aggrieved and sharp-tongued London woman Pansy. The general thinking is that it was either going to be Jean-Baptiste or Fernanda Torres, and Torres got in for the equally beloved \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "This is perhaps up for debate, but there was certainly a lot of goodwill behind Anderson\u2019s movie-star turn in Gia Coppola\u2019s \u201cThe Last Showgirl,\u201d especially considering her SAG nomination. But like with Jennifer Lopez and \u201cHustlers\u201d a few years ago, it was not meant to be at the Oscars.",
      "James Mangold has directed several awards darlings, including \u201cFord v Ferrari\u201d and \u201cWalk the Line\u201d but had consistently missed out on a best director nomination, until this year with \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d It may have come at the expense of Edward Berger, who missed out on a nod for \u201cConclave\u201d or Denis Villeneuve for \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d",
      "Daniel Craig gave one of his best performances as an American expat in Mexico in the torrid May-December romance in \u201cQueer,\u201d but it hasn\u2019t been resonating with awards voters. The Oscar snub is the final piece in a puzzle that just never came together.",
      "If there ever were a shoo-in for a nomination and an Oscar, on paper at least, it would be for Angelina Jolie playing opera legend Maria Callas. Filmmaker Pablo Larra\u00edn had not missed yet in getting best actress nominations for his famous, tragic women biopics, including Natalie Portman for \u201cJackie\u201d and Kristen Stewart for \u201cSpencer.\u201d But somehow Jolie did not make the cut in the end.",
      "\u201cBabygirl\u201d is not a cliche awards movie by a long stretch, but Nicole Kidman\u2019s performance as Romy, the buttoned-up, married CEO who begins a dangerous affair with a young intern at her company was undeniable. But a best actress win at the Venice Film Festival has never guaranteed Oscar success.",
      "Despite the wide love for \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d Felicity Jones has been curiously absent from many nominations lists for her sharp portrayal of Erzs\u00e9bet T\u00f3th. The cast did not even get recognized by SAG. But it just goes to show that it\u2019s never too late to sneak in for the big one",
      "A few years after Danielle Deadwyler was famously snubbed for \u201cTill,\u201d she has another snub to add to her resume for Malcolm Washington\u2019s adaptation of \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d This latest campaign might not have had as much steam behind it as \u201cTill,\u201d but at the very least one would assume that it could have been a make good.",
      "Supporting actress was one of the more chaotic and unpredictable categories this year, with so many deserving performers in the mix. Monica Barbaro was one of those that was on the fringe of possibilities for her turn as Joan Baez, singing and all, for \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "One who was not so lucky was Selena Gomez for \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d perhaps because she was partially competing with her co-star, Zo\u00eb Salda\u00f1a who simply had more momentum (and gave a moving speech at the Golden Globes).",
      "The incarceration drama \u201cSing Sing\u201d did get several significant nominations including for Colman Domingo, adapted screenplay and original song. But Clarence \u201cDivine Eye\u201d Maclin, who delivered a revelatory performance based on his own experience, was not among them. He is, however, credited with helping to write the story.",
      "Margaret Qualley seems to have been unfairly left out of much of the awards conversation around \u201cThe Substance,\u201d a movie that only works with a great Sue. But the focus has been more on Demi Moore, overdue for such recognition, and Coralie Fargeat \u2014 the only woman to score a best director nomination.",
      "Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross delivered one of their most popular scores ever this year for \u201cChallengers\u201d and yet were left off in a batch of nominees that included \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Robot.\u201d It\u2019s not even that they\u2019re consistently overlooked by the academy \u2014 they\u2019ve already won twice, for \u201cSoul\u201d and \u201cThe Social Network.\u201d",
      "Everyone expected the Latvian cat movie \u201cFlow\u201d to get a best animated feature nomination, especially after it won the Golden Globe. But the big surprise is that it got a second for best international feature \u2014 a first for Latvia. This is not a first for an animated movie to get into the international category, though: \u201cWaltz with Bashir\u201d and \u201cFlee\u201d had the honor before \u201cFlow,\u201d but neither ended up winning.",
      "RaMell Ross\u2019 \u201cNickel Boys\u201d has had quite the rollercoaster awards season journey, even though it\u2019s widely considered one of the best films of the year. The film academy thought so too, including it among the 10 best picture nominees (alongside other relative surprises like \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d). Oddly, though, it missed out on cinematography despite its inventive first-person point of view."

      "Dozens of jurors will return to a Los Angeles courtroom for the possibility of serving on the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is charged with firing a gun at a former friend",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A judge said he expects a jury will be chosen at the trial of A$AP Rocky on Thursday, while lawyers for the hip-hop star are protesting the dearth of Black candidates for the panel.",
      "Nearly one hundred potential jurors will pack into the Los Angeles courtroom for a third long day of questioning at the trial, where Rocky is accused of two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm for allegedly firing on a former friend in Hollywood in 2021.",
      "Opening statements will begin once 12 of them, and four alternates, are seated.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re going to have a jury tomorrow,\u201d Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold said at the end of court Wednesday, thanking the panelists for their patience. \u201cThis is not going to go on forever.\u201d",
      "Other than dismissals for cause, each side can have 10 jurors dismissed without giving a reason. The defense has used four of its challenges. Prosecutors used just one. They said they are happy with the jury as currently composed. But that may change.",
      "Meanwhile, lawyers for Rocky said they planned to appeal a judge's rejection of their request for a hearing on why less than 5% of the jury pool is Black, while the area they are drawn from is 9% African American. It's possible that none of the 16 jurors selected will be Black.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re troubled by that to say the least,\u201d defense lawyer Joe Tacopina said. \u201cWe\u2019re in downtown Los Angeles, not a small town in Montana.\u201d",

      "Prosecutors questioned potential jurors Wednesday about their attitudes toward police and celebrity.",
      "Deputy District Attorney John Lewin asked how many of the 12 people in the jury box during the first round of questioning consider themselves fans of Rihanna, who is Rocky's longtime life partner and the mother of his two toddler sons. Four said they were.",
      "He asked them whether they'll worry about the effect that convicting Rocky \u2014 on two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, which could lead to many years in prison \u2014 could have on Rihanna.",
      "\u201cYou put it in my head, and now I'm like, \u2018Oh, it would affect her,\u2019\u201d one woman in the jury box responded.",
      "Rocky, who is free on bail and has pleaded not guilty, sat at the defense table, watching the questioning.",

      "When told who they were, Arnold marveled at the youthful appearance of his mother, Renee Black.",
      "\u201cWhat were you, 7 when you had him?\u201d the judge asked. She said she was 26.",
      "\u201cYou are very beautiful,\u201d the judge told her. \u201cThat's on the record.\u201d",

      "Rocky is set to headline the Rolling Loud California music festival in March, he has been named one of the celebrity chairs of the Met Gala in May, and he has a major role in a Spike Lee-directed film with Denzel Washington to be released soon after.",
      "But his life could be upended if he's convicted of firing a gun at Terell Ephron, a childhood friend who testified that their relationship had soured and a feud came to a head on the night of Nov. 6, 2021. Ephron testified that bullets grazed his knuckles."

      "Meagan Good is basking in her season of harvest, reaping rewards from the hard work she\u2019s sowed throughout her three-decade career",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Meagan Good is in a season of harvest, reaping rewards from the hard work she\u2019s sowed throughout her three-decade career. For the \u201cHarlem\u201d star, gratitude is her mantra.",
      "\u201cAs crazy as, not even just this last year, the last few years have been for me, this is the happiest I\u2019ve been in a long time. And it\u2019s pretty wonderful,\u201d said Good last week with tears welling in her eyes, emotions heightened as she thought of her relationship with Jonathan Majors, her time on \u201cHarlem\u201d and the Los Angeles wildfires.\u201cI\u2019m just thankful for the journey and I\u2019m thankful to be loved.\u201d",
      "Much of that love has been provided by embattled actor Jonathan Majors, and the fluctuating journey includes their scrutinized relationship, leading Tyler Perry\u2019s \u201cDivorce in the Black\u201d film and starring in the third and final season of \u201cHarlem,\u201d premiering Thursday on Prime Video.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible that the people who have supported us and have watched the show have waited on us like \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019\u201d said Good, who plays Camille, a Columbia University professor of sex and love. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool to be a part of something so amazing that people love.\u201d",
      "\u201cHarlem\u201d has been a survivor, emerging from the coronavirus pandemic and the Hollywood actors and writers strikes. The Tracy Oliver dramedy follows four women in their 30s (Good, Grace Byers, Jerrie Johnson and Shoniqua Shandai) living in Manhattan\u2019s historic Black neighborhood as they navigate love, friendships and careers. While the series didn\u2019t reach the acclaim of Issa Rae\u2019s \u201cInsecure,\u201d it earned a staunch fan base.",
      "\u201cIf you really think about shows about New York, it\u2019s almost like purposefully excluding Black people ... so when we reflect on shows like \u2018Friends\u2019 or even \u2018Sex and The City,\u2019 I probably can count on one hand how many Black people I\u2019ve seen in those shows. But in New York, it\u2019s unavoidable because Black people have created the culture here, specifically in Harlem,\u201d said Johnson, who plays Tye, a queer dating app designer for LBGTQ+ people of color.",
      "\u201cWe loved our \u2018Living Single,\u2019 and that\u2019s why we loved it because we love seeing these women meeting in this small little apartment to commune with each other ... that\u2019s why we have such a cult following because there was a hole in the market that Tracy brilliantly filled.\u201d",
      "Good, 43, said the relationship she shares with her cast, crew and streaming platform is one she hadn\u2019t experienced. \u201cThis definitely has been the best professional experience I\u2019ve had in my entire career in terms of emotionally, mentally, professionally, spiritually.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an emphatic declaration by the former child star whose first major film appearance came in Ice Cube\u2019s 1995 classic \u201cFriday,\u201d shined in \u201cEve\u2019s Bayou\u201d and became a household name to kids on Nickelodeon\u2019s \u201cCousin Skeeter\u201d series.",
      "Adored for beauty throughout her relatively drama-free career, many fans questioned her relationship with Majors, the rapidly rising star of \u201cCreed III\u201d and \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\u201d It began toward the end of 2023 following the 35-year-old\u2019s arrest for allegations of escalating incidents of physical and verbal abuse toward ex-girlfriend Grace Jabbari.",
      "But the \u201cThink Like a Man\u201d and \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d actor said her Christian faith and life lessons prepared her for the backlash.",
      "\u201cI think about being in my 20s and you see the Media Take Outs and it\u2019s a hundred nice things and there\u2019s like one or two bad things. And I would just internalize it and I would cry and it would hurt my feelings so much,\u201d said Good, who also cited criticism from fellow Christians about her attire and film choices, false skin-bleaching allegations, and the end of her near decade-long marriage with pastor and Hollywood executive DeVon Franklin as perseverance-builders. \u201cI had been praying for maybe like five or six years, \u2019Lord, please deliver me from what people think about me. \u2026 But I will say the part of it that is still hard for me is to see them drag people I love.\u201d",
      "Majors was convicted of one misdemeanor assault charge and a harassment violation. He avoided jail time but was ordered to complete a yearlong counseling program. He also settled a civil suit with Jabbari, but the ordeal nearly extinguished his career.",
      "Good, who was by Majors\u2019 side at court dates and became in engaged to him in November, is optimistic his career will regenerate. (Ironically, Good starred in 50 Cent\u2019s \u201c21 Questions\u201d hit music video in which he proposes scenarios to a potential girlfriend to see if she\u2019d stand by him, including incarceration.)",
      "\u201cThe idea that people are like, \u2019Well, she got paid,\u201d said Good, rolling her eyes at suggestions it\u2019s a publicity stunt \u2014 \u201cit could be hurtful, but I just don\u2019t care anymore. And that\u2019s a good feeling.\u201d",
      "Good, who aspires to star in an action film, has been open about her desire to have children and is focusing on her future with Majors, including launching a health and wellness brand together.",
      "Admirers and industry colleagues believe Good deserves much more recognition.",
      "\u201cPeople have tried to pigeonhole her in a certain area that now she\u2019s breaking free. I always tell her that this is her phoenix moment ... the ashes actually being a metaphor for people\u2019s expectations of her,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cAbout 75% of my favorite movies that shaped my upbringing have Meagan Good in them ... I\u2019ve learned so much about transitioning into womanhood and adulthood through the characters that she\u2019s played.\u201d",
      "Good, however, stresses her focus is not on recognition or major awards, but reaching the hearts of people. She circles back to gratitude for a career that has defied Hollywood odds.",
      "\u201cTo have any appreciation is a gift,\u201d said Good. \u201cI feel like my best is yet to come. And I feel like even now, I\u2019m kind of just getting started.\u201d",

      "The camera is the ghost in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s chillingly effective, experiential haunted house drama \u201cPresence.\u201d The filmmaker traps the audience in a beautiful suburban home, letting us drift through rooms with this curious being, in and out of delicate conversations as we (and the ghost) try to piece together a puzzle blindly.",
      "Often in haunted house movies where a new family moves in and starts sensing strange things, the ghost knows exactly what they want \u2014 usually their house back. In this one, the presence doesn\u2019t have such a clear objective. It\u2019s more confused, wandering around and investigating the surroundings, like a benevolent amnesiac. Occasionally, though, big emotions erupt, and things shake violently.",
      "Mostly, they go unnoticed. They observe the chipper real estate agent (Julia Fox) preparing for a showing, the painting crew, one of whom believes there\u2019s something around, and finally the family and all the complexities of its dynamics. Lucy Liu (a delightful, wickedly funny scene-stealer) is the mom, Rebecca, a wealthy, successful, type-A woman hyper focused on the success of her eldest, a teenage boy named Tyler (Eddy Maday). The father, Chris (Chris Sullivan), is more of the nurturer, concerned about their teen daughter Chloe (Callina Liang) in the aftermath of her friend\u2019s unexpected death.",
      "There is a family drama transpiring inside the house, only some of which will make sense in the end. We overhear Rebecca drunkenly telling Tyler that everything she does is for him. We listen in as Chris confides to someone on the phone about a hypothetical partner being involved in something illegal and whether they still would be if legally separated. We see Tyler often with his head buried in his phone. And then there's Chloe: Sad, rebellious Chloe, who is the only one to notice that they\u2019re not alone. She\u2019s had the recent trauma, after all, and soon she\u2019s starting a thing with Tyler\u2019s floppy haired, cool guy friend Ryan (West Mulholland). They hook up, they drink, they do drugs, and Chloe gets to escape from her own thoughts \u2014 at least for a little while. Ryan looks straight out of a mid-90s movie, he's an angry, aggrieved kid who assures Chloe that she has the power to decide how this all goes.",
      "\u201cPresence\u201d was written by David Koepp (\u201cJurassic Park\u201d) off of a few pages Soderbergh put together, imagining what it would be like to be the ghost. He is that too, technically, as both director and cinematographer on the project. It\u2019s a slow-burn experience that sneaks up on you, especially once you\u2019ve seen how it plays out. Personally, I didn\u2019t see any of it coming and couldn\u2019t have anticipated the emotional wallop it would pack in the end. It\u2019s a heady experiment that transcends the somewhat gimmicky-on-paper premise \u2014 something Soderbergh manages to do alarmingly well and regularly.",
      "January releases aren\u2019t often the most compelling. Aside from the annual rollout of awards contenders, it\u2019s more often than not a dumping ground. \u201cPresence\u201d is a movie that I first saw last January at the Sundance Film Festival, and yet, even after a year, the chill and the admiration has stubbornly lingered in my mind, like a ghost that just won\u2019t go away, while so many other films have simply faded from memory. It is a rare gem in the January mix.",
      "\u201cPresence,\u201d a Neon release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cteen drinking, drug material, sexuality, language, violence.\u201d Running time: 85 minutes. Three stars out of four."

    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 08:58:14 -0500",
    "summary": "Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan",
    "story": [
      "Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan, the chief of the World Health Organization said Sunday, part of a series of attacks coming as the African nation's civil war escalated in recent days.",
      "The attack on the Saudi Teaching Maternal Hospital, which local officials blamed on the rebel Rapid Support Forces, came as the group was experiencing apparent battlefield losses to the Sudanese military and allied forces under the command of army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan. That includes Burhan appearing near a burning oil refinery north of Khartoum on Saturday that his forces said they seized from the RSF.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Foreign Ministry denounced the attack as \u201ca violation of international law.\u201d",
      "International mediation attempts and pressure tactics, including a U.S. assessment that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide, and sanctions targeting Burhan, haven't halted the fighting.",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted the death toll in the hospital attack in El Fasher on the social platform X.",
      "Officials and others in the capital of North Darfur province had cited a similar figure Saturday, but Tedros is the first international source to provide a casualty number. Reporting on Sudan is incredibly difficult given communication challenges, the indiscriminate violence faced by civilians and exaggerations by both the RSF and the Sudanese military. Sudan's Foreign Ministry accused the RSF of launching a drone attack targeting the hospital's emergency ward, describing the assault as a \u201cmassacre.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe appalling attack on Saudi Hospital in El Fasher, Sudan, led to 19 injuries and 70 deaths among patients and companions,\u201d Tedros wrote. \u201cAt the time of the attack, the hospital was packed with patients receiving care.\u201d",
      "Another health facility in Al Malha also was attacked Saturday, he added.",
      "\u201cWe continue to call for a cessation of all attacks on health care in Sudan, and to allow full access for the swift restoration of the facilities that have been damaged,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cAbove all, Sudan\u2019s people need peace. The best medicine is peace.\u201d",
      "Tedros didn't identify who launched the attack, though local officials had blamed the RSF for the assault. U.N. official Clementine Nkweta-Salami, who coordinates humanitarian efforts for the world body in Sudan, warned Thursday that the RSF earlier had given \u201ca 48-hour ultimatum to forces allied to the Sudanese Armed Forces to vacate the city and indicated a forthcoming offensive.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince May 2024, El Fasher has been under RSF siege,\u201d she said. \u201cCivilians in El Fasher have already endured months of suffering, violence and gross human rights abuses under the prolonged siege. Their lives now hang in the balance due to an increasingly precarious situation.\u201d",
      "The RSF didn't immediately acknowledge the attack in El Fasher, which is more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) southwest of Khartoum. The city is now estimated to be home to more than 1 million people, many of whom have been displaced by the war.",
      "The U.N. said in December that the RSF siege had killed 782 civilians and wounded more than 1,140 others, warning that the figures likely were higher.",
      "The Saudi hospital, just north of El Fasher's airport, sits near the front lines of the war and has been repeatedly hit by shelling. Still, its doctors continue surgeries, sometimes by the light of cellphones while the hospital is hit.",
      "However, the RSF appeared in recent days to have lost control of the Khartoum refinery, the biggest in Sudan and crucial to both its economy and that of South Sudan. Burhan's forces also say they broke another RSF besiegement of the Signal Corps headquarters in northern Khartoum. The rebels claimed they were \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around that base.",
      "Sudan has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the RSF joined forces to lead a military coup in October 2021.",
      "Al-Bashir faces charges at the International Criminal Court over carrying out a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s in the western Darfur region with the Janjaweed, the precursor to the RSF. Rights groups and the U.N. say the RSF and allied Arab militias are again attacking ethnic African groups in this war.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in April 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country.",
      "Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "On Sunday, Burhan traveled to the military's General Command headquarters in Khartoum, a building he hadn't been to since the fighting broke out in 2023. The headquarters is near Khartoum International Airport, which has seen fierce fighting during the war.",
      "\u201cThe armed forces are in their best condition and we will move forward with the determination of our people to eliminate the rebellion in all of Sudan,\u201d Burhan said, according to the state-run SUNA news agency.",

      "Weeks after the worst of the deadly fires tore through Los Angeles suburbs, families are grappling with the reality that toxic ash from burned cars and homes could be a health issue for awhile, especially for children",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Kelli Ferrone wiped blinds and window sills inside her daughters\u2019 elementary school, just a half mile from the devastating Palisades Fire that scorched the coastal enclave in Los Angeles. The cotton swabs and wipes came up black.",
      "There is scattered ash and soot at her feet. Outside, it's on the ground next to a playground.",
      "Ferrone, who recorded videos and shared them with The Associated Press, wanted to see for herself this week if Canyon Charter Elementary School had been adequately cleaned before the school reopens. She wasn't impressed.",
      "Weeks after the most intense days of fire across the Los Angeles area, parents are grappling with the reality that toxic ash from burned homes and cars could be harmful to their children. It's a risk that is becoming more common as wildfires burn in cities.",
      "In the Pacific Palisades, Canyon Charter could reopen as soon as Monday. School officials say staff are working hard to make sure schools are clean and safe and they're confident in their decision. But some parents feel the school is rushing to open. They're urging officials to temporarily relocate, while others try to transfer their students elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThe (Los Angeles Unified School District) has never experienced a disaster like this in their history,\" said Ferrone, who has two daughters at the school, one with asthma. \"And I do think people are trying really hard, but our school needs a new temporary home with classrooms and teachers teaching in-person. That is the only thing that is going to make people feel comfortable.\u201d",
      "In a statement, LAUSD said staff \u201chas worked diligently to prepare schools for a return to in-person instruction.\u201d That includes inspecting ventilation systems, replacing filters and installing air purifiers in classrooms and offices, and cleaning inside and outdoors. An environmental consultant is inspecting campuses. Staff monitors air quality. The district has an Office of Environmental Health and Safety and is following its protocols.",
      "Some schools are within a \u201cdo not drink water\u201d advisory, including Canyon Charter. That means fountains are turned off and bottled water is provided, the district said.",
      "Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, said the school is taking all the right steps. Yet, she said, \u201cthere\u2019s no zero risk.\"",
      "The ash is a toxic soup of incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and every other kind of personal belonging. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead, all of which children are more vulnerable to.",
      "\u201cChildren often have more hand-to-mouth behavior and their bodies are rapidly growing in these first few years, and so they can be more sensitive to this type of pollution,\" said Patel. \"There will be a risk for a while to come in terms of exposure.\u201d",
      "Some materials form reactive chemical compounds when they burn.",
      "Scientists still don't know the long-term health impacts of exposure to massive urban fire like this year's in California or the one in Maui, Hawaii in 2023. Three schools in Lahaina didn't reopen for two months after that. But some chemicals have been linked to heart disease and lung issues, while exposure to minerals like magnetite, which can form when fire burns iron, has been associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "In Pasadena, Emily Stough is trying to minimize the risks for her 11- and 14-year-old who returned to Blair High School, which includes a middle school, this week. She made sure they took masks. In an email to parents last week, the Pasadena Unified School District said some 38 tons of outdoor debris have been hauled away from campuses, and they will only open \u201cafter rigorous cleaning and sanitizing and environmental tests.\"",
      "Stough said she trusts the district to do its due diligence, but she wants more information.",
      "\u201cDid they test air quality? Did they test ash samples? Were the ash samples from inside the school, in the hallways, from outside the schools?,\" she wonders. \"Air quality both inside and outside the schools? I\u2019d like to see that. I\u2019d like to know what cleaning was done.\u201d",
      "The PUSD did not respond to questions from the AP.",
      "It\u2019s hard to know how long these fire toxins will stay in the environment, said Patel, but it could be a few months. Strong winds like the Santa Anas could also blow them distances where they could enter soil and groundwater.",
      "Plastics in particular could last a long time, said Dr. Ilan Shapiro, medical affairs officer for AltaMed and a fellow with the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cAnd we need to remember that the fires are still going. That we still have burn materials coming out.\" As communities recover and clean up, that ash will be moved again, he said.",
      "Longfellow Elementary School in Pasadena is set to reopen next week, but Tanya Reyes doesn\u2019t plan to send her kids back just yet. The school is about two miles from where the Eaton Fire burned down the home they rented. Even with the school's safety measures, \u201cmy gut is saying \u2018no,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be around that area. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d",
      "Her family is staying in West Hollywood, and she\u2019s looking for schools there, somewhere the kids can attend for a little while. She's considering home schooling, too, but still figuring it all out.",
      "It's hard for parents because they understand all the ways kids need school.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this in so many different ways, whether it\u2019s been wildfire smoke or the pandemic,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWhen kids miss school, that is also a detriment to their health. It impacts their learning, it impacts their socioemotional development, their sense of connection and community during a time of crisis.\"",

      "President Trump\u2019s first week in office included a flurry of executive orders with implications for Earth\u2019s climate and environment",
      "President Trump's first week in office included a flurry of executive orders with implications for Earth's climate and environment.",
      "While former President Joe Biden made climate change a hallmark of his administration and some of his policies remain, at least for now, Trump is quickly unraveling that.",
      "Experts say Trump's moves to step away from global climate action, ramp up domestic oil and gas production and remove incentives for electric vehicles are worrisome as the planet continues to heat up. 2024 was Earth's hottest year on record, and climate scientists say the rising heat is contributing to extreme weather affecting millions.",
      "\u201cThese orders will make our air dirtier, make people sicker, make energy more expensive, and make our communities less prepared for extreme weather,\" wrote Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, a marine biologist, policy expert and author who co-founded the non-profit think tank Urban Ocean Lab.",
      "Here are some of Trump's most notable moves affecting climate and environmental issues in his first week:",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday directing the United States to again withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement aimed at global cooperation on climate change.",
      "The agreement requires participating countries to come up with nationally determined contributions to the effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the planet. Trump's move means the federal government won't be trying to meet emissions reductions goals, nor any financial commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",
      "\u201cWalking away from the Paris Agreement won\u2019t protect Americans from climate impacts, but it will hand China and the European Union a competitive edge in the booming clean energy economy and lead to fewer opportunities for American workers,\u201d said Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Trump declared an energy emergency via executive order earlier this week amid a promise to \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d",
      "The order urges oil and gas expansion including through federal use of eminent domain and the Defense Production Act, which allow the government to use private land and resources to produce goods deemed to be a national necessity.",
      "Experts dispute his description of an \u201cinadequate energy supply\u201d as part of the basis for the order.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that the United States is well-supplied with energy in all of its forms,\u201d said Gary Dirks, senior director of the Global Futures Laboratory at Arizona State University. Dirks said he thinks the move is actually more targeted at bringing down prices at the pump.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the United States right now is the largest producer of oil of any nation in history. And we got to that point under the Biden administration, not because of the Biden administration\u2019s policies necessarily, but because of policies that have been ongoing for four decades,\u201d he said.",
      "One section of the order declaring an energy emergency states that the Endangered Species Act cannot be an obstacle to energy development.",
      "The Endangered Species Act has been a hurdle for the development of fossil fuels in the U.S. for decades, and weakening it would accelerate the decline and potential extinction of numerous endangered species, including whales and sea turtles, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "Trump also opened up areas in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling. Biden had previously both restricted and approved drilling in other parts of the Arctic, part of a long process mired in litigation and complicated by political battles.",
      "\u201cI would begin by pointing out that there was an attempt to lease for oil drilling recently and nobody bid,\u201d Dirks said. \u201cI don\u2019t actually think that the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge is an exciting place for oil and gas exploration.\u201d",
      "But he expressed concern about preserving biodiversity, something other scientists and environmental groups have highlighted.",
      "\u201cThe Arctic is a very fragile system,\u201d said Peter Schlosser, vice president and vice provost of global futures at Arizona State. Schlosser added that drilling there would disrupt the land and sea, and that potential contamination or oil spills are more difficult to clean up there due to low temperatures.",
      "Trump promised to eliminate what he incorrectly calls Biden's \u201celectric vehicle mandate.\"",
      "What that means in practice is that the order will revoke a non-binding goal set by Biden to have EVs make up half of new cars sold by 2030. He will also likely seek repeal of a $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases approved by Congress as part of Biden\u2019s landmark 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "All of that is likely frustrating for automakers, who have to make long-term decisions, said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at auto-buying research firm Edmunds. As the rest of the world moves to electric cars, automakers have to decide how to factor in the global direction the industry is headed alongside the sudden lack of federal support.",
      "\u201cWe do think that the long-term end goal here is going to be electrification. It\u2019s just the timeline it seems is uncertain right now,\u201d she said.",
      "When the government reviews new facilities that emit pollution, officials are no longer likely to consider a concept known as environmental justice, or how that new pollution will add to the emissions that have tended to fall more heavily on poor and minority communities.",
      "Those are sweeping moves that Rena Payan, chief program officer at nonprofit Justice Outside, called \u201crolling back decades of progress in addressing environmental discrimination.\u201d",
      "That means more of a burden for state and local groups to fight to protect those communities. Trump\u2019s decision to cut off support will hurt, but many of these organizations are used to operating without federal support \u2014 they have done so for years, according to Peggy Shepard, co-founder and executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m grappling right now with is both the grief of these losses, and the fact that we were on an upward swing, if you will, just weeks ago,\u201d said Jade Begay, an Indigenous rights and climate organizer.",

      "Vaccination bills are popping up in more than 15 states as lawmakers aim to potentially resurrect or create new religious exemptions from immunization mandates, establish state-level vaccine injury databases or dictate what providers must tell patients...",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Vaccination bills are popping up in more than 15 states as lawmakers aim to potentially resurrect or create new religious exemptions from immunization mandates, establish state-level vaccine injury databases or dictate what providers must tell patients about the shots.",
      "Many see a political opportunity to rewrite policies in their states after President Donald Trump's return to the White House and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 's nomination as the next secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency oversees virtually every aspect of vaccination efforts in the U.S., from funding their development to establishing recommendations for medical providers to distributing vaccines and covering them through federal programs.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates against dangerous infections like measles and polio continue to fall nationwide, and the number of parents claiming non-medical exemptions so their kids don't get required shots is rising.",
      "In 2024, whooping cough cases reached a decade-high and 16 measles outbreaks, the largest among them in Chicago and Minnesota, put health officials on edge. Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "About half of Americans are \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d concerned that those declining childhood vaccination rates will lead to more outbreaks, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Yet only about 4 in 10 Americans oppose reconsidering the government\u2019s recommendations for widely used vaccines, while roughly 3 in 10 are in favor. The rest \u2014 about 3 in 10 \u2014 are neutral.",
      "Scott Burris, director of Temple University\u2019s Center for Public Health Law Research, has tracked public health legislation for years, and watched backlash against COVID-19 vaccines grow to include more routine vaccines as anti-vaccine activists take hold of powerful political pulpits.",
      "\u201cI think COVID and the politics gave standard vaccine denialists a lot of wind in their sails,\" he said.",
      "It's hard to predict what will pass into law in the states, Burris said, considering the vast majority of proposed bills in any state go nowhere. But the proposed legislation offers a glimpse into lawmakers\u2019 thoughts, and what else might follow.",
      "Religious exemptions for school vaccine requirements are among the most popular proposals so far. Lawmakers in New York, Virginia, Connecticut and Mississippi have introduced bills that would allow more people to waive routine shots. Indiana lawmakers will weigh religious exemptions for medical students.",
      "Earlier this month, West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order on his first day in office that enabled families to receive religious exemptions from required school vaccinations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a huge step,\" said Brian Festa, co-founder of the law firm We The Patriots USA, which works on vaccination-related cases throughout the country. \"That\u2019s a state that never had a religious exemption.\u201d",
      "Now, only four states allow just a medical exemption from childcare and K-12 immunization requirements: Connecticut, California, New York and Maine.",
      "Festa credited West Virginia's new religious exemption to Trump's nomination of Kennedy, as well as a 2023 federal court ruling that required Mississippi to allow residents to cite religious beliefs when seeking exemptions from state-mandated vaccinations for children.",
      "\u201cI think the writing\u2019s on the wall and they did feel the pressure,\u201d Festa said of West Virginia.",
      "In Connecticut, at least four Republican bills will try to revive the state's religious exemption for schools, colleges and daycares \u2014 something a contentious 2021 state law eliminated for students without an existing exemption.",
      "Connecticut health experts said at the time there was a slow but steady increase in the number of religious exemptions and declining vaccination rates in some schools. The state has historically maintained some of the highest childhood vaccination rates in the county, and in the 2023-2024 school year, more than 97% of kindergarteners protected against chickenpox, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and more.",
      "Given that the U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge to the Connecticut law and the statehouse is controlled by Democrats, GOP state Sen. Eric Berthel said he\u2019s not optimistic legislative leaders will allow debate on his exemption bill, but does believe the broader cultural shift means \u201cmaybe there is a bit of an appetite to look at things like this again.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that we\u2019re not being fair to families who have a true faith-based reason to not vaccinate their child,\u201d he said.",
      "There's one outlier so far among statehouse trends on exemptions. Hawaii, where legislators are looking to move in the opposite direction with a bill to eliminate all non-medical waivers after struggling for years with high exemption rates.",
      "Other vaccine-related bills touch on some of the opposition that's been growing since the pandemic.",
      "Oklahoma and Alabama have proposals that would require parental consent for any vaccine given to minors. Bills in Wyoming, Oregon and Oklahoma would prohibit \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against people who aren\u2019t vaccinated against COVID-19 or other diseases.",
      "New York and Oklahoma have bills that would require providers to give people getting shots a full ingredient list, and Florida legislation would ban edible vaccines, though none are approved for use in the U.S. and research is still in early stages.",
      "Vaccine injury is also a popular topic, and bills in Indiana and North Dakota propose creating state versions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System \u2014 a federal database that drew the attention of vaccine skeptics during the pandemic. Anyone can file a report about a potential issue after a vaccine, though the CDC\u2019s website notes a report doesn\u2019t prove the shot caused a health issue.",
      "North Dakota Republican state Sen. Dick Anderson said he's not against people getting vaccines \u2014 he got one COVID-19 shot himself \u2014 but proposed the bill because many people don't trust the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe have to do something to restore trust in the system,\" Anderson said.",
      "But experts note state databases are unnecessarily duplicative.",
      "\u201cA lot of these proposals, they're trying to fix something that's not broken and really working to counter the goal of preventing the spread of communicable disease,\u201d said Andy Baker-White, senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "Policy should be focused on getting rid of barriers to vaccination, not adding to them, said Dr. Susan Kressly, a pediatrician and president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Many families miss vaccinations not because of ideology, she said, but because of lack of transportation or not having primary care doctors or clinics nearby, among other things.",
      "But because most Americans are vaccinated, they haven't seen the effects of dangerous infections like bacterial meningitis that Kressly fielded calls about from fearful parents early in her career.",

      "A new study suggests that a pill used for emergency contraception could be repurposed at a higher dose as an abortion drug, providing a possible alternative to mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in the most common type of abortion in the United States.",
      "Mifepristone has been under attack by abortion opponents, with several states seeking in federal court to restrict its use.",
      "Now used in two-thirds of U.S. abortions, mifepristone blocks a hormone needed to sustain a pregnancy. It's typically used with misoprostol, which causes contractions and bleeding.",
      "In the study, 133 women who were up to nine weeks' pregnant took a 60 milligram dose of ulipristal acetate, the active ingredient in the prescription contraceptive Ella, followed by misoprostol 24 hours later.",
      "For 97% of them, that drug combo was effective at inducing an abortion, an effectiveness equal to the mifepristone-misoprostol combination. Four women needed a procedure or an additional medication to complete the abortion.",
      "The 60 milligram dose of ulipristal used in the study is twice the dose of Ella, a prescription drug used for emergency contraception.",
      "The company that makes Ella says on its website that it won't end an existing pregnancy. It can be taken up to five days after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy.",
      "The findings, published Thursday in the journal NEJM Evidence, may make emergency contraception a target of abortion opponents.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really worried that these results could be misapplied by anti-abortion activists to try to further their assault on contraception,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Grossman of the University of California, San Francisco, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal. Grossman praised the study but said more research is needed on ulipristal as an abortion drug before doctors would prescribe it routinely for that use.",
      "Lead author Dr. Beverly Winikoff, president of Gynuity Health Projects, a not-for-profit research group, said women need information about ulipristal, especially with mifepristone challenged in court.",
      "\u201cAt least now we would have an alternative,\u201d Winikoff said. \u201cI think it\u2019s better to have more things that you could use.\u201d",

    "summary": "Digital screens are pervasive at work and in homes and schools stores",
    "story": [
      "Digital screens are pervasive at work and in homes and schools stores",
      "NEW YORK -- The trouble started every day at around 3 p.m., after Cathy Higgins had spent five or six hours staring at an array of computer screens at her desk. Her university job overseeing research projects involved peering closely at numbers and details on contracts, applications and budgets.",
      "\u201cMy vision was so blurry, I couldn\u2019t even see what was on the screen, and I was squinting so much that I could not function,\u201d Higgins said.",
      "When her eyesight got bad, Higgins walked around and spoke with members of her staff. She began planning in-person meetings for afternoons. But she would resume the computer work late at night after her children went to bed.",
      "\u201cIf I had to continue working through the blurry vision, that\u2019s when the migraines would happen,\u201d Higgins said.",
      "Digital screens are pervasive, not only at work but in our homes, schools and shops. An estimated 104 million Americans of working age spend more than seven hours a day in front of screens, according to the American Optometric Association. All that screen time can take a toll.",
      "Too much exposure to screens can lead to dry or watery eyes, fuzzy vision and headaches. It can also lead to myopia, or nearsightedness, in some people, especially children. Some technology workers even describe short bouts of vertigo when they look at screens for too long.",
      "One reason for the discomfort is that staring closely at screens for prolonged periods causes the muscle that helps eye focus to tighten up.",
      "\u201cThat muscle's not supposed to stay tight all day long. And if it does, it's like picking up a light weight and trying to hold it over your head for hours,\u201d American Optometric Association President Steven Reed said. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to pick it up. But after a while, even though it\u2019s not a heavy lift, your body just gets tired.\u201d",
      "Fortunately, exposure to blue light from computer screens and devices has not been shown to cause permanent eye damage, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology.",
      "Nevertheless, symptoms can disrupt work, family time and rest. As an optometrist in Mississippi, Reed sees patients who complain of frequent eye pain, headaches and blurry vision associated with computer use. He advises getting an eye exam and taking frequent breaks.",
      "For Higgins, trying to catch up on the work she couldn't do when her eyes were too fatigued on weekdays cut into time she spent with her daughters on weekends. \u201cThey\u2019d be playing together, and I couldn\u2019t be as engaged as I would have liked to have been in what they were doing,\u201d she said.",
      "Here are some tips from eye health professionals to reduce eye strain caused by devices.",
      "Take a break every 20 minutes from sitting at a computer. During the break, focus your eyes on something that's about 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Pausing close-up work and looking at something in the distance gives tired, tight muscles time to relax.",
      "\u201cLuckily, eye strain is temporary,\u201d said Raj Maturi, an ophthalmologist at Midwest Eye Institute in Indianapolis who serves as spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. \u201cThe best way to avoid these symptoms is by taking breaks from our screens or near work activities and using lubricating eye drops, if needed.\u201d",
      "People usually blink about 18 to 22 times per minute. But when looking at a screen, the rate drops to three to seven times per minute, according to the Cleveland Clinic. That's where eye drops come in.",
      "It's good to move around and go outside, but when you don't have time for an outdoor walk, frequent 20-second breaks can help.",
      "Some people find that using a larger computer monitor helps reduce eye fatigue. You can also increase the font size on your laptop, monitor or smartphone screen.",
      "Higgins did all of the above after she started a new job as senior vice president at Stand Up to Cancer. Since she works remotely from home in Midlothian, Virginia, she got a 29-inch monitor and sits about three feet away from it, about a foot farther than in most office setups.",
      "The changes helped. She still has occasional issues with blurriness, but not as frequently. \u201cWhen I have an extended day, like a 12-hour day, that\u2019s when I start to have vision issues again,\u201d she said.",
      "Sitting an arm\u2019s length away from your screen and adjusting it so you\u2019re looking slightly downward also can help reduce eye strain, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology.",
      "Some products, such as blue light glasses, are marketed with claims that they will reduce digital eye strain, improve sleep and prevent eye disease. But several studies have found the glasses are not very effective, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology. It's really our behavior with digital devices that causes symptoms, not the small amount of blue light coming from screens, the group said.",
      "After stepping away from computers at work, many people find themselves reading or scrolling on smartphone screens. It's not just workers: children are using laptops, tablets and smart screens in school settings throughout the day.",
      "Too much screen time or focusing on nearby objects can accelerate the onset and progression of nearsightedness, especially in children, said Ayesha Malik, pediatric optometrist in the division of ophthalmology at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Anyone streaming shows should do so on a television, instead of a tablet, to help relieve eye strain, she said.",
      "Children should follow the 20-20-20-2 rule, which includes an extra \u201c2\u201d at the end to encourage playing outdoors for 2 hours a day, which helps with eye development, she said.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that most children are engaging with screens throughout the day at school and home. It becomes difficult to track the total number of hours,\u201d Malik said. \u201cAim for not more than 20 minutes during any one session.\u201d",
      "The blue light that digital screens emit can increase alertness, so watching Netflix on an iPad or scrolling through social media feeds in bed may make it hard to get restful sleep.",
      "To give your eyes and brain the rest they need, doctors recommend turning off screens one to two hours before going to sleep. You can also set devices to \u201cdark mode\u201d in the evening to reduce the impact of bright light. If you\u2019re used to streaming videos at night, try listening to an audiobook or podcast instead.",

      "Dutch authorities are desperately investigating a major art heist of a millenia-old golden helmet from an ancient civilization in current-day Romania",
      "BRUSSELS -- The prize in this art heist is worth more than its gold. To Romania, the ancient helmet is a priceless cultural heirloom. To the Netherlands, it\u2019s a stolen artifact that authorities hope to retrieve to uphold a reputation for safe museums.",
      "The intricate golden Cotofenesti helmet dates back some 2,500 years and is one Romania\u2019s most revered national treasures from the Dacia civilization. It was on display at the small Drents Museum in eastern Netherlands on the last weekend of a 6-month stint when thieves nabbed it.",
      "The theft of the helmet and three golden wristbands also on display sent shockwaves through the art world, and devastated Romanian authorities who thought they were loaning the items to a nation where security for museums was paramount.",
      "\u201cIt is a pitch dark day for us,\u201d museum director Harry Tupan said.",
      "Investigators had found few clues by late Monday beyond a burnt-out car close to the museum, indicating the thieves wanted to cover their tracks.",
      "Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said the artifacts have \u201cexceptional cultural and historical importance\u201d for Romanian heritage and identity, and that their disappearance had \u201ca strong emotional and symbolic impact on society.\u201d",
      "It was a heist that \u201ceven in our most pessimistic dreams, we would not have believed possible,\u201d said the director of Romania\u2019s National History Museum, Ernest Oberlander-Tarnoveanu.",
      "Romanian Justice Minister Radu Marinescu called the incident a \u201ccrime against our state\u201d and said recovering the artifacts \u201cis an absolute priority.\"",
      "The helmet's fame and dramatic studded appearance means it could never easily be sold, raising fears the thieves were after the gold itself.",
      "\u201cIt is simply unsellable. The whole world knows it. So, they likely went for the gold to \u2014 I almost dare not utter the words \u2014 melt it,\u201d said Dutch art expert Arthur Brand.",
      "That would reduce the treasure to a fraction of its cultural and historical value. Gold stands at about 85,000 euros ($89,000) per kilo and the helmet is estimated to weigh slightly less than that.",
      "\u201cIt is not only about the gold. It is about the cultural heritage,\u201d Tupan said. \u201cAnd it has been taken in a strange way and hurts incredibly.\u201d",
      "On grainy security video distributed by police, three people are seen opening a museum door with a big crowbar, after which an explosion is seen. Then they must have made off with the loot in a matter of minutes.",
      "\u201cSecurity, as it is supposed it be, was as far as we know, totally as it should be,\u201d Tupan said. \u201cAnd now, it is a small battlefield. There is nothing else for us to do but sit and wait and see what will happen.\u201d",

      "MADRID -- Spain attracted a record 94 million tourists last year, making the Southern European nation famous for its Mediterranean coastline, sweeping landscapes and historic cities among the most visited countries on earth.",
      "The surge in visitors has stoked complaints at times from some Spaniards about \u201covertourism, \u201d with concerns about overcrowding, water use and particularly the availability and affordability of housing.",
      "Spain's government has started listening to demands for more regulation, particularly around housing in Spain's big cities, where rising home and rental prices have become a key concern for voters. Earlier this month, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez introduced a 12-part plan to tackle the housing crisis, with measures aimed at bringing stricter regulations to short-term rentals that mainly cater to tourists.",
      "But that doesn't mean Spain is putting the brakes on tourism, an industry that accounts for about 12% of its GDP.",

      "Malaga, an Andalusian port city on the southern Mediterranean coast of Spain, will prohibit new rental properties in 43 neighborhoods of the city where those rentals exceed 8% of the residential stock. The policy went into effect earlier this month and will be tested for three years.",
      "Meanwhile, Barcelona plans to close down all of its 10,000 apartments licensed as short-term rentals in the coming years to safeguard the housing supply for full-time residents. The Mediterranean city known for its beaches, art and surrealist architecture announced last year that it would not renew any new tourism apartment licenses after they expire in 2028.",
      "Yes. Tourists can book hotel stays and short-term apartment-style rentals just about anywhere in Spain.",
      "Spain is in the throes of a growing housing affordability problem. Skyrocketing rents are particularly acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where incomes have failed to keep up, especially for young people. Housing prices are also steadily rising, especially in cities and coastal areas.",
      "Short-term contracts mainly offered for tourists are seen as driving up rental costs for locals, too.",
      "Visitors renting a car in Spain or booking hotel stays will also have to file more paperwork thanks to a new law that requires hotel owners and car rental companies to send personal information to the government for national security reasons.",
      "Passport details, home addresses and payment information used by travelers above 14 are among the details that will be collected.",

      "The 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet troops is being observed at the site of the former death camp",
      "OSWIECIM, Poland -- The 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet troops is being marked on Monday at the site of the former death camp, a ceremony that is widely being treated as the last major observance that any notable number of survivors will be able to attend.",
      "Among those who traveled to the site is 86-year-old Tova Friedman, who was 6 when she was among the 7,000 people liberated on Jan. 27, 1945. She believes it will the be last gathering of survivors at Auschwitz and she came from her home in New Jersey to add her voice to those warning about rising hatred and antisemitism.",
      "\u201cThe world has become toxic,\u201d she told The Associated Press a day before the observances in nearby Krakow. \u201cI realize that we\u2019re in a crisis again, that there is so much hatred around, so much distrust, that if we don\u2019t stop, it may get worse and worse. There may be another terrible destruction.\"",
      "Nazi German forces murdered some 1.1 million people at the site in southern Poland, which was under German occupation during World War II. Most of the victims were Jews killed on an industrial scale in gas chambers, but also Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, gay people and others who were targeted for elimination in the Nazi racial ideology.",
      "Elderly camp survivors, some wearing blue-and-white striped scarves that recall their prison uniforms, walked together to the Death Wall, where prisoners were executed, including Poles who resisted the occupation of their country.",
      "They were joined by Polish President Andrzej Duda, whose nation lost 6 million citizens during the war. He carried a candle and walked with Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum director Piotr Cywinski. At the wall, the two men bowed their heads, murmured prayers and crossed themselves.",
      "\u201cWe Poles, on whose land \u2014 occupied by Nazi Germans at that time \u2014 the Germans built this extermination industry and this concentration camp, are today the guardians of memory,\u201d Duda told reporters afterward.",
      "He spoke of the \u201cunimaginable harm\u201d inflicted on so many people, especially the Jewish people.",
      "In all, the Nazis regime murdered 6 million Jews from all over Europe, annihilating two-thirds of Europe's Jews and one-third of all Jews worldwide. In 2005, the United Nations designated Jan. 27 as International Holocaust Remembrance Day.",
      "Across Europe, officials and others were pausing to remember.",
      "\u201cAs the last survivors fade, it is our duty as Europeans to remember the unspeakable crimes and to honor the memories of the victims,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who is German, said on X.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who leads a nation defending itself against Russia's brutal invasion, placed a candle at the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial a day before in Kyiv, where tens of thousands of Jews were executed during the Nazi occupation. On Monday he arrived in Poland to attend the commemorations.",
      "\u201cThe evil that seeks to destroy the lives of entire nations still remains in the world,\u201d he wrote on his Telegram page.",
      "Commemorations will culminate when world leaders and royalty will join with elderly camp survivors, the youngest of whom are in their 80s, at Birkenau, the part of Auschwitz where the mass murder of Jews took place.",
      "Politicians, however, have not been asked to speak this year. Due to the advanced age of the survivors, about 50 of whom are expected, organizers are choosing to make them the center of the observances. Ronald Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress, will also speak.",
      "Among the leaders expected to attend are Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Germany has never sent both of its highest state representatives to the observances before, according to German news agency dpa.",
      "It is a sign of Germany's continued commitment to take responsibility for the nation's crimes, even with a far-right party gaining increased support in recent years.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron will attend after paying his respects at the Shoah Memorial in Paris, a symbolic tomb for the 6 million Jews who don't have a grave, and meeting with a survivor from Auschwitz and one from the Bergen-Belsen camp.",
      "Britain's King Charles III will also be there, along with kings and queens from Spain, Denmark and Norway.",
      "Russian representatives were in the past central guests at the anniversary observances in recognition of the Red Army liberation of the camp on Jan. 27, 1945, and the huge losses of Soviet forces in the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany. But they have not been welcome since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "The Kremlin said that Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a message to participants saying: \u201cWe will always remember that it was the Soviet soldier who crushed this dreadful, total evil and won the victory, the greatness of which will forever remain in world history.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said in a briefing Thursday: \u201cThere is something that needs to be said to the organizers and all the Europeans who will be there: your lives, your work and leisure, the very existence of your nations, your children have been paid for by Soviet soldiers, their lives, their blood.\u201d",

They also attacked police officers with bricks, steel pipes and other objects. The violence left 17 police officers injured, and police detained 46 protesters.",

      "Residents of northern Israel are surveying damage and trying to rebuild after the 14-month war between Israel and Hezbollah",
      "KIBBUTZ MANARA, Israel -- Kibbutz Manara in northern Israel is so close to the Lebanese border that patrons of a local pub joke, with gallows humor, that the militant group Hezbollah could see if they were eating sunflower seeds or potato chips with their beers.",
      "The proximity made Manara so vulnerable in the war between Israel and Hezbollah that rockets and explosive drones damaged the majority of homes, turning the tiny community into a symbol of the heavy price of fighting. The kibbutz's 300 residents were among the 60,000 Israelis evacuated by the government from communities along the Lebanese border during the 14-month war.",
      "A tenuous ceasefire has largely held, though it was tested on Sunday as a 60-day deadline passed for Israel and Hezbollah to withdraw their forces from southern Lebanon. Health officials in Lebanon said at least 22 people were killed by Israeli fire when demonstrators attempted to enter villages still under Israeli control. Israel says it is committed to withdrawing but says the process will take additional time.",
      "For now, residents of Israel's north are taking their time returning, uncertain when \u2014 or if \u2014 they will go back to shattered communities. Many wonder what future they can have in a place so exposed to violence. The vast majority of displaced families still haven't returned home.",
      "In hard-hit places like Manara, some who have ventured back have found unlivable, blackened homes. It will take years to rebuild.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to understand what we can fix, what we can do better, how we can prepare for the next round (of fighting),\" said Igor Abramovich, who remained in Manara during the war and believes it's just a matter of time before fighting erupts.",
      "All homes on the ridge facing Lebanon are destroyed, with gaping holes left by missile strikes or fires that burned so hot that cars partly melted. Because the kibbutz is so exposed, 70 meters (yards) from the border in some places, firefighters sometimes couldn\u2019t respond to the blazes. Instead, the emergency squad was forced to watch on security cameras as fires burned.",
      "Hezbollah began launching rockets and missiles toward Israeli border communities on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after the deadly Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza. Soon after, Israel evacuated dozens of towns, villages and kibbutzim along the border, including Manara.",
      "In Lebanon, at the height of the war, more than 1 million people were displaced, and reconstruction will take years there as well. Piles of rubble that were once homes can be seen in towns across the border.",
      "Hezbollah rockets killed 77 people in Israel, more than half of them civilians. No one was killed in Manara. Israeli air and ground assaults killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians.",
      "Israel made returning the displaced residents to their homes an aim in its war against Hezbollah and has promised incentives to entice them back. The return has been slow, in part because many residents are skeptical of the government's pledges to ensure their safety and because much work remains to rehabilitate communities.",
      "Manara is prone to howling winds and snow usually once a winter, attracting a hardy, close-knit group of people.",
      "Such remote kibbutzim were an integral element of the Israeli pioneer ethos, and Israel as a fledgling state once relied on them to protect its borders in the face of threats from neighboring Arab countries. Those threats appeared to have waned until Hamas attacked into southern Israel and Israeli authorities assessed that Hezbollah was planning a similar cross-border raid in the north.",
      "The war was a clear reminder for Israelis that the country still depends on the border communities and needs to ensure their viability so that the country doesn't collapse toward its center.",
      "Many in Manara are determined to return and restore their homes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a physical thing. They miss the air here,\u201d said Orna Weinberg, 58, who has lived on the kibbutz her entire life.",
      "Weinberg was displaced to a town about 45 minutes south, but she coordinated with the army and returned to Manara almost every day during the war, helping other evacuated residents who asked her to save photo albums, transfer the kibbutz\u2019s archives or carry out other tasks to keep the community from falling apart.",
      "Now she\u2019s involved in coordinating Manara's rehabilitation, both physical and emotional. She and Abramovich spend hours walking through the kibbutz with appraisers for different government agencies to determine the financial losses and compensation. They also need to check the kibbutz\u2019s infrastructure, including gas, water and electricity lines. All suffered damage.",
      "Out of 157 homes or apartments in the kibbutz, 110 were damaged, including 38 that were completely destroyed. In the part of Manara that faces Lebanon, all houses were destroyed. The ones facing the valley and the city of Kiryat Shmona are damaged but likely salvageable.",
      "Abramovich said an initial estimate of rebuilding costs is at least NIS 150 million ($40 million).",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re having this weird discussion now, who has it better, someone whose house is partially destroyed or totally destroyed,\u201d said Hagar Erlich, 72, whose father was one of Manara's founders and is living in a hotel in the city of Tiberias with other kibbutz members. It may be cheaper and faster to demolish and rebuild rather than renovate, she said.",
      "The kibbutz is committed to reopening the nursery school by Sept. 1, convinced that if young families don\u2019t return as soon as possible, the community's future is in danger, Abramovich said.",
      "So far, none of Manara\u2019s residents have announced they are leaving. The Ambramovich family \u2014 Igor, his wife and two daughters \u2014 will return in February, the first family to do so.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard for people to say, \u2018I\u2019m not coming back,\u2019\u201d Erlich said. \u201cWe decided that we are not asking that question, not as an organization, and not as individuals.\u201d",
      "The community even wants to continue an expansion of 92 housing units that was planned before the war started.",
      "Signs of life are reemerging.",
      "In late December, 50 Manara residents gathered to work in the community garden, the hub of the kibbutz where they mark important celebrations and gatherings. The older members cooked a feast as children ran through the weeds and removed rocks from the garden beds to get them ready for new plants.",
      "\u201cIt was the first time since the war began where I heard voices of people talking and chatting around here,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cWhenever I think about that, that\u2019s home.\u201d"

      "\u201cDubai is on steroids but affordability risks are increasing,\u201d warned Hasnain Malik in a starkly titled report he wrote for the global data firm Tellimer, where he's a managing director.",
      "Under Dubai's current plans, the city aims to have 5.8 million residents by 2040, adding more than half its current estimated population in just 15 years. Since 1980, its population has already soared from around 255,000 to around 3.8 million.",
      "Real estate lit the fire in Dubai's growth in 2002, when the desert sheikdom began allowing foreigners to own property. After sharp falls during both the 2008-2009 financial crisis and Dubai's brief coronavirus lockdown, prices have been soaring.",
      "Today, average prices per square foot are at all-time highs, according to Property Monitor. Rental prices increased as much as 20% in key neighborhoods last year, with further rises likely this year, with some residents moving to communities further out in the desert, the real estate firm Engel & V\u00f6lkers said.",
      "Even before the boom, some people who worked in Dubai chose to live in the neighboring emirate of Sharjah, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the city's downtown, or further away. Some 1 million commuters from other emirates jam the 12-lane Sheikh Zayed Road that runs through the center of the city and other highways every day, as studies suggest that as many as four out of five employees drive to work alone.",
      "That traffic has only intensified with Dubai's new arrivals.",
      "While the rest of the world saw as much as a 4% increase in the number of registered vehicles in the last two years, the city's Road and Transportation Authority says there's been a 10% increase in the number of vehicles.",
      "So many vehicles have been registered that the city has had to make license plates longer.",
      "And while the city keeps building new flyovers and other road improvements, more cars are coming from more directions than ever before.",
      "\u201cDubai is very attractive, more and more people are coming,\u201d said Thomas Edelmann, the founder and managing director of RoadSafetyUAE, which advocates about traffic issues. \u201cI think it\u2019s easier to get people quickly to come to Dubai and to convince them about Dubai, then to build a new intersection or a new highway.\u201d",
      "Congestion has got so bad that it's driving even prominent Emiratis to break their customary silence on public affairs.",
      "Habib Al Mulla, a prominent Emirati lawyer, wrote on the social platform X in December that while authorities were working on congestion, the problem demanded \u201ca set of immediate and long-term mechanisms.\u201d He followed up by publishing an opinion piece twice mentioning \u201ccongestion\u201d as being among \u201cpressing issues\" for global cities like Dubai.",
      "While phrased in mild language, Al Mulla\u2019s comments represented rare public criticism in the United Arab Emirates, where speech is tightly controlled by criminal law and social norms favor raising issues at a \u201cmajlis\u201d \u2014 a semiprivate setting convened by a traditional ruler.",
      "\u201cThe concentration of wealth and opportunities created in global cities may cause income inequality that pushes out lower-income residents,\u201d Al Mulla warned in the English-language Khaleej Times newspaper on Jan. 15.",
      "\u201cThe problem becomes acute when the wealth and opportunities remain inaccessible to segments of the national population who witness the city\u2019s allure being seized by outsiders. This may carry significant social risks, if not mitigated.\u201d",
      "Then there's demographic concerns as the Emirati share of the population dwindles. While the number of citizens isn't public, a back-of-the-envelope, informal calculation shared for years by experts suggests Emirati citizens represent around 10% of the country's overall population of more than 9 million people, a number that's likely falling as foreigners rush in.",
      "In December, sermon scripts issued for the Dec. 13 Friday's prayers directly touched on the duty of having more children.",
      "\u201cIncreasing offspring is both a religious obligation and a national responsibility, as it contributes to the protection and sustainability of nations,\u201d the sermon read, according to a transcript issued by the federal government's General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments.",
      "For Dubai's autocratic government, overseen by ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, possible solutions to the grinding traffic have ranged from the practical to the fanciful. The government in recent months has repeatedly encouraged companies to allow more remote work options, including in a report released in November that also suggested staggered and flexible working hours.",
      "Adding as many as five remote workdays a month, along with the other steps, \u201ccan reduce morning peak travel time across Dubai by 30%,\u201d the study stated.",
      "Dubai's road toll system, known as Salik, has added gates to charge drivers more and will institute surge pricing at the end of the month. Dubai's Metro, which boasts the world's longest self-driving rail line, will also grow beyond its broadly north-south routes in a nearly $5 billion expansion.",
      "Then there's the flying taxi project. Since 2017, Dubai has been announcing plans for airborne cabs in the city. A first \u201cvertiport\u201d is being built by Dubai International Airport with the aim of offering the service from next year.",
      "Dubai also plans 3,300 kilometers (2,050 miles) of new pedestrian paths, although during Dubai's summer months pedestrians have to contend with high humidity and heat of around 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "\u201cIn the coming years, residents of Dubai will be able to move around by walking, cycling, its extensive network of roads and bridges, the Metro and its new lines, water taxis, or flying taxis on specific air routes,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed said on X in December.",
      "But for now, Dubai keeps attracting more people and more cars \u2014 and the traffic jams only get longer."

      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Israel on Monday began allowing thousands of Palestinians to return to the heavily destroyed north of the Gaza Strip for the first time since the early weeks of the 15-month war with Hamas, in accordance with a fragile ceasefire.",
      "The opening was delayed for two days over a dispute between Hamas and Israel, which said the militant group had changed the order of the hostages it released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Mediators resolved the dispute overnight.",
      "Palestinians who have been sheltering in squalid tent camps and schools-turned-shelters for over a year are eager to return to their homes -- even knowing that they have likely been damaged or destroyed. Many had feared Israel would make their exodus permanent, and expressed similar concerns about an idea floated by President Donald Trump to resettle large numbers of Palestinians in Egypt and Jordan.",
      "Ismail Abu Matter, a father of four who had waited for three days before crossing with his family, described scenes of jubilation on the other side, with people singing, praying and crying as they were reunited with relatives.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the joy of return,\u201d said Abu Matter, whose family was among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. \u201cWe had thought we wouldn\u2019t return, like our ancestors.\u201d",
      "Hamas said the return was \u201ca victory for our people, and a declaration of failure and defeat for the (Israeli) occupation and transfer plans.\u201d",
      "The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas and securing the release of dozens of hostages captured in the militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which triggered the fighting.",
      "Israel ordered the wholescale evacuation of the north in the opening days of the war and sealed it off shortly after ground troops moved in. Around a million people fled to the south in October 2023, while hundreds of thousands remained in the north, which had some of the heaviest fighting and the worst destruction of the war.",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israel would continue to enforce the ceasefire, and that anyone violating it or threatening Israeli forces \u201cwill bear the full cost.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not allow a return to the reality of Oct. 7,\u201d he wrote on the platform X.",
      "Israel had delayed the opening of the crossing, which was supposed to happen over the weekend, saying it would not allow Palestinians north until a female civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, was released. It also accused Hamas of failing to provide information on whether the remaining hostages set to be freed in the first phase are alive or dead.",
      "Hamas in turn accused Israel of violating the agreement by not opening the crossing.",
      "The Gulf nation of Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, announced early Monday that an agreement had been reached to release Yehoud along with two other hostages before Friday.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the hostage release \u2014 which will include female soldier Agam Berger \u2014 will take place on Thursday. That release will be in addition to the one already set for next Saturday, when three hostages should be released.",
      "Hamas also handed over a list of required information about the hostages to be released in the ceasefire\u2019s six-week first phase.",
      "Starting at 7 a.m., Palestinians were allowed to cross on foot without inspection through part of the so-called Netzarim corridor, a military zone bisecting the territory just south of Gaza City that Israel carved out early in the war. A checkpoint for vehicles was to open later with an inspection mechanism, the details of which were not immediately known.",
      "Under the first phase of the ceasefire, which runs until early March, Hamas is to free a total of 33 hostages in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The militants have released seven hostages, including four female soldiers, in the current ceasefire, in exchange for more than 300 prisoners, including many serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis.",
      "The second \u2014 and far more difficult \u2014 phase of the agreement has not yet been negotiated. Hamas says it will not release the remaining 60 or so hostages unless Israel ends the war, while Netanyahu says he is still committed to destroying the militant group and ending its nearly 18-year rule over Gaza.",
      "Hamas started the war when thousands of its fighters stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 90 hostages are still inside Gaza, and Israel believes around a third are dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s air and ground war has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "Israeli bombardment and ground operations have displaced around 90% of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people, often multiple times, and flattened entire neighborhoods.",

      "CALI, Colombia -- From time to time, Gustavo Arbel\u00e1ez faces relatives whose losses were caused by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the powerful guerrilla group he was part of during Colombia\u2019s five-decade armed conflict.",
      "Tears in their eyes, victims name their loved ones and reprimand him: They had dreams and now they\u2019re gone.",
      "\u201cI have never regretted being a guerrilla member,\u201d said Arbel\u00e1ez, who signed a divisive peace pact with the government alongside 13,600 FARC fighters in 2016. \u201cBut I now see that those of us who fought our country\u2019s war lost sight of what life means.\u201d",
      "The fight among leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries, drug lords and government forces left more than 450,000 people killed and 124,000 disappeared. These figures are on par with other conflicts in Latin America, where thousands have vanished under similar circumstances.",
      "In Colombia, though, a peculiar thing happened. Aiming to heal long-time wounds and build new paths toward reconciliation, dozens of former rebels, officials, forensic anthropologists and religious leaders now work side-by-side in finding their country\u2019s disappeared.",
      "The 2016 pact earned then-President Juan Manuel Santos a Nobel Peace Prize, but neither he nor his successors have fully addressed endemic violence, displacement and inequality \u2014 issues that helped spark Colombia\u2019s conflict in the 1960s.",
      "Since he came into office in 2022, the rebel-turned-president who was sworn in as the country\u2019s first leftist leader, Gustavo Petro, has pushed for \u201ctotal peace.\u201d His goal is to demobilize all rebels and drug trafficking gangs, but even as a ceasefire was carried out, negotiations with Colombia\u2019s remaining guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army (ELN), are in crisis and violence escalated. Simultaneously, FARC hold-out groups and trafficking mafias continue to affect the country.",
      "\u201cA peace accord is not only a matter of setting down arms,\u201d said the Rev. Arturo Arrieta, who oversees human rights initiatives in Palmira, a city in southwestern Colombia where efforts to exhume unidentified remains at a church-administered cemetery are underway.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a delay on the implementation of the accord, it\u2019s underfunded and, although certain mechanisms are working, more actions are needed,\u201d he added.",
      "The peace pact established three crucial institutions for searching efforts: the Truth Commission; the Special Jurisdiction for Peace, which encourages offenders to confess their crimes and make restitution actions in exchange for not serving any jail time; and the Search Unit for Disappeared Persons, which traces disappearances within the conflict, conducts exhumations and returns loved ones' remains to hurting relatives like Doris Tejada, whose son \u00d3scar Morales disappeared in 2007.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 17 years and still hurts,\u201d said Tejada, who found Morales\u2019 remains in 2024. \u201cI asked God for help because it was difficult to see his bones. We still mourn.\u201d",
      "Morales vanished near the border with Venezuela, where he had traveled from a city neighboring Bogot\u00e1 to earn money selling clothes. Tejada later learned that he became a \u201c false positive,\" one of the 6,402 civilians who were slain by the military and intentionally registered as rebels during the conflict.",
      "Officials have apologized for the killings and some soldiers involved have been sentenced to prison, but many remain reluctant to acknowledge that the military committed war crimes as serious as those carried out by rebels.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been very vocal about this,\u201d said Tejada, who tattooed her son\u2019s face on her arm to keep him present. \u201cIf this will go unpunished, I want everyone to know that what I cared about the most was rescuing my son\u2019s body and giving him a Christian burial.\u201d",
      "Arbel\u00e1ez joined FARC in the 1980s in Valle del Cauca, a highly affected region during the conflict. According to him, as a university leader his life was threatened, so he chose the path of arms.",
      "\u201cNone of us decided, from a young age, to become paramilitary leaders, rebels, drug dealers or to run a hitman\u2019s organization,\u201d he said. \u201cCertain circumstances led us to embrace those decisions and no one owns the truth, so we are still trying to understand what made us become part of a conflict that drove us to kill one another.\u201d",
      "Government forces and illegal groups were as responsible for massacres, forced recruitment and disappearances. According to the Truth Commission, paramilitary groups committed 45% of the homicides, while guerrillas \u2014 most of them FARC \u2014 carried out 27% and the government forces 12%.",
      "Among his commitments toward the peace accord, Arbelaez and fellow former FARC rebels have shared information that benefits searching efforts. He also works with Corporaci\u00f3n Reencuentros, an organization led by 140 ex-members of FARC who look for disappeared Colombians all over the territory.",
      "Among those missing are rebels who died in combat and were buried by their comrades in the mountains, so that the military did not show them off as trophies.",
      "\u201cWhen public forces took our men, our souls were ripped apart,\u201d Arbel\u00e1ez said. \u201cSo we disappeared ourselves.\u201d",
      "Given the divisiveness that the peace process inflames, some have disavowed the search of former rebels. According to the Truth Commission, FARC members were responsible for 24% of the disappearances during the conflict and victims have blamed rebels for causing widespread pain through attacks and kidnappings that financed their operations.",
      "During a recent ceremony in which Corporaci\u00f3n Reencuentros returned a fighter\u2019s remains to his family in the Colombian city of Cali, Cristi\u00e1n P\u00e9rez\u2019s partner said that her search was stigmatized for years, as if relatives of guerilla members had no right to find their loved ones.",
      "\u201cRegardless of the political spectrum, religious preference and ethnicity, we are all human beings and have families that look after us,\u201d said Marcela Rodr\u00edguez, of the search unit in Valle del Cauca. \u201cThat\u2019s the view from which the unit was born and what we're constantly trying to make awareness of.\u201d",
      "Up until late 2024, the search unit had found 31 disappeared Colombians alive and returned 354 remains.",
      "Its personnel has said that bodies may be buried in complex locations: cemeteries, dumps, crematory ovens and strong-current rivers. Given Colombia\u2019s geography and the remoteness in which the conflict developed, teams travel up to 8 hours by mule through rambling roads to reach spots of interest.",
      "Nonetheless, said forensic anthropologist Juan Carlos Benavides on a recently released documentary that details how the unit operates, it\u2019s all worth it. \u201cFinding a body might mean there\u2019s one less person disappeared in Colombia, but it\u2019s the peace of a whole family.\u201d",
      "For those who have searched for their loved ones for decades \u2014 signed accord or not \u2014 peace has been a troublesome concept to grasp on.",
      "\u201cEvery single day, one wonders what happened to them,\u201d said Mar\u00eda F\u00e9nix Torres, who lives in Bogot\u00e1 and has searched for her twin brothers since 2007. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201d",
      "Alexander and Henry vanished on their way to a business meeting. From a young age they worked in emerald mining, an industry that has historically suffered under rivalries and violence.",
      "Torres holds a monthly Mass to pray for her brothers and renew her strength. Church is currently the sole meeting place for her family, which grew distant after the disappearances.",
      "\u201cPeople tell me to stop looking because if I speak badly about the mines, I will get killed,\u201d said Torres. \u201cWell, let them kill me. I will never hide. I will search for them until God allows me to.\u201d",
      "Back in Cali, Melba Bernal also continues her search. Her 34-year-old sister, who was member of a political party founded by rebels, disappeared in 1988.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been searching for my sister for 36 years and I find this inconceivable, painful and unfair,\u201d Bernal said. \u201cI ask God to bring her back to me, to bring me justice.\u201d",
      "Witness testimonies led her to believe that Olga was captured by intelligence police officers who tortured her, then transferred her to a hospital to treat her wounds and ended up taking her to a police commander who denies any wrongdoing.",
      "Bernal said her mother always searched for her sister alive, and until her death two years ago, she used to look at homeless people\u2019s faces, hoping to find her.",
      "It\u2019s painful, Bernal said, that her sister\u2019s son, now 41, has no memories of Olga. He barely speaks of her, but Bernal believes that if her remains are ever found, he would spread her ashes over water.",
      "\u201cIn the ocean, in a river, one can find rest, fluency, peace.\u201d",

      "The most violent period in Peru\u2019s history still brings sorrow among the thousands who lost loved ones between 1980 and 2000",
      "AYACUCHO, Per\u00fa -- The easiest thing might have been to let go. To refresh the flowers at her husband\u2019s grave and find comfort in retrieving his bones, a milestone in a country where 20,000 people disappeared between 1980 and 2000.",
      "Lidia Flores chose a different path, though: to search for others who also went missing during Peru's most violent period.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t stay calm when others, like I did, are crying,\u201d Flores said from her home in Ayacucho, a Peruvian city whose name translates as \u201cnook of the dead\u201d from the Quechua language. \u201cThey are searching and I must be there for them.\u201d",
      "Thousands more have disappeared thought Latin America under dictatorships, during armed conflicts or due to organized crime. Their wives, mothers and daughters have historically fought for justice, but Flores\u2019 case is distinctive because even after finding her husband\u2019s remains 40 years ago, her loss led her to commit to a greater cause.",
      "For several years, she has presided over the National Association of Relatives of Detained and Disappeared Persons of Peru. Known for its Spanish initials, Anfasep, it was founded in 1983 and has about 140 members who advocate for truth and reparations.",
      "\u201cSometimes I feel at ease, but then I wonder, why did this happen?\u201d said Flores, who Peruvians rarely address by name. Most call her \u201cmami\u201d or \u201cmadrecita,\u201d an affectionate Spanish word derived from \u201cmother,\u201d as if she cared for them all.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t let go because I made a commitment,\u201d she added. \u201cFor as long as I live, I will demand justice for all and find out why my husband was killed.\u201d",
      "Soon after Flores last saw him alive, Felipe Huam\u00e1n was detained by members of the military dressed as civilians outside his house in July 1984. Flores found his remains a month later, guided by a stranger who saw a corpse matching his description.",
      "Only days had passed since he was thrown down a hill, but stray dogs had gnawed at the remains. Flores took her 2-month-old baby out of her shawl, wrapped what was left of Huam\u00e1n and climbed uphill, her baby in her arms, her husband\u2019s bones on her back.",
      "She arrived at the prosecutor\u2019s office and requested a death certificate to bury him, but an official told her: \u201cHis body is not whole anymore. Throw him into the river or burn what\u2019s left of him and find your peace.\u201d So she wrapped up the bones, went home and bribed a grave digger to bury Huam\u00e1n at midnight, as she peeked and wept behind a tree.",
      "Stories like hers are part of the aftermath of a brutal fight between the Peruvian government and the insurgency of Sendero Luminoso (or Shining Path), a Communist organization that claimed to seek social transformation through an armed revolution.",
      "Founded in the 1970s by Abimael Guzman, the group turned violent a decade later. Older Peruvians still tell tales about donkeys strapped with explosives detonating in crowds, bombs placed under streetlamps to plunge cities into darkness and massacres that wiped out entire families.",
      "The terror, though, was not merely unleashed by the insurgents. The armed forces were equally responsible for deaths and human rights violations.",
      "Hundreds of men \u2014 many of them innocent \u2014 were captured by the military, often to face torture and execution. Others were slain and buried in mass graves by insurgents seeking to control communities by spreading fear.",
      "Although hundreds of people have disappeared for other motives since then, the Truth Commission said this was the most violent period in Peru\u2019s history. More than 69,000 people are counted as \u201cfatal victims\u201d \u2014 about 20,000 classified as \u201cdisappeared\u201d and the rest killed by insurgents or the military.",
      "\u201cIn many ways, Peru is still dealing with the repercussions of the political violence from the late 20th century,\u201d said Miguel La Serna, a history professor at the University of North Carolina.",
      "\u201cWhole generations of adult men disappeared and that impacted the demographics in these communities. People moved out to escape the violence and some never returned,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s to say nothing of the social, collective trauma that people experienced.\u201d",
      "Those unsure of what happened to their relatives wandered the streets asking for clues and listened to radio news reports. Every time a discovery of remains was announced, they headed out to those locations and turned over corpses, hoping to spot a familiar face.",
      "\u201cPig and dogs ate the bodies, but we got used to that,\u201d said Adelina Garc\u00eda, whose 27-year-old husband, Z\u00f3simo Tenorio, disappeared in 1983. \u201cI felt no disgust or fear.\u201d",
      "The couple had just moved from a nearby town to flee the violence from Sendero Luminoso. They thought they would be safe in Ayacucho, where the armed forces patrolled the streets, but soon realized they were wrong.",
      "\u201cIt was tough,\u201d Garc\u00eda said. \u201cEvery night I thought: Tomorrow we won\u2019t wake up. Which of them will kill us? The insurgents or the military?\u201d",
      "She was sleeping when soldiers stormed into her home. They dragged Tenorio from their bed, called him a \u201cterrorist\u201d and took him away. They wrecked their belongings, stole their savings and hit Garc\u00eda until she lay unconscious on the floor, next to her year-old crying child.",
      "\u201cEven presidents have told us that it\u2019s been a long time and we should turn the page, but we can\u2019t do that,\u201d Garc\u00eda said. \u201cWhen a person dies, you hold a wake according to your religion, but for us, there\u2019s always a question: What if they\u2019re alive?\u201d",
      "After her husband vanished, a military captain told her that he was taken to Cabitos, an army base where a crematory oven was used to dispose of bodies and more than 130 people were executed. She could never corroborate it, though, so the search continues.",
      "\u201cMy face might be wrinkled, but my heart is strong,\u201d Garc\u00eda said. \u201cI\u2019ll keep looking for justice and truth.\u201d",
      "For relatives with missing loved ones, keeping a spiritual connection brings peace into their lives.",
      "\u201cI have faith in my dad,\u201d said Luyeva Yangali, who has prayed to her father, Fortunato, since he disappeared near Ayacucho in 1983. \u201cI spoke to him at night as I did to God.\u201d",
      "Her mother looked for him at first, but the family moved to Lima after the military tortured her for allegedly aiding insurgents and Yangali took over the task.",
      "\u201cI was 11 when my family was destroyed and we haven\u2019t recovered,\u201d Yangali said. \u201cI think we never will.\u201d",
      "Despite the work of forensic doctors, prosecutors and organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross, only about 3,200 remains have been found. Some now fear that President Dina Boluarte might cut out the government\u2019s support to keep searching, but many others remain hopeful, watching a handful of Peruvians who finally had a chance to say goodbye.",
      "At a recent restitution ceremony in Ayacucho, Pablo Valerio bid his farewells not to one, but to five of his relatives.",
      "Back in 1984, his parents, two sisters and a brother were slain by members of Sendero Luminoso while Valerio and his younger brother were away studying. They learned about the massacre a month after it happened, when they headed home.",
      "\u201cAs we got close, we were surprised that no one, not even our dogs, was around,\u201d said Valerio, 63. \u201cIt was all silence. Then we saw our house completely destroyed, burned.\u201d",
      "He found the bodies the next morning, one piled over another inside a pit in which he saw his father\u2019s hands. Fearing the insurgents might come back to kill him and his brother, they left and \u2014 until now \u2014 haven't had the chance to have a wake.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until the Truth Commission came that we could dig them out,\u201d Valerio said. \u201cTheir bones were not whole anymore, but we placed them in a little box and brought them here.\u201d",
      "The day before a Mass honoring them at Ayacucho\u2019s cathedral, forensic experts, prosecutors and Quechua language interpreters comforted more than a dozen relatives who, like Valerio, had a last chance to see their loved ones\u2019 remains.",
      "Most of them sobbed. Others held hands and prayed. A few more, like Valerio, who treasures the one and only photo he preserves of his father, whispered to the bones: \u201cYou are no longer disappeared, but present.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo one can kill a spirit, so you remain alive.\u201d",

      "Spain attracted a record/whopping 94 million tourists last year, making the Southern European nation famous for its Mediterranean coastline and historic sites one of the most visited countries on earth",
      "MADRID -- Spain attracted a record 94 million tourists last year, making the Southern European nation famous for its Mediterranean coastline, sweeping landscapes and historic cities among the most visited countries on earth.",
      "The surge in visitors has stoked complaints at times from some Spaniards about \u201covertourism, \u201d with concerns about overcrowding, water use and particularly the availability and affordability of housing.",
      "Spain's government has started listening to demands for more regulation, particularly around housing in Spain's big cities, where rising home and rental prices have become a key concern for voters. Earlier this month, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez introduced a 12-part plan to tackle the housing crisis, with measures aimed at bringing stricter regulations to short-term rentals that mainly cater to tourists.",
      "But that doesn't mean Spain is putting the brakes on tourism, an industry that accounts for about 12% of its GDP.",
      "Here's what you should know before planning a visit:",
      "No, but some cities have started to regulate tourism rental properties.",
      "Malaga, an Andalusian port city on the southern Mediterranean coast of Spain, will prohibit new rental properties in 43 neighborhoods of the city where those rentals exceed 8% of the residential stock. The policy went into effect earlier this month and will be tested for three years.",
      "Meanwhile, Barcelona plans to close down all of its 10,000 apartments licensed as short-term rentals in the coming years to safeguard the housing supply for full-time residents. The Mediterranean city known for its beaches, art and surrealist architecture announced last year that it would not renew any new tourism apartment licenses after they expire in 2028.",
      "Yes. Tourists can book hotel stays and short-term apartment-style rentals just about anywhere in Spain.",
      "Spain is in the throes of a growing housing affordability problem. Skyrocketing rents are particularly acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where incomes have failed to keep up, especially for young people. Housing prices are also steadily rising, especially in cities and coastal areas.",
      "Short-term contracts mainly offered for tourists are seen as driving up rental costs for locals, too.",
      "Visitors renting a car in Spain or booking hotel stays will also have to file more paperwork thanks to a new law that requires hotel owners and car rental companies to send personal information to the government for national security reasons.",
      "Passport details, home addresses and payment information used by travelers above 14 are among the details that will be collected."

      "The sanctions target trade, finance, energy, technology, industry, transport and luxury goods. They include a ban on the import or transfer of seaborne crude oil and certain petroleum products from Russia to the EU. They will now remain in place at least until July 31.",
      "Some measures were introduced in 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula, but the list grew significantly after Moscow's full-fledged invasion of its neighbor almost three years ago.",
      "On Friday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n called on the EU to intervene in a gas dispute that his country has with Ukraine. He said Kyiv\u2019s decision to halt the transit of Russian gas into Central Europe had forced Hungary to turn to alternative routes, which raised energy prices.",
      "To satisfy Orb\u00e1n's demand, the European Commission attached a statement to Monday\u2019s sanctions rollover agreement, saying that it \u201cexpects all third countries to respect\u201d EU energy security, and warned that it could take action to protect critical infrastructure like oil and gas pipelines.",
      "\u201cHungary has received the guarantees it has requested concerning the energy security of our country,\u201d Hungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said in a statement. All 27 EU member countries must agree for the sanctions to be prolonged.",
      "But already last week EU diplomats and officials expected Hungary to end its threatened blockade on the measures after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose stiff taxes, tariffs and sanctions on Russia if an agreement isn\u2019t reached to end the war in Ukraine.",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is nearly certain to keep its key interest rate unchanged at its policy meeting this week, just a few days after President Donald Trump said he would soon demand lower rates",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is nearly certain to keep its key interest rate unchanged at its policy meeting this week, just a few days after President Donald Trump said he would soon demand lower rates",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is nearly certain to keep its key interest rate unchanged at its policy meeting this week, just a few days after President Donald Trump said he would soon demand lower rates.",
      "Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have cut their rate for three meetings in a row, to about 4.3%, from a two-decade high of 5.3%. Yet with several recent economic reports showing healthy hiring and some progress on inflation, policymakers have said that the pace of rate cuts will slow this year. Some have suggested that few reductions are needed at all.",
      "While the two-day meeting that ends Wednesday may be uneventful, it nevertheless kicks off what is likely to be a turbulent year for the Fed. Trump, last Thursday, made clear he expects to comment on interest-rate policy and said, \u201cI know interest rates much better than they do.\"",
      "At the same time, Fed officials are also navigating a delicate period for the economy: They want to keep borrowing costs high enough to push inflation back to their 2% target, without keeping them too high for too long and plunging the economy into a recession.",
      "The last time he was in the White House, Trump threatened to fire Powell, whom he appointed in late 2017, but he has more recently backed off such threats. Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026, when Trump can name a replacement.",
      "Until then, Trump's comments Thursday suggest he expects to regularly second-guess the Fed in public, despite a decades-long tradition among previous presidents of taking a hands-off approach to the central bank. Former president Joe Biden reappointed Powell, rather than replacing him, in a nod to central bank independence from politics.",
      "Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Investments and a former top economist at the Fed, said Powell won't let Trump's attacks affect his policy decisions.",
      "\u201cIf you like your independence, then you got to live with criticism,\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cIf it\u2019s all talk, it\u2019s not a particular concern to the Fed. I think Chair Powell understands that\u2019s the rules of the game.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Fed officials have clearly signaled they expect to skip a rate hike, at least in January, to evaluate the job market and economy.",
      "\u201cIn January, we kind of need to see what\u2019s going to happen,\" Fed governor Christopher Waller said earlier this month in an interview on CNBC. Fed officials \u201cneed to see a little more progress on inflation,\u201d he added, though he also said it is getting \u201cvery close\u201d to their target.",
      "Annual inflation was just 2.4% in November, according to the Fed's preferred gauge, only modestly above its goal, but it has been stuck there for about six months. Still, there are signs that prices should cool later this year. A spurt of apartment construction is bringing down the growth in rental costs, and car insurance inflation has also slowed.",
      "Some officials, including Beth Hammack, president of the Fed\u2019s Cleveland branch, have argued that the persistence of inflation means the Fed should keep its key rate elevated. Hammack voted against the Fed\u2019s quarter-point cut last month.",
      "Hiring rebounded in December, reversing a downshift in the fall that had unnerved the Fed. Policymakers had agreed to cut the Fed's key rate by a half-point in September, partly because they worried that a then-weakening job market could lead to a recession. Yet the jobless rate ticked down to a low 4.1% last month. A sharp slowdown in hiring would likely spur the Fed to cut rates more quickly.",
      "Fed officials in December signaled that they expected to reduce rates just twice this year. But the 19-member committee that makes interest rate decisions is clearly divided. Some officials, such as Waller and Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, expect inflation to keep cooling and argue that the Fed's rate doesn't need to be so high.",
      "Others, such as Hammack and Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Kansas City branch, say that with inflation still above target and the economy healthy, there is no need to reduce borrowing costs, or at least not by much.",
      "A big unknown for the Fed this year is whether Trump will impose tariffs, how sweeping they will be, and whether they will push up prices. Mass deportation of immigrants could also force employers to pay more for workers to fill jobs, which could also lift inflation.",
      "Most economists forecast that widepread tariffs will likely lift inflation by roughly several-tenths of a percentage point \u2014 not a large amount, but potentially enough for the Fed to postpone rate cuts. It could take months for the tariffs to be formally imposed and then to evaluate their impact on the economy. Some economists don't think the impact will be apparent until next year.",
      "Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and a potential candidate to replace Powell, argued in a recent column in the Wall Street Journal that Trump's promises to reduce regulation could push in the other direction, by reducing costs for businesses, and bring down inflation."

      "The Japanese network Fuji Television and its parent company say its president and chairperson are resigning immediately to take responsibility for a widening sex assault scandal linked to one of Japan\u2019s top TV celebrities",
      "TOKYO -- The Japanese network Fuji Television and its parent company said Monday that its president and chairperson were resigning immediately to take responsibility for a widening sex assault scandal linked to one of Japan's top TV celebrities.",
      "The scandal centers on Masahiro Nakai, a former leader of Japan\u2019s once-hugely popular boy band SMAP, and his costly settlement with a woman over the alleged sex assault at a 2023 dinner party that Fuji TV staff allegedly helped to organize.",
      "The allegations surfaced in magazine articles in December and have since triggered claims of systematic cover-ups by Fuji TV executives. The public outrage over the lack of transparency and explanation at the network's earlier news conference this month have led to an avalanche of advertising losses at Fuji, one of the networks where Nakai worked.",
      "Fuji Television Network President Koichi Minato said his company mishandled the case.",
      "\u201cWe are very sorry that we mishandled the case because of our lack of awareness about human rights and corporate governance ... and as a result our responses to the involved woman were inadequate,\u201d Minato said. \u201cWe are very sorry to have destroyed our credibility.\u201d",
      "Minato said the case violated the woman's human rights, without providing details on grounds of privacy. He said it was handled as an \u201cextraordinary\u201d case requiring maximum confidentiality and sensitivity for the woman's mental health and was shared by a small group of officials. The company had continued allowing Nakai to appear on Fuji shows for a year and six months, he said, but denied covering up the case because it involved a big star.",
      "Minato said he did not think what happened was sexual assault and that the case was not reported to the company\u2019s compliance office until the magazine report came out",
      "He also denied a Fuji TV employee\u2019s involvement but said allegations that the employee had previously organized barbecue and other parties for Nakai needed to be investigated.",
      "Fuji officials also acknowledged that female announcers and other female employees have in the past participated at parties for stars, talent agency executives and sponsors, though they denied any sexual services. Minato said he believed top officials were complacent about the outdated gender roles and they now need to \u201cupdate their mindset.\u201d",
      "Nakai last Thursday announced his retirement from the show business, which has already been hit by a series of sexual assault allegations in recent years in what is seen as a delayed #MeToo movement that began in Western nations in the 2010s. He said he was taking responsibility for the \u201ctrouble\u201d and massive business losses as a result. He had earlier denied any violence or involvement of a third party.",
      "Minato said he last saw the victim last summer when she visited his office to tell him she was quitting.",
      "Shukan Bunshun weekly, one of the magazines that exposed the scandal, also alleged that Fuji TV has long exploited its female announcers to entertain stars like Nakai.",
      "The chair of the companies, Shuji Kanoh, was also resigning in a decision made at a board meeting prior to the news conference, officials said.",
      "Japan\u2019s entertainment industry is in the midst of a wave of sexual assault cases, including the abuses of hundreds of boys and young men by late talent mogul Johnny Kitagawa, whose now-defunct agency Johnny & Associates managed many boy bands, including the one to which Nakai belonged, SMAP.",
      "Following massive protests and criticism from even their own employees, Fuji TV and its parent company announced after a board meeting last week that they have set up an independent panel of lawyers to be submitted by March."

      "HONG KONG -- Manufacturing slowed in China in January for the first time in four months as workers began leaving assembly lines to travel to their hometowns for Lunar New Year holidays.",
      "The National Bureau of Statistics said its purchasing managers index, based on a survey of factory managers, slipped to 49.1 in January from 50.1 the month before. A PMI reading above 50 indicates expansion. Under 50 signals a contraction in activity.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Skyscraper-studded Dubai has been on a hot streak for the last five years \u2014 and some residents are starting to feel burned.",
      "The city-state has seen record-breaking real estate transactions and as more and more people come to live there, and its state-owned airline Emirates is booking record earnings. But all that growth comes with strains for the city's population.",
      "Traffic feels worse than ever on Dubai's roads. The price of housing continues to spike even with new real estate projects being announced almost daily. Caught in the middle are both its Emirati citizens and the vast population of foreigners who power its economy \u2014 sparking rare public expressions of concern.",
      "\u201cDubai is on steroids but affordability risks are increasing,\u201d warned Hasnain Malik in a starkly titled report he wrote for the global data firm Tellimer, where he's a managing director.",
      "Under Dubai's current plans, the city aims to have 5.8 million residents by 2040, adding more than half its current estimated population in just 15 years. Since 1980, its population has already soared from around 255,000 to around 3.8 million.",
      "Real estate lit the fire in Dubai's growth in 2002, when the desert sheikdom began allowing foreigners to own property. After sharp falls during both the 2008-2009 financial crisis and Dubai's brief coronavirus lockdown, prices have been soaring.",
      "Today, average prices per square foot are at all-time highs, according to Property Monitor. Rental prices increased as much as 20% in key neighborhoods last year, with further rises likely this year, with some residents moving to communities further out in the desert, the real estate firm Engel & V\u00f6lkers said.",
      "Even before the boom, some people who worked in Dubai chose to live in the neighboring emirate of Sharjah, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the city's downtown, or further away. Some 1 million commuters from other emirates jam the 12-lane Sheikh Zayed Road that runs through the center of the city and other highways every day, as studies suggest that as many as four out of five employees drive to work alone.",
      "That traffic has only intensified with Dubai's new arrivals.",
      "While the rest of the world saw as much as a 4% increase in the number of registered vehicles in the last two years, the city's Road and Transportation Authority says there's been a 10% increase in the number of vehicles.",
      "So many vehicles have been registered that the city has had to make license plates longer.",
      "And while the city keeps building new flyovers and other road improvements, more cars are coming from more directions than ever before.",
      "\u201cDubai is very attractive, more and more people are coming,\u201d said Thomas Edelmann, the founder and managing director of RoadSafetyUAE, which advocates about traffic issues. \u201cI think it\u2019s easier to get people quickly to come to Dubai and to convince them about Dubai, then to build a new intersection or a new highway.\u201d",
      "Congestion has got so bad that it's driving even prominent Emiratis to break their customary silence on public affairs.",
      "Habib Al Mulla, a prominent Emirati lawyer, wrote on the social platform X in December that while authorities were working on congestion, the problem demanded \u201ca set of immediate and long-term mechanisms.\u201d He followed up by publishing an opinion piece twice mentioning \u201ccongestion\u201d as being among \u201cpressing issues\" for global cities like Dubai.",
      "While phrased in mild language, Al Mulla\u2019s comments represented rare public criticism in the United Arab Emirates, where speech is tightly controlled by criminal law and social norms favor raising issues at a \u201cmajlis\u201d \u2014 a semiprivate setting convened by a traditional ruler.",
      "\u201cThe concentration of wealth and opportunities created in global cities may cause income inequality that pushes out lower-income residents,\u201d Al Mulla warned in the English-language Khaleej Times newspaper on Jan. 15.",
      "\u201cThe problem becomes acute when the wealth and opportunities remain inaccessible to segments of the national population who witness the city\u2019s allure being seized by outsiders. This may carry significant social risks, if not mitigated.\u201d",
      "Then there's demographic concerns as the Emirati share of the population dwindles. While the number of citizens isn't public, a back-of-the-envelope, informal calculation shared for years by experts suggests Emirati citizens represent around 10% of the country's overall population of more than 9 million people, a number that's likely falling as foreigners rush in.",
      "In December, sermon scripts issued for the Dec. 13 Friday's prayers directly touched on the duty of having more children.",
      "\u201cIncreasing offspring is both a religious obligation and a national responsibility, as it contributes to the protection and sustainability of nations,\u201d the sermon read, according to a transcript issued by the federal government's General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments.",
      "For Dubai's autocratic government, overseen by ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, possible solutions to the grinding traffic have ranged from the practical to the fanciful. The government in recent months has repeatedly encouraged companies to allow more remote work options, including in a report released in November that also suggested staggered and flexible working hours.",
      "Adding as many as five remote workdays a month, along with the other steps, \u201ccan reduce morning peak travel time across Dubai by 30%,\u201d the study stated.",
      "Dubai's road toll system, known as Salik, has added gates to charge drivers more and will institute surge pricing at the end of the month. Dubai's Metro, which boasts the world's longest self-driving rail line, will also grow beyond its broadly north-south routes in a nearly $5 billion expansion.",
      "Then there's the flying taxi project. Since 2017, Dubai has been announcing plans for airborne cabs in the city. A first \u201cvertiport\u201d is being built by Dubai International Airport with the aim of offering the service from next year.",
      "Dubai also plans 3,300 kilometers (2,050 miles) of new pedestrian paths, although during Dubai's summer months pedestrians have to contend with high humidity and heat of around 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "\u201cIn the coming years, residents of Dubai will be able to move around by walking, cycling, its extensive network of roads and bridges, the Metro and its new lines, water taxis, or flying taxis on specific air routes,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed said on X in December.",
      "But for now, Dubai keeps attracting more people and more cars \u2014 and the traffic jams only get longer."

      "The proposal, submitted last week, is a revision of a prior plan the artificial intelligence startup had presented to TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance on Jan. 18, a day before the law that bans TikTok went into effect.",
      "The first proposal, which ByteDance hasn't responded to, sought to create a new structure that would merge San Francisco-based Perplexity with TikTok\u2019s U.S. business and include investments from other investors.",
      "The new proposal would allow the U.S. government to own up to half of that new structure once it makes an initial public offering of at least $300 billion, said the person, who was not authorized to speak about the proposal. The person said Perplexity\u2019s proposal was revised based off of feedback from the Trump administration.",
      "If the plan is successful, the shares owned by the government would not have voting power, the person said. The government also would not get a seat on the new company\u2019s board.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not immediately responded to a request for comment.",
      "Under the plan, ByteDance would not have to completely cut ties with TikTok, a favorable outcome for its investors. But it would have to allow a \u201cfull U.S. board control,\u201d the person said.",
      "Under the proposal, the China-based tech company would contribute TikTok\u2019s U.S. business without the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app, according to a document seen by the Associated Press. In exchange, ByteDance's existing investors will get equity in the new structure that emerges.",
      "The proposal seems to mirror a strategy Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary during Trump\u2019s first term, discussed Sunday on Fox News\u2019 Sunday Morning Futures \u2014 that a new investor in TikTok could simply \u201cdilute down\u201d the Chinese ownership and satisfy the law. Mnuchin has previously expressed interest in investing in the company.",
      "\u201cBut the technology needs to be disconnected from China,\u201d he added. \u201cIt needs to be disconnected from ByteDance. There\u2019s absolutely no way that China would ever let us have something like that in China.\u201d",
      "The Perplexity proposal comes as several investors are expressing interest in TikTok. President Donald Trump said late Saturday that he expects a deal will be made in as soon as 30 days.",
      "On a flight from Las Vegas to Miami on Air Force One, Trump also said he hadn't discussed a deal with Larry Ellison, CEO of software maker Oracle, despite a report that Oracle, along with outside investors, was considering taking over TikTok's global operation.",
      "\u201cNumerous people are talking to me. Very substantial people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary. ... I\u2019d only do it if the United States benefits.\u201d",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, TikTok was to be banned in the United States by Jan. 19 if it did not cut ties with ByteDance. The Supreme Court upheld the law, but Trump then issued an executive order to halt enforcement of the law for 75 days.",
      "Trump, on Air Force One, noted that Ellison lives \u201cright down the road\u201d from his Mar-a-Lago estate, but added, \u201cI never spoke to Larry about TikTok. I\u2019ve spoken to many people about TikTok and there\u2019s great interest in TikTok.\u201d",
      "TikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. a week ago, but went back online after Trump said he would postpone the ban. Trump had unsuccessfully attempted a U.S. ban of the platform during his first term. But he has since reversed his position and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters during last year\u2019s presidential election.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Trump's inauguration Jan. 20, along with some other tech leaders who've been forging friendlier ties with the new administration.",
      "Congress voted to ban TikTok in the U.S. out of concern that TikTok's ownership structure represented a security risk. The Biden administration argued in court for months that it was too much of a risk to allow a Chinese company to control the algorithm that fuels what people see on the app. Officials also raised concerns about user data collected on the platform.",
      "However, to date, the U.S. hasn't provided public evidence of TikTok handing user data to Chinese authorities or allowing them to tinker with its algorithm.",

      "The White House is claiming victory in a showdown with Colombia over accepting flights of deported migrants from the U.S., hours after President Donald Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports and other sanctions on the longtime U.S. partner",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- The White House claimed victory in a showdown with Colombia over accepting flights of deported migrants from the U.S. on Sunday, hours after President Donald Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports and other sanctions on the longtime U.S. partner.",
      "Long close partners in anti-narcotics efforts, the U.S. and Colombia clashed Sunday over the deportation of migrants and imposed tariffs on each other\u2019s goods in a show of what other countries could face if they intervene in the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration. The White House held up the episode as a warning to other nations who might seek to impede his plans.",
      "Earlier, the U.S. president had ordered visa restrictions, 25% tariffs on all Colombian incoming goods, which would be raised to 50% in one week, and other retaliatory measures sparked by President Gustavo Petro's decision to reject two Colombia-bound U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants after Petro accused Trump of not treating immigrants with dignity during deportation. Petro also announced a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "Trump said the measures were necessary because Petro\u2019s decision \u201cjeopardized\u201d national security in the U.S. by blocking the deportation flights.",
      "\u201cThese measures are just the beginning,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \u201cWe will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States.\u201d",
      "Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a late Sunday statement that the \u201cGovernment of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump\u2019s terms, including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay.\u201d",
      "Leavitt said the tariff orders will be \u201cheld in reserve, and not signed.\" But Leavitt said Trump would maintain visa restrictions on Colombian officials and enhanced customs inspections of goods from the country, \u201cuntil the first planeload of Colombian deportees is successfully returned.\u201d",
      "The Colombian government late Sunday said it considered as \u201covercome\u201d the episode with the Trump administration and Petro reposted the statement from the White House on X.",
      "\u201cWe have overcome the impasse with the United States government,\u201d said Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo. \u201cWe will continue to receive Colombians who return as deportees, guaranteeing them decent conditions as citizens subject to rights.\u201d",
      "Murillo added that the South American country\u2019s presidential aircraft is available to facilitate the return of migrants who were to arrive hours earlier on the U.S. military airplanes.",
      "Earlier Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he was authorizing the visa restrictions on Colombian government officials and their families \u201cwho were responsible for the interference of U.S. repatriation flight operations.\" They were being imposed on top of the State Department's move to suspend the processing of visas at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia\u2019s capital, Bogota.",
      "Petro had said earlier that his government would not accept flights carrying migrants deported from the U.S. until the Trump administration creates a protocol that treats them with \u201cdignity.\u201d Petro made the announcement in two X posts, one of which included a news video of migrants reportedly deported to Brazil walking on a tarmac with restraints on their hands and feet.",
      "\u201cA migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves,\u201d Petro said. \u201cThat is why I returned the U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants... In civilian planes, without being treated like criminals, we will receive our fellow citizens.\"",
      "After Trump's earlier tariff threat, Petro said in a post on X that he had ordered the \u201cforeign trade minister to raise import tariffs from the U.S. by 25%.\u201d",
      "Colombia has traditionally been the U.S.\u2019s top ally in Latin America. But their relationship has strained since Petro, a former guerrilla, became Colombia\u2019s first leftist president in 2022 and sought distance from the U.S.",
      "Colombia accepted 475 deportation flights from the U.S. from 2020 to 2024, fifth behind Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and El Salvador, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data. It accepted 124 deportation flights in 2024.",
      "Colombia is also among the countries that last year began accepting U.S.-funded deportation flights from Panama.",
      "The U.S. government didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press regarding aircraft and protocols used in deportations to Colombia.",
      "\u201cThis is a clear message we are sending that countries have an obligation to accept repatriation flights,\" a senior administration official told AP. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss issue publicly.",
      "Rubio in a statement said Petro \u201ccanceled his authorization\u201d for the flights when the aircraft were in the air.",
      "Colombians emerged in recent years as a major presence on the U.S. border with Mexico, aided in part by a visa regime that allows them to easily fly to Mexico and avoid trekking though the treacherous Darien Gap. They ranked fourth with 127,604 arrests for illegal crossings during a 12-month period through September, behind Mexicans, Guatemalans and Venezuelans.",
      "Mexico hasn't imposed visa restrictions on Colombians, as they have on Venezuelans, Ecuadoreans and Peruvians.",
      "Petro's government in a statement later announced that the South American country's presidential aircraft had been made available to facilitate the return of migrants who were to arrive hours earlier on the U.S. military airplanes and guarantee them \u201cdignified conditions.\"",
      "As part of a flurry of actions to make good on Trump's campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration, his government is using active-duty military to help secure the border and carry out deportations.",
      "Two U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo planes carrying migrants removed from the U.S. touched down early Friday in Guatemala. That same day, Honduras received two deportation flights carrying a total of 193 people.",
      "Colombia is the U.S.\u2019s fourth-largest overseas supplier of crude oil, shipping about 209,000 barrels of oil per day last year, although booming domestic production has reduced the U.S.\u2019 dependence on foreign oil. The South American country is also the U.S.\u2019s largest supplier of fresh cut flowers.",

    "story": [
      "Inflation was a driving force behind Donald Trump's election victory, but he's put the issue on the back burner during his first week in office",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two months ago, in his first network television interview after the election, Donald Trump said he owed his victory to Americans' anger over immigration and inflation, specifically the rising cost of groceries.",
      "\u201cWhen you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press. \u201cAnd I won an election based on that. We\u2019re going to bring those prices way down.\u201d",
      "But in Trump's first week back in the White House, there was little in his initial blitz of executive orders that directly tackled those prices, besides directing federal agencies to start \u201cpursuing appropriate actions.\u201d He is taking steps to lower energy costs, something that Trump hopes will have ripple effects throughout the economy. Otherwise, his focus has been clamping down on immigration, which he described as his \u201cNo. 1 issue\u201d shortly after taking the oath of office.",
      "\u201cThey all said inflation was the No. 1 issue. I said, \u2018I disagree,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cI talked about inflation too, but how many times can you say that an apple has doubled in cost?\u201d",
      "Trump is banking on voters giving him a pass and continuing to blame former President Joe Biden for high prices. The Republican's comments reflect the reality that presidents have almost no levers to reduce inflation quickly without causing collateral damage to other parts of the economy.",
      "There is more that Trump can do on energy. He is pushing to reduce regulations and increase the amount of land available for drilling. He is trying to persuade domestic and foreign oil producers to potentially sacrifice their own profits by pumping more.",
      "During a rally Saturday in Las Vegas, Trump went after his Democratic predecessor for allowing prices to rise under his watch, and promised to take care of the problem quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen I think of Biden, I think of incompetence and inflation,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Inflation peaked at a 9.1% annual rate in June 2022 during worldwide supply chain problems after the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. Overall consumer prices have fallen since then, but have ticked up in recent months, from 2.4% in September to 2.9% in December, the latest figures available. Economists have warned that Trump's plans for tariffs and tax cuts could create new inflationary pressures and keep interest rates elevated.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, in an interview with CBS' \u201cFace the Nation\u201d airing Sunday, defended the White House's work so far.",
      "\u201cPrices are going to come down, but it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time, right?\u201d he said. He added, \u201cRome wasn't built in a day.\u201d",
      "Trump's relative shift away from addressing costs could create an opening for Democrats to say he is not helping working-class voters, hoping that argument could offer the party a path back to power in Washington.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Trump preferred to distract people from inflation with talk of adding Greenland to the United States or seizing the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s catnip and it causes everybody to stop paying attention to their actual economic agenda, which has nothing to do with lowering costs and everything to do with rigging the economy to help the Mar-a-Lago crowd,\u201d he said.",
      "During an interview on Fox News this past week, host Sean Hannity struggled to get Trump to focus on the economy.",
      "\"Let me get to the economy,\u201d Hannity said at one point. \u201cI\u2019m running out of time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe economy is going to do great,\u201d Trump insisted.",
      "When Trump did talk about inflation in the interview, he noted how low it was during his first term and insisted prices would not have jumped up if he had president after the 2020 election, even though higher inflation was a global trend coming out of the pandemic.",
      "It is not clear how Trump would persuade oil companies and foreign countries to quickly increase production, possibly costing them profits.",
      "The Energy Information Administration reported that domestic oil production has grown at an annual rate of roughly 8.4% over the past two years to an average of nearly 13.5 million barrels a day in October. Some Trump aides suggest that could increase by an additional 3 million barrels a day.",
      "It would be difficult to achieve that much additional production in a single year without serious changes to the global market. The International Energy Agency estimates that the oil supplied to the entire world will increase by 1.8 million barrels per day to 104.7 million barrels a day. He also has expressed opposition to climate-friendlier wind and solar energy, putting more pressure on the U.S. economy to rely on fossil fuels.",
      "EJ Antoni, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, said the potential increase in energy production under Trump would ultimately flow through the economy in the form of lower prices.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to bring down the cost of energy, you\u2019re going to bring down the cost of all kinds of goods and services,\" he said.",
      "But there is a risk that some of Trump's plans taken as a whole could raise \u2014 not reduce \u2014 prices. Deporting migrants who are in the United States illegally could deprive companies of lower wage workers. The cost of tariffs, which are taxes placed on foreign imports, could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Trump said that his strategy also might ultimately involve publicly pressuring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, saying in Davos that he would \u201cdemand\u201d lower rates from central banks. The Fed sees its political independence as key for making tough choices to stabilize prices. Biden saw the independence as worth protecting, whereas Trump sees it as problematic.",
      "The Fed raised its benchmark rates starting in 2022 to make it more expensive to borrow and succeeded enough in reducing inflationary pressures that it could trim rates late last year. Trump believes that greater oil production will put him in a position to tell the Fed what to do.",
      "Asked in the Oval Office if he expects the Fed to listen to him, Trump simply said, \u201cYeah.\u201d",

      "Hermes illuminated a gloomy Paris afternoon with its fall 2025 men\u2019s collection, as Veronique Nichanian turned to the racetrack for inspiration",
      "PARIS -- Hermes illuminated a gloomy Paris afternoon with its fall men\u2019s collection Saturday, as Veronique Nichanian turned to the racetrack for inspiration. Jockeys\u2019 vibrant racing silks became her muse, a dynamic counterpoint to the French maison\u2019s storied equestrian roots. \u201cI wanted this collection to be strong and energetic,\u201d Nichanian explained, her palette pivoting from deep browns and dark teals to flashes of tomato red and lemon yellow.",
      "The collection radiated warmth, both in spirit and texture. Fuzzy mohair coats, velvet varsity jackets and plush sheepskin outerwear wrapped models in an embrace that seemed designed to counter winter\u2019s chill. Layering was less pronounced this season, a deliberate move to retain sleek, streamlined silhouettes. Even gray pinstripe suits \u2014 pared back to essentials \u2014 eschewed bulk, echoing Nichanian\u2019s vision of men unencumbered as they race through life.",
      "Sweaters emerged as the collection\u2019s unsung heroes. Their bold chevrons and geometric patterns were lifted directly from the vibrant stripes of racing silks, a playful nod to Palais d\u2019I\u00e9na\u2019s soaring, angular architecture. A standout turtleneck, with its patchwork of triangles, rectangles, and squares in canary yellow, seemed to channel a nostalgic love for trigonometry. Elsewhere, a jacket with a shawl collar mirrored the same graphical bravado, rendered in cool tones of blue, black and white.",
      "Though grounded in classic tailoring, the collection celebrated irreverence. Nichanian\u2019s juxtaposition of tradition and innovation captured Herm\u00e8s\u2019 ethos with a quiet confidence. Here, functionality was imbued with a touch of whimsy, proving once again that the maison\u2019s refinement can still surprise and delight. In a season steeped in nostalgia and geometry, Herm\u00e8s delivered a collection that was, quite literally, off to the races."

      "Discount store chain Target says it\u2019s joining rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back corporate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives",
      "NEW YORK -- Discount store chain Target said Friday that it would join rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that have come under attack from conservative activists and, as of this week, the White House.",
      "The Minneapolis-based retailer said the changes to its \u201cBelonging at the Bulleye\u201d strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.",
      "Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.",
      "The goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.",
      "In a memo to employees, Kiera Fernandez, Target\u2019s chief community impact and equity officer, as a \u201cnext chapter\u201d in a decades-long process to create \u201cinclusive work and guest environments that welcome all.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,\u201d Fernandez wrote in the memo, which Target shared Friday. \u201cAnd as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future.\u201d",
      "There's no doubt the U.S. civil rights landscape has undergone a massive transformation in the five years since much of corporate America adopted DEI goals in response to the Black Lives Matter protests that followed Floyd's death in Minneapolis.",
      "A 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions emboldened conservative groups to bring or threaten lawsuits targeting corporate initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "Walmart, McDonald\u2019s , Ford, Harley-Davison and John Deere are among the well-known consumer brands that reduced or phased out their DEI commitments in recent months.",
      "President Donald Trump this week signaled his administration's agreement with conservatives who argue that policies designed to increase minority representation by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation are unconstitutional.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending DEI programs across the federal government. The order calls for revoking all DEI mandates, policies, preferences and activities, along with the review and revision of existing employment practices, union contracts, and training policies or programs.",
      "Unlike some of the companies retooling or retiring their diversity initiatives, Target's work to build a more inclusive workforce predated 2020, and the company also was long seen as a trailblazer with respect to LGBTQ+ inclusion.",
      "But the employee memo shared Friday said Target no longer would participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they\u2019re connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.",
      "Getting corporations to withdraw from the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and to stop sponsoring Pride activities have been goals of DEI opponents.",
      "Steering clear of a backlash from conservative customers and organizations is something that Target has tried to navigate for a while. As transgender rights became a more prominent issue in 2016, the company declared that \u201cinclusivity is a core belief at Target\u201d and said it supported transgender employees and customers using whichever restroom or fitting room \u201ccorresponds with their gender identity.\u201d",
      "But after some customers threatened to boycott Target stores, the company said that more stores would make available a single-toilet bathroom with a door that could be locked.",
      "In 2023, Target removed some of its Pride Month merchandise after online complaints and in-store confrontations that the retailer said threatened employees\u2019 well-being. The company decided last year not to stock Pride Month products at every U.S. store.",
      "Still, some prominent companies have resisted public pressure to retreat from their diversity plans. On Thursday, Costco shareholders rejected a proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion practices.",
      "According to preliminary results shared by Costco executives, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal submitted by a conservative think tank based in Washington. Costco's board of directors had recommended a no vote.",

      "The aim of the law is to cut down on shell corporations and money laundering. But small business advocates say the reporting requirements are too onerous.",

      "Al-Baghdadi can\u2019t afford to hire workers or rent a bulldozer to clear the debris and fix the house. He makes just about enough money as a mechanic to feed his family. But he's desperate to rebuild it because he is struggling to pay skyrocketing rent for an apartment.",

      "Utah lawmakers have advanced a bill that experts say would establish one of the most restrictive labor laws in the country",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah lawmakers advanced a bill Thursday that experts say would establish one of the most restrictive labor laws in the country as Republicans seek to curb the political influence of unions serving teachers and other public service professionals.",
      "The GOP proposal would ban collective bargaining across all of Utah's public sectors \u2014 education, transit, law enforcement and more. It would bar labor unions from negotiating on behalf of workers for better wages and working conditions.",
      "Many educators, the state's most frequent users of collective bargaining, view the bill as way for Republicans to weaken teachers unions and clear a path for their own education agenda.",
      "\u201cThe harm of the bill will be borne by public school educators living and working in every single legislative district,\u201d said Sara Jones of the Utah Education Association. \u201cIt sends a message that educators don\u2019t deserve a collective voice in their profession, don\u2019t deserve input on their salaries or working conditions or benefits, or don\u2019t deserve a say in the policies that impact their classrooms.\u201d",
      "Teachers unions are some of the most outspoken opponents of Republican policies in Utah and other states where lawmakers have sought to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs, expand school choice vouchers and restrict transgender bathroom use and sports participation in schools.",
      "The unions tend to skew liberal, which Republicans argue makes them unfit to represent teachers with conservative political views.",
      "\u201cWe need all voices to be heard in the teaching profession, and not just those that align with the union and their political views,\u201d said Cole Kelley, a Republican on Utah\u2019s State Board of Education who teaches high school in American Fork.",
      "State Rep. Jordan Teuscher, a South Jordan Republican who is sponsoring the bill, said collective bargaining agreements often restrict workers from participating in their own contract negotiations, only allowing communication between the union representative and the employer. The bill creates a system in which employers can engage directly with all employees when addressing workplace concerns, he said.",
      "The measure passed the GOP-led House Business, Labor and Commerce Committee in a 11-4 vote with support from some of the state\u2019s most powerful Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Schultz.",
      "State employees could still join unions under the bill, but the unions could not formally negotiate on their behalf.",
      "President Donald Trump has backed policies making it harder for workers to unionize, yet his populist appeal helped Republicans make steady gains among union members in the 2024 election. Republicans have tried to bring some blue-collar workers into the fold, but largely from the private sector, said John Logan, a labor expert at San Francisco State University.",
      "\u201cRepublicans see teachers unions as the main obstacle to transforming public education the way they would like to,\u201d Logan told The Associated Press. \u201cThey want the working class on their side, but public sector unions, they don't have any use for them. Ideologically, they're just an obstacle.\u201d",
      "Logan said Utah's bill is \u201cfairly extreme\u201d and would place the state among the most restrictive for public sector unions, along with North Carolina and South Carolina.",
      "Collective bargaining has been banned for decades across all public sector jobs in the Carolinas. The two states have flip-flopped between having the lowest percentage of union workers in the country for the past two decades, with South Carolina currently in lowest spot at 3%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "In Texas and Georgia, only police and firefighters have the right to bargain. They could not do so under the Utah bill, which also faced opposition from firefighters who worried they would not be able to advocate for proper worker safety without union support."

      "The factory in the rural village of Ada, Ohio, makes the game balls used by every NFL team along with many of the nation\u2019s top college programs and high schools.",
      "But this time of year it's all about the Super Bowl. The Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will face off for the Lombardi Trophy for the second time in three years on Feb. 9 in New Orleans.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the footballs, by the numbers:",
      "The two teams will each get a shipment of 108, plus a dozen more for the kickers, all stamped with the Super Bowl logo and team names. Some of the balls will be for practices, while the best ones will be set aside by the quarterbacks. About 50 of those will be bagged and locked away for each team until it's time for kickoff.",
      "Wilson makes five different sizes for players of all levels, from the pros to youth leagues. Some have different patterns. NFL balls are notable for the lack of a stripe on the ends. They're also embedded with a chip that tracks the ball's position on the field, how far it travels and its trajectory.",
      "Normally it takes three days from start to finish. But the first batch of footballs must be sent to the Super Bowl teams Monday, within about 18 hours, so they have enough time to break them in for practices and the game. That's why the workers start production right away the night of the conference title games.",
      "It's a 20-step process, most of it by hand, from cutting out the four leather panels that are sewn together with 250 stitches to putting in the laces. For NFL footballs, the work goes to the factory's most experienced and skilled workers. \u201cCertain parts of the process require a handmade feel,\u201d said Kevin Murphy, general manager of Wilson Team Sports. \u201cIt's like making a beautiful, sculpted pair of shoes.\u201d",
      "Throughout production the balls are weighed, measured and inspected for flaws. Once finished, they're checked again. By the time they're packaged and ready for shipping, each one will have been touched by about 50 workers.",
      "It churns out roughly 500,000 footballs each year, or about 2,500 per day. NFL teams go through several hundred during a season. For the Super Bowl, Wilson will make between 10,000-20,000 commemorative balls that will be sold by retailers nationwide and at the game site. If there's high demand, the factory will keep producing the souvenir balls well after.",
      "Since 1941, Wilson has made every football used by the league. Its factory in Ada has been making the official game balls since 1955. This year the company opened a new plant in the village that allows for more production and a museum. Fans can tour the factory, too."

      "Five years after NBA great Kobe Bryant, 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash in California, several women\u2019s basketball players reflected on what he meant to their game and how he championed it",
      "Dearica Hamby still smiles at the memory of Kobe Bryant sitting courtside at WNBA games.",
      "She had met him years ago. He came to see her old team, the Las Vegas Aces, play all the time.",
      "\u201cI think one of the first things he told me was that I could play defense,\" Hamby recalled. \"And I was kind of like \u2018Wha-at?\u2019 ... That's something I'll cherish with me forever.\u201d",
      "That epitomized the late NBA great's relationship with the women's game. After his 20-year playing career ended, Bryant turned his focus to the next generation, mentoring some of women's basketball's biggest stars, from WNBA champion and Olympic gold medalist Diana Taurasi to former Oregon star Sabrina Ionescu.",
      "He worked out with them, analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of their game and pushed for them to reach the same heights in popularity that he and his NBA peers did.",
      "For Hamby, now with the Los Angeles Sparks, Bryant saw an aspect of her game she didn't even know she had.",
      "\u201cIf Kobe tells you you can play defense, you can play defense,\" she quipped.",
      "Five years after Bryant, 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, several women's basketball players reflected on what he meant to their game and how he championed it. Many of them thought Bryant would be pleased with the overall progress of women's sports, which have skyrocketed in popularity and reach in recent years.",
      "That growth has been most prominent in the women's basketball arenas that Bryant and Gianna loved so much.",
      "The WNBA last season had its most-watched regular season in 24 years and its best attendance in 22 seasons. Some of the league's most popular players currently are competing in a new 3-on-3 league in South Florida called Unrivaled, founded by Olympic gold medalists Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart.",
      "\u201cWe carry this on for him,\u201d said Satou Sabally, a forward with the WNBA's Dallas Wings who plays for the Phantom squad in Unrivaled. \u201cHe would be so proud of this league. He would be proud of \u2019Phe and Stewie. I know that he\u2019s looking down and hopefully he\u2019s smiling and is proud of us.\u201d",
      "Sabally said she still gets emotional when she thinks of that day on Jan. 26, 2020. It reminds her of her playing days at Oregon, when she, Ionescu and their Ducks teammates connected over Bryant.",
      "\u201cI think about ... how we all bonded together over Kobe and how we bonded together for the rest of our lives because he was so impactful,\u201d Sabally added. \u201cHe was really a person that saw us women as the talents who we are. He came to the games, he was so outspoken and he really was really supportive.\"",
      "The shock of the superstar's death echoed throughout the sports and entertainment worlds, with many taking to social media to post emotional tributes to Bryant while expressing their disbelief.",
      "People were glued to their phones and TV screens as news of the crash spread. NBA players were in tears ahead of games that day.",
      "\u201cI still remember exactly where I was whenever we heard the news,\" said Kate Martin of the Golden State Valkyries, playing for Laces BC at Unrivaled, \"and no one really knew if it was fake or real. I think that\u2019s just one of those things where you\u2019re just always going to remember exactly where you were when you heard that.\u201d",
      "Martin never met Bryant but said she cherishes his mentality \u2014 he had a relentless competitiveness \u2014 and the way he elevated women's sports.",
      "Bryant became heavily involved with his daughters' hoops journeys and coached Gianna's youth team. He was often at women's basketball games, especially college ones, with Gianna, who was fascinated with the UConn Huskies. Gianna was in line to further Bryant's legacy on the court. The plan was for her to attend Connecticut, and surely the WNBA was next.",
      "Bryant was passionate about women's sports despite the belief of some that he should not have been involved with the women\u2019s game at all because of a 2003 charge accusing him of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old employee at a Colorado resort.",
      "Bryant had said the two had consensual sex, and the charge was eventually dropped when the woman declined to testify at trial. The woman later filed a civil suit against Bryant that was settled out of court.",
      "There's an image that still circulates in the sports world today: Kobe and Gianna sitting courtside at a 2019 game featuring his Los Angeles Lakers. He wore a bright orange pullover with a white WNBA logo on the front. Gianna sat beaming at his side.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of people started to follow behind Kobe because he recognized our gift and our talent and how special it really is,\" said former Chicago Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon, the current coach of Unrivaled's Vinyl BC. \"And his daughter was right there as well.\u201d",
      "That's who Bryant had become \u2014 a face of women's sports advocacy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s greatly missed,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBut now his legacy will live on forever.\u201d",

      "Alexander Zverev says he is feeling down and emotional after once again coming within one win of earning his first Grand Slam title",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Alexander Zverev described himself as \u201cquite down\u201d and \u201cquite emotional\" after once again coming within one win of earning his first Grand Slam title.",
      "And unlike his first two defeats in major finals \u2014 both of which he led, and both of which went five sets \u2014 Zverev did not come close to reaching the finish line Sunday in the Australian Open final, which ended with defending champion Jannik Sinner holding the trophy after his 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can. I\u2019m working as hard as I ever did. I think I\u2019m doing all the right things off-court. I think I\u2019m practicing the right things. But I lost in straight sets today. I mean, those are facts. That is a fact. I lost to Jannik in straight sets today,\u201d said Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany who is ranked No. 2 but did not seem anywhere near No. 1 Sinner on this occasion.",
      "\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t want to end my career as the best player of all time to never win a Grand Slam, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Zverev, whose post-match speech was interrupted by someone in Rod Laver Arena calling out the names of two women who have accused him of physical abuse in the past.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll keep doing everything I can,\" Zverev said, \"to lift one of those trophies.\u201d",
      "He is the seventh man in the Open era, which dates to 1968, to start a career with an 0-3 record in title matches at one of the sport's four most important events.",
      "Five of the other six went on to win at least one major championship. The only member of the group who hasn't is Casper Ruud, who is also the only one still active.",
      "Sinner offered support to Zverev during the trophy ceremony Sunday. That came in the form of an arm around the shoulder \u2014 and with his words.",
      "\u201cKeep believing in yourself,\u201d Sinner told Zverev. \u201cKeep working hard, because we all believe that you can lift one of these very, very soon.\u201d",
      "Simone Vagnozzi, one of Sinner\u2019s coaches, said about Zverev: \u201cI really hope, sooner or later, he wins a Slam, because he deserves it.\u201d",
      "Zverev's previous trips to the brink of achieving what he very badly wants came at the 2020 U.S. Open, where he built a two-set lead and even held a match point against Dominic Thiem before faltering, and at the 2024 French Open, where he led Carlos Alcaraz two sets to one before letting that slip away.",
      "This one never got to that sort of stage, and Zverev frequently showed his frustration by cracking rackets",
      "The nearest Zverev came to really making it close was when he was two points from taking the second set. But Sinner took the next four points and that, basically, was that.",
      "\u201cThat was a massive point. I think whoever wins that set, kind of can get a little bit of momentum. Being down two sets to love, especially, then his confidence goes up, mine goes down. It\u2019s a long way back then against someone like Jannik,\u201d Zverev said. \u201cIf it\u2019s one set all, maybe I have a chance. But ... I didn\u2019t stop fighting. I didn\u2019t stop believing. Then, in the third set, I thought he outplayed me more than in the other sets.\u201d",

      "No reason to be anything but aggressive now, Keys thought. No reason to try to wish there weren't nerves accompanying the moment. No reason to worry \u2014 as the American long did along the journey from prodigy at age 12 to major champion less than a month before her 30th birthday \u2014 about what would happen if things didn\u2019t quite work out.",

That was really my goal for the day \u2014 to just be proud, no matter a win or a loss,\" Keys said in an interview with The Associated Press after winning her first Grand Slam title with a 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 victory over the No. 1-ranked Sabalenka in Rod Laver Arena.",

I didn\u2019t want to have any sort of regret that I was passive and I missed. (Then) it could have been something where I thought: \u2018I should have done something else,\u2019\u201d Keys said, her hands clasped as she recalled what transpired about two hours earlier. \u201cSo I kind of just kept saying that, over and over.\u201d",

To the team around her, including Bjorn Fratangelo, a former player who has been her partner for years, her coach since mid-2023 and her husband since November. To her therapist, with whom she spoke or texted frequently over the past two weeks. To her friends on tour who lifted her up when she needed it.",

      "She used to be concerned about never living up to the hype that accompanied her from before she was even a teen and only increased when she made her first appearance in a Grand Slam semifinal at Melbourne Park at age 19 (she lost to Serena Williams). She used to think nothing about her tennis career would matter if she never managed to claim a major trophy. She used to assume the sport's best never felt jitters like those hampering her during her first Grand Slam final at the U.S. Open at age 22 ( she lost to Sloane Stephens ).",
      "Eventually, Keys let all of that go. It was OK not to obsess over others' opinions. It was OK if she never won a Slam. It was OK to face the nerves, because, after all, that's how the greats succeed \u2014 they feel discomfort but play through it.",
      "\u201cI was nervous my entire career. So is Novak (Djokovic). So was Roger (Federer). Everybody has been,\u201d Fratangelo, a former player who looked on with reddened eyes as Keys accepted her trophy, said during the tournament. \u201cIt's just how you deal with it. And she's starting to deal with it in a better way.\u201d",
      "That was the case throughout her run, which featured five three-setters and four victories over top-10 seeds (No. 1 Sabalenka, No. 2 Iga Swiatek, No. 6 Elena Rybakina and No. 10 Danielle Collins ), including a trio of major champs (Sabalenka, Swiatek, Rybakina). No woman had defeated the top two players in the WTA rankings during one major since 2009.",
      "Swiatek used the word \u201cbrave\u201d to describe the ways Keys played while saving a match point before coming through in their final-set tiebreaker.",
      "\u201cTo do it that way,\u201d Keys said at her news conference, \u201cI think, really, I thought to myself after the match that I can absolutely win on Saturday.\u201d",
      "She was so good at the start and down the stretch against Sabalenka.",
      "From 5-all, 30-all, Keys claimed six of the last eight points. She hammered first-strike forehand winners on consecutive points to hold serve, then earned the lone break of the third set, closing it out with \u2014 fittingly \u2014 yet another forehand winner.",
      "\u201cIf she can play consistently like that, I mean, it\u2019s not much you can do,\u201d Sabalenka said.",
      "Keys was brave.",
      "She went for it.",
      "\u201cMy first semifinal here feels like it was forever ago. I mean, I honestly felt like I was a different person then. But I think that that kind of happens when so many things have happened throughout the past decade,\u201d Keys told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of all accumulated to get to the point where I was finally able to just go out and play some really good tennis and walk away with a Grand Slam.\u201d",

      "Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said vaccines are not safe. His support for abortion access has made conservatives uncomfortable. And farmers across the Midwest are nervous over his talk of banning corn syrup and pesticides from America's food supply.",
      "The 71-year-old, whose famous name and family tragedies have put him in the national spotlight since he was a child, has spent years airing his populist \u2014 and sometimes extreme \u2014 views in podcasts, TV interviews and speeches building his own quixotic brand.",
      "A son of a Democratic political dynasty, Kennedy is seeking to become the nation's top health official under President Donald Trump. To get there, he's softening those long-held beliefs, hoping to win approval from the Republican Party.",
      "At stake is Kennedy's control of the nation's sprawling $1.7 trillion U.S. Health and Human Services agency, which oversees food and hospital inspections, health insurance for roughly half of the country and vaccine recommendations. The job would finally give him the kind of political power Kennedys have wielded for decades.",
      "He made a long-shot bid for the presidency last year, following uncles John, who won the White House in 1960, and Edward, who lost his bid in 1980, along with his father, Robert, a leading contender who was assassinated after winning the California primary in 1968.",
      "With a strong resemblance to his father and lawyer credentials to match, he found ardent followers who embrace the critiques he's lodged against unhealthy foods, pharmaceutical companies and chemicals.",
      "But he couldn't get Democrats on his side, with some of his relatives shunning him over his vaccine views. His has been a flexible ideological journey, part liberal Democrat, part libertarian, and now, an adherent of the MAGA agenda after dropping out of the race last year to back Trump.",
      "The president has since directed him to \u201cgo wild\u201d on health. Together, they've even hatched a new slogan: \"Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "Kennedy's aspirations now rest with the Republican-controlled Senate, where he can lose only three GOP votes if all Democrats oppose him.",
      "As Kennedy's confirmation hearings approach this week, he faces a coordinated effort to stop his nomination. A television and digital ad campaign is highlighting his anti-vaccine work. And former Vice President Mike Pence, a stalwart of the conservative anti-abortion movement, is lobbying against him, too.",
      "Kennedy's closest supporters believe he'll prevail. He plans to focus on issues that have bipartisan consensus, like reducing food additives and increasing access to healthier foods. When concerns about his views on conservative priorities like abortion come up, he's promised to follow Trump's lead.",
      "Then there is Kennedy's biggest advantage \u2014 and maybe, too, his biggest liability for someone working under Trump \u2014 his star power.",
      "\u201cBobby K. is coming in with a bigger microphone than any HHS Secretary,\u201d said Calley Means, a close adviser to Kennedy.",
      "Kennedy's numerous remarks, anti-vaccine nonprofit and lawsuits against immunizations are likely to haunt him.",
      "He's rejected the anti-vaccine label, instead casting himself as a crusader for \u201cmedical freedom\u201d who wants more research. He and Trump have vowed not to \u201ctake away\u201d vaccines. To defuse criticism, he resigned from the Children\u2019s Health Defense, his nonprofit that has filed dozens of lawsuits against vaccines, including the government authorizations of some of them.",
      "But critics have argued that his work advocating against vaccine use has cost lives. Democrats are poised to home in on his social media campaigns and work in Samoa, the island nation in the Pacific Ocean where doctors say he and his anti-vaccine acolytes seized on a tragedy to campaign against childhood inoculations.",
      "In 2018, two Samoan children died from botched vaccinations, prompting the government to suspend the childhood vaccination program.",
      "Kennedy showed up with his wife, actor Cheryl Hines, to meet with the prime minister, health minister and other health officials in 2019. Kennedy says he promoted a \u201cmedical informatics system\u201d that would \"assess the efficacy and safety of every medical intervention or drug on overall health.\u201d",
      "Later that year, a measles epidemic killed dozens of infants and children.",
      "Democrat Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, an emergency room doctor who organized flights loaded with 50,000 vaccine doses, doctors and nurses to administer inoculations, has led the campaign to highlight Kennedy's role. He shared during one-on-one meetings with a handful of senators earlier this month what he witnessed there, including accounts from villagers who told them about Facebook posts that scared them away from vaccinations.",
      "\u201cHe went there and used celebrity status to scare the country away from vaccinating,\" Green said of Kennedy. \"You have to ask yourself, \u2018Why, RFK Jr., would you go to Samoa and do this to innocent people?\u2019\u201d",
      "Kennedy has denied playing any role in the outbreak.",
      "A Democratic group is running digital ads that accuse Kennedy of spreading misinformation in Samoa. The campaign is targeting senators in nine states, including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and John Curtis of Utah, which boasts a significant Samoan population.",
      "Another they're targeting is Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Senate committee, which holds a hearing Thursday. Cassidy, who is also a doctor, stopped short of endorsing Kennedy after they met and is seen as swayable.",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who suffered from polio as a child, may also be in play. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, McConnell dipped into his own campaign funds to urge Kentucky residents to vaccinate against the virus.",
      "Last month, McConnell sent a warning about attempts to discredit the polio vaccine.",
      "\u201cEfforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\u201d",
      "Other conservatives have question Kennedy's abortion views, after he said last year that it should be legal for full-term pregnancies. His campaign later clarified that he supports abortion rights until fetal viability, around 22 to 24 weeks.",
      "In meetings with some senators, he's promised to follow Trump's directive on the issue.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for example, said he was convinced after talking to Kennedy that he would be a strong anti-abortion advocate.",
      "But skepticism remains, with Pence's advocacy group highlighting his abortion views in an ad campaign.",
      "\u201cRFK Jr. has made certain overtures to pro-life leaders that he would be mindful of their concerns at HHS, there is little reason for confidence at this time,\" his group said in a letter sent to senators last week.",
      "In Iowa, Kennedy's nomination both excites and worries corn and soybean farmer Brian Fyre.",
      "The sixth-generation farmer and Republican thinks Kennedy will offer a fresh perspective, but he also can't afford the ban on corn syrup or pesticides that Kennedy has promised. If confirmed, Kennedy would oversee the Food and Drug Administration, which has the power to enact restrictions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d be pinched out. It would devastate rural, Midwest communities,\u201d Fyre said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a food supply for a nation. You can\u2019t upend that without a viable alternative.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said he planned to offer some \u201ceducating\u201d on agriculture to Kennedy.",
      "Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from a dairy farm state, sees it differently, telling a crowd at the Heritage Foundation last month that Kennedy's agriculture ideas are a promising part of a bigger goal: \u201cto Make America Healthy Again.\u201d"

      "The authorship of The Associated Press\u2019s renowned \u201cnapalm girl\u201d photograph is being called into question in the new documentary \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- After a half-century of public silence, a freelance photographer from Vietnam has asserted he took one of the most renowned and impactful photos of the 20th century \u2014 the image of a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack in South Vietnam that has long been credited to a staff photographer from The Associated Press.",
      "Nguyen Thanh Nghe claimed authorship of the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cnapalm girl\u201d photograph in the new documentary \u201cThe Stringer\u201d and on the sidelines of its premiere Saturday night at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.",
      "The AP conducted its own investigation and said it has no reason to conclude that anyone other than the long-credited photographer, Nick Ut, made the picture. The news agency said it was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d that filmmakers portrayed it as having reviewed the film\u2019s materials and being dismissive. The AP said it saw the film for the first time at Sundance.",
      "Nghe joined the filmmakers for the post-screening Q&A where he said, through a translator, \u201cI took the photo.\u201d The audience cheered enthusiastically. He did not say why he waited so long to make the claim.",
      "The AP said it was calling on the filmmakers to release their contributors from non-disclosure agreements for the film, including Nghe. It also called on the filmmakers to share a visual analysis they commissioned \u2014 and the film itself. \u201cWe cannot state more clearly that The Associated Press is only interested in the facts and a truthful history of this iconic photo,\" the agency said.",
      "Nguyen says he took the iconic photo of Kim Phuc on June 8, 1972. Nghe said he went to the town of Trang Bang that day as a driver for an NBC news crew and captured the image of Phuc running down the street, crying and naked with arms outstretched. He said he sold his image to the AP for $20, and they gave him a print of the photo that his wife later destroyed.",
      "Representatives for the AP, who saw the film for the first time Saturday at the premiere, are contesting the film's implication that the company reviewed their findings and dismissed them.",
      "\u201cAs recently as December, we reiterated our request to see the filmmakers\u2019 full materials and they did not respond, nor did they include AP\u2019s full response in the film,\" Lauren Easton, an AP spokesperson, said Sunday. \"We were surprised and disappointed that the film portrayed AP as having reviewed the film\u2019s materials and being dismissive of the allegations, which is completely false.\"",
      "The film\u2019s investigation was led by husband-and-wife team of Gary Knight, founder of the VII Foundation, and producer Fiona Turner. Bao Nguyen, a Vietnamese American filmmaker, directed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a journalist by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI had a healthy skepticism, as I think anyone would, going against a 53-year-old truth. ... But as a storyteller and a filmmaker, I thought it was my both or my responsibility and my privilege to be able to uplift the story of individuals like Nghe.\u201d",
      "Before having seen the film, the AP conducted its own investigation over six months and concluded it had \u201cno reason to believe anyone other than Ut took the photo.\u201d Now, the AP is calling on the filmmakers to lift the non-disclosure agreements they placed on their subjects to allow the company to investigate more fully.",
      "\u201cAP stands ready to review any and all evidence and new information about this photo,\" Easton said.",
      "Knight and Turner met with AP in London last June about the allegations. According to the AP, filmmakers requested the news organization sign a non-disclosure agreement before they provided their evidence. AP would not. The film suggests that evidence was presented to the AP, which the AP says is not true.",
      "A primary source in the film is Carl Robinson, then an AP photo editor in Saigon, who was overruled in his judgment not to use the picture by Horst Faas, AP's Saigon chief of photos. Robinson says in the film that Faas instructed him to \u201cmake it staff\u201d and credit Ut for the photo. Both Faas and Yuichi \u201cJackson\u201d Ishizaki, who developed the film, are dead. Robinson, 81, was dismissed by the AP in 1978.",
      "On Saturday, a Sundance Institute moderator asked why he wanted to come forward with the allegations now. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to die before this story came out,\u201d Robinson told the audience after the screening. \u201cI wanted to find (Nghe) and say sorry.\u201d",
      "A variety of witnesses interviewed by AP, including renowned correspondents such as Fox Butterfield and Peter Arnett and the photo\u2019s subject herself, Phuc, say they are certain Ut took the photo.",
      "Robinson was one such person the AP attempted to speak to during their investigation but \u201cwere told we could only do so under conditions\" that they said would have prevented them from \u201ctaking swift action if necessary.\u201d",
      "The film\u2019s investigation took over two years. The journalists enlisted a French forensics team, INDEX, to help determine the likelihood of whether Ut had been in a position to take the photo. The forensics team concluded that it was highly unlikely that Ut could have done it.",
      "Ut's attorney, James Hornstein, had this to say Sunday after the premiere: \u201cIn due course, we will proceed to right this wrong in a courtroom where Nick Ut\u2019s reputation will be vindicated.\u201d",
      "Knight referenced AP\u2019s investigation Saturday, telling the audience that the company's statement is available online. \u201cThey said they\u2019re open always to examining the truth. And I think it was a very reasonable thing to say,\u201d Knight said. \u201cOur story is here and it\u2019s here for you all to see.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThings happen in the field in the heat of the moment. ... We\u2019re all stronger if we examine ourselves, ask tough questions, and we\u2019re open and honest about what goes on in our profession. Now more than ever, I would argue.\"",
      "\u201cThe Stringer\u201d does not yet have distribution plans.",

      "The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic likely originated from a laboratory",
      "WASHINGTON -- The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic likely originated from a laboratory, according to an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even while acknowledging that the spy agency has \u201clow confidence\u201d in its own conclusion.",
      "The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA Director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of President Donald Trump's pick to lead the agency, John Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director.",
      "The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the agency's assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory.",
      "Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities.",
      "\u201cCIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,\u201d a spokesperson for the agency wrote in a statement about the agency's assessment.",
      "Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China's virology labs.",
      "Lawmakers have pressured America's spy agencies for more information about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths.",
      "While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "Some official investigations, however, have raised the the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago a report by the Department of Energy concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the finding.",
      "Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario.",
      "\u201cThe lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense,\u201d Ratcliffe said in 2023.",
      "The CIA \u201cwill continue to evaluate any available credible new intelligence reporting or open-source information that could change CIA\u2019s assessment,\u201d the agency spokesperson said."

      "Officials say they have recaptured the final four monkeys who escaped two months ago from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research",
      "YEMASSEE, S.C. -- Authorities in South Carolina said Friday the last four of 43 escaped monkeys have been recaptured after two months living in the woods, weathering a rare snowstorm and being temped back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.",
      "The rhesus macaque monkeys, all females, made a break for it after police say an employee did not fully lock their enclosure at Alpha Genesis, a facility that breeds them for medical research \u2014 known to locals as \u201cthe monkey farm.\u201d",
      "The recaptured monkeys appeared to be in good health, Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by Yemassee Police in a social media post, without further details.",
      "While they were on the loose, the area saw its first snow in seven years, accumulating up to 3 inches (8 centimeters).",
      "The rhesus macaques made a break for it on Nov. 6, and mostly hung around near the facility. They're about the size of a cat, weighing roughly 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "It appears a worker unintentionally left the gates unlocked when the monkeys escaped, Westergaard said in November. Workers were supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure.",
      "The monkeys posed no risk to public health, said Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police.",
      "Alpha Guard employees kept an eye on the monkeys and set out humane traps. Most were lured back with food and were given peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and \"monkey biscuits\" \u2014 a high-protein Purina Monkey Chow specially formulated for the rhesus macaques.",
      "The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers. Humans have been using the monkeys for scientific research since the late 1800s.

      "Looking for a quick fix for their fast-growing electricity diets, tech giants are increasingly looking to strike deals that would let them plug directly into power plants",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Looking for a quick fix for their fast-growing electricity diets, tech giants are increasingly looking to strike deals with power plant owners to plug in directly, avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.",
      "It's raising questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it's fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid. Federal regulators are trying to figure out what to do about it, and quickly.",
      "Front and center is the data center that Amazon\u2019s cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, is building next to the Susquehanna nuclear plant in eastern Pennsylvania.",
      "The arrangement between the plant's owners and AWS \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 is the first such to come before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. For now, FERC has rejected a deal that could eventually send 960 megawatts \u2014 about 40% of the plant's capacity \u2014 to the data center. That's enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "That leaves the deal and others that likely would follow in limbo. It's not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural ground, will take up the matter again or how the change in presidential administrations might affect things.",
      "\u201cThe companies, they\u2019re very frustrated because they have a business opportunity now that\u2019s really big,\u201d said Bill Green, the director of the MIT Energy Initiative. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re delayed five years in the queue, for example \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it would be five years, but years anyway \u2014 they might completely miss the business opportunity.\u201d",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "That's spurred proposals to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, develop small modular nuclear reactors and build utility-scale renewable installations or new natural gas plants. In December, California-based Oklo announced an agreement to provide 12 gigawatts to data center developer Switch from small nuclear reactors powered by nuclear waste.",
      "Federal officials say fast development of data centers is vital to the economy and national security, including to keep pace with China in the artificial intelligence race.",
      "For AWS, the deal with Susquehanna satisfies its need for reliable power that meets its internal requirements for sources that don't emit planet-warming greenhouse gases, like coal, oil or gas-fueled plants.",
      "Big Tech also wants to stand up their centers fast. But tech's voracious appetite for energy comes at a time when the power supply is already strained by efforts to shift away from planet-warming fossil fuels.",
      "They can build data centers in a couple years, said Aaron Tinjum of the Data Center Coalition. But in some areas, getting connected to the congested electricity grid can take four years, and sometimes much more, he said.",
      "Plugging directly into a power plant would take years off their development timelines.",
      "In theory, the AWS deal would let Susquehanna sell power for more than they get by selling into the grid. Talen Energy, Susquehanna\u2019s majority owner, projected the deal would bring as much as $140 million in electricity sales in 2028, though it didn't disclose exactly how much AWS will pay for the power.",
      "The profit potential is one that other nuclear plant operators, in particular, are embracing after years of financial distress and frustration with how they are paid in the broader electricity markets. Many say they have been forced to compete in some markets against a flood of cheap natural gas as well as state-subsidized solar and wind energy.",
      "Power plant owners also say the arrangement benefits the wider public, by bypassing the costly buildout of long power lines and leaving more transmission capacity on the grid for everyone else.",
      "A favorable ruling from FERC could open the door to many more huge data centers and other massive power users like hydrogen plants and bitcoin miners, analysts say.",
      "FERC\u2019s 2-1 rejection in November was procedural. Recent comments by commissioners suggest they weren't ready to decide how to regulate such a novel matter without more study.",
      "In the meantime, the agency is hearing arguments for and against the Susquehanna-AWS deal.",
      "Monitoring Analytics, the market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid, wrote in a filing to FERC that the impact would be \u201cextreme\u201d if the Susquehanna-AWS model were extended to all nuclear power plants in the territory.",
      "Energy prices would increase significantly and there's no explanation for how rising demand for power will be met even before big power plants drop out of the supply mix, it said.",
      "Separately, two electric utility owners \u2014 which make money in deregulated states from building out the grid and delivering power \u2014 have protested that the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement amounts to freeloading off a grid that ordinary customers pay to build and maintain. Chicago-based Exelon and Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power say the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement would allow AWS to avoid $140 million a year that it would otherwise owe.",
      "Susquehanna\u2019s owners say the data center won't be on the grid and question why it should have to pay to maintain it. But critics contend that the power plant itself is benefiting from taxpayer subsidies and ratepayer-subsidized services, and shouldn't be able to strike deals with private customers that could increase costs for others.",
      "FERC's decision will have \u201cmassive repercussions for the entire country\u201d because it will set a precedent for how FERC and grid operators will handle the waiting avalanche of similar requests from data center companies and nuclear plants, said Jackson Morris of the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Stacey Burbure, a vice president for American Electric Power, told FERC at a hearing in November that it needs to move quickly.",

      "Still circling Earth, Firefly Aerospace\u2019s lunar lander fired its thrusters Thursday to put it on a path to reach the moon in over a month. Dubbed Blue Ghost, the spacecraft beamed back photos and video of the Blue Marble, our planet. The Texas company released the images Friday.",

      "Google is pledging to crack down on fake online reviews with tougher punishments for rogue reviewers and businesses after an investigation by regulators in Britain",
      "LONDON -- Google pledged to crack down on fake online reviews with tougher punishments for rogue reviewers and businesses that try to profit from them, British regulators said Friday following an investigation.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority said that Google has committed to \u201crigorous steps\u201d to detect and remove sham reviews, so it can quickly identify and investigate businesses and reviewers trying to benefit from the phony posts.",
      "Google will delete all reviews written by people who repeatedly write fake or misleading reviews \u2014 either positive or negative \u2014 for U.K. businesses, the watchdog said. These reviewers will also be banned from posting new reviews, whether or not they're in the U.K.",
      "Businesses that try to artificially boost their star ratings will also face consequences. Warning alerts will be slapped on their Google profiles, and new reviews will not be allowed. And if they repeatedly engage in fake review activity, all their reviews for the past six months or more will be deleted, the CMA said.",
      "Google's also adding a way for consumers to quickly and easily report shady reviews, including payments or rewards offered for a positive review.",
      "\u201cThe changes we\u2019ve secured from Google ensure robust processes are in place, so people can have confidence in reviews and make the best possible choices,\u201d the watchdog's CEO Sarah Cardell said. \u201cThey also help to create a level-playing field for fair dealing firms.\u201d",
      "Google said its \u201clongstanding investments to combat fraudulent content help us block millions of fake reviews yearly \u2013 often before they ever get published.\" The company said in a brief statement that its \"work with regulators around the world, including the CMA, is part of our ongoing efforts to fight fake content and bad actors.\u201d",
      "A separate investigation into Amazon over fake reviews is ongoing, the watchdog said. It opened the probes in 2021 to examine whether the two companies broke U.K. consumer law by failing to protect shoppers. It began looking into phony reviews on some big websites amid the boom in online shopping fueled by the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Phony reviews have long plagued the internet. Some online travel and shopping platforms have banded together to fight fraudulent reviews. Authorities in the U.S. meanwhile have also been trying to crack down, with the Federal Trade Commission banning their sale or purchase and fining businesses and individuals who engage in the practice.",
      "Fake reviews are typically traded on private social media groups between fake review brokers and businesses willing to pay. Sometimes, such reviews are initiated by businesses that offer customers incentives such as gift cards for positive feedback.",

      "Seven families are suing TikTok in France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material",
      "CASSIS, France -- In the moment when her world shattered three years ago, Stephanie Mistre found her 15-year-old daughter, Marie, lifeless in the bedroom where she died by suicide.",
      "\u201cI went from light to darkness in a fraction of a second,\u201d Mistre said, describing the day in September 2021 that marked the start of her fight against TikTok, the Chinese-owned video app she blames for pushing her daughter toward despair.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org. Helplines outside the U.S. can be found at www.iasp.info/suicidalthoughts.",
      "___",
      "Delving into her daughter\u2019s phone after her death, Mistre discovered videos promoting suicide methods, tutorials and comments encouraging users to go beyond \u201cmere suicide attempts.\u201d She said TikTok\u2019s algorithm had repeatedly pushed such content to her daughter.",
      "\u201cIt was brainwashing,\u201d said Mistre, who lives in Cassis, near Marseille, in the south of France. \u201cThey normalized depression and self-harm, turning it into a twisted sense of belonging.\u201d",
      "Now Mistre and six other families are suing TikTok France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material. Out of the seven families, two experienced the loss of a child.",
      "Asked about the lawsuit, TikTok said its guidelines forbid any promotion of suicide and that it employs 40,000 trust and safety professionals worldwide \u2014 hundreds of which are French-speaking moderators \u2014 to remove dangerous posts. The company also said it refers users who search for suicide-related videos to mental health services.",
      "Before killing herself, Marie Le Tiec made several videos to explain her decision, citing various difficulties in her life, and quoted a song by the Louisiana-based emo rap group Suicideboys, who are popular on TikTok.",
      "Her mother also claims that her daughter was repeatedly bullied and harassed at school and online. In addition to the lawsuit, the 51-year-old mother and her husband have filed a complaint against five of Marie\u2019s classmates and her previous high school.",
      "Above all, Mistre blames TikTok, saying that putting the app \"in the hands of an empathetic and sensitive teenager who does not know what is real from what is not is like a ticking bomb.\u201d",
      "Scientists have not established a clear link between social media and mental health problems or psychological harm, said Gr\u00e9goire Borst, a professor of psychology and cognitive neuroscience at Paris-Cit\u00e9 University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to show clear cause and effect in this area,\u201d Borst said, citing a leading peer-reviewed study that found only 0.4% of the differences in teenagers\u2019 well-being could be attributed to social media use.",
      "Additionally, Borst pointed out that no current studies suggest TikTok is any more harmful than rival apps such as Snapchat, X, Facebook or Instagram.",
      "While most teens use social media without significant harm, the real risks, Borst said, lie with those already facing challenges such as bullying or family instability.",
      "\u201cWhen teenagers already feel bad about themselves and spend time exposed to distorted images or harmful social comparisons,\" it can worsen their mental state, Borst said.",
      "Lawyer Laure Boutron-Marmion, who represents the seven families suing TikTok, said their case is based on \u201cextensive evidence.\u201d The company \"can no longer hide behind the claim that it\u2019s not their responsibility because they don\u2019t create the content,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that TikTok\u2019s algorithm is designed to trap vulnerable users in cycles of despair for profit and seeks reparations for the families.",
      "\u201cTheir strategy is insidious,\u201d Mistre said. \u201cThey hook children into depressive content to keep them on the platform, turning them into lucrative re-engagement products.\u201d",
      "Boutron-Marmion noted that TikTok\u2019s Chinese version, Douyin, features much stricter content controls for young users. It includes a \u201cyouth mode\u201d mandatory for users under 14 that restricts screen time to 40 minutes a day and offers only approved content.",
      "\u201cIt proves they can moderate content when they choose to,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said. \u201cThe absence of these safeguards here is telling.\u201d",
      "A report titled \u201cChildren and Screens,\u201d commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron in April and to which Borst contributed, concluded that certain algorithmic features should be considered addictive and banned from any app in France. The report also called for restricting social media access for minors under 15 in France. Neither measure has been adopted.",
      "TikTok, which faced being shut down in the U.S. until President Donald Trump suspended a ban on it, has also come under scrutiny globally.",
      "The U.S. has seen similar legal efforts by parents. One lawsuit in Los Angeles County accuses Meta and its platforms Instagram and Facebook, as well as Snapchat and TikTok, of designing defective products that cause serious injuries. The lawsuit lists three teens who died by suicide. In another complaint, two tribal nations accuse major social media companies, including YouTube owner Alphabet, of contributing to high rates of suicide among Native youths.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to parents who had lost children while testifying last year in the U.S. Senate.",
      "In December, Australia enacted a groundbreaking law banning social media accounts for children under 16.",
      "In France, Boutron-Marmion expects TikTok Limited Technologies, the European Union subsidiary for ByteDance \u2014 the Chinese company that owns TikTok \u2014 to answer the allegations in the first quarter of 2025. Authorities will later decide whether and when a trial would take place.",
      "When contacted by The Associated Press, TikTok said it had not been notified about the French lawsuit, which was filed in November. It could take months for the French justice system to process the complaint and for authorities in Ireland \u2014 home to TikTok\u2019s European headquarters \u2014 to formally notify the company, Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "Instead, a Tiktok spokesperson highlighted company guidelines that prohibit content promoting suicide or self-harm.",
      "Critics argue that TikTok\u2019s claims of robust moderation fall short.",
      "Imran Ahmed, the CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, dismissed TikTok\u2019s assertion that over 98.8% of harmful videos had been flagged and removed between April and June.",
      "When asked about the blind spots of their moderation efforts, social media platforms claim that users are able to bypass detection by using ambiguous language or allusions that algorithms struggle to flag, Ahmed said.",
      "The term \u201calgospeak\u201d has been coined to describe techniques such as using zebra or armadillo emojis to talk about cutting yourself, or the Swiss flag emoji as an allusion to suicide.",
      "Such code words \"aren\u2019t particularly sophisticated,\u201d Ahmed said. \"The only reason TikTok can\u2019t find them when independent researchers, journalists and others can is because they\u2019re not looking hard enough,\u201d Ahmed said.",
      "Ahmed\u2019s organization conducted a study in 2022 simulating the experience of a 13-year-old girl on TikTok.",
      "\u201cWithin 2.5 minutes, the accounts were served self-harm content,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cBy eight minutes, they saw eating disorder content. On average, every 39 seconds, the algorithm pushed harmful material.\u201d",
      "The algorithm \u201cknows that eating disorder and self-harm content is especially addictive\u201d for young girls.",
      "For Mistre, the fight is deeply personal. Sitting in her daughter\u2019s room, where she has kept the decor untouched for the last three years, she said parents must know about the dangers of social media.",
      "Had she known about the content being sent to her daughter, she never would have allowed her on TikTok, she said. Her voice breaks as she describes Marie as a \u201csunny, funny\u201d teenager who dreamed of becoming a lawyer.",
      "\u201cIn memory of Marie, I will fight as long as I have the strength,\u201d she said. \u201cParents need to know the truth. We must confront these platforms and demand accountability.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk is clashing with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the Stargate artificial intelligence infrastructure project touted by President Donald Trump, the latest in a feud between the two tech billionaires that started on OpenAI's board and is now testing Musk's influence with the new president.",
      "Trump on Tuesday had talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion through a new partnership formed by OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, alongside Oracle and SoftBank.",
      "The new entity, Stargate, is already starting to build out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of fast-evolving AI technology.",
      "Trump declared it \u201ca resounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential\u201d under his new administration, with an initial private investment of $100 billion that could reach five times that sum.",
      "But Musk, a close Trump adviser who helped bankroll his campaign and now leads a government cost-cutting initiative, questioned the value of the investment hours later.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t actually have the money,\u201d Musk wrote on his social platform X. \u201cSoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\u201d",
      "Altman responded Wednesday to say Musk was \u201cwrong, as you surely know\u201d and inviting Musk to come visit the first site in Texas that is already under construction.",
      "\"(T)his is great for the country. i realize what is great for the country isn\u2019t always what\u2019s optimal for your companies, but in your new role i hope you\u2019ll mostly put (America) first,\u201d Altman wrote, using a U.S. flag emoji to represent America.",
      "The public clash over Stargate is part of a years-long dispute between Musk and Altman that began with a boardroom rivalry over who should run OpenAI, which both men helped found.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company last year alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.",
      "Musk has since escalated the dispute, adding new claims and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully. A hearing is set for February in a California federal court.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man, whose companies include Tesla, SpaceX and X, last year started his own rival AI company, xAI, that is building its own big data center in Memphis, Tennessee. Musk says it faces unfair competition from OpenAI and its close business partner Microsoft, which has supplied the huge computing resources needed to build AI systems such as ChatGPT.",
      "Tech news outlet The Information first reported on an OpenAI data center project called Stargate in March 2024, indicating that it's been in the works long before Trump announced it.",
      "Another company \u2014 Crusoe Energy Systems \u2014 announced in July it was building a large and \u201cspecially designed AI data center\u201d at the northwest edge of Abilene, Texas at a site run by energy technology company Lancium. Crusoe and Lancium said in a joint statement at the time that the project was \u201csupported by a multibillion-dollar investment\u201d but didn't disclose its backers.",
      "AI technology requires huge amounts of electricity to build and operate and both companies said the project would be powered with renewable sources such as nearby solar farms, in a way that Lancium CEO Michael McNamara said would \u201cdeliver the maximum amount of green energy at the lowest possible cost.\u201d Crusoe said it would own and develop the facility.",
      "It's not clear how and when that project became the first phase of the Stargate investment revealed by Trump. Abilene Mayor Weldon Hurt said construction began about nine months ago but \u201cwe didn\u2019t know it was going to be quite this big. We thought it was going to be about a third of this size.\u201d",
      "Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said Tuesday that the Abilene project is the first of about 10 data center buildings currently being built and that number could expand to 20.",
      "Hurt told The Associated Press that the region surrounding Abilene, a city of about 130,000 people, benefits from a wealth of energy sources, including oil, gas, solar and some of the \u201clargest wind farms in the world,\u201d though Trump signaled opposition to wind power this week by temporarily halting approval of wind projects on federal lands.",
      "\u201cWe have the capability to produce the energy for this market so it really means a lot for a town like Abilene,\u201d Hurt said. \u201cTo have this opportunity here in west-central Texas, to have something like this to make Abilene substantial, we\u2019re just excited about it.\u201d",
      "Missing from Trump's press conference Tuesday was Microsoft, which has long supported OpenAI with billions of dollars in investments and enabling its data centers to be used to build the models behind ChatGPT and other generative AI tools.",
      "Microsoft is also a technology partner in the Stargate project, along with chipmakers Nvidia and Arm, but put out a statement noting that its OpenAI partnership will \u201cevolve\u201d in a way that enables OpenAI \u201cto build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models.\u201d",
      "Asked about Musk's comments about the Stargate deal Wednesday during a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella pivoted to his company's own $80 billion plan to build out its global AI infrastructure, of which $50 billion is being spent in the U.S.",

      "Samsung is injecting another dose of artificial intelligence into the next version of its Galaxy smartphones, escalating an effort to simplify people\u2019s lives while deepening their dependence on a device that accompanies them almost everywhere",
      "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Samsung is injecting another dose of artificial intelligence into its next lineup of Galaxy smartphones, escalating an effort to simplify people\u2019s lives while deepening their dependence on a device that accompanies them almost everywhere.",
      "The three Galaxy S25 models unveiled Wednesday in San Jose, California, are the second generation to be designed for the AI age \u2014 a craze that market-leading Apple joined last September with the release of the iPhone 16. Most of the hardware on the Galaxy S25 is mostly the same as last year's model, except for a faster chip and a more powerful ultrawide lens on the camera.",
      "In its next phase, Samsung is positioning the Galaxy S25 as an \u201cAI companion\u201d capable of pulling more requests out of conversations, learning people\u2019s routines, anticipating people's needs and performing more technological tricks, such as being able to remove unwanted sounds from videos or identifying the name of a song upon request.",
      "The AI on the new Galaxy phones has been designed to toggle from one app to another to fetch, summarize and manage information, entertainment and other content stored on the devices. In an attempt to make the technology even more indispensable, the AI on Galaxy S25 will be able to create customized digital dossiers on users' behavior patterns and other unique characteristics that Samsung is calling a \u201cpersonal data engine.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverything you see here is the beginning of a new reality,\" said TM Roh, the Samsung executive who oversees its smartphones. \u201cThings that you thought you could never do, but now you can.\u201d",
      "As Apple has been doing with its AI features, Samsung is promising that its technology will shield users' privacy while also peering into their lives. Samsung is providing the protection primarily by keeping all the knowledge accrued by its AI technology on the Galaxy devices \u2014 within a digital fortress the company nicknamed after Fort Knox, the Kentucky Army base seated next to the U.S. government\u2019s depository for gold.",
      "After raising prices last year, Samsung is standing pat with the Galaxy S25 phones, with the standard model starting at $800, the Plus model at $1,000 and the Ultra model at $1,300. The phones are scheduled to be in stores starting Feb. 7.",
      "Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson thinks the Galaxy S25 models \u201cwill offer a more intuitive user experience with more integrated vocal and cross-app experiences, but AI is not yet a key reason to buy a new smartphone.\u201d",
      "Samsung is doubling down on its AI bet after getting a sales bump from the past year's emphasis on the technology. The South Korean company sold 32 million of its Galaxy S24 models from January through September last year, a 25% increase from the same time in the previous year, according to the research group Canalys.",
      "But Samsung didn\u2019t fare as well in the lower end of the smartphone market, where it was hurt by cheaper devices made by Chinese competitors. That\u2019s one of the reasons Samsung\u2019s total smartphone shipments fell by 1% last year, leaving it slightly behind Apple in the worldwide market, according to the research firm International Data Crop.",
      "As was the case with last year\u2019s models, the Galaxy S25 will draw heavily on AI technology made by Google, the maker of the free operating system Android that Samsung has long used for its smartphones.",
      "Some of the new AI tricks, such as the ability to deploy Google's \u201ccircle to search\u201d technology to quickly identify the song title of music playing in a video, will debut on the Galaxy S25 before coming to other Android phones later this year. Google also has been planting more AI on its own phone, the Pixel, but that device still lags far behind the iPhone and Galaxy.",

      "Researchers have captured such sounds in space before, but now they have sensed the chirping waves from much farther away: over 62,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) from Earth, where they've never been measured before.",
      "\u201cThat opens up a lot of new questions about the physics that could be possible in this area,\u201d said Allison Jaynes, a space physicist at the University of Iowa who was not involved with the work.",
      "Scientists still aren\u2019t sure how the perturbations happen, but they think Earth\u2019s magnetic field may have something to do with it.",
      "The chorus has been picked up on radio antennas for decades, including receivers at an Antarctica research station in the 1960s. And twin spacecraft \u2014 NASA's Van Allen Probes \u2014 heard the chirps from Earth's radiation belts at a closer distance than the newest detection.",
      "The latest notes were picked up by NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale satellites, launched in 2015 to explore the Earth and sun's magnetic fields. The new research was published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "Chorus waves have also been spotted near other planets including Jupiter and Saturn. They can even produce high-energy electrons capable of scrambling satellite communications.",
      "\u201cThey are one of the strongest and most significant waves in space,\u201d said study author Chengming Liu from Beihang University in an email.",
      "The newfound chorus waves were detected in a region where Earth's magnetic field is stretched out, which scientists didn't expect. That raises fresh questions about how these chirping waves form.",
      "\u201cIt's very captivating, very compelling,\u201d Jaynes said. \u201cWe definitely need to find more of these events.\u201d",

      "The site \u2014 currently https://www.whitehouse.gov/es/ \u2014 now gives users an \u201cError 404\u201d message. It also included a \u201cGo Home\u201d button that directed viewers to a page featuring a video montage of Trump in his first term and on the campaign trail. The button was later updated to read \u201cGo To Home Page\u201d.",
      "Hispanic advocacy groups and others expressed confusion at the abrupt change and frustration at what some called the administration\u2019s lack of efforts to maintain communication with the Latino community, which helped propel him to the presidency.",
      "The Spanish profile of the White House\u2019 X, @LaCasaBlanca and the government page on reproductive freedom also were disbanded. Meanwhile, the Spanish versions of other government agencies such as the Department of Labor, Justice and Agriculture remained available for users on Tuesday.",
      "Asked about the changes, White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields responded Tuesday that the administration is \u201ccommitted to bringing back online the Spanish translation section of the website.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s day two. We are in the process of developing, editing and tweaking the White House website. As part of this ongoing work, some of the archived content on the website went dormant. We are committed to reloading that content in a short timeline,\" he said without elaborating.",
      "Trump removed the Spanish version of the page in 2017. At that time, White House officials said they would reinstate it. President Joe Biden reinstated the page in 2021.",
      "The page's removal coincided with Trump\u2019s first-day wave of executive orders highlighted by the launch of an illegal immigration crackdown that was one of his key campaign pledges. Trump on Monday declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border and announced plans to send U.S. troops to help support immigration agents and restrict refugees and asylum.",
      "According to 2023 Census Bureau estimates, about 43.4 million Americans \u2014 13.7% of the U.S. population age 5 and older \u2014 speak Spanish at home. The U.S. has no official language.",
      "Monica Rivera, a brand and communications strategist in New York City of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent, said the shutdown sends a clear signal.",
      "\u201cThere are 43 million Latinos who speak Spanish as their first language and removing access to information directly from the White House draws a distinct line as to who they are serving and more dangerously, signals to the administration\u2019s MAGA base that we as Latinos are \u2018other\u2019 and a less significant part of this country,\" Rivera said.",
      "Anthony Hernandez, a paralegal in the nation's capital, wasn\u2019t initially aware of the move and said it suggests what the coming years of a second Trump presidency would look like, with specific issues making headlines while \u201cminor but equally malicious things like that go unnoticed.\u201d",
      "\u201cA move like shutting down the Spanish White House page and X profile serves no purpose other than to cut off resources for millions of Hispanic Americans and immigrants attempting to enter the United States legally,\" Hernandez said. \"And it\u2019s a slap in the face to the millions of Hispanic voters that supported him in this recent election.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, is Cuban American and speaks Spanish. At his swearing-in Tuesday, he gave remarks in Spanish, thanking God, his family and Trump.",
      "Meanwhile, Hispanic leaders and communication strategy experts expressed surprise with the page's removal, given Trump\u2019s popularity with certain Latino voters.",
      "\u201cIf the White House is seriously interested in engaging with Latinos, the second largest group in this country, then they need to make sure that updates can also be distributed in Spanish, a preferred language for millions in our community,\u201d said Frankie Miranda President and CEO of the Hispanic Federation.",

      "Kris Klein Hern\u00e1ndez, a U.S. historian specializing in race, gender, and sexuality at Connecticut College, said the content removal from official White House websites not only limits the access available to Spanish-speaking U.S. citizens and migrants but leads \"some to question which constituencies the administration prioritizes.\u201d",
      "Jeff Lee, former deputy cabinet secretary and deputy director of external and international affairs for former California Gov. Jerry Brown, said the move seems counterintuitive given the opportunity to \u201cshowcase\u201d policy changes, especially ones related to economics and border security.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see any other language mediums that got the kibosh. So I think that\u2019s a really interesting thing to single out \u2014 if that\u2019s the case,\" Lee said.",
      "AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters, found Trump won a larger share of Black and Latino voters than he did in 2020, and most notably among men under age 45. Young Latinos, particularly young Latino men, also were more open to Trump than in 2020. Roughly half of young Latino men voted for Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, compared with about 6 in 10 who went for Biden.",

      "President Donald Trump is talking up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Tuesday talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank.",
      "The new entity, Stargate, will start building out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of the fast-evolving AI in Texas, according to the White House. The initial investment is expected to be $100 billion and could reach five times that sum.",
      "\u201cIt's big money and high quality people,\u201d said Trump, adding that it's \u201ca resounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential\u201d under his new administration.",
      "Joining Trump fresh off his inauguration at the White House were Masayoshi Son of SoftBank, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Larry Ellison of Oracle. All three credited Trump for helping to make the project possible, even though building has already started and the project goes back to 2024.",
      "\u201cThis will be the most important project of this era,\" said Altman, CEO of OpenAI.",
      "Ellison noted that the data centers are already under construction with 10 being built so far. The chairman of Oracle suggested that the project was also tied to digital health records and would make it easier to treat diseases such as cancer by possibly developing a customized vaccine.",
      "\u201cThis is the beginning of golden age,\u201d said Son, referencing Trump's statement that the U.S. would be in a \u201cgolden age\u201d with him back in the White House.",
      "Son, a billionaire based in Japan, already committed in December to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years. He previously committed to $50 billion in new investments ahead of Trump's first term, which included a large stake in the troubled office-sharing company WeWork.",
      "While Trump has seized on similar announcements to show that his presidency is boosting the economy, there were already expectations of a massive buildout in data centers and electricity plants needed for the development of AI, which holds the promise of increasing productivity by automating work but also the risk of displacing jobs if poorly implemented.",
      "The initial plans for Stargate go back to the Biden administration. Tech news outlet The Information first reported on the project in March 2024. OpenAI has long relied on Microsoft data centers to build its AI systems, but it has increasingly signaled an interest in building its own data centers.",
      "OpenAI wrote in a letter to the Biden administration\u2019s Commerce Department last fall that planning and permitting for such projects \u201ccan be lengthy and complex, particularly for energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Other partners in the project include Microsoft, investor MGX and the chipmakers Arm and NVIDIA, according to separate statements by Oracle and OpenAI.",
      "The push to build data centers predates Trump's presidency. Last October, the financial company Blackstone estimated that the U.S. would see $1 trillion invested in data centers over five years, with another $1 trillion being committed internationally.",
      "Those estimates for investments suggest that much of the new capital will go through Stargate as OpenAI has established itself as a sector leader with the 2022 launch of its ChatGPT, a chatbot that captivated the public imagination with its ability to answer complex questions and perform basic business tasks.",
      "The White House has put an emphasis on making it easier to build out new electricity generation in anticipation of AI's expansion, knowing that the United States is in a competitive race against China to develop a technology increasingly being adopted by businesses.",
      "Still, the regulatory outlook for AI remains somewhat uncertain as Trump on Monday overturned the 2023 order signed by then-President Joe Biden to create safety standards and watermarking of AI-generated content, among other goals, in hopes of putting guardrails on the technology's possible risks to national security and economic well-being.",
      "CBS News first reported that Trump would be announcing the AI investment.",
      "Trump supporter Elon Musk, worth more than $400 billion, was an early investor in OpenAI but has since challenged its move to for-profit status and has started his own AI company, xAI. Musk is also in charge of the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d created formally on Monday by Trump with the goal of reducing government spending.",
      "Trump previously in January announced a $20 billion investment by DAMAC Properties in the United Arab Emirates to build data centers tied to AI.",

    "summary": "RFK Jr. played a lead role in building an case against Merck's HPV vaccine and could profit from the lawsuit alleging fraud, even if confirmed as health secretary.",
    "story": [
      "He says, if confirmed, he can still earn referral fees from a firm suing Merck.",
      "In 2020, as a pandemic raged across the globe, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took to social media to appeal to his hundreds of thousands of followers on Facebook.",
      "The son of the late U.S. Attorney General and New York Sen. Bobby Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy, the younger Kennedy said he was looking for parents whose children had been vaccinated against a different virus -- human papillomavirus or HPV -- and later grew sick.",
      "Public health researchers and doctors said there was no evidence that the vaccine, Gardasil, was linked to the health problems he cited, noting 160 favorable studies on safety. A federal court created to compensate people injured by vaccines also had already rejected a similar claim, citing \"insufficient proof\" that the vaccine was behind the plaintiff's health issues.",
      "But in his posts, Kennedy said that he and lawyer Michael Baum \u2013 \"one of my closest friends\" -- believed there was still a path forward. The families could sue the manufacturer Merck in civil court claiming marketing fraud \u2013 allegations Merck denies.",
      "\"If you have been injured by Gardasil, call us,\" Kennedy wrote on Facebook, posting a toll-free number invoking his famous initials \"RFK.\"",
      "According to financial disclosure documents released last week, Kennedy's primary source of income in the past year were large sums of referral fees from multiple law firms, including Baum's office, whose civil lawsuit against Merck's Gardasil vaccine went to trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court last week.",
      "Kennedy's leading role in building a case against Merck is now raising questions about how he might wield his power as the nation's next health secretary \u2013 a job intended as an impartial overseer in public health \u2013 while in line for potential payouts from a major pharmaceutical company.",
      "\"This disclosure shows that RFK Jr. made millions off of peddling dangerous anti-vaccine conspiracies,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which will oversee Kennedy's nomination.",
      "\"Even worse, if he is confirmed, his finances will still be tied to the outcomes of anti-vaccine lawsuits -- even as he'd be tasked with regulating them as health secretary. These are outrageous conflicts of interest that endanger public health,\" Warren said in a statement provided to reporters.",
      "Kennedy, who is expected to testify for the first time Wednesday before the Senate panel, said he has resigned his work with several law firms, including Wisner Baum, and that if confirmed he would not be involved in legal cases.",
      "But in a plan greenlit by federal ethics officials, Kennedy said he plans to retain his right to 10 percent of fees awarded in contingency cases with Wisner Baum so long as the cases don't involve the U.S. government. The federal government is not a party in the civil lawsuit against Merck.",
      "\"I am entitled to receive a portion of future recovery in these cases based upon the set percentage as set forth in the referral agreement,\" he wrote.",
      "Kennedy disclosed another $856,559 in income from Wisner Baum referral fees, although the documents do not say which legal cases were tied to those fees. Other income included $8.8 million from his firm Kennedy & Madonna. Kennedy said he was terminating his relationship with the firm, which would no longer use his name.",
      "A spokesperson for Kennedy declined to comment on the record on the Wisner Baum payouts and ongoing lawsuit. Baum did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a statement on the civil lawsuit, Merck said \"an overwhelming body of scientific evidence, including more than 30 years of research and development along with real world evidence generated by Merck and by independent investigators, continues to support the safety and efficacy of our HPV vaccines. The plaintiff's allegations have no merit, and we remain committed to vigorously defending against these claims.\"",
      "Robert Krakow, a New York lawyer who specializes in vaccine injury cases and has worked with Kennedy in the past, said referral fees are fairly standard when it comes to personal injury claims.",
      "Kennedy has been a \"galvanizing force\" when it came to questioning vaccine safety, providing a special touch when talking to families because \"he was very sincere and listened to people,\" Krakow said. Using social media platforms to recruit clients is a natural extension of that work, he said.",
      "\"It's not often you have a celebrity do that,\" Krawkow said of Kennedy's work to find clients who claim vaccine injuries. \"But there's nothing inherently wrong with recruiting people for referral fees.\"",
      "Reuters was first to report Kennedy's extensive role in the Gardasil vaccine lawsuit.",
      "Because Kennedy's financial arrangement was allowed by ethics officials, it's not clear whether the issue will be a sticking point for Republicans eager to align with Trump. According to the agreement released last week, Kennedy can keep the fees from Wisner Baum so long as the independent ethics office at the Health and Human Services Department determines the case does \"not involve the United States as a party and in which the United States does not have a direct and substantial interest.\"",
      "Kennedy also has insisted in private meetings with senators that he is not \"anti-vaccine,\" but only wants more study, according to one person familiar with the discussions.",
      "The messaging aligns with what Kennedy has said publicly. Kennedy often notes he was vaccinated as a child and opted to vaccinate his own children decades ago. His work as chair and chief litigator of the Children's Heath Defense, which opposes the recommended schedule of vaccines for children, did not begin until around 2015.",
      "\"What I've said is I'm pro-science and pro-safety,\" he told a local New Hampshire television station in 2023.",
      "Still, public health experts and many senators -- several of them old enough to remember serious outbreaks of measles and polio in the 1950s -- have expressed serious concerns about his role in eroding confidence in vaccines even if he says he won't outright block access to them.",
      "\"We potentially face a massive health hazard, maybe especially for our children,\" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.",
      "Sanders, a Vermont Democrat who had been seen as someone who might be able to find common ground with Kennedy on environmental and food policy, said the concern with the incoming administration was that \"we may revert back to those terrible days when so many children died\" before age 3.",
      "As head of the Health and Human Services Department, Kennedy would be responsible for the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the selling and marketing of vaccines, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which collects data on vaccines to issue public health recommendations that are closely followed by doctors.",
      "If confirmed, he could insist upon appointing vaccine skeptics to the independent group that reviews FDA data on vaccines.",
      "Kennedy also could alter how information is used from CDC's public reporting system known as \"VAERS\" that allows anyone to flag possible adverse reactions from vaccines. The reports are unverified but used to look for potential patterns that can be investigated.",
      "Health officials say symptoms reported in VAERS are often found to be unrelated from a person's immunization history.",
      "Dorit Reiss, a professor at UC Law San Francisco and expert in legal issues on vaccinations, said handing over that process to someone with Kennedy's track record would be unprecedented.",
      "\"Kennedy has been a committed anti-vaccine activist for a long time. I have seen no indication that his views have changed,\" Reiss said.",

Trump further threatened to issue visa sanctions on all party members, family members and supporters of the Colombian government. Finally, he said that he would also enhance Customs and Border Protection Inspections of all Colombian nationals and Colombian cargo.",
      "Trump said he would use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to fully impose the aforementioned treasury, banking and financial sanctions.",
      "\"These measures are just the beginning,\" Trump said in his post. \"We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States!\" No evidence has been produced to show that Colombia forced anyone into the U.S.",
      "The Colombia Foreign Ministry confirmed to ABC News that two U.S. military aircraft had been blocked from landing in Colombia on Sunday. It was not immediately clear if all 160 passengers aboard the flights were Colombian citizens.",
      "\"A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that every human being deserves,\" Petro said in a statement posted on X on Sunday. It included a video of Brazilian deportees handcuffed after landing in Brazil.",
      "The Foreign Ministry of Brazil also  issued a statement Sunday asking the United States to clarify the \"degrading treatment\" of the deportees.",
      "Petro had issued an early-morning statement on X saying that he objected to U.S. military repatriation planes landing in Colombia -- although, the country would accept civilian planes repatriating citizens, he added.",
      "But a U.S. defense official told ABC News that the two U.S. Air Force C-17 transport aircraft had been granted diplomatic clearances. Then, when the planes were already heading south, Colombia notified the U.S. that they would not be allowed to land, the defense official said.",
      "In a statement posted on X on Sunday afternoon, Petro offered to send his presidential plane to bring deportees to Colombia in a \"dignified\" manner.",
      "Mexico has also denied U.S. military repatriation flights from landing there, a U.S. official familiar with the situation told ABC News, while explaining that such flights are not being prepared until after all diplomatic clearances have been finalized.",
      "Like Colombia, Mexico does not have a problem with contracted civilian aircraft carrying out the flights, the official said, and those are what the Department of Homeland Security typically uses.",
      "Discussions are ongoing, the official added.",
      "In an interview on Sunday with Martha Raddatz -- ABC News' chief global affairs correspondent and a co-anchor of \"This Week\" -- Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, discussed what would happen to countries that won't take the undocumented immigrants back.",
      "\"Oh, they'll take them back,\" Homan said. \"We got President Trump coming to power. President Trump puts America first. Mexico didn't want the 'Remain in Mexico' program under the first administration. They did it. They didn't want to put military on the southern border. They did it.\"",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted a statement on X on Sunday afternoon, saying, \"President Trump has made it clear that under his administration, America will no longer be lied to nor taken advantage of.\"",
      "\"It is the responsibility of each nation to take back their citizens who are illegally present in the United States in a serious and expeditious manner,\" Rubio wrote. \"Colombian President Petro had authorized flights and provided all needed authorizations and then canceled his authorization when the planes were in the air. As demonstrated by today's actions, we are unwavering in our commitment to end illegal immigration and bolster America's border security.\"",
      "Later in the evening, the U.S. Department of State added a post saying that Rubio \"immediately ordered a suspension of visa issuance at the U.S. Embassy Bogota consular section\" and is now \"authorizing travel sanctions on individuals and their families, who were responsible for the interference of U.S. repatriation flight operations.\"",
      "Tariffs are a tax on imports that U.S. companies pay to import their goods, and the higher costs are largely passed on to consumers.",
      "Trump leveraging a tariff of 25% to 50% could have a serious impact on Colombia's economy because the U.S. is Colombia's largest trading partner. According to the U.S. State Department, the United States accounts for 34% of Colombia's total trade.",
      "But that could also hurt American consumers: The U.S. imported $17.5 billion dollars' worth of goods from Colombia in 2024, according to Moody's Analytics.",
      "Notably, Colombia is a top supplier of crude oil to the U.S.",
      "Petro responded to Trump's threatened sanctions late Sunday, saying in a post on X that Colombia will impose reciprocal 50% tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "\"I'm told that you impose a 50% tariff on the fruits of our human labor to enter the United States, and I do the same,\" Petro said in the impassioned post.",

      "The White House issued a statement shortly after 10 p.m. on Sunday saying that Colombia had agreed to all of Trump's terms, \"including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay.\"",

He also confirmed that Petro would be sending his presidential plane to retrieve those citizens who had been on the rebuffed military planes, but didn't specify when that would occur.",
      "The foreign affairs minister said that a high-level diplomatic meeting between the U.S. and Colombia would take place in a matter of days.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 19:55:44 -0500",
    "summary": "According to Trump's \"border czar\" Tom Homan, every undocumented immigrant should worry they could be arrested at any time, even if they have no criminal record.",
    "story": [
      "Homan says administration has a \"clear\" message for undocumented immigrants.",
      "For the first time in U.S. history, military aircraft were used this past week to deport scores of undocumented migrants from the United States. Middle schools, Trump administration officials say, are now seen as places to target for immigration enforcement operations. And, according to President Trump's \"border czar,\" every undocumented immigrant should worry they could be arrested at any time, even if they have no criminal record.",
      "The \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, says it's all part of the Trump administration's effort to send a \"clear\" message: \"There's consequences [for] entering the country illegally,\" he told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday.",
      "\"If we don't show there's consequences, you're never going to fix the border problem,\" he said.",
      "More than 11 million undocumented immigrants are currently estimated to be living in the U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to take unprecedented action to remove as many of them as possible and stem the flow of more migrants coming to the southern border.",
      "In his first several days in office, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, announced an end to the so-called practice of \"catch and release\" -- when migrants claiming asylum are given court dates and then released pending those proceedings -- and sought to overturn the long-held Constitutional right of birthright citizenship, a move that immediately faced legal challenges and was at least temporarily blocked by a federal judge.",
      "As for the millions of undocumented immigrants already in the country, Homan said the administration will deport \"as many as we can,\" starting with threats to public safety threats and national security, Homan said.",
      "According to estimates released by House Republicans last year, based on government data, hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants in the country are convicted criminals or have charges pending against them. Government statistics indicate that in the past four years, hundreds of migrants were caught along the southern border with names matching known or suspected terrorists on a government watchlist. And Homan has said more than 2 million people were detected along the border but never captured, so authorities don't know who they are or what threat some of them could pose.",
      "According to statistics released by the Department of Homeland Security last year, a tiny fraction of those who reached U.S. borders in the prior three years had any kind of criminal record, and the vast majority of them involved nonviolent crimes, such as driving under the influence or previously entering the country illegally.",
      "Homan told ABC News that the Trump administration is only \"in the beginning stages\" of carrying out its mass deportation plan, making public safety threats and national security threats a \"priority,\" but \"as that aperture opens, there'll be more arrests nationwide.\"",
      "And he warned that there will be \"collateral arrests,\" especially in the so-called \"sanctuary cities\" that he says are resistant to helping Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials locate and arrest undocumented immigrants already in local custody for other crimes.",
      "\"Sanctuary cities lock us out of the jails,\" said Homan, who led ICE as acting director in Trump's first administration.",
      "According to Homan, that creates significant safety concerns: When an undocumented immigrant arrested for a serious crime is released by local authorities, instead of being deported, it \"endangers the community.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Homan said that's a time when ICE officers would likely make \"collateral arrests.\"",
      "\"When we find him, he's going to be with others \u2026 [and] if they're in the country illegally, they're coming too,\" he said.",
      "He emphasized that anyone in the country unlawfully is \"on the table.\"",
      "\"It's not OK to violate the laws of this country,\" he said. \"We have millions of people standing in line, taking the test, doing their background investigation, paying the fees that want to come in the right way.\"",
      "\"So if you're in the country illegally, you got a problem,\" he said.",
      "On Monday, during Trump's first day in office, acting Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman issued a directive telling immigration authorities they could conduct operations in so-called \"sensitive\" areas that he said were off-limits during the Biden administration.",
      "\"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Others, however, said the administration was simply creating fear within the immigrant community, with the chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Migration saying that \"turning places of care, healing and solace into places of fear and uncertainty \u2026 will not make our communities safer.",
      "He said that as they prioritize national security threats and public safety threats, ICE officers might have to even go into schools because \"many\" members of gangs tied to South and Central America, such as MS-13, are between 14 and 17 years old.",
      "In his interview with ABC News, Homan said that no other law enforcement agency is restricted from entering certain locations to promote public safety in the same way ICE has been.",
      "\"Name another agency, another law enforcement agency, that has those type of requirements, that they can't walk into a school or doctor's office or a medical campus,\" he said. \"No other agency is held to those standards.\"",
      "\"These are well-trained [ICE] officers with a lot of discretion, and when it comes to a sensitive location, there's still going to be supervisory review,\" he said. \"But ICE officers should have discretion to decide if a national security threat or a public safety threat [is] in one of these facilities.\"",
      "Homan said anyone already in the country unlawfully \"should leave,\" and those looking to claim asylum should \"do it the legal way.\"",
      "\"Go to the embassy, go to the point of entry,\" he said. \"You shouldn't come to this country and ask to get asylum and the first thing you do is break our laws by entering illegally.\"",
      "In the meantime, Homan said the Trump administration is using not just the military but the \"whole\" government, including the Justice Department, to support its mass deportation plan, which allows ICE officers to concentrate on conducting enforcement operations.",
      "But Homan acknowledged that the federal government won't be able to remove every undocumented immigrant in the U.S., and that his \"success is going to be based on what Congress gives us.\"",
      "ICE doesn't currently have enough funding from Congress to detain all of the undocumented immigrants that the Trump administration says it hopes to arrest.",
      "\"I'm being realistic,\" he said. \"We can do what we can with the money we have. We're going to try to be efficient. But with more money we have, the more we can accomplish.\"",
      "\"What price [do] you put on national security?\" he added. \"When you \u2026 don't secure that border, that's when national security threats enter the country. That's when sex trafficking goes up. That's when, you know, that's when the fentanyl comes in.\"",
      "As for what success practically looks like at the end of the Trump administration, Homan said: \"Our success every day is taking a public safety threat off the streets or getting a national security threat out of here.\"",

      "Among recommendations in the Project 2025 conservative blueprint for a second Trump term was replacing inspectors general under the new administration.

      "Still, the HHS Office of Inspector General -- and inspectors generals' offices in most every government agency -- had prepared a transition book for the incoming administration laying out what the independent agency does, and to identify areas of focus to make the departments and their programs healthier, more efficient and more effective, according to multiple sources.",
      "On a call Saturday afternoon among the inspector general community, not only was there note-comparing about who got fired, what their email said, and what happens now -- there was also discussion of encouraging those acting inspectors general who are remaining to stay independent and not shy away from difficult facts or unflattering findings, according to a source familiar with the call.",
      "There's a concern among the inspector general community now, given the language about \"changing priorities\" in the firing emails, that the new administration is cleaning house in order to install personnel aligned with Trump's political leanings, rather than those who champion the agencies' guiding mission of independence and oversight, multiple sources said.",

      "\"Negotiating any new nuclear arms control agreement with the Kremlin would be difficult to hammer out and a new comprehensive framework deal could require sustained talks over many months, if not years, to achieve,\" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association.",
      "During Trump's first term in office, he aimed but failed to strike a three-way nuclear nonproliferation deal between the U.S., Russia and China -- a prospect Trump has revisited during the first days of his second term.",
      "When it comes to ending the war in Ukraine, Trump has also said he intends to bring China -- Russia's most powerful ally -- into the fold, saying Beijing has a \"great deal of power over the situation.\"",
      "What's not clear is how -- or if -- Trump plans to incorporate Ukraine in the talks.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired on Thursday, Trump criticized Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy -- saying \"he's not angel\" and that he \"shouldn't have allowed\" the war with Russia to happen.",
      "On Friday, Andriy Yermak, the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, wrote on social media that Putin \" is trying to push the idea of negotiations with the United States.\"",
      "\"But he has one condition: he wants to decide Europe's fate -- without Europe. And he seeks to talk about Ukraine-- without Ukraine,\" Yermak said, \"This will not happen.",

      "The South Dakota governor was confirmed 59-34 in the Senate.",
      "South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, the firebrand who gained a national spotlight during the coronavirus pandemic, was confirmed by the Senate on Saturday to lead the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Noem won confirmation in a 59-34 vote, making her the fourth person confirmed to Trump's cabinet. Pete Hegseth was confirmed as defense secretary just hours earlier.",
      "In a statement released by the department, Secretary Noem said she will work \"every day\" to keep Americans \"safe and secure.\"",
      "\"The Trump Administration will once-again empower our brave men and women in law enforcement to do their jobs and remove criminal aliens and illegal gangs from our country,\" she said in a statement on Saturday. \"We will fully equip our intelligence and law enforcement to detect and prevent terror threats and will deliver rapid assistance and disaster relief to Americans in crisis.\"",
      "Noem thanked the president for the opportunity to serve and said she wants to achieve the president\u2019s mandate \"to secure our southern border and fix our broken immigration system.\"",
      "During her confirmation hearing, Noem said the southern border is \"not secure\" and that she will help to fix it.",
      "\"President Trump needs to achieve this mission because two-thirds of Americans support his immigration and border policies, including the majority of Hispanic Americans,\" Noem said in her opening statement. \"I was the first governor to send National Guard troops to our southern border when Texas asked for help and when they were being overwhelmed by an unprecedented border crisis. If confirmed as secretary, I'll ensure that our exceptional, extraordinary Border Patrol agents have all the tools and resources and support that they need to carry out their mission.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security already shut down the CBP One app, which allowed migrants to make appointments at the border to claim asylum -- something Noem promised the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee she'd do.",
      "Noem will oversee 22 agencies with more than 260,000 employees who work on issues ranging from the border to federal disaster management to the Secret Service.",
      "\"As secretary, I will oversee the Secret Service, an agency that is in serious need of reforms. We all saw the threats to President-elect Trump last year and the consequences of failure,\" Noem said. \"Now, that should never happen again, and I've worked closely with my own gubernatorial protective detail, and I'm familiar with what works and what doesn't work, and I'll bring that experience towards strengthening the Secret Service.\"",
      "The incoming secretary said she will follow the law and implement reforms with no political bias, including with regard to disaster relief.",
      "She added that \"if given the chance to be secretary of homeland security, that I will deliver the programs according to the law and that it will be done with no political bias.\"",

      "The vote on Friday night was initially 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance then casting the tie-breaking vote.",
      "Former GOP leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, voted no. He joined Sens. Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, along with all Democrats in voting against Hegseth's nomination.",
      "The former Fox News host was sworn in at the White House on Saturday morning during a ceremony officiated by Vance.",
      "\"We look forward to having the backs of our troops and having your back in executing peace through strength, in putting America first. And in rebuilding our military,\u201d Hegseth said in remarks at the ceremony, thanking Vance and President Donald Trump.",
      "In an official statement to the department, he said: \"It is the privilege of a lifetime to lead the warriors of the Department of Defense, under the leadership of our Commander in Chief Donald J. Trump. We will put America First, and we will never back down.\"",
      "Hegseth, a former \"Fox and Friends\" television anchor, was nominated by Trump in November to lead the Defense Department.",
      "In the time since his nomination was announced, Hegseth has been scrutinized for a number of accusations made against him, including those of sexual assault and financial mismanagement of two different veterans organizations.",
      "Hegseth has fiercely denied the allegations. He appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee for a public hearing earlier this month, where he asserted to the panel that he was a \"changed man.\"",
      "\"I am not a perfect person, but redemption is real,\" he told the panel.",
      "Speaking to reporters while on a visit to Los Angeles, Trump said he was \"very happy\" with the vote, and said he was not aware of McConnell's vote.",
      "In a statement released while the vote was still going on, McConnell said that Hegseth's desire to be a \"change agent\" was not enough to qualify him for the role of secretary of defense.",
      "\"Effective management of nearly 3 million military and civilian personnel, an annual budget of nearly $1 trillion, and alliances and partnerships around the world is a daily test with staggering consequences for the security of the American people and our global interests,\" McConnell said in the statement. \"Mr. Hegseth has failed, as yet, to demonstrate that he will pass this test. But as he assumes office, the consequences of failure are as high as they have ever been.\"",
      "Hegseth was confirmed by one of the narrowest Senate margins of any defense secretary in modern history. Most defense secretaries have been confirmed with broad bipartisan votes.",
      "Lloyd Austin, former President Joe Biden's pick for defense secretary, was confirmed in a 93-2 vote and Trump's first pick for defense secretary in his first term, James Mattis, was confirmed in a 98-1 vote.",
      "Before the vote, Hegseth arrived at the Capitol with his wife and children to watch the proceedings in person, a rare move for a Cabinet nominee.",
      "With the Senate's vote Friday, Hegseth becomes the third member of Trump's team to be confirmed by the Senate, following Marco Rubio as secretary of state and John Ratcliffe, as CIA director.",
      "During the same hearing, he affirmed his promise to restore the \"warfighting ethos\" of the DOD, touting his experience in the National Guard.",
      "It was enough to win over the support of most Republicans in the Senate, including several of those who were initially skeptical.",
      "\"He articulated a clear vision of the Pentagon, and it was clear to anyone who listened that he is going to bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the department's stagnant bureaucracy,\" Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a floor speech endorsing Hegseth on Thursday. \"He will restore a warfighting ethos and relentlessly focused on the military's core mission: to deter conflict and, if necessary, to win a war.\"",
      "The Senate Armed Services Committee advanced his nomination on a party-line vote on Monday. Then, in a closely watched moment on Thursday, Hegseth's nomination passed a key test vote that set the table for Friday's vote of final passage.",
      "The nomination only required a simple majority in the Senate to advance, and it cleared the threshold narrowly, with only GOP backing.",
      "Collins and Murkowski also voted no on that occasion.",
      "In a statement, Murkowski explained that she could not support Hegseth due to concerns about this character and lack of experience.",
      "\"I believe that character is the defining trait required of the Secretary of Defense and must be prioritized without compromise,\" Murkowski said in the post. \"The leader of the Department of Defense must demonstrate and model the standards of behavior and character we expect of all servicemembers, and Mr. Hegseth's nomination to the role poses significant concerns that I cannot overlook.\"",
      "Collins took issue with comments Hegseth made in the past about his belief that women should not serve in combat roles in the military. Though Hegseth has since changed his tune on that, Collins said she was unconvinced.",
      "\"I am also concerned about multiple statements, including some in the months just before he was nominated, that Mr. Hegseth has made about women serving in the military,\" Collins said. \"He and I had a candid conversation in December about his past statements and apparently evolving views. I am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed.\"",
      "Trump expressed confidence in Hegseth ahead of the vote on Friday, though he added, \"You'll never know what's going to happen.\"",
      "McConnell, the former GOP leader, and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, ultimately cast votes in favor of advancing Hegseth's nomination in the earlier test vote, although the president questioned whether McConnell will vote no on Hegseth Friday morning.",
      "Tillis said he was still considering the most recent slate of allegations against Hegseth, leveled in an affidavit from his former sister-in-law Danielle Hegseth. In that affidavit, which ABC News obtained, Danielle Hegseth attested that Pete Hegseth's ex-wife Samantha told her she \"once hid in her closet from him because she feared for her personal safety\" in the home they shared during their marriage. It also detailed episodes of binge drinking by Pete Hegseth.",
      "An attorney for Pete Hegseth denied these allegations, and the claims of abuse were also rejected by his ex-wife.",

    "story": [
      "The Democratic senator also said Tulsi Gabbard isn't qualified to serve as DNI.",
      "Michigan Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin explained why she voted against confirming Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense on ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday, saying she had not been confident Hegseth would be more loyal to the Constitution than he would be to President Donald Trump..",
      "Hegseth, a former Fox News host, was sworn into the role on Saturday following a razor-thin vote in the Senate.",
      "Slotkin, who joined the Senate in January and previously worked for multiple national security agencies, including the Department of Defense, told \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz that it was important in confirmation hearings that nominees knew they were \"raising your right hand and pledging an oath to the Constitution -- not Donald Trump -- and that if Donald Trump asks you to do something that contravenes the Constitution, you would push back.\"",
      "\"He couldn't unambiguously say that he will push back if the president asked him to do something that wasn't constitutional, and that, to me, is why I couldn't confirm him,\" Slotkin said. \"There's a lot of other things in his background I don't like, but I look at what is the strategic and irreversible threats to our democracy, and that's using the uniform military in ways that violate the Constitution.\"",
      "The vote to confirm Hegseth was initially 50-50 until Vice President JD Vance, in his role as president of the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote. Every Democrat voted against Hegseth's confirmation, as did Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski.",
      "His nomination process was marred by accusations of sexual misconduct, excessive drinking and financial mismanagement of two different veterans organizations. He has denied all the allegations.",
      "During Hegseth's confirmation hearing, Slotkin questioned him on whether he supports active-duty military members supporting immigrant detention centers if ordered to do so by Trump. With 1,500 soldiers and Marines now at or deploying to the border, Slotkin stressed on \"This Week\" that the military should not take on a law enforcement role in this new mission.",
      "\"According to our Constitution, you can go in supporting roles -- logistics, driving, setting up facilities, setting up, you know, border locations, whatever -- it's very different when you cross the line into law enforcement,\" she said. \"Our military are not trained as law enforcement officers -- they'll be the first one to tell you that. That's not why they got into service, and it's also in violation of our Constitution, so I think it's very important that we keep that line.\"",
      "Slotkin said it was important to know \"you're not going to use the uniform military in ways that violates the Constitution and makes American citizens scared of their own military.\"",
      "\"We were scared of the British when they occupied us,\" she said. \"We don't want to repeat that, so I'm watching that very, very closely.\"",
      "Slotkin also spoke about Tulsi Gabbard's upcoming confirmation hearing for the role of director of national intelligence. Slotkin was one of the first employees in the director's office, working there between 2005 and 2006 in between stints at the CIA as an analyst.",
      "\"I served with Tulsi Gabbard. We were on the Armed Services Committee together. She didn't spend a lot of time showing up to hearings, so I didn't get to see her in action all that much,\" Slotkin said. \"But from what I understand from people who have been meeting directly with her -- and she hasn't asked to meet with me -- is that she doesn't show the competence, the understanding, the depth. She wasn't prepared for her meetings, not to mention the deeply questionable decisions she's made of cozying up to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, flying and cozying up with Assad in Syria.\"",
      "Slotkin said she does \"not believe [Gabbard] is qualified for this role.\"",
      "\"You know, having someone in charge of our intelligence organization that shows a preference for our adversaries, to me, is just right off the bat, a deep question,\" Slotkin said. \"And so again, I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who now have control of the Senate, control of the House, that they think about, again, their commitment to the country, not to any one party.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 09:27:14 -0500",
    "summary": "Inflation was a driving force behind Donald Trump's election victory, but he's put the issue on the back burner during his first week in office",
    "story": [
      "Inflation was a driving force behind Donald Trump's election victory, but he's put the issue on the back burner during his first week in office",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two months ago, in his first network television interview after the election, Donald Trump said he owed his victory to Americans' anger over immigration and inflation, specifically the rising cost of groceries.",
      "\u201cWhen you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press. \u201cAnd I won an election based on that. We\u2019re going to bring those prices way down.\u201d",
      "But in Trump's first week back in the White House, there was little in his initial blitz of executive orders that directly tackled those prices, besides directing federal agencies to start \u201cpursuing appropriate actions.\u201d He is taking steps to lower energy costs, something that Trump hopes will have ripple effects throughout the economy. Otherwise, his focus has been clamping down on immigration, which he described as his \u201cNo. 1 issue\u201d shortly after taking the oath of office.",
      "\u201cThey all said inflation was the No. 1 issue. I said, \u2018I disagree,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cI talked about inflation too, but how many times can you say that an apple has doubled in cost?\u201d",
      "Trump is banking on voters giving him a pass and continuing to blame former President Joe Biden for high prices. The Republican's comments reflect the reality that presidents have almost no levers to reduce inflation quickly without causing collateral damage to other parts of the economy.",
      "There is more that Trump can do on energy. He is pushing to reduce regulations and increase the amount of land available for drilling. He is trying to persuade domestic and foreign oil producers to potentially sacrifice their own profits by pumping more.",
      "During a rally Saturday in Las Vegas, Trump went after his Democratic predecessor for allowing prices to rise under his watch, and promised to take care of the problem quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen I think of Biden, I think of incompetence and inflation,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Inflation peaked at a 9.1% annual rate in June 2022 during worldwide supply chain problems after the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. Overall consumer prices have fallen since then, but have ticked up in recent months, from 2.4% in September to 2.9% in December, the latest figures available. Economists have warned that Trump's plans for tariffs and tax cuts could create new inflationary pressures and keep interest rates elevated.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, in an interview with CBS' \u201cFace the Nation\u201d airing Sunday, defended the White House's work so far.",
      "\u201cPrices are going to come down, but it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time, right?\u201d he said. He added, \u201cRome wasn't built in a day.\u201d",
      "Trump's relative shift away from addressing costs could create an opening for Democrats to say he is not helping working-class voters, hoping that argument could offer the party a path back to power in Washington.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Trump preferred to distract people from inflation with talk of adding Greenland to the United States or seizing the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s catnip and it causes everybody to stop paying attention to their actual economic agenda, which has nothing to do with lowering costs and everything to do with rigging the economy to help the Mar-a-Lago crowd,\u201d he said.",
      "During an interview on Fox News this past week, host Sean Hannity struggled to get Trump to focus on the economy.",
      "\"Let me get to the economy,\u201d Hannity said at one point. \u201cI\u2019m running out of time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe economy is going to do great,\u201d Trump insisted.",
      "When Trump did talk about inflation in the interview, he noted how low it was during his first term and insisted prices would not have jumped up if he had president after the 2020 election, even though higher inflation was a global trend coming out of the pandemic.",
      "It is not clear how Trump would persuade oil companies and foreign countries to quickly increase production, possibly costing them profits.",
      "The Energy Information Administration reported that domestic oil production has grown at an annual rate of roughly 8.4% over the past two years to an average of nearly 13.5 million barrels a day in October. Some Trump aides suggest that could increase by an additional 3 million barrels a day.",
      "It would be difficult to achieve that much additional production in a single year without serious changes to the global market. The International Energy Agency estimates that the oil supplied to the entire world will increase by 1.8 million barrels per day to 104.7 million barrels a day. He also has expressed opposition to climate-friendlier wind and solar energy, putting more pressure on the U.S. economy to rely on fossil fuels.",
      "EJ Antoni, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, said the potential increase in energy production under Trump would ultimately flow through the economy in the form of lower prices.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to bring down the cost of energy, you\u2019re going to bring down the cost of all kinds of goods and services,\" he said.",
      "But there is a risk that some of Trump's plans taken as a whole could raise \u2014 not reduce \u2014 prices. Deporting migrants who are in the United States illegally could deprive companies of lower wage workers. The cost of tariffs, which are taxes placed on foreign imports, could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Trump said that his strategy also might ultimately involve publicly pressuring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, saying in Davos that he would \u201cdemand\u201d lower rates from central banks. The Fed sees its political independence as key for making tough choices to stabilize prices. Biden saw the independence as worth protecting, whereas Trump sees it as problematic.",
      "The Fed raised its benchmark rates starting in 2022 to make it more expensive to borrow and succeeded enough in reducing inflationary pressures that it could trim rates late last year. Trump believes that greater oil production will put him in a position to tell the Fed what to do.",
      "Asked in the Oval Office if he expects the Fed to listen to him, Trump simply said, \u201cYeah.\u201d",

      "The 39-year-old biotech entrepreneur who made an unsuccessful bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination has lined up strategists with Ohio experience and plans to announce his run as soon as this week.",
      "Attending a recent breakfast with more than 600 state GOP activists, Ramaswamy was mobbed by people seeking to have their photos taken with him and his wife, Apoorva. Ramaswamy, who travels with his own small security detail, was again swarmed the same evening during a black-tie inaugural ball in Washington sponsored by the Ohio Republican Party.",
      "Ramaswamy will try to follow the paths of Vice President JD Vance and Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno \u2014 two political newcomers who won Senate seats with the help of Trump's endorsement. His plans have complicated things for a deep bench of veteran Republican politicians, especially the ones who also aspire to succeed term-limited Gov. Mike DeWine. Attorney General Dave Yost announced his candidacy on Thursday.",
      "So far, Ohio voters have continued to support candidates with government experience for state-level offices, while favoring business backgrounds in their presidential and Senate picks.",
      "\u201cAt the federal legislative level, that\u2019s a different yardstick and standard than for governor of Ohio,\" said Republican consultant Terry Casey. \u201cHistorically, the governor's a little closer to voters \u2014 clearing highways, running prisons \u2014 than senators and members of Congress.\u201d",
      "Ramaswamy stands to benefit from instant popularity among Trump's most ardent backers and long ties to both Vance and Moreno. He attended Trump's second inauguration and is a well-known booster of the president.",
      "\u201cThe question is can you bypass the 20 years' worth of political history that used to be required to run for governor,\u201d said Ryan Stubenrauch, a Republican strategist and former senior policy adviser to DeWine.",
      "Ramaswamy is the son of Indian immigrants and a native of Cincinnati. He earned Harvard and Yale degrees before joining a hedge fund firm and leading its pharmaceutical investments. Ramaswamy launched his own venture in 2014, Roivant, specializing in buying discount patents for drugs stuck in development and resurrecting them. His portfolio is now measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars, enough to dwarf the $15 million he loaned his presidential campaign.",
      "He was raised in a Hindu-practicing home. With evangelical Christians holding sway in the Republican Party, Ramaswamy says his faith shares core principles with Christianity and he traces his abortion-rights opposition to his time at St. Xavier High School in his hometown.",
      "Ramaswamy has drawn criticism both from establishment Republicans and the party's populist pro-Trump wing. His opposition to providing weapons to Ukraine in the war with Russia bothered some Republicans. But when he urged Trump, notably in an X post that went viral, to bring in more foreign tech workers, it angered former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and other hard-line supporters of restricted immigration.",
      "When Ramaswamy arrived in Springfield, Ohio, last year to hold a town hall in the wake of false claims made by Trump and Vance that Haitian migrants there were eating people's pets, the venue couldn't hold all the people who showed up.",
      "That popularity does not always translate to those who know Ramaswamy well. Some inside and outside the Trump universe say his style can be abrasive and exhausting.",
      "Ramaswamy has long considered running for governor, according to those with knowledge of his plans.",
      "After Trump appointed him to DOGE, Ramaswamy pulled himself out of consideration for the Senate seat that came open with Vance's election as vice president. But Ramaswamy later discussed the vacancy with Trump, according to two people familiar with his plans who were not authorized to publicly discuss the private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity, and then went to DeWine to ask for the appointment. The governor opted for Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, citing his extensive government experience.",
      "A spokesperson for DOGE said Ramaswamy would not participate in the cost-cutting initiative due to his plans to run for office. That leaves Musk, the world's richest person, as its sole leader.",
      "Ramaswamy has ties to Republican strategists from his campaign for the White House race, notably Ben Yoho, CEO of the Columbus-based Strategy Group.",
      "By appointing Husted to the Senate, DeWine eliminated the leading contender to follow him as governor. Bot no longer is it a given that the wealthy donors and key endorsers that Husted had locked up over the past six years would naturally shift to another experienced Republican \u2014 Yost or Treasurer Robert Sprague, for example.",
      "Yost, 68, is a former county prosecutor elected four times statewide \u2014 twice as auditor, twice as attorney general. Sprague, 51, has been twice elected statewide after spending years in the Ohio House and county government. Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a former state senator whose job running elections makes him among the state\u2019s highest profile politician, has yet to announce his plans.",
      "\u201cThis new dynamic and competition adds a layer of complexity for me,\u201d said Ken Blackwell, a Trump loyalist who served two terms as Ohio secretary of state and whose potential endorsement would be coveted. Blackwell is a long-time Yost supporter who lives in Cincinnati and is a former mayor.",
      "Yost, in announcing his campaign, did not mention Ramaswamy, but seemed to draw a contrast with a potential rival who has played on the national stage.",

    "title": "A new luxury hotel towers over Havana as Cuba's economic troubles mount and tourism plummets",
    "published": "Sat, 25 Jan 2025 00:02:57 -0500",
    "summary": "The tallest building in Havana is impossible to miss",
    "story": [
      "The tallest building in Havana is impossible to miss",
      "HAVANA -- It\u2019s impossible to miss. The huge rectangular mass of concrete and glass \u2014 the tallest building in Havana \u2014 dominates the city skyline, towering 150 meters (490 feet) above colonial homes with its 542 luxury rooms and majestic views of the city and the sea.",
      "The Selection La Habana hotel, managed by Spanish chain Iberostar, has yet to be inaugurated but it is already the target of criticism \u2014 and not only for its unusual shape. Cubans are questioning the government\u2019s allocation of millions of dollars towards luxury tourism while the island grapples with a severe economic crisis and tourism numbers plummet to historic lows.",
      "\u201cAll that money could have been spent to build hospitals and schools,\u201d lamented Susel Borges, a 26-year-old artisan, as she looked up to the towering edifice, known to locals as the \u201cK and 23 building\u201d because of its location.",
      "Located near the legendary Habana Libre hotel and the iconic Coppelia ice cream parlor, the new hotel is part of a government plan to build a dozen luxury establishments \u2014 mainly in Havana \u2014 that did not stop even during the COVID-19 pandemic and while existing luxury hotels remained largely unoccupied.",
      "For decades, tourism drove the Cuban economy, generating annual revenues of up to $3 billion. But in December, Cuban authorities said only 2.2 million tourists visited the island in 2024, a decrease of roughly 200,000 from 2023 and significantly lower than the 4.2 million tourists who visited in 2019.",
      "The government attributes the decline in tourism to a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of factors including supply shortages, a severe energy crisis causing massive blackouts and a lack of personnel, due to emigration and low wages. Furthermore, the island is grappling with a surge in U.S. sanctions, including restrictions on travel by U.S. citizens, a ban on cruise ships and other measures specifically designed to stifle the growth of Cuba\u2019s tourism industry.",
      "\u201cTourism is gone,\u201d said Julio Garc\u00eda Campos, driver of a shiny red 1951 Pontiac with an original engine. \u201cTourists used to line up to get on one of these!\u201d he said, recalling a bygone era when the island was bustling with American and European travelers following a removal of sanctions by then-President Barack Obama.",
      "The new Selection La Habana, like all other hotels in Cuba, is state-owned and operates under GAESA, a conglomerate belonging to the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces that has often been criticized because of the opacity of its businesses. As a military-run operation, it is exempt from audits by the Comptroller General\u2019s Office and has not disclosed the amount it invested in the 40-story hotel.",
      "Cuban economist Pedro Monreal notes the \u201cincongruity\u201d of investing capital in the tourism sector when very little is being allocated to strategic areas such as agriculture.",
      "\"With food insecurity a concern, it\u2019s troubling that agricultural investment lags significantly behind tourism investment, remaining 11 times lower,\u201d Monreal noted last year on social media.",
      "Architects also expressed little enthusiasm for the new hotel, pointing at its disruptive appearance within the environment, its excessive height violating urban regulations and tall glass windows that are ill-suited for a tropical climate.",
      "\u201cThis building serves as a perfect example in our classes of what should not be done in terms of bioclimatic design,\u201d said Abel Tablada, an architect and university professor, adding it's \"unforgivable\" that the little money available to the Cuban state has been allocated to a building that does not add value to the city.",

      "Republicans want voters to curb the uniquely expansive partial veto powers that Wisconsin governors from both parties have enjoyed for nearly a century",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Republicans want voters to curb the uniquely expansive partial veto powers that Wisconsin governors from both parties have enjoyed for nearly a century.",
      "Wisconsin is the only state where governors can partially veto spending bills by striking words, numbers and punctuation to create new meaning or spending amounts. In most states, governors can only eliminate or reduce spending amounts.",
      "And while the Wisconsin governor's veto power has been reduced over the past four decades, it is still considered the strongest in the country. The issue has crossed party lines, with Republicans and Democrats pushing at different times for more limitations on the governor\u2019s veto depending on which party was wielding the power.",
      "Republican state lawmakers on Monday took the latest swing at reducing the veto powers, proposing a constitutional amendment that would eliminate a governor's powers to delete words and rework sentences in bills that spend taxpayer money.",
      "Under the proposal, the governor could only veto entire sections from spending bills instead of individual words.",
      "The partial veto as used by governors currently has turned them into a \u201csuper lawmaker,\u201d according to Republican Sens. Julian Bradley and Cory Tomcyzk and Republican state Rep. Scott Allen. They circulated the proposal for cosponsors Monday.",
      "The idea would have to pass two consecutive legislative sessions and be approved by voters before taking effect. The soonest that could happen is 2027. The Legislature is controlled by Republicans this session, but the 2026 election will determine who will have power starting in 2027.",
      "The governor could not veto the proposal.",
      "Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' spokesperson Britt Cudaback said lawmakers instead should get behind the governor's proposal to give voters the power to put issues on the ballot themselves through circulating referendums. Republicans oppose that idea.",
      "\u201cRepublicans\u2019 message to the people of Wisconsin is clear: power for me but not for thee,\u201d Cudaback said.",
      "The move comes as Republicans have increasingly gotten around Evers by proposing constitutional amendments, which the governor can't stop. Five amendments were put on the ballot last year and a sixth which would add the state's voter ID law to the constitution is up for voter approval on April 1.",
      "Wisconsin\u2019s partial veto power was created by a 1930 constitutional amendment, but it\u2019s been weakened. Voters adopted constitutional amendments in 1990 and 2008 that removed the ability to strike individual letters to make new words \u2014 the \u201cVanna White\u201d veto \u2014 and the power to eliminate words and numbers in two or more sentences to create a new sentence \u2014 the \u201cFrankenstein\u201d veto.",
      "There is a pending case before the Wisconsin Supreme Court challenging a partial veto Evers made in 2023 that attempts to lock in a school funding increase for 400 years. Evers struck digits to create a new ending year for the increases, 2425.",
      "The Supreme Court is weighing whether to declare that the state constitution forbids the governor from striking digits to create a new year or to remove language to create a longer duration than the one approved by the Legislature."

      "More rain is falling on parts of Southern California after causing mudflows over the weekend",
      "LOS ANGELES -- More rain fell Monday on parts of Southern California after causing mudflows over the weekend, helping firefighters but boosting the risk of toxic ash runoff in areas scorched by Los Angeles-area wildfires.",
      "Flood watches were in effect for burn areas from recent fires that broke out around the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Los Angeles, Altadena and Castaic Lake, said Joe Sirard, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Oxnard.",
      "\u201cAll these fresh burns are very susceptible to rapid runoff,\u201d Sirard said, warning of even small amounts of rain in a few minutes' time. \u201cWhat that means is we have a fairly high danger of mud and debris flows once we get above those thresholds.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles International Airport reported a little under an inch of rain (2.5 centimeters) in a 24-hour period ending at 3 a.m. Monday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported. Surrounding areas reported lesser amounts.",
      "School was closed Monday for the four Malibu schools in the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District \u201cdue to dangerous road conditions and challenges with access to our schools,\u201d school officials posted online.",
      "A portion of the Pacific Coast Highway in Los Angeles County was closed as of Sunday afternoon due to mudflows in Topanga Canyon, the California Department of Transportation said. Heavy snow fell in the mountains in San Bernardino and Riverside counties.",
      "One benefit that could come from the rain: It may help firefighters who are reining in multiple wildfires after weeks of windy and dry weather.",
      "Los Angeles County crews spent much of last week removing vegetation, shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of the Palisades and Eaton fires, which reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds on Jan. 7.",
      "The Palisades Fire, the largest of the blazes that destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 11 people, reached 90% containment Sunday. The Eaton Fire, which broke out near Altadena and has killed at least 16 people, was 98% contained.",
      "The Hughes Fire, which ignited last week north of Los Angeles and caused evacuation orders or warnings for more than 50,000 people, was 95% contained as of Sunday evening.",
      "In San Diego County, firefighters made progress to contain the smaller Border 2 Fire as it burned through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Most of the region was forecast to get about an inch of precipitation over several days, but the weather service warned of a risk of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills.",
      "\u201cSo the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area,\u201d weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said on social media. \u201cThat could be enough to create debris flows.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order last week to expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. LA County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.",
      "Fire crews filled sandbags for communities, while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins.",
      "Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones was a toxic mix of incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up.",
      "Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018, when the town of Montecito, up the coast from Los Angeles, was ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died.",
      "The rain snapped a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Most of Southern California is currently in \u201cextreme drought\u201d or \u201csevere drought,\u201d according to the U.S. Drought Monitor."

      "Current and former European and U.S. officials have raised concerns about some of President Donald Trump\u2019s picks for top intelligence posts",
      "LONDON -- As Russia moved closer to invading Ukraine nearly three years ago, the United States and its allies took the extraordinary step of declassifying and sharing intelligence to expose Moscow\u2019s plans.",
      "Information flew across the Atlantic from U.S. spy agencies to NATO and Western partners showing that Russia was poised to launch the biggest attack on a European country since World War II.",
      "It was designed to muster support for Kyiv, and on the strength of the U.S. warning, some nations sent weapons to Ukraine, which moved some equipment out of the range of Russian strikes.",
      "Now, officials are bracing for a potentially changed security landscape under President Donald Trump. He has criticized America's allies and lambasted its intelligence agencies. He's been accused of disregarding secrecy rules and hoarding classified documents.",
      "Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, has parroted Russian propaganda while his nominee to lead the FBI, Kash Patel, has promised changes that could significantly curtail the flow of intelligence to America's friends. Both are expected to face sharp questioning from lawmakers during confirmation hearings Thursday.",
      "The Associated Press spoke with 18 current and former senior European and U.S. officials who worked in NATO, defense, diplomacy or intelligence. Many raised questions and concerns about Trump's past relationship with America's spies and their ability to share information at a time of heightened terror threats and signs of greater cooperation between U.S. adversaries.",
      "The U.S. and its allies routinely share top-secret information, be it about potential terror threats, Chinese cyberattacks or Russian troop movements. America's closest intelligence partners are New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Britain, and it often shares with other nations or sometimes even adversaries when lives are at stake.",
      "In July, the U.S. helped foil a Russian plot to assassinate the head of a German arms manufacturer that produced weapons for Ukraine. In August, the CIA said it provided intelligence to Austrian authorities that allowed them to disrupt a plan, allegedly inspired by the Islamic State group, to attack a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna.",
      "Cooperation particularly between the U.S. and the U.K. is \u201cstrong and robust enough to withstand some turbulence at the political level,\u201d said Lord Peter Ricketts, former U.K. national security adviser and current chair of the European Affairs Committee of the upper chamber of the British Parliament.",
      "However, any strong intelligence relationship is underpinned by trust, and what if \u201ctrust isn\u2019t there?\u201d Ricketts said.",
      "There was some skepticism about U.S. intelligence ahead of the invasion of Ukraine due to the faulty American information that led to the invasion of Iraq in 2001, said Oana Lungescu, a fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London and formerly NATO's longest-serving spokesperson.",
      "But when combined with information from its security partners, America's \u201cremarkable intelligence\" enabled the NATO alliance to raise the alert about Russia, Lungescu said.",
      "European leaders are working to convince Trump's administration that threats on the continent also are relevant for the United States.",
      "There shouldn't be much debate, said former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Mike McFaul, who said there's a direct relationship between U.S. intelligence sharing and national security. He noted that U.S. authorities have warned of escalating terror threats.",
      "\u201cOne of our great advantages is that we have incredible intelligence capabilities and we have allies that we share that with \u2014 it\u2019s a force multiplier for us,\u201d said McFaul, who now teaches at Stanford University. \u201cWe\u2019ll lose that if we\u2019re no longer considered trustworthy.\u201d",
      "The Trump team has an \u201copen mind and is in a listening mode,\u201d Norway\u2019s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said, adding that was a good sign because \u201cwhen you come in with a new administration in a very eventful, rapidly changing environment, getting on the same footing is a challenge.\u201d",
      "Predicting Trump\u2019s moves, however, is difficult. He has criticized NATO allies for not spending enough on defense. He even suggested he would encourage Russia to invade countries that didn\u2019t pay what he thought they should. But he didn\u2019t follow through on the threat.",
      "\u201cLast time it didn\u2019t turn out so badly: He was going to throw NATO under the bus, but he didn't do that,\" former U.S. Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte said. \"The rhetoric turned out to be transactional.\u201d",
      "Spokespeople for the White House and Gabbard did not respond to questions about Trump and his nominees or how they planned to handle intelligence sharing with America\u2019s allies.",
      "NATO members have hiked their defense spending \u2014 as Trump has demanded \u2014 and the alliance is now bigger than before, with Sweden and Finland joining after Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThere is a big risk of continuing to take American support for European, NATO countries ... and defense of Ukraine for granted,\u201d said Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson.",
      "But it would also be risky to assume \u201cthe U.S. is simply leaving.\u201d On that question, Kristersson said, \u201cthe jury is very much out.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s choice of Gabbard to oversee more than a dozen intelligence agencies has alarmed lawmakers from both parties and many current and former intelligence officials. Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who later became a Trump ally, met since-deposed Syrian President Bashar Assad in 2017 in Damascus and has promoted Russian propaganda about its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "If confirmed, Gabbard would have the power to declassify information and direct some intelligence sharing with allies.",
      "A European intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said that while there is concern around some of Trump\u2019s nominations, there is \u201cno reason to think we can\u2019t trust them because of who is in power.\u201d",
      "The official suggested nominees like Gabbard and Patel \u201chaven\u2019t heard all the facts yet\u201d and could \u201cgrow and learn\u201d when presented with the full picture.",
      "With thousands of professionals working in a multitude of agencies, the day-to-day operations of America\u2019s spy services may look very similar under the Trump administration. And there are safeguards, current and former officials told the AP, that include agencies sharing intelligence but not sources.",
      "But those in top positions will have a huge impact if they lead to staff departures, curtail longstanding surveillance programs as Patel has suggested or politicize their offices in ways that can be exploited by Moscow and other adversaries.",
      "The task for Europe is to convince everybody to focus on Russia, \u201dthe real troublemaker,\u201d the intelligence official said.",
      "Alongside Gabbard, Patel has rattled intelligence insiders in the U.S. and elsewhere because he's criticized surveillance programs like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which U.S. authorities use to keep tabs on suspected spies and terrorists overseas.",
      "The United States shared intelligence gathered through that law with Russia when public safety was at stake, passing along a warning before a deadly concert attack in Moscow in March that killed 145 people. It is not clear if Moscow tried to act on the warning.",
      "The European Union must be realistic that \u201cif the U.S. is reducing its participation in Europe, European members have to be ready to fill any gap,\u201d said former Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6, who has called for the 27-nation bloc to create its own intelligence agency.",
      "Many global tech and communication firms such as Google, Apple and Microsoft as well as Elon Musk\u2019s X are based in the U.S., giving American law enforcement and spy agencies an advantage over their foreign counterparts, which may lack the political or legal means to obtain information.",
      "Niinist\u00f6 hosted a summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018, in which Trump openly questioned his own intelligence agencies\u2019 finding that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election to his benefit, restating Putin\u2019s claim that Moscow was not involved.",
      "Niinist\u00f6, whose country borders Russia, described his discussions with Trump while in office as clear, open and frank.",

      "Despite legally migrating to the U.S. under the country\u2019s Temporary Protected Status program, many of the thousands of Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, are fearful President Donald Trump\u2019s promised migration crackdown will soon include them",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ohio -- At the end of his Sunday service, the pastor of the First Haitian Evangelical Church of Springfield, Ohio, asked ushers and musicians to form a circle around him as he knelt in prayer, flanked by the flags of Haiti and the United States.",
      "Many had come to receive his blessing and hear his guidance on how to deal with federal agents in case of raids stemming from President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration. Other congregants stayed home out of fear and growing uncertainty.",
      "\u201cI asked God to protect my people,\u201d the Rev. Reginald Silencieux said after the service, reflecting on his final prayer. \u201cI prayed especially for the Haitian community, and I prayed for U.S.A. too, because Trump is our president. As a church, we have an obligation to pray for him because he\u2019s our political leader right now.\u201d",
      "Some of Springfield's estimated 15,000 Haitians are seeking solace and divine intervention in their churches or at shops that sell spiritual products. Community leaders say many are overwhelmed by fears Trump will end or let expire the Temporary Protected Status program that allows them to remain in the U.S. legally.",
      "\u201cThe community is panicking.\u201d said Viles Dorsainvil, the leader of Springfield's Haitian Community Help and Support Center. \u201cThey see the arrests on TV in other parts of the country and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe majority of immigrants in the U.S.A. are not criminals, and they\u2019re hard-working people,\u201d he added. \u201cAny administration with common sense would rather work with those kinds of immigrants than deport them.\u201d",
      "Last year, Trump falsely accused Haitians in Springfield of eating their neighbor\u2019s cats and dogs. The false rumors exacerbated fears about division and anti-immigrant sentiment in the mostly white, blue-collar city of about 59,000.",
      "In the weeks after his comments, schools, government buildings and the homes of elected officials were targeted with dozens of bomb threats.",
      "\u201cBefore, we had a different type of fear \u2014 it was a fear of retaliation, whether it was the far right, the Proud Boys,\u201d said Jacob Payen, a Haitian community leader and owner of Milokan Botanica, a religious shop that sells Haitian spiritual and natural healing products.",
      "\u201cNow, there\u2019s a fear of deportation. That keeps a lot of people from going out and has caused a lot of people to have left,\u201d he said, pointing to the usually busy commercial plaza where his business is located and that was now more quiet than usual.",
      "Between selling religious candles and spiritual ointments, Payne guided customers with immigration forms, employment authorization cards and questions on their TPS applications.",
      "Brutus Joseph, 50, who works installing solar panels, said he came to the botanica to find spiritual relief. But he also wanted to speak his mind.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel right at all. I have a lot in my chest,\u201d Joseph said in Creole through an interpreter. \u201cMy wife and I can\u2019t even sleep because we\u2019re so worried. We\u2019re law-abiding citizens \u2014 all we did is to be Haitian. We didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be treated like this by the (Trump) administration. I\u2019m praying to God that the president changes his mind.\u201d",
      "Joseph especially worries about the future for his five children, including one who is a senior in high school in Springfield and plans to attend college this year.",
      "\u201cIf I leave here, there\u2019s no future for my children. My children can get raped and killed if I go back, so I have everything to lose,\" he said, making an appeal to Trump as a fellow family man who is married to an immigrant.",
      "The Rev. Philomene Philostin, one of the pastors at the First Haitian Evangelical Church, bemoaned the lower-than-usual attendance at Sunday's service.",
      "\u201cThey don't have to be scared. They have to be alert,\" she said. \"They shouldn't be scared to the point where they don't come to church.\u201d",
      "The migration concerns of clergy and other community members in Springfield are shared by many faith leaders nationwide. In several cities, including New York, Philadelphia and Portland, Oregon, interfaith groups are discussing how to provide security and support to migrants in their communities, including those who are undocumented.",
      "During his first administration, Trump used bluntly vulgar language to question why the U.S. would accept immigrants from Haiti and \u201cshithole countries\u201d in Africa. His 2024 campaign focused heavily on illegal immigration, often referring in his speeches to crimes committed by migrants.",
      "Thousands of temporary Haitian migrants have legally landed in Springfield in recent years under the TPS program, as longstanding unrest in their home country has given way to\u202f violent gangs ruling the streets.",
      "\u201cEverything changed because Trump is president. People are scared right now. Most are staying in their homes \u2014 they don\u2019t want to go outside,\u201d said Romane Pierre, 41, who settled in Springfield in 2020 under the TPS program after fleeing violence in his native Haiti.",
      "\u201cI love my country, but you can\u2019t live there; it\u2019s terrible right now,\u201d said Pierre, who works at the Rose Gaute, a popular Haitian restaurant in Springfield. \u201cSo where do you go back to?\u201d",
      "Last year, his 8-year-old daughter got ill in the middle of the night. Gunshots rang in their neighborhood in the capital of Port-Au-Prince, and her mother felt it was too dangerous to take her to the hospital. She died in the morning in front of the hospital entrance. Pierre couldn\u2019t get a permit on time to return for her funeral.",
      "\u201cSometimes, life is difficult,\u201d he said pensively on a break from work.",
      "The TPS, which allows him and thousands of others to remain legally in Springfield, expires on February 2026. He still hopes Trump will keep in mind the violence in Haiti and renew it.",
      "\u201cThink about Haitians because Haiti is not a place to return to right now,\u201d he said. \u201cGod, talk to Mr. Trump and do something for Haitians.\u201d",
      "The migrants' fears were echoed by the president of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council, who said the Trump administration\u2019s decisions to freeze aid programs, deport migrants and block refugees will be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for Haiti.",
      "Leslie Voltaire made the comment in an interview with The Associated Press in Rome on Saturday following a meeting with Pope Francis at the Vatican.",
      "The pontiff and Voltaire discussed the dire situation in Haiti where gangs have killed civilians and operate across the Caribbean nation with impunity. Half of Haiti\u2019s 11.4 million people are already hungry, according to Voltaire, and losing humanitarian assistance will make the situation dramatically worse.",

      "CHICAGO -- Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove visited Chicago on Sunday to witness the start of ramped-up immigration enforcementin the nation's third-largest city promised by the Trump administration, though few details of the operation were made public.",
      "Bove said he was in Chicago on Sunday morning and observed Department of Homeland Security agents, along with assisting federal agencies \u2014 including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives. He didn't say where the operations took place in the city or detail any arrests.",
      "\u201cWe will support everyone at the federal, state, and local levels who joins this critical mission to take back our communities,\u201d Bove said in a statement. \"We will use all available tools to address obstruction and other unlawful impediments to our efforts to protect the homeland. Most importantly, we will not rest until the work is done.\u201d",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Jeff Carter said the agency \u201cbegan conducting enhanced targeted operations\u201d Sunday in Chicago but declined other details, citing an ongoing operation. Spokesmen for the FBI, ATF and the Drug Enforcement Administration confirmed their involvement but didn't give other information.",
      "Chicago residents, especially in immigrant circles, have already been on edge for months in anticipation of large-scale arrests touted by the Trump administration. The atmosphere has been especially tense the past week as top Trump officials vowed to start immigration enforcement operations in Chicago the day after Trump's inauguration before walking back those statements.",
      "Immigrant rights groups have tried to prepare with campaigns for immigrants to know their rights in case of an arrest. City officials have done the same, publishing similar information at public bus and train stations.",
      "On Friday, Chicago Public Schools officials mistakenly believed ICE agents had come to a city elementary school and put out statements to that effect before learning the agents were from the Secret Service. Word of immigration agents at a school \u2014 which have long been off limits to immigration agents until Trump ended the policy last week \u2014 drew swift criticism from community groups and Gov. JB Pritzker.",
      "The Democratic governor, a frequent Trump critic, questioned the aggressive approach of the operations and the chilling effect for others, particularly for law-abiding immigrants who have been in the country for years.",
      "\u201cWe need to get rid of the violent criminals. But we also need to protect people, at least the residents of Illinois and all across the nation, who are just doing what we hope that immigrants will do,\u201d Pritzker said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \"State of the Union.\"",
      "Chicago has been one of Trump's favorite targets. The city has some of the strongest sanctuary protections, which bar cooperation between city police and immigration agents.",
      "On Saturday, several Chicago-based immigrant rights groups filed a lawsuit against ICE, seeking an injunction prohibiting certain types of immigration raids in Chicago.",
      "\u201cImmigrant communities who have called Chicago their home for decades are scared,\u201d said Antonio Gutierrez from Organized Communities Against Deportation, one of the plaintiffs. \u201cWe refuse to live in fear and will fight any attempts to roll back the work we\u2019ve done to keep families together.\u201d",

      "Rain falling on Southern California is expected to aid firefighters mopping up multiple wildfires",
      "LOS ANGELES -- After weeks of windy and dry weather, rain has fallen in parched Southern California and is expected to aid firefighters who are mopping up multiple wildfires. But potentially heavy downpours on charred hillsides could bring new troubles such as toxic ash runoff.",
      "Los Angeles County crews spent much of the past week removing vegetation, shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of the Palisades and Eaton fires, which reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds Jan. 7.",
      "Most of the region was forecast to get around an inch (about 2.5 centimeters) of precipitation over several days, but \u201cthe threat is high enough to prepare for the worst-case scenario\u201d of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills, the National Weather Service said on social media.",
      "\u201cSo the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area,\u201d weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said. \u201cThat could be enough to create debris flows.\u201d",
      "Rainfall that began late Saturday was expected to increase Sunday and possibly last into early Tuesday, forecasters said. Flood watches were issued for some burn areas, while snow was likely in the mountains.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order last week to expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. LA County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.",
      "Fire crews filled sandbags for communities, while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins.",
      "Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones was a toxic mix of incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up.",
      "Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018, when the town of Montecito, up the coast from LA, was ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died.",
      "While the impending wet weather ended weeks of dangerous gusts and reduced humidity, several wildfires were still burning Saturday across Southern California. Those included the Palisades and Eaton fires, which killed at least 28 people and destroyed more than 14,000 structures. Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 81% on Saturday and the Eaton Fire was 95% contained.",
      "In northern Los Angeles County, firefighters made significant progress against the Hughes Fire, which prompted evacuations for tens of thousands of people when it erupted on Wednesday in mountains near Lake Castaic.",
      "In San Diego County, there was still little containment of the Border 2 Fire as it burned through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The rain was expected to snap a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Much of the region has received less than 5% of the average rainfall for this point in the water year, which began Oct. 1, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday.",
      "Most of Southern California is currently in \u201cextreme drought\u201d or \u201csevere drought,\u201d according to the U.S. Drought Monitor."

He held forth on everything from the color of the presidential plane to the fate of TikTok, Greenland and Canada.",
      "Trump popped in to the plane's press cabin while flying from Las Vegas to Florida, where he was staying at his Doral golf club through Monday evening, though he insisted he'd be too busy to hit the links.",
      "The new president scoffed at reporters getting \u201ca bit more access\u201d than under his predecessor, Joe Biden, and joked it was \u201clike 5,000%\u201d different \u2014 meaning he was willing to answer a lot more questions. Trump called Air Force One a \u201cspecial plane\u201d but observed that it hasn\u2019t changed much from his last term. And, yes, he still wants to change the plane\u2019s exterior colors.",
      "\u201cWe want power blue, not baby blue,\u201d Trump said. \u201cEverything has its time and place. We\u2019ll be changing the colors.\u201d",
      "Here are some highlights from the conversation:",

      "\u201cNumerous people are talking to me,\" he said. \u201cVery substantial people.\u201d He said he expects to decide what happens next \u201cprobably over the next 30 days.\u201d",
      "The president said he'd not been in contact with Oracle about buying TikTok, despite reports that he had, and that he'd not spoken to Oracle's billionaire co-founder Larry Ellison, whom he called a friend. He noted Ellison lives \u201cright down the road\u201d from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.",
      "But he said there are many other potential buyers.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary,\u201d Trump said of a potential sale. \u201cI\u2019d only do it if the United States benefits.\u201d",
      "He added that, \u201cI have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok\u201d because he felt like it improved his standing with young voters in November\u2019s presidential election.",
      "Asked about the series of executive orders he\u2019s signed since taking office that have placed new rules on the federal workforce, Trump said he was opposed to work-from-home concessions that became more common during the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "\u201cYou have to go to your office and you have to work,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019re not going to have a job.\u201d",
      "Trump also said he\u2019s not worried about existing federal employees leaving and the talent pool to find replacements being diminished: \u201cWe have very deep talent. We also have a lot of excess people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was a gimmick for Democrats, to a certain extent,\u201d he said of existing federal worker rolls, which he suggested were too large.",
      "Trump reiterated his desire to somehow purchase Greenland from Denmark, despite that country insisting it's not for sale.",
      "\u201cI do believe Greenland, we\u2019ll get because it really has to do with freedom of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has nothing to do with the United States, other than we\u2019re the one that can provide the freedom.\u201d",
      "The president also made some of his most extensive comments about his recent suggestions that Canada could become part of the U.S.",
      "\u201cI love Canada,\u201d he said. \u201cI have so many friends up in Canada. And they like us, and they like me. But Canada\u2019s been taking advantage of the United States for years, and we\u2019re not going to let that happen.\u201d",
      "He suggested that the U.S. is losing hundreds of millions annually to Canada in trade deficits while Canada does \u201calmost 90% of their business with the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on supporting the country unless that country is a state. And, if it\u2019s a state, the people of Canada will pay a much lower tax.\u201d",

      "Trump said he complimented Jordan for having successfully accepted Palestinian refugees and that he told the king, \u201cI\u2019d love for you to take on more, cause I\u2019m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it\u2019s a mess. It\u2019s a real mess.\u201d",
      "Such a drastic displacement of people would openly contradict Palestinian identity and deep connection to Gaza. Still, Trump said the part of the world that encompasses Gaza, has \u201chad many, many conflicts\u201d over centuries. He said resettling \u201ccould be temporary or long term.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomething has to happen,\" Trump said. \u201cBut it\u2019s literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything\u2019s demolished, and people are dying there.\u201d He added: \u201cSo, I\u2019d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations, and build housing in a different location, where they can maybe live in peace for a change.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate comment from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.",
      "Trump has offered non-traditional views on the future of Gaza in the past. He suggested after he was inaugurated on Monday that Gaza has \u201creally got to be rebuilt in a different way.\"",

      "His resuming delivery of large bombs, meanwhile, is a break with then-President Joe Biden, who halted their delivery in May as part of an effort to keep Israel from launching an all-out assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. A month later, Israel did take control of the city, but after the vast majority of the 1 million civilians that had been living or sheltering in Rafah had fled.",

I\u2019m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem.\u201d",

      "Trump's action comes as he has celebrated the first phase of a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel that has paused the fighting and seen the release of some hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Negotiations have yet to begin in earnest on the more difficult second phase of the deal that would eventually see the release of all hostages held by Hamas and an enduring halt to the fighting.",

      "Ricardo Mendez took part in a yearslong scheme between a law firm he worked for that specialized in defending those charged with driving while intoxicated and the Albuquerque Police Department, New Mexico State Police and the Bernalillo County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Mendez admitted that since 2008 he had been offering gifts and thousands of dollars in bribes to officers in exchange for having his clients\u2019 cases dismissed.",
      "\u201cI admit that, since at least 2008, this DWI scheme I participated in constituted an enterprise (the DWI Enterprise) that engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity that included multiple acts of bribery, chargeable under New Mexico state law, as well as multiple acts of interference commerce by extortion,\u201d Mendez wrote in his plea.",
      "Dubbed the Driving While Intoxicated Enterprise, the scheme would allow offenders who drove while intoxicated to get off scot-free, prosecutors said.",
      "Clients would pay Mendez or his associate an attorney retainer fee in cash, court records said. Then Mendez would pay officers in cash \u2014 $5,000 or more \u2014 or in the form of gifts or legal services to not appear in court as a necessary witness to the driving incident, resulting in the dismissal of the case, according to court records.",
      "As the scheme continued, officers started referring DWI cases to Mendez and his associate with the ask of increased payments.",
      "\u201cI admit that when drivers avoid criminal culpability for DWI, they become more likely to drive while intoxicated in the future, and, the more often that a person drives while intoxicated, the more likely they are to have an accident,\u201d Mendez said in his plea.",
      "According to documents obtained by the Albuquerque Journal, the probe began following a stop by one of the officers in August 2023. He allegedly told the driver that he should contact a specific attorney, who, if hired, would make sure the police department would not file a case in court.",
      "Prosecutors recommended a reduced prison sentence for Mendez as part of the plea deal.",

Since them, a dozen officers have resigned, been placed on administrative leave, been terminated or been temporarily reassigned per a DWI timeline from Albuquerque Police Department communications director Gilbert Gallegos. Dozens of cases have been dismissed.",
      "The Albuquerque Police Department has made administrative changes, including the creation of a DWI unit handbook.",

Killed were 30-year-old Jasmine Sturm; her brother, 26-year-old Matthew Pettus; her boyfriend, 35-year-old Loyace Foreman III; and her friend, 30-year-old Nitosha Flug-Presley.",
      "Suggs told his father that he \u201csnapped\u201d and shot a couple of people, according to a criminal complaint charging him with four counts of second-degree murder. Osborne followed Suggs to a Dunn County cornfield, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) east of St. Paul. They left the bodies in Suggs' Mercedes Benz SUV, abandoned the vehicle in the cornfield and left in Osborne's vehicle. A farmer who owned the cornfield discovered the bodies.",
      "Suggs testified he shot the four in self-defense because he thought they were going to rob him but prosecutors countered that his motive was unclear but he meant to kill them. He was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 103 years in prison in 2023.",
      "A Minnesota judge sentenced Osborne to almost five years in prison in 2022 for helping his son. He'll serve what remains of the Minnesota sentence and the Wisconsin sentence concurrently.",

      "The short phrase seemed aimed at Rubio's vocal criticism of China and its human rights record when he was a U.S. senator, which prompted the Chinese government to put sanctions on him twice in 2020.",
      "It can be translated in various ways \u2014 in the past, the Foreign Ministry has used \u201cmake the right choice\u201d and \u201cbe very prudent about what they say or do\u201d rather than \u201cact accordingly.\u201d",
      "The vagueness allows the phrase to express an expectation and deliver a veiled warning, while also maintaining the courtesy necessary for further diplomatic engagement, said Zichen Wang, a research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a Chinese think tank.",
      "\u201cWhat could appear to be confusing is thus an intended effect originating from Chinese traditional wisdom and classic practice of speech,\u201d said Wang, who is currently in a mid-career master's program at Princeton University.",

      "MONTCLAIR, Va. -- In a wine shop an hour outside of Washington, owner Arthur Lampros sampled a wine from a part of the world that was totally new to him, racking his brain to pin down the tastes on his tongue.",
      "Was there a body of water near the vineyards, he wondered, that would moderate any storms or heat waves buffeting the grapes?",
      "\u201cAbsolutely, absolutely\u201d \u2014 Ukraine's Black Sea coast, near Odesa, said Giorgi Iukuridze, a Ukrainian winery owner introducing Ukraine's modernized wines to a broad U.S. audience for the first time.",
      "Sam Lerman, a U.S. Air Force vet and one of a number of former American military officers and diplomats in Ukraine backing him in the endeavor, nodded, beaming at the words of praise that followed for many of the wines.",
      "Ukraine is in the eyes of the world as it battles the Russian invasion with the aid of the United States and dozens of other countries. But Lerman said he and the others who teamed up with Iukuridze for the U.S. launch want Americans to see \u201cthat Ukraine is more than an ally at war, suffering tremendous tragedy.\u201d",
      "Bringing the wines to the U.S. will help show \u201cwhat Ukraine was really about, and has always been about,\u201d he said.",
      "For Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO who served as President Donald Trump's special representative to Ukraine during a stormy time in his first term, what Ukraine is about is determination, dedication and hope.",
      "\u201cRight now, because of Russia\u2019s invasion and the military assistance the U.S. has given to Ukraine, when people hear and talk about Ukraine, it is all about the war. And it\u2019s a little bit groaning ... like, \u2018Oh, geez, you know, how much more we\u2019re going to spend on this?\u2019'' Volker told The Associated Press.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasions of neighboring countries have served to introduce a whole community of American military people and diplomats to the burgeoning wine regions of the former Soviet Union.",
      "Volker met his winemaker wife, and bought a small winery in Georgia, owing to Russia's 2008 invasion. He traveled often to Iukridze's Shabo winery in Ukraine for production tips.",
      "It was Russia\u2019s invasions of Ukraine, especially in February 2022, that made more American military into fans of the wines of Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea coast, and of the country\u2019s best vodkas.",
      "Lerman, a former technical sergeant decorated for valor in combat in Afghanistan, first went to Ukraine in a team of volunteer military advisers in the first weeks after Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion, and now represents a U.S. defense company there.",
      "Militaries have a venerable history of revering alcohol. U.S. sailors treasure rationed beer at rare \u201csteel beach picnics\u201d on deck. Officers off-duty in Iraq sipped hoarded zero-alcohol beer and pretended it was more. Militias fighting brutal civil wars in West Africa spared the beer factories, if nothing else.",
      "Lerman sampled Ukraine\u2019s alcohol for the first time in a safehouse with other U.S. vet volunteers and Ukrainian allies in the first weeks of the war. Someone had placed a bottle of Ukrainian vodka on the table where they worked, amid the laptops and firearms.",
      "\u201cI was blown away,\u201d Lerman recounted. \u201cI thought I didn\u2019t even like vodka.\u201d",
      "Soon, Lerman was toting out bottles of vodka and Shabo wines for his family and friends back home. Searches of U.S. stores for more struck out, since much of what little Ukrainian wine was shipped to the U.S. was of an older, sweeter variety aimed at the Ukrainian diaspora.",
      "That led to him teaming up with Iukuridze and partners to set up Spyrt Worldwide, a new U.S. import company to bring in Shabo wines and two Ukrainian vodkas. A share of the profits is designated for Invictus Global Response, a mine-removal nonprofit run by veterans.",
      "Ukraine's Black Sea coast claims a 2,500-year history of growing wine thanks to settlements founded by ancient Greeks, and some of the vines at Shabo winery date back to the subsequent Ottoman era. Swiss settlers in the 1800s made Shabo and the area around it a proper wine-growing region, prizing its soil and climate.",
      "Wine under Soviet rule, on the other hand, was \u201cbarely drinkable muck,\u201d said Volker. He sees the region's best wines today as a model for private companies shaking off the Soviet mindset.",
      "Soviet state-run wineries wanted cheap wines in big quantities, especially sweeter ones. Shabo's vines survived a Soviet crackdown on alcohol under Mikhail Gorbachev in the final years before the Soviet collapse thanks only to a Shabo worker who falsified forms, claiming the vineyards produced only table grapes, Iukirdze said.",
      "After the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991, Iukeridze and his father, who have roots in wine production in Georgia, were among the largest producers in an independent Ukraine bringing production up to modern standards. Shabo's wines have won international awards and are featured in Michelin-starred restaurants.",
      "Shabo is far from the front lines of the war, but Russian rockets on rare occasions have fallen within sight of workers in the vineyards, and Shabo\u2019s wine salesmen have faced checkpoints and immediate induction into Ukraine\u2019s military while traveling their sales routes. The most reliable route for shipping the wines to the United States lies through neighboring Moldova.",
      "\u201cThe grape does not wait for any diplomatic solutions,\u201d Iukeridze said. \u201cWe continue working without stopping any single day.\u201d",
      "Over the winter holidays, members of Congress, a former defense secretary, defense industry executives and others, including Lerman and Volker, turned out in Washington for the launch of the import company.",
      "All were attuned to the joint mission of wine and war. Unspoken was the worry about Russia\u2019s larger military grinding down Ukraine, and uncertainty over whether Trump would withdraw vital U.S. military support to Ukraine once back in office.",
      "But Iukeridze told a story: In 2014, when the Russian military first invaded eastern Ukraine and seized Crimea on the Black Sea, a family that lived nearby drove by Shabo's vineyards as they fled toward the border with Moldova.",
      "But the family spotted Shabo's head winemaker out in the field, planting new vines that would take three years to produce wine. They stopped the car.",
      "\u201c\u2018What is happening?\u2019\u201d they asked the winemaker.",
      "\u201c\u2019We\u2019re planting new wines, for Ukrainian, independent, glorious country,\u201d Iukeridze recounted the winemaker answering.",
      "Seeing the commitment to \u201cthe bright future of Ukraine,\u201d the family \u201cturned around the car and went back,\u201d he told those at the Washington launch.",

School officials responded to the agents with the understanding that they were from ICE, amid rumors and reports that the agency was in the community, school district officials said.",
      "The agents were from the Secret Service Chicago Field Office and visited the school while investigating a threat made against a government official they protect, according to statement sent by Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi. He said agents first visited a home in a local neighborhood and then went to the school.",

      "Last week, OpenAI joined a group of other firms who pledged to invest $500bn (\u00a3400bn) in building AI infrastructure in the US.",
      "President Donald Trump, in one of his first announcements since returning to office, called it \"the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history\" that would help keep \"the future of technology\" in the US.",
      "DeepSeek is powered by the open source DeepSeek-V3 model, which its researchers claim was trained for around $6m  - significantly less than the billions spent by rivals.",
      "But this claim has been disputed by others in AI.",
      "The researchers say they use already existing technology, as well as open source code - software that can be used, modified or distributed by anybody free of charge.",
      "DeepSeek's emergence comes as the US is restricting the sale of the advanced chip technology that powers AI to China.",
      "To continue their work without steady supplies of imported advanced chips, Chinese AI developers have shared their work with each other and experimented with new approaches to the technology.",
      "This has resulted in AI models that require far less computing power than before.",
      "It also means that they cost a lot less than previously thought possible, which has the potential to upend the industry.",
      "After DeepSeek-R1 was launched earlier this month, the company boasted of \"performance on par with\" one of OpenAI's latest models when used for tasks such as maths, coding and natural language reasoning.",
      "Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Trump adviser Marc Andreessen described DeepSeek-R1 as \"AI's Sputnik moment\", a reference to the satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957.",
      "At the time, the US was considered to have been caught off-guard by their rival's technological achievement.",
      "DeepSeek's sudden popularity has startled stock markets in Europe and the US.",
      "AI chipmaker Nvidia and its rival Broadcom had plunged 18% midway through trading on Monday.",
      "Other tech firms also sank, with Microsoft down 2.5% and Google's owner Alphabet down over 4%.",
      "In Europe, Dutch chip equipment maker ASML ended Monday's trading with its share price down by more than 7% while shares in Siemens Energy, which makes hardware related to AI, had plunged by a fifth.",
      "\"This idea of a low-cost Chinese version hasn't necessarily been forefront, so it's taken the market a little bit by surprise,\" said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index.",
      "\"So, if you suddenly get this low-cost AI model, then that's going to raise concerns over the profits of rivals, particularly given the amount that they've already invested in more expensive AI infrastructure.\"",
      "Singapore-based technology equity adviser Vey-Sern Ling told the BBC it could \"potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain\".",
      "But Wall Street banking giant Citi cautioned that while DeepSeek could challenge the dominant positions of American companies such as OpenAI, issues faced by Chinese firms could hamper their development.",
      "\"We estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US access to more advanced chips is an advantage,\" analysts said in a report.",
      "Meanwhile, DeepSeek said on Monday it had been the victim of a cyberattack.",
      "\"Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service,\" it said in a statement.",
      "\"Existing users can log in as usual. Thanks for your understanding and support.\"",
      "Who founded DeepSeek?",
      "The company was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng in Hangzhou, a city in southeastern China.",
      "The 40-year-old, an information and electronic engineering graduate, also founded the hedge fund that backed DeepSeek.",
      "He reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips, now banned from export to China. Experts believe this collection - which some estimates put at 50,000 - led him to launch DeepSeek, by pairing these chips with cheaper, lower-end ones that are still available to import.",
      "Mr Liang was recently seen at a meeting between industry experts and the Chinese premier Li Qiang.",
      "In a July 2024 interview with The China Academy, Mr Liang said he was surprised by the reaction to the previous version of his AI model.",

    "title": "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2025 16:50:28 GMT",
    "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce expansion plans but some question the short-term benefits.",
    "story": [
      "This is a key week for the government and its pledge to grow the UK economy.",
      "On Wednesday, Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to announce plans for a third runway at Heathrow airport as part of measures to propel investment and kick some life into Britain's lacklustre performance.",
      "Growth, Reeves will reiterate, is the priority.",
      "However opponents claim expanding the airport would lead to higher emissions and blight local communities with extra noise and pollution. Last week, Friends of the Earth said it would be \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\".",
      "But is expanding the country's biggest airport the right way to bring an immediate boost to the economy in any case?",
      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and - the airport's owner would argue - provides a vital avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",
      "Expanding the airport would, in theory, provide an avenue for growth that simply isn't there at the moment.",
      "The construction project itself - the biggest privately-funded infrastructure scheme in Europe - would create thousands of jobs.",
      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

      "President Donald Trump has said he thinks the US will gain control of Greenland, underlining his persistent claim on the Arctic island, on one occasion pointing to \"economic security\" as the reason.

      "After sailing for two hours we stepped ashore at a remote valley beneath Nalunaq mountain, where the firm is drilling for gold.",
      "It's also scouring the surrounding mountain range and valleys, hunting for other valuable minerals, having snapped up exploration licences spanning over 10,000 sq km (3,861 sq miles).",
      "\"We're looking for copper, nickel, and rare earths,\" says the Icelandic boss. \"This is uncharted, and still has the potential to have multiple big deposits.\"",
      "The base camp is a cluster of mobile buildings and bright orange accommodation tents housing more than 100 staff, including Greenlanders, Australians, and British former coal miners. From there a road climbs up the valley, and we drive by car into the gold mine, following a dark tunnel upwards inside the mountain.",

      "Amaroq is confident that the mine will now be profitable. And it plans to ramp up production this year, where it has built a brand new processing plant to crush the ore and refine the precious metal into gold bars.",
      "\"We can either walk off site every month with a suitcase of gold, versus a 30,000 tonne ship [carrying the ore],\" explains Mr Olafsson.",
      "He says that Greenland presents an unrivalled opportunity because its huge mineral reserves are largely untouched.",
      "\"It can be the supplier of all the minerals the Western world will need for decades,\" adds Mr Olafsson. \"And that is a very unique position.\"",
      "Yet currently there are just two active mines on the entire island.",
      "Greenland is a self-governing territory that is part of Denmark, but controls its own natural resources.",
      "It's endowed with the eighth largest reserves of so-called rare earth elements, which are vital for making everything from mobile phones to batteries and electric motors. It also has large amounts of other key metals, such as lithium and cobalt.",
      "There is oil and gas too, but new drilling is banned, while deep-sea mining has also been ruled out.",
      "Christian Kjeldsen, director of Greenland's Business Association, says that the global \"geopolitical situation right now is driving interest in the world's biggest island\".",
      "He points to China having the world's largest reserves of rare earth metals, while the West wants to secure alternative supplies.",

      "Trump ramps up threats to gain control of Greenland and Panama Canal",
      "That has fuelled a growing focus among Western nations to get access to Greenland's minerals. China has also been keen to get involved, but its presence is limited.",
      "Reuters recently reported that the US lobbied an Australian mining firm not to sell Greenland's biggest rare earth project to potential Chinese buyers.",

      "She adds: \"We're used to being a hotspot for the climate crisis. We want to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Permits have now been given for 100 blocs across Greenland, where companies are searching for viable deposits. British, Canadian and Australian mining firms are the biggest foreign licence holders, while Americans hold just one.",
      "But there are many more steps before these sites become potential mines.",
      "Yet while Greenland may be sitting on mineral riches, any \"gold rush\" continues to be slow to materialise.",
      "The economy, which has an annual GDP of just over $3bn (\u00a32.4bn), is still driven by the public sector and fishing. And the territory also relies on an annual $600m subsidy from Denmark.",
      "Greenland's politicians hope that mining revenues will reduce reliance on the annual $600m subsidy from Denmark, and help boost independence efforts. But in the meantime Greenland is making more money from tourism.",
      "Officially mining is still important for independence, says Javier Arnaut, head of Arctic Social Sciences at Greenland University. \"But in practical terms, you can see that there are very few mining licenses awarded.\"",
      "Ms Nathanielsen concedes that while there are partnerships being developed with the US and EU, \"we still have not seen large amounts of money flowing into this sector\". She hopes that there will be another three to five mines operating within the next decade.",
      "However mining is not easy in Greenland because of its remote geography and weather. It's the world's largest island and 80% of it is covered by an ice sheet. It has rugged mountains and no roads between settlements.",
      "\"It's an arctic terrain,\" says Jakob Kl\u00f8ve Keiding, from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, which has mapped the territory's deposits. \"We have problems with harsh conditions in terms of the climate and limited infrastructure. So it's quite expensive to open a mine.\"",
      "Those high costs, coupled with low global metal prices, have held back investors.",
      "Others blame red tape for the sector's slow growth. The territory has strict environmental regulations and social impact requirements, and getting permits can take time.",
      "Ms Nathanielsen maintains that most communities do support mining, and that it boosts local economies. \"They [overseas miners] are shopping in the local shop. They're employing local employees. They're chartering a local boat or helicopter,\" she says.",
      "Yet in the south's biggest town, Qaqortoq, resident Heidi Mortensen M\u00f8ller is sceptical whether new mines will lead to employment for locals. \"When they say they're going to add jobs, who are they talking about?\"",
      "Jess Berthelsen, head of local labour union, SIK, says that many people think mining income \"will leave the country\", and not benefit Greenland. But he supports the growth of the sector. \"Greenland needs more income and to earn money from other ways than fishing.\"",
      "It's unclear how Trump's latest gambit on Greenland will play out. However, the territory's prime minister Mute Egede said earlier this month that \"we need to do business with the US\" and that it was \"doors open in terms of mining\".",
      "Mr Kjeldsen from the business association, hopes it will be bring \"much needed investment\" to the sector. \"On the other hand, if the uncertainty surrounding the signals from Trump drag on for a longer period, there is a risk that this might impact the investment environment negatively.\"",

    "summary": "The chancellor raised taxes in the Budget - but now she wants to get rid of barriers to business. Why the change of focus?",
    "story": [
      "Rachel Reeves is suddenly in a rush.",
      "She'd hate the comparison, but the way she's been talking over recent weeks sounds more like a Conservative chancellor.",
      "She wants to get rid of barriers to business and make it harder for green groups to put the brakes on big development. She's easing off plans to make life more expensive for wealthy non-doms \u2013 and is expected to approve new airport runways and cut welfare.",
      "It doesn't sound much like Reeves' Budget in October, in which she raised whopping taxes, increased spending on public services and reminded us, time and time again, how much trouble the economy was in and how the Conservatives \u2013 she claimed \u2013 had left that fabled \u00a322bn black hole.",
      "So why the switch in focus?",
      "Treasury insiders say in private that almost as soon as she sat down after the Budget, she was banging the table with officials and pushing for more ideas to get the economy growing. After all, she and Sir Keir Starmer always said growth was their priority.",
      "The plan for her big speech next Wednesday \u2013 in which she is expected to unveil more changes to cut back planning rules and announce a new runway at London's Heathrow \u2013 was hatched back then, and she's only come under more pressure since to respond to the howls of business.",
      "One City source told me: \"Labour did a great job of pretending to be pro-business up until [the Budget]. No one would say they are now.\"",
      "Ouch!",
      "The metrics that measure how the government is doing in their touted top priority \u2013 making the UK more prosperous \u2013 are patchy at best, and bleak at worst. We had a wobble in the markets and warnings of a \"doom loop\" on the way.",

      "As one FTSE chief executive told me: \"There's been nervousness about this year, sentiment has definitely got worse, with a lack of a positive drum beat.\"",
      "There's also been \"argy bargy\" with the unions, one union leader told me, with \"robust conversations\" about the best way to get the economy going, and where to spend public money to support growth. \"The bottom line is that growth is anaemic \u2013 they need to massively invest,\" they say.",

      "Faisal Islam: Soaring UK borrowing costs are a problem for Rachel Reeves",
      "Inside Number 11, there's a suggestion that the jitters have been helpful, because it's restored a \"sense of urgency and put the focus back on the Treasury\".",
      "Sources say it's enabled Reeves to make the argument more strongly to her colleagues for things like another runway at Heathrow.",
      "Others also say Reeves' new push reflects that she and the rest of the Cabinet are no longer apprentices, and are settled into their roles.",
      "The need to \"move at speed is much clearer\", a senior source told me. Another said \"the market wobble brought that frustration to the fore \u2013 we talked about growth for a long time\u2026 I think its begun to put rocket boosters under that\".",
      "But didn't Starmer's tribe tell you and me hundreds of times in opposition that they were ready to hit the ground running? The evidence from their first months in government is that wasn't exactly true and that masterplan we were told existed wasn't real after all.",
      "A Whitehall source said \"they lost time because the preparing for government team wasn't really preparing for government - they had the opportunity to come in and show what they were made of and they fluffed it\", leading to a \"meandering approach\".",

      "You'd be forgiven if this sudden rush of positivity and love for swashbuckling business feels a bit confusing.",
      "Broadly speaking, the government has taxed, spent and borrowed heavily, even though they say they want to concentrate on growing the economy.",
      "They say now they want to sweep away rules - but at the same time they are increasing regulation for employers to give workers more rights, on landlords, and even want to regulate football. And on green energy, plans for a national energy company are a huge state intervention.",
      "To help get growth going, ministers would point to planning changes, or their plan to woo big AI companies, even though none other than Sir Paul McCartney notes that's far from straightforward.",

      "In government, there's a belief that better news on wage growth and a tolerable level of inflation has been under-acknowledged. Tomorrow in our studio, and in her big speech on Wednesday, Reeves will try to give you the impression that she is brimming with optimism and in a hurry to get the economy going, so that jobs can be created, the government's tax coffers filled and, ultimately, voters might regain a long-lost feel-good factor.",

      "World leaders, the bosses of the world's biggest companies and a sprinkling of celebrities gathered in the small Swiss mountain town of Davos for the annual World Economic Forum this week.",
      "On the other side of the Atlantic, President Donald Trump was starting his political comeback as the new US president.",
      "\"Nothing will stand in our way\", he declared, as he vowed to end America's \"decline\".",
      "Towards the end of the gathering, President Trump was beamed in straight from the White House webcam to deliver his message of world domination directly to the global elite.",
      "While he charmed, almost seduced the audience with a credible picture of a booming US economy about to scale new technological heights, he simultaneously menaced with threats of tariffs to those who did not choose to shift their factories into the US.",
      "Trillions of dollars of tariffs for the US Treasury for those businesses exporting into the US market from foreign factories.",
      "\"Your prerogative\" he said, with a smile not out of place in a Godfather movie. And then for one of his own, the Bank of America chief Brian Moynihan, a remarkable public lashing accusing the lending giant of \"debanking\" many of his conservative supporters.",
      "He awkwardly mumbled about sponsoring the World Cup.",
      "In this first week of his second term, most people at Davos were nodding along, as they cannot think what else to do, just yet.",
      "Two worlds colliding, as the 'America First' President was beamed in like a 30-foot interplanetary emperor, into the beating heart of the rules-based international economic order.",
      "It is one thing suggesting that trade deficits are a problem with your domestic electorate. It is quite another to suggest at an internationalist forum that a G7 ally, Canada, become a state of your nation, eliciting gasps in the audience, and not just from Canadians.",
      "The address was, by design, charming and offensive. There was carrot and stick for the rest of the world.",
      "As delegates absorbed the mix of threats, invites and on occasion, praise, many appeared to be trying to decide just how much Trump might damage the global trading system, whilst assessing just how far ahead his America is getting in this tech driven AI boom.",
      "Davos has been for this first week the alternative pole of the Trump second term.",
      "There was a coherence to his agenda to use every means to drive down energy prices including by pressurising the Saudis on oil.",
      "This he said would not just help to lower inflation, but also drain Russia's war coffers of oil dollars to help end the Ukraine war, by economic means. The ceasefire in the Middle East has already bought Trump some geopolitical credibility in these circles.",
      "Christine Lagarde, David Miliband, and John Kerry shuffled into the hall. Various bank chiefs assembled on stage to praise and then lightly question the President.",
      "The bottom line was this: Is president Trump serious about what sounded like campaign trail threats to the world economic system? The answer will reverberate for the next four years and beyond.",
      "The answer sounded like a most definitely, yes. However, this does not mean it is going to work.",
      "Some leading US CEOs told me that they were preparing for tit-for-tat retaliatory tariffs to be applied to their exports. Their assumption was that the President's love of a rising stock market would restrict his deployment of tariffs.",
      "But no one really knows. In any event, much is up for grabs. He has already withdrawn from the World Health Organisation.",
      "In the promenades the whisper was of his Project 2025 allies suggesting US withdrawal from the IMF and the World Bank too.",
      "The rest of the world does have some counter leverage, once it decides to get back up after the Trump whirlwind.",
      "The Canadians are now briefing on their retaliatory tariffs. In conversations with both the British business secretary and EU trade minister, Jonathan Reynolds and European Union trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, I detected a desire for calm dialogue.",
      "Both are making similar arguments to try to dissuade Trump from wider tariffs.",
      "Mr Reynolds told me that as the US does not have a goods trade deficit with the UK, there is no need for tariffs.",
      "Mr Sefcovic said that the US should really think about its services surplus too.",
      "But do they not consider the threats to G7 and Nato allies Canada and Denmark (over Greenland) to be straightforwardly unacceptable and as absurd as France claiming back Louisiana? Sefcovic did not want to whip anything up.",
      "Diplomats are making lists of US goods that Europe can now purchase to demonstrate \"wins\" for President Trump, from arms to gas to the magnets in wind turbines.",
      "It might make some sense for the rest of the G7 to work in unison on retaliation against the tariffs, in order to concentrate the minds of Congress, and the competing factions inside the court of Trump.",
      "There is no sign of that happening.",
      "The US tech supremacy story epitomised by the broligarchy \u2013 including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, Apple leader Tim Cook, and Google chief Sundar Pichar -  had top seats at the inauguration this week.",
      "While the US is streets ahead of Europe, its standing against China is more uncertain.",
      "One of the talks of Davos was DeepSeek's high performing, much cheaper AI model, made in China. The prediction that the tech bros would be tearing strips out of each other in the court of Trump began to come true within hours, rather than months.",
      "Meanwhile, while most, though not all, here in Davos sounded rather seduced by Trump's tech-fuelled optimism, some in Europe also see a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to attract top researchers who may be rather less than enamoured with the direction of US politics. It was openly suggested by the European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde.",
      "Others sought solace in the fact that Europe no longer has to face Biden's massive green subsidies, creating a more level playing field again for Europe.",

    "summary": "All homes with external wall insulation fitted under two government schemes will be contacted by the energy regulator.",
    "story": [
      "Serious and systemic problems have been found in homes insulated under government schemes, according to the Minister for Energy Consumers.",
      "An audit of homes that have had external wall insulation since 2022 found ''widespread cases of poor-quality installations that did not meet the required standard'', Miatta Fahnbulleh told Parliament.",
      "She added that 39 businesses have now been suspended from the government schemes as a result of poor-quality work.",
      "Some 65,000 households in the UK have had solid wall insulation installed under two government schemes - ECO4 and the Great British Insulation Scheme - since 2022.",
      "All homes that have had external wall insulation fitted under the schemes would be contacted by the energy regulator Ofgem, the minister said, with repair work overseen by the regulator and the cost met by installers.",
      "The audit, which was carried out by the independent organisation Trustmark found problems ranging from missing or incomplete paperwork to more serious problems such as exposed insulation and poor ventilation which, if not fixed, could lead to damp and mould. In some cases, serious health and safety concerns were raised such as wires not being fitted properly.",
      "Last year the BBC highlighted the case of Tormuja Khatun, whose Luton home has been consumed by black mould, mushrooms and dry rot after the botched installation of external wall insulation. Her family told the BBC they had been warned it could cost more than \u00a3100,000 to repair and described the situation as a \"nightmare\".",
      "In total more than three million homes have been insulated under government schemes and the BBC reported last year that hundreds of thousands of them could have insulation that wasn't installed to the required standard.",
      "A growing number of MPs are worried about the impact on their constituents of poorly installed insulation, while Citizens Advice has called on the government to \"urgently fix\" regulation of the sector.",
      "In a statement to the House of Commons, Fahnbulleh said: ''The government is moving fast to protect households. But I have to be honest with the House - these issues are the result of years of failure in a system that must be reformed.",
      "\"I know that this will be concerning for families who have had solid wall insulation fitted through these schemes. Getting this sorted out is our number one priority. We are determined to make sure families are never let down in this way again.''",
      "But some MPs voiced their concerns that the government did not announce a review of other insulation schemes, such as those involving cavity wall insulation and spray foam insulation.",
      "Fahnbulleh said audits of other forms of insulation had not shown the \"systemic failure'' found with solid wall installations.",
      "The minister's statement was welcomed by the Energy Saving Trust (EST), which has been calling for a national expert advice service in England to provide all households with impartial, tailored advice.",
      "\"It's equally important that steps are now taken to strengthen consumer protection and support going forward, to ensure households have confidence when upgrading their homes,\" said Stew Horne, head of policy at the EST."

    "published": "Sat, 25 Jan 2025 02:26:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Maxime Chapoutier makes wines that combine French and Australian grapes, a strict no-no in the EU.",
    "story": [
      "Winemaker Maxime Chapoutier would be arrested if he tried to sell two of his newest wines in his native France.",
      "\"There would likely be outrage about these wines in France, and that would be a good thing,\" he says. \"Sometimes you need to be provocative to drive change.\"",
      "The two bottles in question, one white and one red, would be illegal in France because they are made from a blend of French and Australian base wines.",
      "Under both French and European Union law it is forbidden to make a wine that combines EU and non-EU fruit. In France in particular, authorities take such things very seriously.",
      "The French wine industry has a celebrated word called \"terroir\", which applies to all the environmental factors that affect vines growing in a vineyard, such the soil, the climate, and the elevation. As a result, wines from a specific place are held in the highest esteem.",
      "Add a strict appellation or classification system for France's wine regions, and the thought of blending French and Australian wine to create a global hybrid would horrify many French wine lovers.",
      "Yet Maxime has done just this, and it is all thanks to one word - Brexit.",
      "For while he cannot sell the two wines in the EU, he can do so in the UK now that London no longer has to follow food and drink rules set by Brussels.",
      "Maxime has created the wines in partnership with UK online retailer The Wine Society, where they are called Hemispheres Red and Hemispheres White. The red is made from syrah grapes, or shiraz as they are called in Australia, while the white is a blend of marsanne and viognier varieties.",
      "The Australian red and white wine components are shipped in bulk to the UK, where they are blended with wine from France's northern Rhone and Roussillon regions before bottling.",
      "Maxime who works for his family's celebrated Rhone-based wine company Chapoutier, say that while he respects France's focus on terroir, there should be room for global blends to also be sold.",
      "\"Chapoutier has been making wine for more than 200 years, very terroir driven, and biodynamic,\" he says. \"But more and more people are turning their back on French wines because they don't understand the complicated appellation rules.",
      "\"We need to adapt for consumers and make wines more accessible, which international blends can help to do. Maybe the EU law will change. It is also more ecological to ship wine from Australia to Europe in bulk, as you don't have the weight of all the glass bottles.\"",
      "Another wine company now making wines by combining grapes from two continents is Australian firm Penfolds. It sells reds made from both Australian and Californian grapes, and others that mix Australian and French. Again they cannot be sold in the EU, but they can in the UK, US, Australia and elsewhere.",
      "Penfolds refers to these blends as \"wine of the world\", and says that they \"possess an otherness that can best be described as worldly\". Whatever that is supposed to mean.",
      "Unsurprisingly, some more traditional winemakers are not in favour of this development. One such person is Jas Swan, an independent winemaker based in Germany.",
      "While the two-continent blends from Chapoutier and Penfolds are made with care from quality grapes, and priced accordingly, she is fearful that if the trend grows it will mean a lot more cheap, low-grade wine going on sale.",
      "\"I believe that those types of wine would have nothing left of any terroir, even before they left their continent,\" she says. \"Those wines would have seen only machine work, heavy additions to keep them clean, and are manufactured to be easy to drink for the masses.",
      "\"Why can consumers not be more demanding? The consumerism is insane.\"",
      "Peter Richards, who holds the top global wine industry qualification, the master of wine (MW), is also sniffy. \"The notion of cross-country blending for wine isn't something I find outrageous in itself,\" he says. \"My concern is more that this is about creating novelty for novelty's sake.\"",
      "His wife, Susie Barrie, who is also an MW, adds: \"I remain to be convinced that a wine made by blending grapes from different countries can be great in terms of taste.\"",
      "By contrast, wine writer Jamie Goode says that development of two-continent wine \"is actually quite a fun idea\".",
      "\"If the wines are good, and made well from good vineyard sites - and not simply a gimmick blending together cheap bulk wines and then slapping a huge margin on the wine - then this is quite interesting.",
      "\"The fundamental basis for fine wine is the notion of terroir - that wines come from a place, and their flavour expresses this place in unique ways. But not all wines have to be terroir wines, and there's room for wines like this.",
      "\"In some ways, there's a lot of skill required to blend the right wines together to create something interesting coming from such different places.\"",
      "Pierre Mansour, head of buying for The Wine Society, says he and his colleagues came up with the idea of creating two wines made from grapes from different continents as part of the company's 150th birthday celebrations.",
      "\"We were thinking about the future of wine, and we wanted to do something innovative. In the end we thought that one area of innovation is blending, of creating a wine that can mitigate for the impact of climate change on a particular country.",
      "\"And from a carbon footprint out of view, it is more environmentally friendly to ship wine in bulk from Australia to the UK. But at the same time we did expect 'terroirists' to say 'hold on this is fundamentally against the French principle of wine'.",
      "\"So we approached Chapoutier, thinking that they might say 'are you mad, how dare you insult us', but they were great. They were really enthusiastic.\""

    "summary": "New research says internship opportunities increasingly favour those from a middle class background.",
    "story": [
      "Unpaid and low-paid internships are \"unfair\" to working-class graduates, students say, as a new study suggests that these opportunities increasingly favour those from a middle-class background.",
      "Research from the Sutton Trust, a social mobility charity, says the gap between the two demographics is growing - driven by employers continuing to underpay interns, and giving opportunities to family and friends rather than advertising them.",
      "A poll of more than 1,200 recent graduates shows half have undertaken an internship, an increase of 12% since 2018, but the gap between working-class and middle-class graduates has widened in that time from 12% to 20%.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, one student says she has had to turn down \"potentially wonderful\" opportunities as she was not able to afford working for free.",
      "Erin Cruickshank, 20, said one of those was an unpaid internship in London last summer that she ultimately turned down.",
      "The cost of staying in the capital - where she had no family or friends to stay with - would have left her \"worse off,\" she said.",
      "The 20-year-old, from West Lothian, called the situation \"unjust and unfair\".",
      "Unpaid \"or unfairly paid\" positions are commonplace, Erin said, and many take place in \"affluent areas\" like London.",
      "\"I've had to turn down experiences - potentially wonderful ones - because I couldn't stay in London to have them,\" she added.",
      "The proportion of working-class graduates completing an internship is now 36%, compared to 55% for their middle-class peers, the Sutton Trust said.",
      "Graduates in London were significantly more likely to have undertaken an internship than those in the West Midlands, Yorkshire, Scotland and Wales, its research showed.",
      "Around three-fifths of internships undertaken by recent graduates were unpaid or underpaid, the study indicated.",
      "Erin, a French and social anthropology student, decided to take a paid position at a charity in Edinburgh for the summer rather than an unpaid role.",
      "She said: \"To others who search for larger internships - from their perspective, maybe that wasn't the best choice. But for me it was\u2026 I had a great experience.\"",
      "Since she often funds her own accommodation at the University of St Andrews she only applies for paid positions. She is currently on a year abroad working in France.",
      "\"If that means I'm not taking experiences in what others might consider a large name or big business, I take experiences I know will still expand my skillset and help me take steps towards my future.\"",
      "In many cases, those undertaking unpaid internships were able to do so because they received money from parents, lived at home or with family or friends, or used savings, the Sutton Trust's research found.",
      "Chiera Mclaughlin, a fourth year law student at the University of Glasgow, said the decision for many was \"balancing whether you want to get experience in the industry you want to work in, or if you have money for food\".",
      "\"There's not that freedom to accept unpaid positions,\" she added.",
      "From her experience in the law industry, she said that paid internships were \"rare\" and \"to get any early work experience in law, it's expected that you wouldn't get paid for it\".",
      "The Sutton Trust's research also found that internships were almost twice as likely to have been found through family and friends in an organisation compared to an advertisement, further contributing to the widening access gap.",
      "\"If I was trying to get experience in say corporate law or at a law firm of some sort, it seems really difficult to even get your foot in the door if you don't maybe know someone there,\" Chiera, who is now doing a paid internship in an adjacent sector, agreed.",
      "\"I'm the first person from my family to go to uni and I don't really have any family connections, or anyone in my social circle, that's in the industry.\"",
      "As part of its 'Make Work Pay' plan issued before the election, Labour said it wanted to ban unpaid internships, aside from those that form part of an education or training course. Details on when that might happen have not been confirmed.",
      "Politics student Erin Dunne said \"pretty much every internship\" she had come across in the sector was unpaid.",
      "The 20-year-old works at a bar alongside her studies in Cardiff, and said she had to miss shifts to take part in an unpaid politics scheme in London.",
      "\"A train from Cardiff to London and back is nearly \u00a3100,\" she said, \"so I haven't been able to attend as much as I'd like to\".",
      "She added most paid opportunities take place in the summer - the time \"for the majority of people who go to uni and are working class... you work full-time to fund being at uni\".",
      "\"The pay you'd be getting is lower than working your normal job.\"",
      "Another hurdle was a \"huge gap in connections\" between middle-class and working-class students, she said.",
      "\"I know someone who's studying law who just received an internship through his dad at a top law firm.",
      "\"I've tried to contact PR agencies, political communication places... they just turn you away.\"",

Cambridge University Press and Assessment (CUP&A), one of the UK's biggest exam providers, has been setting papers since the 1850s and its English exams have now been taken by more than 100 million people around the world. But today's exam is very different to that very first paper.",
      "In 1913, three people sat down to take the first Cambridge English exam. They were all teachers and all of them failed. But would you? This is one of the questions - you can find the answers at the end.",
      "Correct or justify four of the following sentences, giving your reasons:",
      "(a) I hope you are determined to seriously improve.",
      "(b) Comparing Shakespeare with Aeschylus, the former is by no means inferior to the latter.",

      "(d) The statement was incorrect, as any one familiar with the spot, and who was acquainted with the facts, will admit.",
      "(e) It has the largest circulation of any paper in England.",
      "(f) The lyrical gifts of Shakespeare are woven into the actual language of the characters.",
      "The exam comprised a series of papers on phonetics, grammar, and translation, which took 12 hours to complete.",
      "\"At first, it was an exam for a small elite who wanted to study English as an academic subject, like Latin or Ancient Greek,\" says Dr Evelina Galaczi, director of research at CUP&A.",
      "\"At the time, grammar and translation were considered the most important thing, but now the exam is much more about using English to communicate.",
      "\"The shift was gradual, but in the Second World War English became a global language and so speaking and pronunciation became much more important.",
      "\"That was a catalyst for change, and I firmly believe that learning English opens doors.\"",
      "By the 1950s, there had been requests for the English exam to offer translation questions in dozens of different languages, ranging from Arabic to Vietnamese.",
      "Gillian Cooke, group archivist at CUP&A, said: \" I think the take up for each language was quite small and so that probably wasn't cost effective.",
      "\"It might be one of the reasons why the translation paper was dropped in the 1970s.\"",
      "The Cambridge English exam has continued to evolve.",
      "There are now different versions tailored to the needs of schools, higher education, and businesses.",
      "\"More than 100 million people across 130 countries have now sat our English exams,\" says marketing director for higher education, Ian Cook.",
      "\"They're recognised by more than 25,000 organisations from governments - which use them for immigration purposes - to employers and universities.",
      "\"Some universities in Germany, Sweden, and East Asia, for example, deliver IT and healthcare courses in English in order to attract the best candidates and so students need to show they have the language skills to cope with the course.\"",
      "Today, the exams are also available digitally and artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to create adaptive tests.",
      "\"In simple terms, the next question you're served up depends on how well you answered the previous one,\" says Mr Cook.",
      "\"And by offering a range of slightly more difficult and then easier questions as you go through, the technology will help to find your level.",
      "\"Our expertise and research have proven that the more teaching and tests are personalised, the better for students.",
      "\"We want people to have confidence, to pass - and show what they're capable of.\"",

      "How did you do?",
      "CUP&A says opinions about correct English grammar have changed, but in 1913, these would have been the expected answers:",
      "(a) This is a split infinitive which would have been considered wrong. It should have said \"to improve seriously\"",
      "(b) This is a hanging participle. It should have read \"Shakespeare is by no means inferior to Aeschylus\". Now we would say \"Shakespeare is just as good as\".",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 01:01:43 GMT",
    "summary": "A number of tracks that didn't make a big impact when they were first released have now become hits.",
    "story": [
      "When the lists of the most successful songs of 2024 in the charts, streaming and social media were revealed recently, they included the expected big hitters and some evergreen classics. But sprinkled among them was a different type of hit song.",
      "A number of tracks that failed to make a big impact when they were first released, mostly in the 2010s, have since bubbled up and become firm favourites.",
      "The rise of these slow-burning sleeper hits in recent years is \"one of the most fascinating trends right now\", says Stuart Dredge, head of insight at Music Ally.",
      "Here is our guide to the biggest 2010s sleeper hits.",
      "The Night We Met - Lord Huron (2015)",
      "This song only reached number 77 in the UK at the time of release, but was the 60th most popular song in 2024, according to the Official Charts Company's end-of-year list - above Charli XCX's biggest track. It was even higher on Spotify's global end-of-year chart, at 24.",
      "The LA folk-rock group's song first took off after being used in the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack in 2018, and with aching lyrics harking back to the start of a relationship, it has since been recycled in various TikTok memes and Molly-Mae Hague's pregnancy announcement video in 2022 (even though it's actually a break-up song). Cosmopolitan put it top of its playlist of Sad Songs to Blast When You're Feeling Hella Moody.",
      "Sweater Weather - The Neighbourhood (2012)",
      "This one reached the US top 20 but missed the UK top 40. It has snowballed on social media and is now the seventh most-streamed song in Spotify history, spending more than three years in total in its global daily top 50. The California band say the autumnal theme made it an \"accidental seasonal hit\", and it has also been adopted as a bisexual anthem.",
      "Champagne Coast - Blood Orange (2011)",
      "Champagne Coast didn't chart originally but British singer Dev Hynes' seductive \"come to my bedroom\" refrain was used in TV show Euphoria's soundtrack in 2019, and then the song blew up on TikTok last summer. It was the most popular old song on the platform in 2024 and sixth overall on Billboard's end-of-year TikTok chart. It finally reached the UK top 20 in July.",
      "Evergreen - Richy Mitch & the Coal Miners (2017)",
      "Evergreen is just 87 seconds long and didn't chart originally, but became the go-to song for \"hopecore\" videos offering snippets of positivity and optimism on TikTok last year. It spent 35 weeks in the UK top 60 in 2024, and was in the overall end-of-year top 100.",
      "Lovely - Billie Eilish (2018)",
      "Released on the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack, this track didn't reach the UK or US top 40s, but Eilish's delicate duet with Khalid is now her most-streamed song, and 14th on Spotify's all-time list. It is apparently, among other things, good for sending you to sleep.",
      "I Wanna Be Yours - Arctic Monkeys (2013)",
      "I Wanna Be Yours was on the hit AM album but only reached 99 in the UK as a single. However, last year it had more Spotify plays than any other song over a decade old. TikTok users have chosen the melodramatic chorus to soundtrack their romantic declarations.",
      "The Sound of Silence - Disturbed (2015)",
      "Hard rock band Disturbed's brooding but beautiful cover of the Simon and Garfunkel classic has now spent eight months in the UK top 60 in the past year, helped by a dance remix and a TikTok shuffle dance trend.",
      "See You Again by Tyler, the Creator (2017)",
      "See You Again didn't chart at the time but took off on TikTok (where else?), with one snippet turning into a personality quiz (do you sing along with Tyler's \"OK OK OK OK\" or guest vocalist Kali Uchis' \"La la la la\"?). The song finally reached number 21 in the UK in 2023, and was the 19th most-streamed song on Spotify in the US in 2024.",
      "Songs from all eras have been resurfacing for several years, of course.",
      "Many were hits to start with. Mr Brightside by The Killers (2004) is a fixture, while Kate Bush's Running Up That Hill (1985) and Sophie Ellis-Bextor's Murder on the Dancefloor (2001) shot back up the charts thanks to TV and film soundtracks.",
      "But when it comes to songs that weren't as big the first time around, the 2010s dominate.",
      "One reason is that people who grew up in those years are introducing their favourite tunes to others, according to Sarah Kloboves from music data analysts Chartmetric.",
      "\"This revival is pioneered by these older Gen Z listeners [in their mid-20s]. But when they start to create these trends, you also have the younger Gen Zs and even Gen Alpha [young teens and below] that are hearing these songs for the first time - the release date is interesting because it's old, but it's not too old.\"",
      "Dredge agrees: \"A lot of the influencers on places like TikTok are a few years older, so they are probably using songs from the 2010s that soundtracked their teenage years.\"",
      "Taylor Swift's Cruel Summer (2019) could even be described as a sleeper hit - it wasn't released as an official single at the time, but eventually reached number one in 2023 and was the fifth-biggest song of 2024 overall on Apple Music.",
      "Others, though, are not such obvious hits. Musically, most sound quite restrained and atmospheric - they're emotive soundtrack songs rather than upbeat bangers or full-blooded anthems.",
      "\"These aren't songs that were released with the intention of being a pop hit,\" Kloboves says.",
      "\"Not to bash on pop music or pop stars, but sometimes they all sort of sound the same. But I think a lot of these songs are very different from what you might usually hear in the mainstream,\" she says.",
      "\"I think that's why listeners really resonate with them, because they're slightly unique and different-sounding.\"",
      "Eight more sleeper hits:",
      "Pink + White by Frank Ocean (2016)No Role Modelz by J Cole (2014)Jocelyn Flores by XXXTentacion (2017)All I Want by Kodaline (2012)Lovers Rock by TV Girl (2014)Space Song by Beach House (2015)Apocalypse by Cigarettes After Sex (2017)Freaks by Surf Curse (2013)",

      "Space Song by Beach House (2015)",
      "Apocalypse by Cigarettes After Sex (2017)",
      "Freaks by Surf Curse (2013)",
      "Many of these songs owe their belated success to TikTok, and tracks that take off \"evoke some kind of emotional response\" in the listener, the platform's UK head of music partnerships Toyin Mustapha believes.",
      "\"It's having something that emotionally resonates. That could be a lyric. It could be the way that the instrumental lands.\"",
      "And our relationship with music has changed. When packaging songs with clips on social media, fans are choosing them as soundtracks to evocative moments.",
      "\"It's no longer passive listening,\" Mustapha adds. \"People are really active participants in the culture. And they're active because they are taking this music and essentially reimagining it in their own way.\"",
      "Record labels do try to help back-catalogue songs become sleeper hits, but it normally happens organically thanks to fans, Dredge says.",
      "\"One of the things you can see is it's songs that lend themselves to a feeling or mood. It often is a particular line from the song that is the thing that is picked up on and goes viral,\" he says.",
      "\"There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it other than they suddenly feel relevant to someone in a way that other people appreciate.\"",
      "Sometimes, it's simply that a great song didn't get the attention it deserved at the time: \"Part of it is just that a brilliant song can connect with people, no matter how long ago it was made.\""

      "The fantasy graphic novel and science fiction writer - whose books Good Omens, American Gods and The Sandman have been adapted for television - was the subject of a New York Magazine cover story.",
      "The magazine and its website Vulture reported allegations from eight women, four of whom also previously accused Gaiman of sexual assault in July 2024 on Master, a Tortoise Media podcast.",
      "One of the women reportedly alleged that when babysitting the author's five-year-old child, he offered her a bath in his garden before joining her in the tub naked, asking her to sit on his lap before sexually assaulting her.",
      "While the article states that all of the accusers had at some point played along with Gaiman's desires to some extent by calling him \"master\" and continuing to communicate with him, the women reportedly alleged that consent and specific BDSM activities which they say took place had not been discussed and agreed upon prior to them happening.",
      "Gaiman's representative's previously told Tortoise that \"sexual degradation, bondage, domination, sadism and masochism may not be to everyone's taste, but between consenting adults, BDSM is lawful\".",
      "Gaiman has since denied all of the allegations made against him, posting on his blog on 14 January: \"I've stayed quiet until now, both out of respect for the people who were sharing their stories and out of a desire not to draw even more attention to a lot of misinformation.",
      "\"As I read through this latest collection of accounts, there are moments I half-recognise and moments I don't, descriptions of things that happened sitting beside things that emphatically did not happen.\"",

    "story": [
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on Friday in Los Angeles, where the rapper is accused of firing a gun at a former friend.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, faces up to 24 years in prison if convicted on two felony assault charges in the 2021 incident near a Hollywood hotel.",
      "In opening statements on Friday, prosecutors described the rapper as the aggressor and claimed he orchestrated a plan to shoot his childhood friend following a disagreement.",
      "The Grammy-nominated hip-hop star, who is also a fashion mogul and the longtime partner of singer Rihanna, has pleaded not guilty and denied the allegations.",
      "The victim, fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, testified last year that bullets grazed his knuckles when the rapper opened fire in his direction in Hollywood, just one block from the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame. He said he decided to seek medical treatment at a hospital after flying back to New York.",
      "Authorities say the shooting happened on 6 November in 2021 after a \"heated discussion\" in Hollywood between the rapper and Terell Ephron, who were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "A jury of seven women and five men was selected over the course of three days this week before the opening arguments kicked off on Friday.",
      "Mr Mayers, attending the trial in a grey suit, was joined by some members of his family on Friday, but notably absent was singer Rihanna, who he shares two children with. It's unclear whether she might appear at the trial, but the rapper's attorney told the court this week that Mr Mayers has tried to keep his family away from all of this.",
      "Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec opened the trial on Friday with a detailed presentation of video evidence, describing the case against the rapper as straightforward. \"What will become almost instantly clear is that this is not a complicated case,\" he told the jury.",
      "Mr Mayers, along with two friends and Mr Ephron, met up to talk after they had a disagreement the night before. But the meeting turned violent.",
      "The first video, which was partially obscured, showed a confrontation between two men, with two others stepping in to intervene. One man, identified as Mr Mayers, is seen pulling a gun but not firing. Additional footage from later that night captures two gunshots during a scuffle involving the same group.",
      "\"If you brought a gun, then you should shoot,\" Mr Ephron reportedly told Mr Mayers, according to Przelomiec. Moments later, Mr Mayers is accused of opening fire, allegedly grazing Ephron's knuckle.",
      "\"In his state of mind, he never believed he was going to be shot,\" Przelomiec told the court.",
      "Prosecutors also showed the jury text messages exchanged shortly after the incident between the pair, where Mr Ephron accuses the rap star of trying to kill him.",
      "\"U try killing me,\" he wrote.",
      "Mr. Mayers responded, \"wtf iz ut talking about.\"",
      "The rapper rejected a plea offer ahead of the trial and said the weapon he was accused of firing was a \"prop gun\" incapable of firing real ammunition. The AP news agency reported that this would have meant agreeing to 180 days in prison.",
      "Defence attorney Joe Tacopina on Friday said the gun was a starter pistol used as a prop, something the rapper's security guards advised him to carry to fend off potential attackers. The rapper had been victim of crimes in the past, he said.",
      "Mr Tacopina painted the case as bitter falling out between friends that was wrapped up in money.",
      "\"This case is about one man's jealousy, which lies in green,\" he told the jury. \"This case is all about money, a clear attempt at extortion. Period, end of story.\"",
      "A key point of contention in the case is the police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries. The rapper's attorneys have focused - and did on Friday - on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police and how authorities found no trace of a shooting.",
      "Authorities who responded to the 2021 shooting did not find any bullet shell casings when surveying the area, but Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident two days later.",
      "The defence said the trial's outcome hinges on Mr Ephron's testimony, noting, \"He's the witness that this case will rise and fall on\".",
      "The trial is expected to last about three weeks, with Mr Ephron expected to take the stand as a key witness.",
      "The trial is happening at a crucial moment for A$AP Rocky's career.",
      "In May, he is set to co-chair the 2025 Met Gala alongside big names like Anna Wintour, British race car driver Lewis Hamilton, singer Pharrell Williams and basketball superstar LeBron James.",
      "Later this summer, he is also set to appear in a film directed by Spike Lee called \"Highest 2 Lowest\" with acting legend Denzel Washington.",
      "The star was previously given a two-year suspended sentence for his role in a brawl in Stockholm in August 2019.",
      "The rapper and two members of his entourage were convicted of kicking and beating a 19-year-old man after an argument. They said they acted in self-defence, but the court rejected their argument.",
      "The case drew worldwide media attention after US president Donald Trump unsuccessfully tried to secure Mr Mayers's release from prison as he awaited trial.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:46:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The star discusses how she feels about blowing up on TikTok and the trademark honesty in her lyrics.",
    "story": [
      "South London singer Lola Young's unflinchingly honest hit Messy has reached number one in the UK after a two-month climb, and she's been nominated for a Brit Award. Now she's made a breakthrough, this could be her year.",
      "Lola Young jumps into a car, laughing uncontrollably as she flashes a brand new set of shiny gold teeth.",
      "\"I just got grills fitted,\" she explains once she's regained her composure. \"But they're like so intense, so you're rocking with this today, and a lisp.\"",
      "She's been running a few minutes late for the interview and this explains why - so she can finish getting her dental jewellery accessories fitted, with which she seems extremely pleased.",
      "The screen suddenly freezes. The car she's in is somewhere in the US and the reception has cut out.",
      "Young made her US TV debut on Jimmy Fallon's talk show the night before, which followed a whirlwind trip to Australia, and she'll soon set off on a sold-out European tour. She's talking on Zoom as her manager drives her to the next stop on her schedule.",
      "Travelling the world and in high demand, but making time to get a full set of solid gold teeth grills fitted - she's living a proper pop star's life.",
      "And she is now a proper pop star. After several years of almost making it - she sang on the 2021 John Lewis advert, was on the BBC Sound of 2022 list and had glowing reviews for her two albums - Messy has given her a bona fide hit.",
      "The song became inescapable at the end of 2024 and completed its climb to the top of the charts on Friday.",
      "The 24-year-old is the first current British artist to have a UK number one since Chase and Status and Stormzy in August, the youngest to do so since Dave in 2022, and the youngest British woman to score a chart-topper since Dua Lipa in 2017.",
      "Her number one came a day after she was nominated for best pop act at the Brit Awards.",
      "\"The response has been amazing and it's been really exciting to see all the love that Messy has been receiving,\" says Young after reconnecting the call.",
      "\"I love the song, it's a song I wrote that's really personal and really important to me. So I'm really happy that it's resonating so much.\"",
      "Messy was released on Young\u2019s second album This Wasn't Meant For You Anyway last May.",
      "Its trajectory was supercharged when superstar US influencers Sofia Richie Grainge and Jake Shane posted a 14-second TikTok clip of themselves dancing to its chorus. Young's song has now been used in 1.3 million videos on the platform - from Kylie Jenner lip-syncing as a dog, to a viral clip of an old woman vaping and holding a pint alongside the caption \"94 and still messy\".",
      "The singer would like to point out that the track's success is not simply down to TikTok, however.",
      "\"That's not necessarily how it blew up. I would like to say that the song was blowing up before TikTok, and it was having its moment elsewhere. A lot of things contributed to the success.",
      "\"The TikTok thing is great. I don't make music for TikTok. I make music for myself and for my fans, but the Sofia Richie thing is just one element of how well it did in every aspect.",
      "\"But yeah, it's been great to see every side of it.\"",
      "Contradictions",
      "The track was indeed starting to gain traction before finding TikTok virality, and has only done so well because it is more than a mere meme.",
      "Its lyrics, about never being good enough for someone whatever you do, have connected deeply with fans. \"I want to be me, is that not allowed?\" she implores.",
      "\"I guess it's because the song speaks to so many people in terms of, I'm talking about the idea that there's two sides of a person, the contradictions,\" Young says.",
      "The song captures how it is \"to basically feel like you're not enough for somebody and also in turn not enough for yourself\".",
      "Amid the craziness of success, there's some relief that she has now reached the next level in her career.",
      "\"I mean, I feel like it's the right time,\" the singer says. \"It's been a minute, but also it does feel like the right time for me.\"",
      "Young has also recently featured on Tyler, the Creator\u2019s well-received album Chromakopia.",
      "Grit and charisma",
      "When it was released, the Observer said Young\u2019s album had \"a winning combination of zingers and vulnerability\", and the Telegraph said it showed \"all of the grit and charisma of a seasoned artist\".",
      "Like Messy, many of her tracks are one-sided conversations - mainly with an unseen, unreasonable and unsuitable man (or woman).",
      "Other songs continue the theme of double-edged romance. Wish You Were Dead is about a relationship that veers between being affectionate and volatile; while in Big Brown Eyes, Young gets weak-kneed when a lukewarm love interest insults her.",
      "Unlike some artists, there's little need to ask Young what her songs are about - the stories are laid out in her raw and razor-sharp lyrics.",
      "But how real are the situations and scenarios about which she sings?",
      "\"Pretty real. As real as it gets, to be honest,\" she replies.",
      "\"I just write from my own experience and they're very real. They're all the things that I've been through, all situations I've had, and all experiences I've had.\"",
      "The honesty of her songwriting sets her apart from many other artists, but she says she knows no other way.",
      "\"I don't think about it. Music is the only place I can be dead honest,\" she says. \"Not that I'm a liar...",
      "\"But I feel like that's my outlet, the place I can be the most honest. I never really think about it. It doesn't feel like a difficult thing to do, or something that feels like I'm baring my soul or anything. It's just I've always done that in my music.\"",
      "The album ends with an equally candid spoken-word outro, in which she says the LP was written to help her accept and love herself, and to realise she doesn't need \"no ugly man (or woman)\".",
      "\"I haven't got there yet but I will,\" she says on the track.",
      "'Different angle' on Brat",
      "Young is managed by two men who separately worked with Amy Winehouse and Adele, and she has something in common with those two artists in her combination of fragility and front.",
      "To that, she adds the conversational tone of Lily Allen and the modern pop sensibility and chaotic energy of Charli XCX.",
      "Young's breakthrough coincided with the reign of Charli's Brat ethos, which she defined as \"a girl who is a little messy, likes to party, maybe says dumb things sometimes, feels herself, and has a breakdown but parties through it\".",
      "Young feels an affinity with that. \"I massively do, and I think it's that thing of empowered women who like to party and be themselves, and that's really important to me,\" she says.",
      "\"I guess I come from a different angle - of a less heightened version of that, I guess. It would be more like, 'I don't really give a [care], but I also really do'. That's what I guess I stand by a little bit more.\"",
      "Bratpop season will stretch further when Young releases her next album later this year. It is nearly finished and will \"dig deeper\" than the last, she says. How much deeper can she really dig?",
      "\"Quite a lot,\" she says. \"There's quite a lot more to say. There's a lot of other topics and things that have happened to me, and things that I've gone through that I want to discuss with people.",
      "\"But also things that are a little bit less about love, and about other things that I've gone through.\"",
      "Now that Messy's cleaned up, we can expect to see more of Young, and her shiny teeth."

      "\"Oh my god, who the hell is not going to come back?\" she asked unconvincingly one breakfast as they waited to see who had been murdered.",

      "At the roundtable, he hit back at Jake for his illogical theory that Kas must be a traitor because he saves lives during the day and therefore, must kill at night.",
      "\"You're basically calling me Harold Shipman or something!\" he replied, in what became one of the most viral moments of the series.",

      "Who would've thought lovely \"Welsh\" Charlotte would turn out to be a smiling evil mastermind and betray not one, but two fellow traitors.",
      "First, it was poor Minah. Much to the original traitor's surprise, Charlotte turned on her at the roundtable - after Minah had spent the whole day telling the cameras she totally trusted her fellow traitor to have her back.",
      "If that wasn't enough, Charlotte then chose to recruit faithful Freddie and encouraged him to murder Leanne, despite knowing she had the shield.",
      "A cunning move and one that helped her achieve her aim of getting him banished, but perhaps she schemed too hard as Freddie chose to write her name on his card at the roundtable, casting doubts over her true identity.",

      "Charlotte and Francesca share an icy breakfast",
      "After Francesca discovered Charlotte was a traitor, the pair subjected us to the season's most wincingly awkward breakfast.",
      "From the moment they entered the room, the atmosphere was icy.",
      "Then, Charlotte lied to the others that Frankie had discovered she was actually a faithful - prompting uncomfortable smiles from Francesca.",

      "\"Charlotte saying the words 'don't trust this woman' is such a bold thing to say,\" said Leanne.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:56:27 GMT",
    "summary": "As the dust settles on the prince's epic legal battle with The Sun, who has come out on top, and what happens now?",
    "story": [
      "Did the hero Prince slay the tabloid dragon? Or to quote one of its most memorable headlines, was it The Sun Wot Won It?",
      "The dust is still settling on the settlement of Prince Harry's epic legal battle against News Group Newspapers.",
      "Had the trial gone ahead, Prince Harry would have alleged he had been the victim of unlawful newsgathering by NGN journalists between 1996 and 2011 - and that its leaders covered up wrongdoing by destroying evidence - something that the company denied. But the eight-week trial didn't happen because the two sides suddenly settled.",
      "He's scored an apology for intrusion by The Sun, including NGN accepting that there was unlawful information gathering by private investigators working for the newspaper.",
      "NGN has not admitted unlawful activity by journalists or editors - and the settlement means a judge won't now have to decide if there was, as the Duke's team alleges, a corporate cover-up of wrongdoing - a claim NGN vehemently denied and said it would fight at trial.",
      "The space between those positions, in which both sides will feel they won something, is now the battleground.",
      "The question is how far, realistically, can a campaign around historical events go? Is this week a reboot of investigations or, in fact, the final chapter?",
      "The main focus of pressure and lobbying will be the police - because campaigners believe Scotland Yard didn't go far enough in its previous investigations, missing opportunities to widen its focus beyond wrongdoing at The News of the World.",
      "'Dossier' being prepared",
      "Speaking to the BBC on Friday, actor Hugh Grant - who said the financial risks forced him to settle, with The Sun's owners last year - said the police's job was not done \"by any means\" - and suing the newspapers was never going to get at the full truth.",
      "So all eyes will be on Lord Tom Watson, the former Labour deputy leader, who NGN admits was placed under surveillance by News of the World journalists in 2009.",
      "The last remaining claimant alongside Prince Harry, he says a dossier will go to the Metropolitan Police.",
      "The Met for its part says there is no active criminal investigation into alleged newspaper wrongdoing.",
      "That statement also means there's no current probe into the separate Mirror Group titles, despite a judge ruling in 2023 that they had used phone hacking to get information on Prince Harry.",
      "So why no investigation?",
      "The police aren't ruling one out, but Sir Mark Rowley, the Met's commissioner, told LBC radio on Friday that they would need to see something \"radically new\".",
      "And that's because Scotland Yard takes the view that it carried out a huge investigation 10 years ago.",
      "Team Harry believe this is profoundly myopic. While some of their planned evidence for the NGN trial had come from the police, his lawyers also obtained new documents from NGN itself under rules for a fair trial.",
      "Could that be new evidence? Let's take the example of the records of the myriad of payments to private investigators.",
      "Team Harry and Watson would have sought to prove at a trial that many were for unlawful activity. On one level you can see that would arguably fit a test of something radically new.",
      "But, in its defence, News Group would have argued that none of this proved journalists or anyone else at the Sun knew information was being unlawfully gathered - far short of a whiff of a criminal enterprise.",
      "The full apology to Prince Harry from Sun owner",
      "Hugh Grant urges police to investigate Sun owners",
      "What this single episode we had been expecting to see at the trial shows is how each allegation against NGN would have been fought rather than conceded. And if the police knock on the company's door with its truncheon, they are likely to face a similarly robust response.",
      "And that's why the thrust of Lord Watson's promised dossier to the police will become important. It will have to say something really big. And in the absence of a court finding - that challenge becomes larger still.",
      "Other bodies could in theory act. Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee investigated phone-hacking allegations in 2011. It's likely to face calls to review the evidence of NGN CEO Rebekah Brooks and others - evidence that NGN will stand by because there's been no finding in court of unlawful activity by journalists, editors or executives.",
      "There's also the Information Commissioner's Office. It had a role in the origins of this story, investigating privacy and data breaches by private investigators. The ICO says it has no plans to reopen or review this investigation.",
      "The government has already ruled out launching \"Leveson 2\", the second leg of the public inquiry promised by David Cameron. It was meant to investigate \"unlawful or improper conduct\" across tabloids and whether the police, put simply, had turned a blind eye to it because they had been corrupted by getting too close to journalists who may have been paying them off. But it never happened.",
      "Labour in government won't revisit it because too much time has passed."

      "It has regular difficulties with floods and sewage leaks across its site, which dates back to the 1960s.",
      "There have been reports of patients slipping on flooded floors, foul smells of faeces filling A&E and leaks on wards and in the operating theatre areas, posing a risk to patients and staff alike.",

      "Over the summer, two of the main operating theatres were out of action, disrupting care for patients needing hip and knee surgery.",
      "\"We were unable to get the ventilation parts. We were unable to get the light fittings,\" hospital chief operating officer Stephanie Lawton told the BBC.",
      "\"It took us several weeks to get those theatres repaired. The infrastructure is quite old now - it's very difficult to maintain.\"",
      "From delight to disappointment",
      "It should not have been like this. Back in September 2019, there was delight at the hospital when it was announced at the Conservative party conference that a new hospital would replace the existing one.",
      "Hospital bosses were soon predicting the doors at the new site would open in 2024 as Boris Johnson promised England 40 new hospitals, including upgrades of existing sites, in his 2019 election manifesto.",
      "But by 2023 the planned finish date for Princess Alexandra had slipped to 2030 - and this week it became one of 18 hospitals to be told there rebuilds would be delayed even further in an announcement on Monday, which largely slipped under the radar as attention was focused on the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president.",
      "Construction work on Princess Alexandra will now not start until 2032 at the earliest. In the meantime, the hospital has no option but to limp on.",
      "Ms Lawton says the hospital is spending about \u00a39m a year just maintaining and repairing the current estate.",
      "\"Staff come to work to deliver outstanding care to our patients every single day and working within a hospital that is very old and breaks down is very frustrating for them,\" she adds.",
      "Torbay Hospital, one of the oldest in the NHS dating back to the 1920s, and Leeds General Infirmary have both reported problems with sewage leaks and flooding too and are in the same position.",
      "Others have been put back even further, with a number told it could be the late 2030s before work begins.",
      "Bosses at St Mary's Hospital in London, which has been given a prospective start date of 2035 to 2038, have warned the chances of some parts of the estate closing due to patient safety concerns were \"increasing day by day\" as supplies of electricity, heating and water could not be guaranteed.",
      "\"We are now providing care in some buildings which are over 180 years old,\" chief executive Prof Tim Orchard told the BBC.",
      "Meanwhile, Sam Higginson, the chief executive of Royal Devon Healthcare NHS  Trust, says he is \"deeply disappointed\" that the redevelopment of his North Devon District Hospital may have to wait until 2038.",
      "\"For us that's too far in the future,\" he says. \"There is a limit how long we can run that infrastructure for and we are right at that limit.\"",
      "He says he would be seeking money from NHS England and the government to try to keep the operating theatres and A&E running as best they can, warning otherwise the drive to tackle the hospital waiting list could be hit.",
      "The government has said it is committed to the projects. But, as they will all now slip into the next Parliament and, as such, there is no money yet committed to cover the costs, there is real concern behind the scenes about whether this timetable can even be kept to.",
      "\"They've kicked us all into the long grass,\" says one NHS leader, who wished to remain anonymous. \"A commitment to do something in 10 years' time is almost meaningless.\"",
      "Matthew Taylor, head of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals, says he understands such concerns, adding: \"They feel let down.\"",
      "And he says the government will need to take into account how compromised the NHS leaders are with their dilapidated estates when it comes to judging their performance in the coming years.",
      "Who is to blame?",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has firmly laid the blame at the Tories door, accusing them of leaving an \"unfunded and undeliverable\" hospital building programme for him to pick up.",
      "This has been disputed by the Tories, who accused Labour of breaking promises and simply deciding not to prioritise the schemes.",
      "The Liberal Democrats believe both parties have a case to answer. Health and care spokeswoman Helen Morgan says the public had been \"led up the garden path\" by the Tories, while accusing Labour of \"dither and delay\" and treating those affected with \"complete disrespect\" for trying to bury the news on the day of Trump's inauguration.",
      "Regardless of the arguments taking place in Parliament, what is certainly clear is that problems had been brewing for a number of years.",
      "In spring 2023, the BBC revealed building work had not yet started at 33 of the 40 hospitals.",
      "And later that year the National Audit Office (NAO) warned the target of 40 new hospitals by the 2030 target date was likely to be missed.",
      "The watchdog pointed to a number of factors, including delays by the government signing off plans, slow engagement of the construction industry and problems recruiting key staff to work on the national team, the latter which was partly caused by the pandemic.",
      "The timeline was further complicated by the need to prioritise other hospitals for work, including five built using reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) over which there are major safety concerns because of crumbling concrete within the buildings. This pushed the total number of projects up to 46 - five of which are now finished.",
      "Why there is a wider problem",
      "But Siva Anandaciva, of the King's Fund health think-tank, says the problems run far deeper than just these 18 delayed projects - and the others that have already been finished, started or approved for this decade.",
      "He points out the backlog in repairs and maintenance across the entire NHS has been growing for years as capital spending budgets for buildings and equipment have been squeezed.",
      "\"The scale of the crumbling NHS estate is far wider than the rebuilds on the new hospital programme,\" he says.",
      "\"Much of the mental health estate is some of the oldest within the NHS and it is estimated one in five GP premises pre-date when the NHS was formed in 1948.\"",
      "This lack of investment, he argues, is a \"false economy\" as it results in poorer patient care and hampers NHS productivity.",
      "But it is not just the health service that is affected. A report published this week by the NAO pointed out other parts of the public sector are affected too, with school, court and prison buildings all struggling with maintenance backlogs too.",

      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",

      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",

      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

    "story": [
      "When Zara Mohammed became the first female leader of one of the largest representative bodies for British Muslims in 2021, she already had a lot on her plate: rising Islamophobia, the Covid-19 pandemic, and a government refusing to engage with the group.",
      "The then 29-year-old could not have imagined three years later, she would be facing one of the biggest challenges of her career - rioting across England and Northern Ireland, often explicitly targeting Muslims, and still no government contact.",
      "The violent unrest, triggered by false rumours that the Southport knife attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker, saw bricks hurled at mosques and Islamophobic chants on the streets.",
      "Many Muslims and people of colour felt afraid to leave their homes.",
      "\"It was so visceral. We were watching on our screens: people breaking doors down, stopping cars, attacking taxi drivers, smashing windows, smashing mosques,\" she told the BBC. \"The kind of evil we saw was really terrifying and I felt like, am I even making a difference?\"",
      "As Ms Mohammed ends her time as general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain \u2013 on Saturday, Wajid Akhter was elected as her replacement \u2013 she spoke to the BBC about the difficulties she has faced.",
      "She described an \"unbelievable tidal wave of Islamophobia\" in the UK, which she said was made more difficult to tackle due to the ongoing policy of government non-engagement.",
      "\"It was the Southport riots for us that made it really quite alarming. The justification was there, the urgency, the necessity of engagement was there, British Muslims were under attack, mosques were under attack and the largest umbrella Muslim organisation wasn't being talked to,\" she said.",
      "Strains in the relationship between successive governments and the MCB began over a decade ago. Ties were severed with the MCB in 2009 under then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, after the group's deputy leader signed a declaration advocating attacks on the Royal Navy if it tried to stop arms for Hamas. Hamas's military wing had been proscribed as a terror group in the UK eight years earlier.",
      "The deputy secretary later resigned and Ms Mohammed said the MCB made clear such actions did not reflect the organisation, leading to a brief period of re-engagement.",
      "However, under consecutive governments, that engagement was broken again. In 2018, when asked about Islamophobia in the Conservative Party, then Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the government did not engage with MCB as \"too many of their members have had favourable comments on extremists and that's not acceptable\" - claims the MCB vehemently denied at the time.",
      "For Ms Mohammed, there were hopes that engagement would be renewed when Labour entered government last year as she described \"strong\" and \"positive\" relationships with Labour MPs. However, the policy of non-engagement has continued without any explanation.",
      "She said this was having a \"terrible impact\" on communities who \"do not feel Islamophobia is being taken seriously\". \"At least have a conversation about it, but to not say anything and not tell us why? Surely what happened 14 years ago cannot be the justification.",
      "\"What is the issue now? We're not illegal, we're not proscribed. We do not harbour any extremist views. We have a broad-based demographic of British Muslims,\" she added.",
      "A spokesperson for the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) confirmed there had been no change to the policy of non-engagement with MCB but did not detail why.",
      "\"All forms of religious and racial hatred have absolutely no place in our society,\" the spokesperson said. \"The government engages regularly with faith communities to help foster strong working relationships and we are exploring a more integrated and cohesive approach to tackling racial and religious hatred, including Islamophobia.\"",
      "Various government departments engage with faith organisations to discuss relevant issues and policy, including on the Covid-19 pandemic and tackling hate crime.",
      "The rise in Islamophobia has personally affected Ms Mohammed, who faces frequent abuse online. She was also the victim of a hate incident on the London Underground by a man who used offensive language.",
      "\"I've definitely got more of a fear of my personal security than I've ever had before,\" she said. \"There's been an onslaught of far-right, thuggish, anti-Islam, quite disgusting, really awful graphic content that's posted on my account.\"",
      "National monitoring group Tell Mama UK recorded 4,971 incidents of anti-Muslim hate in the year after the Hamas attacks on Israel - the highest total in 14 years - with Muslim women particularly vulnerable.",
      "Challenged on whether the MCB had done enough to support communities, particularly without government engagement, Ms Mohammed said the organisation had done \"a lot of community building \" and \"political advocacy\" to address anti-Muslim hate, including interfaith projects, an Islamophobia event in Parliament and a Visit My Mosque initiative.",
      "However, she said this had not changed mainstream narratives around British Muslims. \"There has been such a normalisation of Islamophobic rhetoric without it being challenged or condemned.\"",
      "\"We could say we're making a difference but then what is being seen in national discourse does not seem to translate,\" she added.",
      "'Constantly firefighting'",
      "Ms Mohammed recognised this as part of a broader trend of hostility directed at Muslim politicians and leaders, drawing attention to former Conservative MP Lee Anderson saying \"Islamists\" had \"got control\" of the mayor of London.",
      "Sadiq Khan condemned the remarks as \"pouring fuel on the fire of anti-Muslim hatred\".",
      "As more Muslim professionals and politicians reached new heights, like Humza Yousaf becoming Scottish first minister and Sir Sadiq being knighted, they \"faced disgusting levels of Islamophobia which others have not ever faced\", said Ms Mohammed.",
      "A BBC Woman's Hour interview with Ms Mohammed was also accused of being \"strikingly hostile\" with more than 100 politicians, writers and other prominent figures criticising Ms Mohammed's \"mistreatment\" on the show. The BBC said it promised to \"reflect on\" the concerns raised following the interview.",
      "These ongoing challenges has left Ms Mohammed in two minds about her legacy.",
      "\"You're constantly firefighting. Did we make British Muslims' lives better? On one hand, yes, because we raised these issues, we took them to a national platform. But with Islamophobia, we're still having the same conversation.",
      "\"We still haven't been able to break through, whether it's government engagement, Islamophobia, social mobility,\" she added.",
      "\"My happiest achievements are that I've visited over 300 organizations across the country,\" she said.",

      "The department can currently only demand such financial information where it has reason to suspect fraud, and only in individual cases.",

    "summary": "The government says repeated legal action against big projects is preventing the country's growth.",
    "story": [
      "Major infrastructure projects in the East of England have been delayed by lengthy legal challenges, according to the government. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to end so-called Nimby - Not in My Back Yard - challenges from those he says stand in the way of the country's growth. But just how disruptive have these challenges been in the East of England, and why have groups campaigned against the projects cited by the government?",
      "What has the government said?",
      "On Thursday, Sir Keir announced plans to block campaigners from making repeated legal challenges against decisions on major infrastructure projects in England and Wales.",
      "His reasoning was to prevent \"cynical\" and \"hopeless\" appeals blocking plans for things such as wind farms, nuclear stations and transport projects.",
      "As part of the announcement, Downing Street referenced Suffolk's Sizewell C nuclear power station, improvement plans for the A47 in Norfolk and wind farm infrastructure in the region that has been hit by campaigners' challenges.",
      "What do these projects entail?",
      "Energy company EDF wants Sizewell C to provide what they claim would be decades of clean, reliable electricity, but it is waiting for a final investment decision, expected this year.",
      "The government previously said new nuclear plants would be needed if the UK wanted to hit its target to decarbonise power generation, and some work has begun on the site in preparation.",
      "In Norfolk, National Highways is undertaking three major upgrades to the A47.",
      "The first scheme began last year on the section of the road between North Tuddenham and Easton, east of Norwich, which will create two additional lanes and two new junctions by 2027.",
      "Finally, the LionLink and Sea Link offshore wind projects in Suffolk are due to see converter stations built at several locations in the county.",
      "National Grid is waiting for permission from the government but has spoken of the wider project's importance.",
      "What campaigns have delayed these projects?",
      "Several groups have taken action against Sizewell C over a number of issues.",
      "Most recently, Theberton and Eastbridge Action Group on Sizewell Limited lost a High Court bid to challenge the Office for Nuclear Regulation's decision to issue a licence for the site.",
      "In December 2023, the Court of Appeal dismissed a legal challenge from Together Against Sizewell that argued the government failed to consider the need for a water supply at the site.",
      "The A47 improvement schemes were previously thrown into doubt when a former Green Party councillor attempted to block them.",
      "Andrew Boswell claimed the Department for Transport's development consent orders, approved in 2022, failed in each case to assess the significance of the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions, as required by law.",

      "Campaign group Stop Sizewell C has been vocal against the nuclear power station for a number of years.",
      "Alison Downes, executive director of the group, said on Thursday that the prime minister's comments suggested people were \"always winning legal challenges\" \u2013 which was \"very far from being the case\".",
      "She felt the decision could \"erode the right\" for people to defend where they live.",
      "\"Sometimes [legal challenges] are the only means left to address fundamental flaws in a project that have not been addressed either by the developers or by ministers,\" she said.",
      "\"It's people most affected by a project who are the ones who take the time and trouble to really read the detail and understand where all the difficulties are that quite often ministers and developers will try to gloss over, and which potentially could lead to very serious problems down the line.\"",
      "What did the energy secretary say?",
      "During a visit to the Port of Lowestoft on Thursday, Energy Security Secretary Ed Miliband told the BBC it was \"absolutely right\" for local people to be able to have a judicial review over what the government was doing.",
      "However, he said there was often an \"endless cycle of case after case on the same issue\".",
      "\"I think we were elected to make a different choice as a country, which is [to] listen to local people [and] make sure that local communities get direct benefit if they host clean energy infrastructure, but also to build that infrastructure that is in the interest of the country,\" he added.",
      "What happens next?",
      "The government said it planned to use the upcoming Planning and Infrastructure Bill in March to introduce legislative changes to \"drive action at a strategic level\", providing certainty for developers and the environment.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 09:29:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Questions continue over why UK authorities did not publish key details about Axel Rudakubana earlier than they did.",
    "story": [
      "The Conservatives have called for the forthcoming public inquiry into the Southport murders to consider why the police, prosecutors and government did not make public more details about the killer before his trial.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer have both said the government could not have risked Axel Rudakubana walking free by ignoring advice that publishing information could have jeopardised his trial.",
      "But Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said it was likely an \"information vacuum\" had resulted in misinformation which \"fuelled\" the riots which followed the attack.",
      "He asked why the discovery of ricin and a copy of an al-Qaeda training manual in Rudakubana's house could not have been swiftly revealed.",
      "Cooper said the government had wanted to make public that Rudakubana had been referred to the counter-extremism programme Prevent, but could not because of legal advice.",
      "Rudakubana was charged with three counts of murder and 10 of attempted murder on 31 July, shortly after launching his attack which killed Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine.",
      "Within days, in early August, officers searching Rudakubana's home found ricin and a file entitled \"Military Studies in the Jihad against the Tyrants, the al-Qaeda training manual\".",
      "The government was kept up-to-date about the discovery. The BBC has been told the ricin was in a Tupperware box in his bedroom.",
      "Police rarely give details of an ongoing investigation without what they describe as a \"policing purpose\".",
      "In this case, false rumours were spreading online about the killer, including that he had migrated to Britain.",
      "Senior officers felt under pressure to reassure the public, and dispel some of the rumours about the suspect by making clear he was in fact British.",
      "But after discovering the ricin and manual they did not immediately make this public.",
      "The investigation continued, with searches taking weeks because of the need for teams to wear hazmat suits and take a break every 40 minutes.",
      "As they prepared to announce the outcome to the investigation, senior police officers became frustrated that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was advising them to withhold many details they felt should be made public, due to false claims online.",
      "The killer was not charged with production of a biological weapon, and possession of information likely to be useful for terrorism, until 29 October 2024.",
      "Southport killer admitted carrying a knife more than 10 times",
      "'Terrorism has changed', says PM on Southport attacks",
      "Father stopped Southport killer from going to former school a week before attack",
      "Sources close to the handling of the case say police wanted to announce these charges and reveal the discovery of the ricin and manual 11 days earlier, on 18 October, but there was a hold-up as the CPS and the police negotiated over what could be said publicly.",
      "A source said the CPS \"put a load of red pen through the statement\".",
      "Rudakubana was finally charged with the additional two offences on 29 October.",
      "It was at this point, three months after the Southport attacks, that police made public for the first time that the ricin and manual had been found.",
      "He was not charged with preparing for acts of terrorism because, under current laws, this would involve finding evidence of a political motivation or ideology, and none had been found.",
      "The prime minister suggested on Tuesday the laws defining terrorism might need to change to take account of \"loners, misfits, young men in their bedroom\".",
      "Neil Basu, former counterterrorism chief at the Metropolitan Police, told Radio 4's Today programme that he thought doing so would be a mistake.",
      "\"Bad legislation is made in haste in response to shocking incidents,\" he said. \"We need to think very carefully about the unintended consequences.\"",
      "Mr Basu said the people the prime minister pointed to were not terrorists but rather \"violent individuals\" who use \"any ideology as an excuse for their violent actions\". As such, some would \"revel\" in being branded a terrorist.",
      "Adding to the workload of counter-terror teams would also \"come with a very large bill\", Mr Basu said.",
      "Lord Carlile, who previously served as the government's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, agreed with Sir Keir that it was \"high time\" to review the definition of terrorism in UK law to include lone attackers who do not have a clear motivation.",
      "He told BBC Breakfast that he thought Rudakubana being a British citizen should have been made public far quicker, as claims about him being a migrant helped fuel the riots.",
      "But he said regarding the other details that it was \"not for the prime minister, or for retired police officers, or for the police, or for the newspapers to prejudice a trial by disclosing material that could undermine the integrity of that trial\".",
      "Rudakubana has now pleaded guilty to all the charges he faced and will be sentenced on Thursday.",
      "Normally the risk of jeopardising the case falls away once all charges have been decided, either by a plea, or a jury reaching a verdict.",
      "Crime reporters attended a police and CPS-led briefing setting out the entire case - but on Monday, the CPS again decided the information should not be published, this time until after the sentencing.",
      "Despite that, the prime minister and home secretary have both given details about the case in the Commons.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer's deputy official spokesperson told political reporters on Tuesday afternoon that the prime minister had \"not strayed\" into areas related to sentencing.",
      "Yet the CPS insists it needs to protect the sentencing process due to take place on Thursday.",
      "Nick Price, CPS director of legal services, said: \"The next stage of the process is for the prosecution to present our full case to the court on Thursday - including relevant details of the defendant's past - so the judge can consider all the evidence when passing sentence.",
      "\"This will be the point when the full details of this case will be heard by the public.",
      "\"We recognise the profound interest in these proceedings, and it is important the prosecution case is presented to the court so the facts can be determined which may inform the sentence handed down.\"",
      "The CPS has taken this position because it believes the judge is entitled to make factual findings about the case and must also determine what weight to attach to different aspects of the evidence.",
      "However, the Crime Reporters Association, representing around 50 senior crime and home affairs correspondents, has written to the CPS raising concerns that the service is breaching a long-established principle that there is no legal risk in publishing material about a case after guilty pleas and before sentencing.",
      "The CPS said in its response that the \"independence of the judge must be respected\"."

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 19:57:06 GMT",
    "summary": "Years of delay and dispute have worn down support for what was once the government's flagship policy.",
    "story": [
      "After years of delay and dispute, the Scottish government has ripped up its plans for a National Care Service.",
      "The plans have gone from the flagship announcement of the parliamentary term and potentially a cornerstone of Nicola Sturgeon's legacy, to a non-statutory advisory board.",
      "Some \u00a330m was spent in the process, amid a series of consultations, legislative redrafts and political rows.",
      "But when the plans were first announced, there was widespread support for the principle of reforming social care. Many were in favour of the idea of ending a \"postcode lottery\" across different areas.",
      "So what happened to bring the National Care Service crashing to earth?",
      "Has it been scrapped?",
      "To be clear, yes.",
      "It might be a bit confusing, given the government says it remains committed to a National Care Service, and that the bill to set it up is still going through parliament.",
      "But care minister Maree Todd has agreed to remove part one of the bill - the part literally titled \"the National Care Service\".",
      "The vision originally set out by Nicola Sturgeon - of a game-changing network of care boards across the country, a mirror for the NHS - is completely gone.",
      "It had already been hugely diluted, stripped back to a national oversight board, amid concerns over costs and a lack of detail in the plans.",
      "All that's left now is a non-statutory advisory board, and widely-supported proposals to strengthen the rights of people living in care homes, known as \"Anne's law\".",
      "While it will no doubt do important work, the government has almost 300 advisory boards currently active - this is not the game-changing innovation of a National Care Service as it has ever been promised.",
      "Delivery problems",
      "The vision of a groundbreaking new care service began its slow-motion crash into harsh reality when the government started trying to construct a legal framework for it.",
      "The legislation laid before parliament was an \"enabling bill\", which set out the broad idea of a care service but left finer details to be filled in by ministers later.",
      "MSPs reacted with alarm, with almost every committee in the parliament questioning how they could properly scrutinise the plans when there was so little substance attached.",
      "The bill was held up repeatedly due to a lack of firm costings attached to the project, with members demanding that fresh financial memorandums be drawn up.",
      "Money quickly became a problem, and the budget for setting up the scheme - projected as \u00a32.2bn over ten years at one point - became an easy target when ministers needed to make cuts.",
      "That inevitably led to delays, with the target delivery date drifting from 2026 to 2029.",
      "And when the plans were stripped back, it made the legislative process even more complicated, requiring massive amendments to the bill already before parliament.",
      "It made it all the easier for people to call for the government to start over from scratch - or indeed to bin the plans and just channel the funding directly to frontline care instead.",
      "Industry concerns",
      "The government was keen to pursue a \"co-design\" process with those who would be closely involved in the running and use of a National Care Service.",
      "The sheer breadth of groups involved in caring underlines the difficulty of reform - there are councils, health boards, \"integrated joint boards\", health and social care partnerships, independent care providers, staff unions, and more.",
      "While there was support for the principle of improving care services in many quarters, some of these groups had concerns about the plans from the very outset - and others grew increasingly alienated as time went by.",
      "The original vision would have shifted responsibility for staffing and the delivery of care to the new care boards - which councils saw as undermining local control of services.",
      "The redrafted plans would have seen councils keep more of that control under a \"shared accountability\" model, but that too ultimately proved unpopular.",
      "The decision of council leaders to walk away from negotiations in September 2024 was really the moment which signalled the end of the road.",
      "It followed on the heels of unions which represent many carers - including Unison - coming out against the proposals.",
      "Without the support of those at the sharp end of actually delivering care, there was just no way that the NCS could become a reality.",
      "Political spats",
      "The collapse of the care service plans has spanned the reigns of three first ministers, each of whom insisted at some point that they were completely committed to delivering on them.",
      "Politics has undoubtedly played a part.",
      "But when it was first announced, there was not a wave of opposition to the idea of a care service at Holyrood.",
      "Indeed a few of the opposition parties remain in favour of the plans in principle - Labour in particular have just run on a manifesto promising to set one up at a UK level.",
      "But positions hardened as the policy process dragged on and concerns over the lack of detail in the bill mounted.",
      "The final straw came when the Greens withdrew their support in October 2024.",
      "That left the SNP completely isolated, with no clear way of building a coalition to get the bill passed.",
      "The government is actually quite keen to stress that there is no route through parliament for the bill, because it spreads the blame around other parties.",
      "But it is fair to reflect that political opposition has grown over time, in parallel with concerns about the proposals across a much wider base."

    "story": [
      "When Mir Ahmad Bin Quasem was abducted at night by armed men from his home in Bangladesh, his four-year-old daughter was too young to understand what was happening.",
      "\"They were dragging me away, I was barefoot,\" he tells me, sobbing. \"My youngest daughter was running behind me with my shoes saying 'take, father', as if she thought I was going away.\"",
      "He was held in solitary confinement for eight years, handcuffed and blindfolded, yet still doesn't know where or why.",
      "The British-trained barrister, 40, is one of Bangladesh's so-called \"disappeared\". These were critics of Sheikh Hasina, the country's prime minister of more than 20 years, in two terms, until she was deposed last August.",
      "Hasina's regime ruled over the worst violence Bangladesh has seen since its war of independence in 1971 in which hundreds were killed, including at least 90 people while she clung to power on her last day in office.",
      "Controversial in her own right, Hasina is also the aunt of Labour MP Tulip Siddiq - who resigned as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's anti-corruption minister last week after a slew of corruption allegations that she denied.",
      "These included claims Siddiq's family embezzled up to \u00a33.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh - and that she used properties in London linked to her aunt's allies.",
      "The government's ethics watchdog later found she did not break the ministerial code, but Siddiq resigned anyway.",
      "That isn't necessarily the end of the matter, though.",
      "Questions for Starmer",
      "The episode raises troubling questions about Starmer's judgement and Labour's approach to courting the votes of people of Bangladeshi heritage.",
      "Questions are now swirling over why Labour failed to see this coming, given the party has long known about Siddiq's links to her scandal-hit aunt. It was 2016 when Bin Quasem's case was first raised with her.",
      "He and others among Bangladesh's \"disappeared\" have represented an awkward tension with Siddiq's publicly voiced views on human rights in the years since.",
      "She long campaigned for the release from Iran of her constituent Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, for example, while showing an apparent comparative indifference in her public statements to the suffering and extrajudicial killings under her aunt's regime in Bangladesh.",
      "Siddiq has also previously appeared alongside her aunt at a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared on BBC television as a spokesperson for the Awami League, the political party Hasina has led since 1981.",
      "Siddiq also thanked Awami League members for helping her election as a Labour MP in 2015. Two pages on her website from 2008 and 2009 setting out her links to the party were later removed.",
      "Yet once in Parliament Siddiq told journalists that she had \"no capability or desire to influence politics in Bangladesh\".",
      "So these links weren't a secret, but perhaps they weren't viewed as a bad thing within Labour, not least since it has shown little sign of distancing itself from the Awami League in recent years.",
      "Then-Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick told the Commons in 2012 that they were \"sister organisations\", a warmth shared by many of his colleagues.",
      "And Starmer - who entered Parliament in 2015 at the same time as Siddiq in her neighbouring seat - has met Hasina multiple times.",
      "This included in 2022 when the then-Bangladeshi PM was in London for Queen Elizabeth II's funeral, a meeting that Bin Quasem calls \"heartbreaking and shocking\".",
      "A Starmer ally argues it is \"perfectly legitimate\" for him to have met Hasina, and it did not amount to an endorsement of her policies.",
      "The apparent attempts by Labour over the years to keep Bangladesh on side might reflect the political reality here in the UK, especially in parts of the capital city.",
      "\"You can't succeed in east London without understanding the Bangladeshi vote\", one seasoned Labour campaigner explains.",
      "However, those who fail to appreciate the country's divided and volatile politics can end up offending those they are attempting to charm. \"You need to carefully balance what you say and do,\" the campaigner says. \"If you are too overt for one [Bangladeshi] party, you'll get criticised.\"",
      "Analysis by the FT suggests there are at least 17 UK constituencies where the voting-age Bangladeshi population is larger than the Labour majority.",
      "Starmer's Holborn and St Pancras constituency has at least 6,000 adult residents of Bangladeshi origin.",
      "A potential blind spot",

      "When spent nuclear fuel is separated it into its component parts, one of the products is plutonium.",
      "Successive governments have kept the material to leave open the option to recycle it into new nuclear fuel.",
      "Storing this highly radioactive material - in its current form - is expensive and difficult. It needs to be frequently repackaged, because radiation damages the containers it's kept in. And it's guarded by armed police. All that costs the taxpayer more than \u00a370m per year.",
      "The government has made the decision that the safest - most economically viable solution - is to \"immobilise\" its entire plutonium stockpile.",
      "That means that a facility will be built at Sellafield where the plutonium can be converted into a stable, rock-like material, which can eventually be disposed of deep underground.",
      "In a statement, energy minister Michael Shanks said the objective was \"to put this material beyond reach, into a form which both reduces the long-term safety and security burden during storage and ensures it is suitable for disposal\".",
      "Nuclear materials scientist Dr Lewis Blackburn from the University of Sheffield said the plutonium would be \"converted into a ceramic material\" which, while still radioactive, is solid and stable so it is deemed safe to dispose of.",
      "\"The type of ceramic remains to be decided [and selecting the right material] is the subject of ongoing research.\"",
      "Nuclear waste expert Prof Claire Corkhill from the University of Bristol said the goverment's decision was a \"positive step\".",
      "She told BBC News that it paved the way to removing the cost and hazard of storing plutonium at Sellafield \"by transforming it and locking it away into a solid, durable material that will last for millions of years in a geological disposal facility\".",
      "\"These materials are based on those we find in nature - natural minerals, that we know have contained uranium for billions of years.\"",
      "The government is currently in the early stages of a long technical and political process of choosing a suitable site to build a deep geological facility that will eventually be the destination for all of the country's most hazardous radioactive waste. That facility will not be operational until at least 2050."

      "\"Icebergs are inherently dangerous. I would be extraordinarily happy if it just completely missed us,\" sea captain Simon Wallace tells BBC News, speaking from the South Georgia government vessel Pharos.",
      "Around the world a group of scientists, sailors and fishermen are anxiously checking satellite pictures to monitor the daily movements of this queen of icebergs.",
      "It is known as A23a and is one of the world's oldest.",
      "It calved, or broke off, from the Filchner Ice Shelf in Antarctica in 1986 but got stuck on the seafloor and then trapped in an ocean vortex.",
      "Finally, in December, it broke free and is now on its final journey, speeding into oblivion.",
      "The warmer waters north of Antarctica are melting and weakening its vast sides that extend up to 1,312ft (400m), taller than the Shard in London.",
      "It once measured 3,900 sq km, but the latest satellite pictures show it is slowly decaying. It is now around 3,500 sq km, roughly the size of the English county of  Cornwall.",
      "And large slabs of ice are breaking off, plunging into the waters around its edges.",

      "\"Chunks of it were tipping up, so they looked like great ice towers, an ice city on the horizon,\" says Mr Belchier, who saw the iceberg while at sea.",

      "\"Those pieces basically cover the island - we have to work our way through it,\" says Captain Wallace.",
      "The sailors on his ship must be constantly vigilant. \"We have searchlights on all night to try to see ice - it can come from nowhere,\" he explains.",
      "A76 was a \"gamechanger\", according to Mr Newman, with \"huge impact on our operations and on keeping our vessel and crew safe\".",
      "All three men describe a rapidly changing environment, with glacial retreat visible year-to-year, and volatile levels of sea ice.",
      "Climate change is unlikely to have been behind the birth of A23a because it calved so long ago, before much of the impacts of rising temperatures that we are now seeing.",
      "But giant icebergs are part of our future. As Antarctica becomes more unstable with warmer ocean and air temperatures, more vast pieces of the ice sheets will break away.",
      "Before its time comes to an end though, A23a has left a parting gift for scientists.",

      "\"This isn't just water like we drink. It's full of nutrients and chemicals, as well as tiny animals like phytoplankton frozen inside,\" Ms Taylor says.",
      "As it melts, the iceberg releases those elements into the water, changing the physics and chemistry of the ocean.",
      "That could store more carbon deep in the ocean, as the particles sink from the surface. That would naturally lock away some of the planet's carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change.",

    "summary": "Many have questioned Meta's motivations for ditching fact checkers - but could it be a positive change?",
    "story": [
      "As flames tore through large parts of Los Angeles this month, so did fake news.",
      "Social media posts touted wild conspiracies about the fire, with users sharing misleading videos and misidentifying innocent people as looters.",
      "It brought into sharp focus a question that has plagued the social media age: what is the best way to contain and correct potentially incendiary sparks of misinformation?",
      "It is a debate that Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, has been at the centre of.",
      "Shortly after the January 6th Capitol riots in 2021, which were fuelled by false claims of a rigged US presidential election, Mr Zuckerberg gave testimony to Congress. The billionaire boasted about Meta's \"industry-leading fact checking program\".",
      "It drew, he pointed out, on 80 \"independent third-party fact checkers\" to curb misinformation on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Four years on, that system is no longer something to brag about.",
      "\"Fact checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created, especially in the US,\" Mr Zuckerberg said earlier in January.",
      "Taking their place, he said, would be something totally different: a system inspired by X's \"community notes\", where users rather than experts adjudicate on accuracy.",
      "Many experts and fact checkers questioned Mr Zuckerberg's motives.",
      "\"Mark Zuckerberg was clearly pandering to the incoming administration and to Elon Musk,\" Alexios Mantzarlis, the director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, told the BBC.",
      "Mr Mantzarlis is also deeply critical of the decision to axe fact checkers.",
      "But like many experts, he also makes another point that has perhaps been lost in the firestorm of criticism Meta faces: that, in principle, community-notes-style systems can be part of the solution to misinformation.",
      "Birdwatching",
      "Adopting a fact checking system inspired by an Elon-Musk-owned platform was always going to raise hackles. The world's richest man is regularly accused of using his X account to amplify misinformation and conspiracy theories.",
      "But the system predates his ownership.",
      "\"Birdwatch\", as it was then known, began in 2021 and drew inspiration from Wikipedia, which is written and edited by volunteers.",
      "Like Wikipedia, community notes rely on unpaid contributors to correct misinformation.",
      "Contributors rate corrective notes under false or misleading posts and, over time, some users earn the ability to write them.  According to the platform, this group of contributors is now almost a million strong.",
      "Mr Mantzarlis - who himself once ran a \"crowd-sourced\" fact checking project - argues this type of system potentially allows platforms to \"get more fact checks, more contributions, faster\".",
      "One of the key attractions of community-notes-style systems are their ability to scale: as a platform's userbase grows, so does the pool of volunteer contributors (if you can persuade them to participate).",
      "According to X, community notes produce hundreds of fact checks per day.",
      "By contrast, Facebook's expert fact checkers may manage less than 10 per day, suggests an article by Jonathan Stray of the UC Berkeley Center for Human-Compatible AI and journalist Eve Sneider.",
      "And one study suggests community notes can deliver good quality fact checks: an analysis of 205 notes about Covid found 98% were accurate.",
      "A note appended to a misleading post can also organically cut its viral spread by more than half, X maintains, and research suggests they also increase the chance that the original poster will delete the tweet by 80% .",
      "Keith Coleman, who oversees community notes for X, argues Meta is switching to a more capable fact checking programme.",
      "\"Community notes are already covering a vastly wider range of content than previous systems,\" he told me.",
      "\"That is rarely mentioned. I see stories that say 'Meta ends fact checking program',\" he said.",
      "\"But I think the real story is, 'Meta replaces existing fact checking program with approach that can scale to cover more content, respond faster and is trusted across the political spectrum'.\"",
      "Checking the fact checkers",
      "But of course, Mr Zuckerberg did not simply say community notes were a better system - he actively criticised fact checkers, accusing them of \"bias\".",
      "In doing so, he was echoing a long-held belief among US conservatives that Big Tech is censoring their views.",
      "Others argue fact checking will inevitably censor controversial views.",
      "Silkie Carlo, director of UK civil liberties group Big Brother Watch - which ran a campaign against alleged censorship of David Davis MP by YouTube - told the BBC allegations of Big Tech bias have come from across the political spectrum.",
      "Centralised fact checking by platforms risks \"stifling valuable reporting on controversial content\", she told the BBC, and also leads users to wrongly believe that all the posts they are reading are the \"vetted truth\".",
      "But Baybars Orsek, the managing director of Logically Facts, which supplies fact checking services to Meta in the UK, argues professional fact checkers can target the most dangerous misinformation and identify emerging \"harmful narratives\".",
      "Community-driven systems alone lack the \"consistency, objectivity and expertise\" to address the most harmful misinformation, he wrote.",
      "Professional fact checkers, and many experts and researchers, strongly dispute claims of bias. Some argue fact checkers simply lost the trust of many conservatives.",
      "A trust Mr Mantzarlis claims was deliberately undermined.",
      "\"Fact checkers started becoming arbiters of truth in a substantial way that upset politically-motivated partisans and people in power and suddenly, weaponised attacks were on them,\" he said.",
      "Trust in the algorithm",
      "The solution that X uses in an attempt to keep community notes trusted across the political spectrum is to take a key part of the process out of human hands, relying instead on an algorithm.",
      "The algorithm is used to select which notes are shown, and also to ensure they are found helpful by a range of users.",
      "In very simple terms, according to X, this \"bridging\" algorithm selects proposed notes that are rated helpful by volunteers who would normally disagree with each other.",
      "The result, it argues, is that notes are viewed positively across the political spectrum. This is confirmed, according to X, by regular internal testing. Some independent research also backs up that view.",
      "Meta says its community notes system will require agreement between people with a range of perspectives to help prevent biased ratings, \"just like they do on X\".",
      "But this wide acceptance is a high bar to reach.",
      "Research indicates that more than 90% of proposed community notes are never used.",
      "This means accurate notes may go unused.",
      "But according to X, showing more notes would undermine the aim of displaying only notes that will be found helpful by the most users and this would reduce trust in the system.",
      "'More bad stuff'",
      "Even after the fact checkers are gone, Meta will still employ thousands of moderators who remove millions of pieces of content every day, like graphic violence and child sexual exploitation material, which break the platform's rules.",
      "But Meta is relaxing its rules around some politically divisive topics such as gender and immigration.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg admitted the changes, designed to reduce the risk of censorship, meant it was \"going to catch less bad stuff\".",
      "This, some experts argue, was the most concerning aspect of Meta's announcement.",
      "The co-chair of Meta's Oversight Board told the BBC there were \"huge problems\" with what Mr Zuckerberg had done.",
      "So what happens from here?",
      "Details of Meta's new plans for tackling misinformation are scarce. In principle, some experts believe community notes systems could be helpful - but many also feel they should not be a replacement for fact checkers.",
      "Community notes are a \"fundamentally legitimate approach\", writes Professor Tom Stafford of Sheffield University, but platforms still need professional fact checkers too, he believes.",

      "President Donald Trump has floated the possibility of a joint venture.",
      "\"I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position,\" he said in a Truth Social post on Sunday. \"By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to [stay up].\"",
      "Trump has since signed an executive order that allows the app to stay operational for another 75 days.",
      "Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that China was considering a TikTok sale to Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a close ally of President Trump,  who already owns the social media platform X.",
      "Musk himself wrote on X this week that while he has long been against a TikTok ban, \"the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change\".",

      "Prof Chander said the 50-50 joint ownership model does not comport with the law's requirements, which might prompt Trump to pressure Congress into revising the law.",
      "For now, the platform's future remains in limbo.",
      "Prof Chander said the Biden administration made an \"unforced error\" by allowing the law to give the president outsized control over who owns TikTok.",

      "The billionaire twice extended his arm out straight as he thanked the crowd for \"making it happen.\"",
      "Critics, including some historians, said it was a Nazi salute - Mr Musk has dismissed that, saying comparisons with Hitler were \"tired\" and \"dirty tricks.\"",

      "However the platform relies heavily on community moderation, where unpaid individuals known as Redditors decide what is - and isn't - allowed to be published on their own corner of the website.",

      "The biggest subreddits to have enforced the ban include basketball community r/NBA, which has 15 million members, female-focused community r/TwoXChromosomes, which has 14 million members, and American football community r/NFL, which has 12 million members.",
      "It is worth remembering that subreddits are almost always run by fans - it does not mean that the NFL or NBA organisations are taking a stance against Musk.",
      "The BBC has independently verified that at least 100 subreddits have banned X posts.",
      "Of this number, more than 60 have at least 100,000 members.",

      "And gamers are also amongst those to bring in the ban for video games including Baldur's Gate 3 and World of Warcraft.",

      "Does it matter?",
      "Though there are many subreddits which already disallow posts from social media, those built around professional sports in particular may have a big impact on referrals to X.",
      "That's because sports subreddits generally get a lot of content from links to athletes, analysts and journalists who spend a lot of time posting online.",

      "TikTok came back online with a short message thanking Trump for his \"efforts\".",
      "Has Trump overturned the TikTok ban?",

      "Instead it tells the US attorney general not to enforce the law for now - something experts had expected would be his first move.",
      "That buys time for his administration to, as the order puts it, \"determine the appropriate course of action.\"",
      "Trump has floated the possibility of TikTok becoming a joint venture, telling reporters he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between \"the United States\" and ByteDance, though he did not give any further details on how that might work.",
      "For now though the order creates a situation where the president is directly opposing a ruling made by the Supreme Court, which upheld the law to ban TikTok on 17 January.",
      "It said the ban was \"designed to prevent China - a designated foreign adversary - from leveraging its control over ByteDance to capture the personal data of US TikTok users\".",
      "Technically, even after the 75 days have passed, it would be possible for Trump to allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice (DoJ) to continue to ignore it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google they will not be punished for continuing to allow people to download TikTok onto their devices, meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:02:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Engineers are working on systems that can turn lunar regolith into useful elements like oxygen.",
    "story": [
      "Inside a giant sphere, the engineers pored over their equipment. Before them stood a silvery metal contraption swathed in colourful wires \u2013 a box that they hope will one day make oxygen on the moon.",
      "Once the team vacated the sphere, the experiment began. The box-like machine was now ingesting small quantities of a dusty regolith \u2013 a mixture of dust and sharp grit with a chemical composition mimicking real lunar soil.",
      "Soon, that regolith was gloop. A layer of it heated to temperatures above 1,650C. And, with the addition of some reactants, oxygen-containing molecules began to bubble out.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve tested everything we can on Earth now,\u201d says Brant White, a program manager at Sierra Space, a private company. \u201cThe next step is going to the moon.\u201d",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s experiment unfolded at Nasa\u2019s Johnson Space Center in the summer of 2024. It is far from the only such technology that researchers are working on, as they develop systems that could supply astronauts living on a future lunar base.",
      "Those astronauts will need oxygen to breathe but also to make rocket fuel for spacecraft that might launch from the moon and head to destinations further afield \u2013 including Mars.",
      "Lunar base inhabitants might also require metal and they could even harvest this from the dusty grey debris that litters the lunar surface.",
      "Much depends on whether we can build reactors able to extract such resources effectively or not.",
      "\u201cIt could save billions of dollars from mission costs,\u201d says Mr White as he explains that the alternative \u2013 bringing lots of oxygen and spare metal to the moon from Earth \u2013 would be arduous and expensive.",
      "Luckily, the lunar regolith is full of metal oxides. But while the science of extracting oxygen from metal oxides, for example, is well understood on Earth, doing this on the moon is much harder. Not least because of the conditions.",
      "The huge spherical chamber that hosted Sierra Space\u2019s tests in July and August this year induced a vacuum and also simulated lunar temperatures and pressures.",
      "The company says it has had to improve how the machine works over time so that it can better cope with the extremely jagged, abrasive texture of the regolith itself. \u201cIt gets everywhere, wears out all sorts of mechanisms,\u201d says Mr White.",
      "And the one, crucial, thing that you can\u2019t test on Earth or even in orbit around our planet, is lunar gravity \u2013 which is roughly one sixth that of the Earth. It might not be until 2028 or later that Sierra Space can test its system on the moon, using real regolith in low gravity conditions.",
      "The moon\u2019s gravity could be a real problem for some oxygen-extracting technologies unless engineers design for it, says Paul Burke at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "In April, he and colleagues published a paper detailing the results of computer simulations that showed how a different oxygen-extracting process might be hindered by the moon\u2019s relatively feeble gravitational pull. The process under investigation here was molten regolith electrolysis, which involves using electricity to split lunar minerals containing oxygen, in order to extract the oxygen directly.",
      "The problem is that such technology works by forming bubbles of oxygen on the surface of electrodes deep within the molten regolith itself. \u201cIt is the consistency of, say, honey. It is very, very viscous,\u201d says Dr Burke.",
      "\u201cThose bubbles aren\u2019t going to rise as fast \u2013 and may actually be delayed from detaching from the electrodes.\u201d",
      "There could be ways around this. One could be to vibrate the oxygen-making machine device, which might jiggle the bubbles free.",
      "And extra-smooth electrodes might make it easier for the oxygen bubbles to detach. Dr Burke and his colleagues are now working on ideas like this.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s technology, a carbothermal process, is different. In their case, when oxygen-containing bubbles form in the regolith, they do so freely, rather than on the surface of an electrode. It means there is less chance of them getting stuck, says Mr White.",
      "Stressing the value of oxygen for future lunar expeditions, Dr Burke estimates that, per day, an astronaut would require the amount of oxygen contained in roughly two or three kilograms of regolith, depending on that astronaut\u2019s fitness and activity levels.",
      "However, a lunar base\u2019s life support systems would likely recycle oxygen breathed out by astronauts. If so, it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to process quite as much regolith just to keep the lunar residents alive.",
      "The real use case for oxygen-extracting technologies, adds Dr Burke, is in providing the oxidiser for rocket fuels, which could enable ambitious space exploration.",
      "Obviously the more resources that can be made on the moon the better.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s system does require the addition of some carbon, though the firm says it can recycle most of this after each oxygen-producing cycle.",
      "Along with colleagues, Palak Patel, a PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, came up with an experimental molten regolith electrolysis system, for extracting oxygen and metal from the lunar soil.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really looking at it from the standpoint of, \u2018Let\u2019s try to minimise the number of resupply missions\u2019,\u201d she says.",
      "When designing their system, Ms Patel and her colleagues addressed the problem described by Dr Burke: that low gravity could impede the detachment of oxygen bubbles that form on electrodes. To counter this, they used a \u201csonicator\u201d, which blasts the bubbles with sound waves in order to dislodge them.",
      "Ms Patel says that future resource-extracting machines on the moon could derive iron, titanium or lithium from regolith, for example. These materials might help lunar-dwelling astronauts make 3D-printed spare parts for their moon base or replacement components for damaged spacecraft.",
      "The usefulness of lunar regolith does not stop there. Ms Patel notes that, in separate experiments, she has melted simulated regolith into a tough, dark, glass-like material.",
      "She and colleagues worked out how to turn this substance into strong, hollow bricks, which could be useful for building structures on the moon \u2013 an imposing black monolith, say. Why not?",

      "Additionally, any remaining DEI-related bureaucracy will be eliminated from those departments.",
      "It remains unclear what specific programmes will be affected by the order.",
      "In a December 2020 report, the department's Board on Diversity and Inclusion recommended a number of steps, including the removal of \"aptitude test barriers that adversely impact diversity\" and incorporating the \"value of cultivating diversity and inclusion\" into leadership and professionalism curricula.",

      "\"Military training will be focused on the readiness of what our troops in the field need to deter our enemies,\" he added.",

      "Under the new rules, visitors can carry out remote working for a foreign employer while holidaying in the country for up to 90 days, after which they may have to pay resident's tax.",
      "\"The change will enable many visitors to extend their stays, which will lead to more money being spent in the country,\" Immigration Minister Erica Stanford said.",

      "\"We welcome visitors of all types to New Zealand and in this particular announcement, those who are able to work as digital nomads here on our shores,\" said Stanford.",

      "It added that only remote work based overseas was allowed, while visitors whose employment required them to be in the country still had to obtain appropriate visas.",

      "\"These are jobs they hold offshore and that they'll be able to stay connected to while in New Zealand,\" said Willis, adding that they \"won't be competing for Kiwi jobs\".",

      "It is part of the wider economic hardship the country has been facing. Interest rate hikes fuelled by high inflation have seen economic growth in the country stagnate, leading to a rise in unemployment and the number of people seeking jobs abroad.",

      "Behind the lines, Nazi commanders were experimenting with ways to kill en masse. They feared that shooting people was too stressful for their soldiers, and so came up with more efficient means of murder.",
      "Experimental gas vans had been used to kill mentally disabled people in Poland as early as 1939. Poisonous fumes were pumped into a sealed compartment to suffocate those inside. By the winter of 1941, the Nazis had constructed their first gas chamber and crematorium at Auschwitz.",

      "Work began on a new camp, Auschwitz II-Birkenau, the following month. This became the site of the huge gas chambers where hundreds of thousands were murdered prior to November 1944, and the crematoria where their bodies were burned.",
      "Birkenau was to become the biggest of six Nazi death camps. Three others, at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka, were also completed in 1942.",
      "The first transport of Jews to Auschwitz II-Birkenau was 999 women and girls from Slovakia in March 1942, immediately followed by deportations from France, and later the Netherlands and Belgium. By 1944, 12,000 Jews were being murdered every day.",
      "German chemicals company IG Farben built and operated a synthetic rubber factory at Auschwitz III-Monowitz. Other private companies like Krupp and Siemens-Schuckert also ran factories nearby, to use the prisoners as slave labour. Both Primo Levi and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel survived Monowitz concentration camp.",
      "When Auschwitz was eventually liberated, it had more than 40 camps and subcamps.",

      "Then Sonderkommandos - other prisoners, usually Jews forced to work for the guards or be killed - would remove artificial limbs, glasses, hair and teeth before dragging the corpses to the incinerators. Ashes of the bodies were buried or used as fertiliser.",
      "Belongings of those gassed and those sent to work were taken for sorting in a part of the camp known as \"Canada\" - so named because the country was seen as a land of plenty.",

      "So many Hungarian Jewish people were killed in such a short time that victims' bodies were dropped in pits near the camp and burned",
      "Tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews were sent to Auschwitz every day. Three quarters of them were killed on arrival.",
      "Some 75,000 Polish civilians, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, 25,000 Roma and Sinti, as well as Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals and political prisoners were also put to death by the German state at the Auschwitz complex.",
      "What happened when Auschwitz was liberated?",
      "German authorities ordered a halt to gassing and the destruction of the gas chambers and crematoria in late 1944, as Soviet troops advanced westward. The stockpile of stolen valuables in the Canada sector was shipped to Germany shortly afterwards.",
      "Determined to erase the evidence of their crimes, the Nazis ordered 56,000 remaining prisoners to march west to other concentration camps, such as Bergen-Belsen, Dachau and Sachsenhausen. Those too sick to walk were left behind; any who fell behind on the march itself were killed.",
      "Soviet forces found only a few thousand survivors when they entered the camp on 27 January 1945, along with hundreds of thousands of clothes and several tonnes of human hair. Soldiers later recalled having to convince some survivors that the Nazis had truly gone.",
      "Elie Wiesel later said in a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of the liberation, external that the Nazi crimes at Auschwitz \"produced a mutation on a cosmic scale, affecting man's dreams and endeavours\".",

      "After sailing for two hours we stepped ashore at a remote valley beneath Nalunaq mountain, where the firm is drilling for gold.",
      "It's also scouring the surrounding mountain range and valleys, hunting for other valuable minerals, having snapped up exploration licences spanning over 10,000 sq km (3,861 sq miles).",
      "\"We're looking for copper, nickel, and rare earths,\" says the Icelandic boss. \"This is uncharted, and still has the potential to have multiple big deposits.\"",
      "The base camp is a cluster of mobile buildings and bright orange accommodation tents housing more than 100 staff, including Greenlanders, Australians, and British former coal miners. From there a road climbs up the valley, and we drive by car into the gold mine, following a dark tunnel upwards inside the mountain.",

      "Amaroq is confident that the mine will now be profitable. And it plans to ramp up production this year, where it has built a brand new processing plant to crush the ore and refine the precious metal into gold bars.",
      "\"We can either walk off site every month with a suitcase of gold, versus a 30,000 tonne ship [carrying the ore],\" explains Mr Olafsson.",
      "He says that Greenland presents an unrivalled opportunity because its huge mineral reserves are largely untouched.",
      "\"It can be the supplier of all the minerals the Western world will need for decades,\" adds Mr Olafsson. \"And that is a very unique position.\"",
      "Yet currently there are just two active mines on the entire island.",
      "Greenland is a self-governing territory that is part of Denmark, but controls its own natural resources.",
      "It's endowed with the eighth largest reserves of so-called rare earth elements, which are vital for making everything from mobile phones to batteries and electric motors. It also has large amounts of other key metals, such as lithium and cobalt.",
      "There is oil and gas too, but new drilling is banned, while deep-sea mining has also been ruled out.",
      "Christian Kjeldsen, director of Greenland's Business Association, says that the global \"geopolitical situation right now is driving interest in the world's biggest island\".",

      "She adds: \"We're used to being a hotspot for the climate crisis. We want to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Permits have now been given for 100 blocs across Greenland, where companies are searching for viable deposits. British, Canadian and Australian mining firms are the biggest foreign licence holders, while Americans hold just one.",
      "But there are many more steps before these sites become potential mines.",
      "Yet while Greenland may be sitting on mineral riches, any \"gold rush\" continues to be slow to materialise.",
      "The economy, which has an annual GDP of just over $3bn (\u00a32.4bn), is still driven by the public sector and fishing. And the territory also relies on an annual $600m subsidy from Denmark.",
      "Greenland's politicians hope that mining revenues will reduce reliance on the annual $600m subsidy from Denmark, and help boost independence efforts. But in the meantime Greenland is making more money from tourism.",
      "Officially mining is still important for independence, says Javier Arnaut, head of Arctic Social Sciences at Greenland University. \"But in practical terms, you can see that there are very few mining licenses awarded.\"",
      "Ms Nathanielsen concedes that while there are partnerships being developed with the US and EU, \"we still have not seen large amounts of money flowing into this sector\". She hopes that there will be another three to five mines operating within the next decade.",
      "However mining is not easy in Greenland because of its remote geography and weather. It's the world's largest island and 80% of it is covered by an ice sheet. It has rugged mountains and no roads between settlements.",
      "\"It's an arctic terrain,\" says Jakob Kl\u00f8ve Keiding, from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, which has mapped the territory's deposits. \"We have problems with harsh conditions in terms of the climate and limited infrastructure. So it's quite expensive to open a mine.\"",
      "Those high costs, coupled with low global metal prices, have held back investors.",
      "Others blame red tape for the sector's slow growth. The territory has strict environmental regulations and social impact requirements, and getting permits can take time.",
      "Ms Nathanielsen maintains that most communities do support mining, and that it boosts local economies. \"They [overseas miners] are shopping in the local shop. They're employing local employees. They're chartering a local boat or helicopter,\" she says.",
      "Yet in the south's biggest town, Qaqortoq, resident Heidi Mortensen M\u00f8ller is sceptical whether new mines will lead to employment for locals. \"When they say they're going to add jobs, who are they talking about?\"",
      "Jess Berthelsen, head of local labour union, SIK, says that many people think mining income \"will leave the country\", and not benefit Greenland. But he supports the growth of the sector. \"Greenland needs more income and to earn money from other ways than fishing.\"",
      "It's unclear how Trump's latest gambit on Greenland will play out. However, the territory's prime minister Mute Egede said earlier this month that \"we need to do business with the US\" and that it was \"doors open in terms of mining\".",
      "Mr Kjeldsen from the business association, hopes it will be bring \"much needed investment\" to the sector. \"On the other hand, if the uncertainty surrounding the signals from Trump drag on for a longer period, there is a risk that this might impact the investment environment negatively.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2025 00:10:32 GMT",
    "summary": "The DR Congo is planning to build a massive dam delivering power to millions of people - but it is not easy.",
    "story": [
      "From a set of roaring rapids, comes a grand vision.",
      "There are plans to build a magnificent, multi-billion dollar mega-dam on the Congo River - one that would produce enough renewable electricity to power vast areas of Africa.",
      "The structure would be called the Grand Inga Dam. Located in the Democratic Republic of Congo, it would have twice the power generation of China's Three Gorges and, therefore, be the world's largest hydroelectric plant.",
      "The Grand Inga Dam enticed investors and developers but decades after it was first dreamt up, the site reserved for the structure remains untouched.",
      "While DR Congo's government has insisted the plan is still in motion, critics point to the long delays, DR Congo's record of poor governance and the potential for serious environmental harm.",
      "There is also concern about the project's revolving set of international partners. Just last week, Chinese state-owned firm the Three Gorges Corporation, withdrew from the project, a source close to the partnership told the BBC.",
      "And then there is the eye-watering bill, which is reportedly as high as $80bn (\u00a363bn) in a country that is one of the poorest in the world.",
      "But some believe the nay-sayers are holding Grand Inga to a different standard than other major infrastructure projects. And while construction has not begun, there has been  a flurry of meetings and discussions between interested parties over the past year.",
      "The need for the Grand Inga is certainly there. Roughly 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa lack access to electricity, according to the International Energy Agency, a global watchdog. It is a pressing issue - African heads of state, private sector figures and development partners are currently  discussing the issue at the Africa Energy Summit in Tanzania.",
      "Attempts to solve this problem date back decades. In the early 2000s DR Congo and its neighbours - South Africa, Angola, Namibia and Botswana - dreamt up an interconnected electricity grid.",
      "They looked to the vast Congo River, realising that its powerful waters have an immense hydropower potential.",
      "The international collective - known as Westcor - sought to multiply the two dams that already existed on the river - Inga 1 and Inga 2.",
      "DR Congo's long-time leader Mobutu Sese Seko oversaw their construction in the 1970s and 1980s, but by the end of the century, both dams were dilapidated due to a lack of funding for their maintenance.",
      "Westcor eventually disbanded but their Grand Inga dream lived on. Inga 1 and 2 now work at around 80% of their capacity and DR Congo has drawn up plans to supercharge this output, by adding six more dams along the river.",
      "These extra dams are forecast to generate up to 40,000MW of electricity at any one time - enough to power New York city during the summer.",
      "Through Inga, DR Congo will play its role as \"the trigger of the African revolver... a catalyst for the industrialisation of Africa,\" says the country's Agency for the Development and Promotion of the Grand Inga Project.",
      "The BBC contacted the agency for this article but it did not comment.",
      "Despite its previous projections that Inga 3 would be completed by 2018, construction has not even begun.",
      "The lack of visible progress suggests the project has stalled, but recent messaging from the World Bank - the world's leading development organisation - implies otherwise.",
      "Late last year, the bank announced it was back in talks with the Congolese government, having withdrawn its funding for Inga 3 back in 2016.",
      "The World Bank had cited \"strategic differences\" but eight years later - and with F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi having replaced Joseph Kabila as DR Congo\u2019s president - it has done a U-turn.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s the first time that I feel more optimistic. I almost believe that we can get it done,\u201d Demetrios Papathanasiou, the World Bank's global director of energy and extractives, told a South African panel last February.",
      "This optimism seemed to be felt elsewhere, also. A pan-African alliance of finance institutions - including the African Development Bank - has recently been working together to help attract private investment to the project.",
      "The Grand Inga is like a \"serpent - it is up, down, visible, not visible,\" Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Gonz\u00e1lez Tausz, chairman of AEE Power, a Spanish-run company and partner in the project, tells the BBC.",
      "In November, Fabrice Lusinde, the head of DR Congo's public electricity company Snel, said that if work on Inga 3 began in 2026, two of its turbines should be up and running by 2032. Electricity produced by these turbines would then finance the plant's other turbines, he said.",
      "On its own, Inga 3 is projected to produce 4,800MW of electricity. South Africa, a country hindered by regular power cuts, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) stating that they will import just over half of this amount.",
      "South Africa's authorities have argued that Inga will deliver consistent and reliable energy, but critics in the country say cheaper electricity can be found elsewhere.",
      "A Nigerian company, Natural Oilfield Services, has also reportedly signed up as a buyer. Like South Africa, Nigeria also suffers from severe electricity shortages.",
      "Guinea and Angola have reportedly expressed interest in the Grand Inga Dam too.",
      "So why - after decades of talks - have no new dams materialised?",
      "\"It is a project in the Democratic Republic of Congo,\" Mr Tausz says bluntly.  \"Even if the project is one of the best all over the world - it does not have the credibility.\"",
      "For decades, DR Congo has been blighted by corruption, a lack of infrastructure and sluggish development. Conflict in the east of the country also makes international headlines - though Inga is thousands of kilometres away from the fighting.",
      "Investors are also \"afraid\" because the Grand Inga would not show returns for decades, Mr Tausz says, adding \"who knows what will happen in Congo in the next 30 years\".",
      "Mr Tausz - whose father worked as an engineer on Inga 1 in 1972 - also says that a lack of financial commitment by the Congolese government has contributed to the delay.",
      "And then there is the funding issue. In September 2023, DR Congo's president told reporters that the country was \"still facing difficulties in mobilising investments\" for the dam.",
      "The recent withdrawal of China's Three Gorges Corporation intensifies these difficulties. Three Gorges was a major partner, which brought money and expertise to the complex project.",
      "According to the BBC's source, who spoke under condition of anonymity, Three Gorges pulled out as they were frustrated with the way DR Congo President Tshisekedi was handling the project.",
      "There has been no official confirmation of the pull-out.",
      "But are these problems unique to the Grand Inga Dam? Not really, says Professor George Aggidis, a hydropower expert at the UK's Lancaster University.",
      "He says years of delays and numerous changes of partners are \"normal\" for a major infrastructure project like the Inga Dam.",
      "He points to the UK's Mersey Tidal Project - which if successful would be the world's largest tidal barrier. The idea was first floated in 1984 and has been abandoned, then revived in the decades since.",
      "\"Does that mean we are unstable here in the UK?\" Prof Aggidis asks. He describes the Inga project as \"doable\".",
      "A similar sentiment is shared by Alexander Schwab, an executive at Andritz, an Austrian-based company that signed on to supply equipment for Inga 3.",
      "Mr Schwab says Andritz signed a MoU with the Congolese authorities but has not received any word on the project since 2021.",
      "He seems largely unfazed by the lack of communication, saying that one in three major infrastructure projects will be \"stalled somewhere\".",
      "For Mr Schwab, the Grand Inga is \"one of the best mega projects... in the world\".",
      "But despite its potential, there are deep concerns about the project's environmental and social impact.",
      "A common criticism is that the dam will benefit South African consumers and DR Congo's mining companies, but not the Congolese people. Some 80% of the population lack access to electricity.",
      "\"Inga will not bring electricity for the people,\" says Emmanuel Musuyu, the head of Congolese civil society coalition Corap. He alleges that the majority of electricity has already been promised to South Africa and the mines.",
      "In a recent report on Inga 3, the DR Congo authorities acknowledged that the dam is \"alone not sufficient to address DRC's energy and development challenges\" but said it could act as a \"catalyst\" for national change.",
      "The World Bank said it was exploring how it could support the government to ensure Inga \"delivers broad benefits for energy access\".",
      "Environmental and rights groups also worry that approximately 37,000 residents in the Inga area will be displaced without compensation. According to organisations like International Rivers and Observatori del Deute en la Globalitzaci\u00f3, thousands were forcibly removed from their homes and never compensated when Inga I and II were built.",
      "They also say that the first two dams damaged the region's biodiversity and that any extra dams are likely to do the same.",
      "\"It will have a specific impact on the fish and all animals in the water... when you change the flow of water in rivers, we can see some species of fish disappear,\" says Mr Musuyu.",
      "A 2018 study argued that many large-scale hydropower projects in Europe and the US have been disastrous for the environment.",
      "DR Congo's authorities have recognised that people would be displaced by Inga III, but said residents would be resettled in areas with basic services and promised that \"fair compensation\" would be awarded.",
      "They have also recognised the risks to the local environment and said an assessment aiming to reduce this impact would be completed within the next two years. However, according to the BBC's source close to the project, the authorities have not yet raised enough money to fund these studies.",
      "If the Grand Inga is simply experiencing the ups and downs that come with big infrastructure projects, the World Bank may still have cause for optimism.",
      "But the dam is a complex engineering project - one that requires its many stakeholders to work together in harmony.",
      "The World Bank returning, only for the Three Gorges to leave, suggests DR Congo is struggling to maintain such unity.",
      "And despite DR Congo's ambition, construction cannot begin unless funding is secured.",
      "So for now, it appears as though this project which has the potential to change the lives of millions of people in Africa remains just that - a grand vision.",

      "It was 16 years ago, in the unforgiving Sundarbans - a vast, harsh delta of 100 islands in India's West Bengal state. Her son Ajit, just beginning to walk, was full of life: frisky, restless, and curious about the world.",
      "That morning, like so many others, the family was busy with their daily chores. Mangala had fed Ajit breakfast and taken him to the kitchen as she cooked. Her husband was out buying vegetables, and her ailing mother-in-law rested in another room.",
      "But little Ajit, always eager to explore, slipped away unnoticed. Mangala shouted for her mother-in-law to watch him, but there was no reply. Minutes later, when she realised how quiet it had become, panic set in.",
      "\"Where is my boy? Has anyone seen my boy?\" she screamed. Neighbours rushed in to help.",
      "Desperation quickly turned to heartbreak when her brother-in-law found Ajit's tiny body floating in the pond in the courtyard outside their ramshackle home. The little boy had wandered out and slipped into the water - a moment of innocence turned into unthinkable tragedy.",
      "Today, Mangala is one of 16 mothers in the area who walk or cycle to two makeshift creches set up by a non-profit where they look after, feed and educate some 40 children, who are dropped off by their parents on way to work. \"These mothers are the saviours of children who are not their own,\" says Sujoy Roy of Child In Need Institute (CINI), which set up the creches.",
      "The need for such care is urgent: countless children continue to drown in this riverine region, which is dotted with ponds and rivers. Every home has a pond used for bathing, washing, and even drawing drinking water.",
      "A 2020 survey by medical research organisation The George Institute and CINI found that nearly three children aged between one and nine years drowned daily in the Sundarbans region. Drownings peaked in July, when the monsoon rains began, and between ten in the morning and two in the afternoon. Most children were unsupervised at that time as caregivers were occupied with chores. Around 65% drowned within 50m of home, and only 6% received care from licensed doctors. Healthcare was in shambles: hospitals were scarce and many public health clinics were defunct.",
      "In response, villagers clung to ancient superstitions to save rescued children. They spun the child's body over an adult's head, chanting invocations. They beat the water with sticks to ward off spirits.",
      "\"As a mother, I know the pain of losing a child,\" Mangala told me. \"I don't want any other mother to endure what I did. I want to protect these children from drowning. We live amid so many dangers anyway.\"",
      "Life in Sundarbans, home to four million people, is a daily struggle.",
      "Tigers, known to attack humans, roam dangerously close to and enter crowded villages where the poor eke out a living, often squatting on land.",
      "People fish, collect honey, and gather crabs under the constant threat of tigers and venomous snakes. From July to October, rivers and ponds swell due to heavy rains, cyclones lash the region, and rampaging waters swallow villages. Climate change is worsening this uncertainty. Nearly 16% of the population here is aged one to nine.",
      "\"We've always co-existed with water, unaware of the dangers, until tragedy strikes,\" says Sujata Das.",
      "Sujata's life was overturned three months ago when her 18-month-old daughter Ambika, drowned in the pond at their joint family home in Kultali.",
      "Her sons were at their coaching classes, some family members had gone to the market, and an elderly aunt was busy working at home. Her husband, who usually works in the southern state of Kerala, was home that day, repairing a fishing net at the nearby trawler. Sujata had gone to fetch water at a local handpump because a promised water connection at her residence had still not materialised.",
      "\"Then we found her floating in the pond. It had rained, water had risen. We took her to a local quack, who declared her dead. This tragedy has woken us up to what we should do to prevent such tragedies in the future,\" says Sujata.",
      "Sujata, like others in the village, plans to fence her pond with bamboo and nets to prevent children from wandering into the water. She hopes that children who don't know how to swim are taught in village ponds. She wants to encourage neighbours to learn CPR to provide lifesaving aid to rescued drowning children.",
      "\"Children don't vote, so the political will to address these issues is often lacking,\" says Mr Roy. \"That's why we're focusing on building local resilience and spreading knowledge.\" Support from India's top science agency, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in funding creches and pond fencing has also been crucial.",
      "Over the past two years, around 2,000 villagers have received CPR training. Last July, a villager saved a drowning child by reviving him before he was sent to the hospital. \"The real challenge lies in setting up creches and raising awareness among the community,\" he adds.",
      "Implementing even simple solutions is challenging due to costs and local beliefs.",
      "In the Sundarbans, superstition about angering water deities made it hard to get people to fence their ponds. In neighbouring Bangladesh, where drowning is the leading cause of death for children aged one-four, wooden playpens were introduced in courtyards to keep children safe. However, compliance was low - children disliked them, and villagers often used them for goats and ducks. \"This created a false sense of security, and drowning rates slightly increased over three years,\" says Jagnoor Jagnoor, an injury epidemiologist at the George Institute.",
      "Eventually non-profits set up 2,500 creches in Bangladesh, cutting drowning deaths by 88%. In 2024, the government expanded this to 8,000 centres, benefitting 200,000 children annually. Water-rich Vietnam focused on children aged six-10, using decades of mortality data to develop policies and teach survival skills. This reduced drowning rates, especially among schoolchildren travelling on waterways.",
      "Drowning remains a major global issue. In 2021, an estimated 300,000 people drowned - over 30 lives lost every hour, according to the WHO. Nearly half were under 29, and a quarter were under five. India's data is scanty, officially recording around 38,000 drowning deaths in 2022, though the actual number is likely much higher.",
      "In the Sundarbans, the harsh reality is ever-present. For years, children have been either allowed to roam freely or tied with ropes and cloth to prevent wandering. Jingling anklets were used to alert parents to their children's movements, but in this unforgiving, water-surrounded landscape, nothing feels truly safe.",
      "Kakoli Das's six-year-old son walked into an overflowing pond last summer while delivering a piece of paper to a neighbour. Unable to distinguish between the road and the water, Ishan drowned. He had suffered seizures as a child and couldn't learn to swim due to the risk of fever.",
      "\"Please, I beg every mother: fence your ponds, learn how to revive children and teach them how to swim. This is about saving lives. We cannot afford to wait,\" says Kakoli.",
      "For now, the creches serve as a beacon of hope, offering a way to keep children safe from the dangers of water. On a recent afternoon, four-year-old Manik Pal sang a cheerful ditty to remind his friends: I won't go to the pond alone/Unless my parents are with me/I'll learn to swim and stay afloat/And live my life fear-free.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 10:43:27 -0500",
    "summary": "In her new musical, \"Redwood,\" the Tony Award-winning star of \"Wicked\" and \"Rent\" plays a woman seeking a refuge, and a purpose, by escaping into a redwood forest.",
    "story": [
      "Last fall, when superstar Idina Menzel wasn't in New York, she hung out in Oakland, Calif. At Bandaloop Studios, she was learning to dance suspended at the end of a rope \u2026 and this from a woman who says she isn't much of a dancer on the ground. \"I don't know what I'm doing!\" she exclaimed.",
      "But when you see exactly why she was doing this, it suddenly all makes sense.",
      "In the new Broadway musical \"Redwood,\" the audience is transported to the heart of the redwood forest, and seemingly into the trees themselves. It's loosely inspired by a woman named Julia Butterfly Hill, who, in the late '90s, spent more than two years living in a thousand-year-old redwood to save it from being cut down. Her effort worked: the tree was saved.",
      "And now, Menzel and writer-director Tina Landau are taking their own leap of faith with an idea they've been kicking around for more than a decade.",
      "Asked if she was ever worried that their experiment would fail, Landau said, \"Yes, I'm still worried. I didn't know. But it was one of those passion projects for both myself and Idina where it was just like, let's just trust that what is meant to happen will happen.\"",
      "\"Redwood\" is about a workaholic mom who runs away from it all, and finds herself in the redwood forest where her life is changed forever.",
      "One of the themes of the show is based on the fact that 300-foot redwoods actually support each other. Landau said, \"Their roots only go five or six feet into the ground. Their roots go sideways instead of down, until they reach the roots of other trees, and they intertwine with those. So, all the trees end up holding each other up.\"",
      "To listen to Idina Menzel perform \"Great Escape,\" from the musical \"Redwood,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The musical, which is currently in previews, is all-new, but Menzel is on familiar ground. She's performing at the Nederlander Theatre, which is the same theatre where she opened in \"Rent\" in 1996. \"Yeah, it's like a homecoming for me. It's full circle. It's very emotional for me. When I did 'Rent,\" that was the first professional job I ever had \u2013 and it was a Broadway show. So, I was super-lucky. That was a beautiful time in my life.\"",
      "It was beautiful. She was 25 years old, and her performance in \"Rent\" put her squarely on the map, with a Tony Award nomination. \"I got a record deal that I always wanted to get,\" she said. \"I wanted to be signed to a record label so badly and make my own album, and I did. And that was a dream come true. But then I only sold, like, three albums. So, then I got dropped from the label. And then by that time, my whole kind of momentum of being this Tony-nominated actress from the hit musical 'Rent,' it sort of dissipated. And then I had to kind of keep pounding the pavement again. It wasn't until 'Wicked' that things started to really look up again.\"",
      "As the original Wicked Witch Elphaba in Broadway's \"Wicked,\" Menzel won a Tony, and helped turn the show into a mega-hit, though it wasn't always easy being green. Asked what Elphaba gave her, Menzel replied, \"Green ears for the rest of my life!\"",
      "Idina Menzel performs \"Defying Gravity\" from \"Wicked\" on \"The Late Show With David Letterman\":",
      "And then, she was an animated princess in Disney's \"Frozen,\" singing the song that millions of would-be princesses couldn't get out of their heads. \"My relationship with 'Let It Go' is fabulous,\" she said. \"It's one of the best things that's ever happened to me. People always say, 'Do you get sick of a song like that?' And maybe they think I'm lying to you, but I really don't.\"",
      "Idina Menzel, as Elsa, performs \"Let It Go\" in \"Frozen\":",
      "\"When I was a little girl, if I would have dreamt that I'd be up there singing a song like this, I wouldn't have believed it. Or, no, I would have, 'cause I really was very cocky when I was little, and I actually, you know, believed in myself and thought, 'Definitely, it's definitely gonna happen for me.'\"",
      "But the task of writing Menzel's next big song went to someone who'd never written for a big Broadway star (or for anyone). \"Redwood\" is composer Kate Diaz's very first show, but you'd never know it. Asked what it's like to write for The Idina Menzel, Diaz said, \"It's amazing. I had never written for anybody else before, so great place to start, for sure! What an incredible voice to write for.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is there a little part of you that's like, 'Let me just see if she can do this'?\"",
      "\"I mean, she usually can,\" Diaz replied, \"So, not really.\"",
      "And she can do it on demand, as she demonstrated in the new \"Wicked\" film where she brought back her classic vocal riff.",
      "Her new show offers a different way to go green: an immersion in a leafy redwood forest. Even the seats in the newly-remodeled Nederlander are green. For Menzel it's almost hard to believe: \"It's just so rare that you get to see it come to fruition after so many years, and they're literally loading things into the Nederlander as we speak. That accomplishment isn't lost on me, and it's just, I'm so emotional about it.",
      "And now she's hoping to defy gravity, again. \"But I think green and being high, flying, literally or figuratively, is just something that I must respond to or attract in my life, in my characters,\" Menzel laughed. \"And I'm kind of happy with that!\"",

    "summary": "The playful anarchy of author-illustrator Dav Pilkey's bestselling \"Dog Man\" series, about a hero cop who is part-man, part-police dog, is now on screen in a new animated film, with comedian Pete Davidson playing Dog Man's arch-nemesis, Petey the Cat.",
    "story": [
      "It's hard to believe, but as author and Illustrator Dav Pilkey recently told students at Boy's Prep in the Bronx, he created Dog Man back when he was in second grade. \"He looks a little bit different,\" he said.",
      "The kids loved hearing when someone with learning disabilities (\"I had ADHD, and I was dyslexic, and I was the class clown, and I couldn't sit still,\" he said) could go on to be so successful.",
      "Every book in Pilkey's Dog Man series has been the bestselling children's book for the year it came out.",
      "And as the new film out next week reminds us, it all started when a police officer and his dog got into a bad accident \u2013 and doctors sewed the head of the dog onto the man's body, creating \u2026 Dog Man!",
      "And while he's part man, he's all dog. \"Oh, yeah, yeah. The man part doesn't really come out that much,\" Pilkey said.",
      "But in addition to all the fun, Pilkey tries to layer meaning into the Dog Man books, even in their titles, from \"The Scarlet Shedder\" and \"Fetch-22,\" to \"Lord of the Fleas,\" and \"A Tale of Two Kitties.\" \"I was looking at Charles Dickens' 'A Tale of Two Cities,' which is such a wonderful book. It talks about sacrifice, self-sacrifice, and the value of that.\"",
      "\"And you hope that children will be moved to read these classics?\" I asked.",
      "\"I hope so, yeah,\" Pilkey replied. \"I hope they don't think 'Oh, that Charles Dickens stole an idea from Dav Pilkey.' That wouldn't be so good!\"",
      "Pilkey's sense of humor is what made director Peter Hastings want to make the \"Dog Man\" movie. He also directed a TV series based on Pilkey's \"Captain Underpants\" books. \"I just love his sensibility, the playful anarchy of his work,\" Hastings said.",
      "Comedian Pete Davidson gets top billing in the film: \"I'm a huge Dav Pilkey fan,\" he said. \"I grew up reading all the 'Captain Underpants' books. My mom got them for me. All the young kids in my family, they all read 'Dog Man,' they're obsessed with 'Dog Man.' And then right around the time I started noticing that, we got the offer.\"",
      "It was an offer to play Dog Man's nemesis, Petey the Cat. Davidson said it was fun to play the villain: \"It's a really fun, loud, layered character,\" he said. \"I don't get a lot of opportunities to stretch like that.\"",
      "In fact, as readers of the \"Dog Man\" books know, things start to change when Petey tries to clone himself, and instead creates \u2026 an adorable kitten!",
      "\"His character has a great arc in the story,\" said Hastings.",
      "\"It's the best arc I've ever been given\" Davidson laughed. \"Usually I'm in a movie for, like, nine minutes, and then shot in the face, so it was nice to have a full [arc]!\"",
      "Asked if it's hard for someone else to control his characters, Pilkey said, \"No, no. Not at all actually. I'm just so honored that they wanted to do something with my characters, so I was like, YESSS!!! Jumping up and down.\"",
      "But Pilkey says what really matters to him is seeing how much kids appreciate all the work he puts into his books.",
      "Asked whether he ever worries about running out of ideas, he said, \"No, I think I worry about running out of time to get all of my ideas down on paper!\"",

    "summary": "This month, the Sundance Film Festival is once again providing a showcase for independent filmmakers and documentarians from around the world. But that isn't all that Sundance does. \"Sunday Morning\" goes behind the scenes.",
    "story": [
      "Park City Utah is a snow globe kind of place. It sparkles and glitters like a fairy tale, especially at this time of year, when the silver screens of Sundance come to this silver mining town, and young filmmakers start thinking of the moment they might see some glitter of their own.",
      "Sian Heder's film \"CODA\" premiered at Sundance in 2021. It went on to win three Oscars the following year, including best picture. It doesn't always happen that way, but the Sundance Film Festival does have a pretty good track record of catapulting independent filmmakers into a career.",
      "Its alumni include the likes of Steven Soderbergh (\"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\"), Quentin Tarantino (\"Reservoir Dogs\"), Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\"), and Lulu Wang (\"The Farewell\"). They were all introduced not only to audiences, but to powerful film distribution companies, at the annual festival held high in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah.",
      "\"I think that was the big breakthrough with Sundance, is that finally these new voices, these exciting new filmmakers had a place where they could actually show what they had done and potentially sell them,\" said eight-time Oscar nominee Glenn Close.",
      "She first heard about Sundance from its famous founder, Robert Redford, on the set of \"The Natural.\" His idea \u2013 then in its infancy - was in some ways just as pure as baseball itself.",
      "As Redford told us in 2018, \"I said, wait a minute, there are other stories out there. There are other voices to be heard that are not being given a chance. What if we created something, an opportunity, for those people to get their films made and have them distributed? \u2026 The smaller stories. The more offbeat stories. The more controversial.\"",
      "Which is why he wanted his non-profit Sundance Institute to be held as far away from profit-focused Hollywood as possible. So, he set it up amid the pines and aspens of Utah's Provo Canyon, on land he bought after the success of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\"",
      "Close said, \"You are surrounded by nature in a way that, if you're from a city, it's undeniable,\" she said. \"It's a spiritual thing. And I think that was very important for Bob.\"",
      "Redford said he didn't think the idea he started would last beyond two or three years. But the Sundance Institute has lasted 44 years and counting. It's become for film what Michelin Stars are to fine dining.",
      "You don't choose Sundance; Sundance chooses you.",
      "Michelle Satter, the Institute's founding senior director, has been by Redford's side since 1981. \"We'll get 3,000 scripts; we'll select 12,\" she said. \"That's a tiny number. But there are a lot of people globally who want to tell stories, and we believe in the power of storytelling.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you know when you've found a unique story or a unique talent?\"",
      "\"It speaks to me,\" Satter replied. \"If they don't have a voice that is unique, we're not interested.\"",
      "\"And what does that mean to you, voice'?\"",
      "\"There's something about the way they tell the story that does not feel generic, like anybody could tell the story,\" said Satter. \"But they're bringing something from their own experience, from their own connection to storytelling that uplifts it.\"",
      "According to Satter, \"A film is not complete until it reaches an audience and engages with an audience.\"",
      "Last Spring, Satter allowed us into Sundance's storied Directors and Screenwriters Lab, this time held in Estes Park, Colorado. One of the lab's advisors was four-time Oscar nominated actor-director Ed Harris.",
      "\"It's not about ego,\" Harris said. \"It's not about anything other than learning, making mistakes. I love the work. It's all about the work, and I learn as much as I probably help anybody.\"",
      "All the Sundance \"Fellows,\" as they're called, bring projects already in the works, like Hannah Gray Organschi, polishing up her upcoming feature film. \"There's tough feedback, like, feedback that's good,\" she said. \"And to have that at the phase where you can really be deepening and honing the characters and story is, it feels lucky.\"",
      "Casey Modderno was fine tuning her rom-com: \"The questions I think that you're normally asked as a filmmaker are, like, about budget, about accessibility, about market response. And so, to be asked questions about the feeling of the film and the aesthetics of the film and the texture, and just go deep in craft, it's, like, super-special.\"",
      "And then there's Sean Wang. \"This experience has just, like, changed my DNA as a filmmaker,\" he said.",
      "What got him accepted to Sundance was his screenplay for his first feature film, \"Didi.\" He had been toiling away on the film pretty much by himself with his crew for six years. \"I was just obsessed with, 'Who won Sundance this year? Who won the Audience Award? Who won the Jury Prize? What's the next filmmaker that is coming out of Sundance?'\" he said.",
      "Turns out he was one of those Sundance filmmakers. Last year, \"Didi\" not only won two of the Sundance Film Festival's top prizes; it got him a distribution deal.",
      "Wang notes that Sundance doesn't finance films. \"They have no financial stake in your movie,\" he said. \"When we sell the movie, they're not like, 'Great. Where's our 10%?' It's a very giving environment. Obviously they want your films to succeed.\"",
      "This year the California wildfires cast a long shadow over the festival. Michelle Satter's home, where we did our interview, is now gone, as are so many others.",
      "None of those victims were forgotten in Utah this past week. As Satter told the audience, \"We lost our village, but at the end of the day, we are the village.\"",
      "As for Robert Redford, the visionary who started it all is now 88. He hasn't been here in person for the last three years, but his spirit remains. Independent film has forever been changed \u2013 a legacy that he and others have taken to the box office bank.",
      "Glenn Close said, \"He put his money where his mouth is. And you know, I'm in awe of that. And I salute him for it.\"",

      "Read an excerpt below.",
      "\"Playworld\" by Adam Ross",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Prologue",
      "In the fall of 1980, when I was fourteen, a friend of my parents named Naomi Shah fell in love with me. She was thirty-six, a mother of two, and married to a wealthy man. Like so many things that happened to me that year, it didn't seem strange at the time.",
      "Two decades later, when I finally told my mother\u2014we were on Long Island, taking a walk on the beach\u2014she stopped, stunned, and said, \"But she was such an ugly woman.\" The remark wasn't as petty as it sounds. If I was aware of it then, it neither repulsed me nor affected my feelings for Naomi. It was just a thing I took for granted, like the color of her hair.",
      "Wiry and ashen, it had the shading but not the shimmer of pigeon feathers. Naomi kept it long, so that it fell past her shoulders. I knew it by touch, for my face was often buried in it. Only later did I wonder if she considered herself unattractive, because she always wore sunglasses, as if to hide her face, large gold frames with blue-tinted prescription lenses. When we were driving together, which was often that year, she'd allow these to slide down her nose and then look at me over their bridge. She might've considered this pose winning, but it was more likely to see me better. Her mouth often hung slightly open. Her lower teeth were uneven, and her tongue, which pressed against them, always tasted of coffee.",
      "Naomi's car was a silver Mercedes sedan\u2014300sd along with turbo diesel nickel-plated on the back\u2014that made a deep hum when she drove. The interior, enormous in my mind's eye, was tricked out with glossy wood paneling and white leather, back seat so wide and legroom so ample they made the driver appear to be far away. It was in this car that Naomi and I talked most often. We'd park, and then she'd lean across the armrest to press her cheek to mine, and I'd sometimes allow her to kiss me. Other times we'd move to the back. Lying there with Naomi, her nose nuzzled to my neck, I'd stare at the ceiling's dotted fabric until the pattern seemed to detach and drift like a starred sky. This car was her prized possession, and like many commuters, she had turned the machine into an extension of her body. Her left thumb lightly hooked the wheel at eight o'clock when traffic was moving, her fingertips sliding to eleven when it was slow. She preferred to sit slightly reclined, her free hand spread on her inner thigh, though after she lost her pinky the following summer, and even after being fitted with a prosthesis, she kept it tucked away.",
      "\"I was worried you'd think it was disgusting,\" she said, the digit hidden between the seat and her hip. She'd bought herself a diamond ring to hide the seam, and for the most part the likeness was uncanny, but at certain angles you could tell\u2014the cuticle's line was too smooth, the nail's pale crescent too creamy to match the others. Like my father's fake teeth, which he occasionally left lying around our apartment, I was fascinated by it, though my curiosity wasn't morbid. I was a child actor, you see, a student of all forms of dissembling, and had long ago found my greatest subject to be adults.",

      "It was meant to be a harmless prank. Not even a prank, not initially.",
      "An inside joke, only for the three of them. But now she was locking her apartment door behind two departing police officers.",
      "She had managed to sound appropriately earnest but unworried when they began asking questions. After all, why should May Hanover, of all people, be nervous around police? May was the good girl, always. The one who only needed to be told once by a teacher to open a book to a specific page. The teenager who drove strictly within the limits of her learner's permit. Even her pug, Gomez, seemed to understand at an instinctive level why he needed to break away from his neighbor buddies to ride the building's service elevator while they strutted brazenly with their humans through the lobby.",
      "May, simply put, was a rule follower. A rule enforcer, in fact. It was a trait that had helped her succeed in life, but, as she had learned, could also lead to trouble.",
      "Josh emerged from the bedroom where he'd gone to give her privacy when the police arrived. Gomez waddled slightly behind him. \"Was that about Roland Shaw?\"",
      "Shaw was the man she'd convicted in her final in-person trial as an assistant district attorney after he was found breaking into his next victim's apartment. \"How'd you know?\" Could a question be a lie? That one probably counted. So many lies since she'd gotten home yesterday from her long weekend in the Hamptons.",
      "\"That was a major case for you. I recognized the big guy from the news.\"",
      "The trial was before she and Josh had found themselves suddenly living together. Before they were engaged. The media coverage consisted of two small articles in the Post, including a photograph of a defiant-looking May flanked by two detectives in the courthouse hallway\u2014one of them the \"big guy\" Josh recognized. Whereas May was obsessed with all things crime-related\u2014in her job, the news, truth or fiction\u2014Josh found it all, quote, \"dark and depressing.\" But Josh was interested in all things May-related. Of course he had followed the coverage.",
      "\"The DA's Office got an inquiry from another jurisdiction and needed to clear something up,\" she said. Misleading, but technically true.",
      "\"They couldn't just call you?\" he asked.",
      "\"Actually, he called, but I didn't see the message.\" That one was a full-on lie. \"Guess he's training a new guy and wanted a change of scenery.\"",
      "\"Well, I'm glad they were quick. I really wanted a Negroni but thought the sound of a cocktail shaker might be inadvisable while you were in official law enforcement mode.\"",
      "\"Another reason why you should stir,\" she said. \"I like what I like.\"",
      "\"Make two? I'm getting back into my comfy clothes.\" She called Lauren once she was alone in the bedroom. \"Hey there, woman. We were just saying we miss you.\"",
      "\"Yes, we miss you!\" Kelsey called out in the background. \"Come back here right now. It's boring without you.\"",
      "May could hear a few drinks' worth of enthusiasm in Kelsey's voice. \"You're clearly having a miserable time. Absolutely suffering.\" She felt a knot form in her sternum as she steeled herself to explain why she was calling. \"I don't even know how to say this, but the police are probably going to call you. Both of you.\"",
      "\"What? How would they even know about us?\" Lauren asked. \"They came to my apartment. They asked who I was with. I didn't have a choice. They have your names. And your phone numbers.\"",
      "\"How? Were there cameras or something?\"",
      "\"No, it was because of me. I'm so sorry.\"",
      "What had she gone and done? No one was supposed to know about any of their stupidity. And now something really, really bad was going to happen\u2014she could feel it. Something she couldn't control. She wanted to open her mouth wide to scream\u2014to scream impossibly loudly again, like last time.",

      "The wisest souls say that pure mountain air makes us all go a little mad. A wind\u2014lawless and long-tailed\u2014slices through the snow-stippled Apuan alps and the Apennines with all the wantonness of La Befana, the winter witch. Swifts catch this wind on their wings, carving up the crisp blue morning. Dipping down into the valley, the wind now worries over the murmuring blue tongue of the Serchio river on its journey to the Tyrrhenian Sea. It slips\u2014an unseen spirit\u2014under Devil's bridge. Shivers along the great gray hunch of the Devil's back. Hissing over every ancient stone. Rising from the river, the wind picks up speed, hastening toward the woods. Hurtling toward chestnut trees spaced like the pews of a great Duomo. The wind now weaves between golden leaves. Whispering quick consonants between the branches, borrowing an autumnal aura. Sweet sigh of ripe chestnuts and shed leaves. And here\u2014where the wind steals woodland scents\u2014hides a curiosity. Cloistered by soil, moss, stone and leaf litter, a thing unseen\u2014a thing quite mysterious\u2014lies in waiting.",
      "A thing that sits buried, like old bones.",
      "What lies under the soil has stayed secret. It is an underground barterer. A schemer who has set a trap in the soil. A sylvan swindler. A tormentor.",
      "A tiny god.",
      "Swelling to irresistible bulk, it has ripened into a knobbled fruit of corruption. And now the time has come. The tiny god releases a lusty sigh, soundlessly unfurling a phantom into the wind.",
      "No more visible than the notes of nightingale song.",
      "No more audible than a wordless wish.",
      "The tiny god has released a cipher.",
      "The breath of the tiny god is whisked away by the breeze, slipping through the damp woodland of chestnut worship. Deeper into the woods, the breath in the breeze paints the pupils of a fallow deer into great glistening lakes. Fur stiffens along a back freckled in the white of first snow. The doe salivates in answer to the call of the stranger she can smell but cannot see. Her nostrils flutter, messages flood her bloodstream. But the breath blows on.",
      "Now a wild sow lifts her moist snout from the leaf litter and inhales a slip of the wind. Instantly intoxicated, her muddy snout snuffing. The grunting sow is aroused into a frenzy. Bristled legs stab at the soil as she arranges them to assume her stance, ready to receive the boar she smells. Turning her head toward her tail, she hunts for him, but\u2014and here is the trick, here is the olfactory deception\u2014there is no boar and the breeze blows on through the woods, fanning the sensual scent along with it.",
      "See-through scarves of scent curl from the forest and swirl toward a beautiful medieval village, perched upon a peak. Its tallest point an 11th century bell tower with memories of steel swords and shields. The wind, pickled with flavors of the forest, ridden by the breath of the tiny god, tickles trees of olive and cyprus. Until it dangles its string of little calamities above cobblestone streets and terracotta roof tiles.",
      "And it settles upon the medieval village like a spell.",

      "An Alabama woman passed a major milestone Saturday to become the longest-living recipient of a pig organ transplant \u2013 healthy and full of energy with her new kidney for 61 days and counting.",
      "\"I'm superwoman,\" Towana Looney told The Associated Press, laughing about outpacing family members on long walks around New York City as she continues her recovery. \"It's a new take on life.\"",
      "Looney's vibrant recovery is a morale boost in the quest to make\u00a0animal-to-human transplants a reality. Looney the\u00a0fifth American\u00a0given a\u00a0gene-edited pig organ.",
      "\"If you saw her on the street, you would have no idea that she's the only person in the world walking around with a pig organ inside them that's functioning,\" said Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led Looney's transplant.",
      "Montgomery called Looney's kidney function \"absolutely normal.\" Doctors hope she can leave New York \u2013 where she's temporarily living for post-transplant checkups \u2013 for her Gadsden, Alabama, home in about another month.",
      "\"We're quite optimistic that this is going to continue to work and work well for, you know, a significant period of time,\" he said.",
      "Why scientists are using pig organs for transplants",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike to address a severe shortage of transplantable human organs. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting.",
      "Pig organ transplants so far have been \"compassionate use\" cases, experiments the Food and Drug Administration allows only in special circumstances for people out of other options.",
      "And the handful of hospitals trying them are sharing information of what worked and what didn't, in preparation for the world's first formal studies of xenotransplantation, expected to begin sometime this year. United Therapeutics, which supplied Looney's kidney, recently asked the Food and Drug Administration for permission to begin a trial.",
      "How Looney fares is a \"very precious experience,\" said Dr. Tatsuo Kawai of Massachusetts General Hospital, who led the world's first pig kidney transplant last year and works with another pig developer, eGenesis.",
      "Looney was far healthier than the prior patients, Kawai noted, so her progress will help inform the next attempts.",
      "\"We have to learn from each other,\" he said.",
      "Towana Looney's transplant story",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed, something incredibly rare among living donors. She spent eight years on dialysis before doctors concluded she'd likely never get a donated organ \u2013 she'd developed super-high levels of antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney.",
      "So Looney, 53, sought out the pig experiment. No one knew how it would work in someone \"highly sensitized\" with those overactive antibodies.",
      "Discharged just 11 days after the Nov. 25 surgery, Montgomery's team has closely tracked her recovery through blood tests and other measurements. About three weeks after the transplant, they caught subtle signs that rejection was beginning \u2013 signs they'd learned to look for thanks to a 2023 experiment when a pig kidney worked for 61 days inside a deceased man whose body was donated for research.",
      "Montgomery said they successfully treated Looney and there's been no sign of rejection since \u2013 and a few weeks ago she met the family behind that deceased-body research.",
      "\"It feels really good to know that the decision I made for NYU to use my brother was the right decision and it's helping people,\" said Mary Miller-Duffy, of Newburgh, New York.",
      "Looney in turn is trying to help others, serving as what Montgomery calls an ambassador for people who've been reaching out to her through social media, sharing their distress at the long wait for transplants and wondering about pig kidneys.",
      "One, she said, was being considered for a xenotransplant at another hospital but was scared, wondering whether to proceed.",
      "\"I didn't want to persuade him whether to do or not to do it,\" Looney said.",
      "Instead, she asked if he was religious and urged him to pray, to \"go off your faith, what your heart tells you.\"",
      "\"I love talking to people, I love helping people,\" she added. \"I want to be, like, some educational piece\" for scientists to help others.",
      "There's no way to predict how long Looney's new kidney will work but if it were to fail she could receive dialysis again.",
      "\"The truth is we don't really know what the next hurdles are because this is the first time we've gotten this far,\" Montgomery said. \"We'll have to continue to really keep a close eye on her.\"",

His final payment from the firm was in May 2024, he said.",

      "\"Upon confirmation, I will retain an interest in contingency fee cases that do not involve claims against the United States and in which the United States is not a party and does not have a direct and substantial interest,\" Kennedy wrote in his disclosure.",

      "\"The FDA is aware of reports of death or illness associated with uncooked food in 13 domestic cats in eight households, 1 exotic cat in one household, and an unknown number of animals at two sanctuaries for large felids,\" an FDA official said in a statement.",
      "Cases have been in California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington state, the FDA said.",
      "Investigators are now working to trace back the outbreaks, the official said. Testing is underway but could take several weeks to yield results to pin down the source.",

      "\"Affected flocks that are depopulated as part of USDA's efforts to control H5N1 are not permitted in any food product at all. They are most frequently composted on site, as part of the efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus,\" Eric Deeble, Deputy Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, told reporters last week.",
      "While bird flu has largely spared many of the humans and cows sickened by this past year's outbreaks in the U.S. from death or severe disease, officials have warned that the virus is especially lethal to cats.",

      "\"Apparently it was a very seasonally warm fall and early winter further north, and so that kept a lot of those birds up co-mingling with each other further north, before they started the fall migration,\" said Alex Turner, the USDA's national incident coordinator for the outbreak.",

    "summary": "Chinese startup DeepSeek has debuted an AI app that challenges OpenAI's ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, sending a shock through Wall Street.",
    "story": [
      "A Chinese artificial intelligence company called DeepSeek is grabbing America's attention \u2014 and sending a shock wave through Wall Street \u2014 due to its new tech, which some experts say rivals that of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "DeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after Mr. Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday morning, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17% as of 2:08 p.m. Eastern Time while ASML shed 7.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3.5%, or 698 points, in afternoon trade, while the S&P 500 declined 1.7%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "In the meantime, major tech companies including Meta and Microsoft are slated to report earnings this week, where investors will likely hear more from their executives about their AI plans and their thoughts on DeepSeek, experts said.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",

The company had continued allowing Nakai to appear on Fuji shows for a year and six months, he said, but denied covering up the case because it involved a big star.",
      "Minato said he did not think what happened was sexual assault and that the case was not reported to the company's compliance office until the magazine report came out.",
      "He also denied a Fuji TV employee's involvement but said allegations that the employee had previously organized barbecue and other parties for Nakai needed to be investigated.",
      "Fuji officials also acknowledged that female announcers and other female employees have in the past participated at parties for stars, talent agency executives and sponsors, though they denied any sexual services. Minato said he believed top officials were complacent about the outdated gender roles and they now need to \"update their mindset.\"",
      "Nakai last Thursday announced his retirement from show business\u00a0in Japan, which has already been hit by a series of sexual assault allegations in recent years in what is seen as a delayed #MeToo movement that began in Western nations in the 2010s. He said he was taking responsibility for the \"trouble\" and massive business losses as a result.",
      "\"I alone am responsible for everything\" and \"sincerely apologize,\" Nakai said.",
      "He had previously issued a statement saying some of what had been reported was \"different from the facts.\"",
      "Minato said he last saw the woman last summer when she visited his office to tell him she was quitting.",
      "Shukan Bunshun weekly, one of the magazines that exposed the scandal, also alleged that Fuji TV has long exploited its female announcers to entertain stars like Nakai.",
      "The chair of the companies, Shuji Kanoh, was also resigning in a decision made at a board meeting prior to the Jan. 17 news conference, officials said.",
      "Japan's entertainment industry is in the midst of a wave of sexual assault cases, including the abuses of hundreds of boys and young men by late talent mogul Johnny Kitagawa, whose now-defunct agency Johnny & Associates managed many boy bands, including the one to which Nakai belonged.",
      "One of Japan's most popular comedians, 61-year-old Hitoshi Matsumoto, has also been accused of sexual assault by two women.",
      "Following massive protests and criticism from even their own employees, Fuji TV and its parent company announced after a board meeting last week that they have set up an independent panel of lawyers to be submitted by March.",
      "While the tabloid reports about Nakai unleashed a coverage frenzy, most Japanese media have taken a cautious approach, referring to the allegations as sexual \"trouble\" or misconduct.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 19:33:50 -0500",
    "summary": "Perplexity is seeking to create a new $300-billion public company with TikTok's U.S. business and include investments from other investors.",
    "story": [
      "Perplexity AI has presented a new proposal to TikTok's parent company that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "The proposal, submitted last week, is a revision of a prior plan the artificial intelligence startup had presented to TikTok's parent ByteDance on Jan. 18, a day before the law that bans TikTok went into effect.",
      "The first proposal, which ByteDance hasn't responded to, sought to create a new structure that would merge San Francisco-based Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business and include investments from other investors.",
      "The new proposal would allow the U.S. government to own up to half of that new structure once it makes an initial public offering of at least $300 billion, said the person, who was not authorized to speak about the proposal. The person said Perplexity's proposal was revised based off of feedback from the Trump administration.",
      "If the plan is successful, the shares owned by the government would not have voting power, the person said. The government also would not get a seat on the new company's board.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Under the plan, ByteDance would not have to completely cut ties with TikTok, a favorable outcome for its investors. But it would have to allow a \"full U.S. board control,\" the person said.",
      "Under the proposal, the China-based tech company would contribute TikTok's U.S. business without the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app, according to a document seen by the Associated Press.",
      "The proposal seems to mirror a strategy Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary during President Donald Trump's first term, discussed Sunday on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures \u2014 that a new investor in TikTok could simply \"dilute down\" the Chinese ownership and satisfy the law. Mnuchin has previously expressed interest in investing in the company.",
      "\"But the technology needs to be disconnected from China,\" he added. \"It needs to be disconnected from ByteDance. There's absolutely no way that China would ever let us have something like that in China.\"",
      "The Perplexity proposal comes as several investors are expressing interest in TikTok. Mr. Trump said late Saturday that he expects a deal will be made in as soon as 30 days.",
      "On\u00a0a flight from Las Vegas to Miami on Air Force One, Mr. Trump also said he hadn't discussed a deal with Larry Ellison, CEO of software maker Oracle, despite\u00a0a report\u00a0that Oracle, along with outside investors, was considering taking over TikTok's global operation.",
      "\"Numerous people are talking to me. Very substantial people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary. ... I'd only do it if the United States benefits.\"",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, TikTok was to be banned in the United States by Jan. 19 if it did not cut ties with ByteDance. The Supreme Court upheld the law, but Mr. Trump then issued an executive order to halt enforcement of the law for 75 days.",
      "Mr. Trump, on Air Force One, noted that Ellison lives \"right down the road\" from his Mar-a-Lago estate, but added, \"I never spoke to Larry about TikTok. I've spoken to many people about TikTok and there's great interest in TikTok.\"",
      "TikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. a week ago, but went back online after Mr. Trump said he would postpone the ban. Mr. Trump had unsuccessfully attempted a U.S. ban of the platform during his first term. But he has since reversed his position and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters during last year's presidential election.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Mr. Trump's inauguration Jan. 20, along with some other tech leaders who've been forging friendlier ties with the new administration.",
      "Congress voted to ban TikTok in the U.S. out of concern that TikTok's ownership structure represented a security risk. The Biden administration argued in court for months that it was too much of a risk to allow a Chinese company to control the algorithm that fuels what people see on the app. Officials also raised concerns about user data collected on the platform.",
      "However, to date, the U.S. hasn't provided public evidence of TikTok handing user data to Chinese authorities or allowing them to tinker with its algorithm.",

      "Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, is recalling more than 63,000 Jeep Cherokees because of a defect that causes the vehicles to lose power and impede parking, increasing the risk of a crash, according to a recall notice posted Wednesday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",
      "As a result of a poorly seated input shaft ring, the vehicles' \"power transfer unit (PTU) may become damaged and disengage the transmission and differential, resulting in a loss of drive power and/or loss of park function,\" the recall documents state. \"A loss of drive power can increase the risk of a crash.

    "published": "Sat, 25 Jan 2025 16:20:29 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump revoked a 1965 rule that prohibited federal contractors from discriminating against employees or job applicants.",
    "story": [
      "Among the flurry of executive orders since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Donald Trump has taken aim at\u00a0rooting out diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs within the federal government. But his efforts go beyond DEI, with one recent order rescinding a Civil Rights-era rule that has helped protect millions of workers from discrimination.",
      "Mr. Trump's Jan. 21\u00a0order \u2014 \"Ending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity\" \u2014 revokes the\u00a0Equal Employment Opportunity\u00a0rule signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u2014 which is still law today \u2014 had a loophole that excluded federal employees.",
      "Johnson signed the Equal Employment Opportunity rule to close the loophole, and those protections were signed into law in 1972. That rule bars federal contractors, who today employ 3.7 million people, from discriminating against job applicants or workers on the basis of race, gender, religion and other protected characteristics. It also gave the Labor Department the authority to take action against discrimination.",
      "Mr. Trump's order does not invalidate the law, and private and federal employees are still protected from discrimination as laid out under the Civil Rights Act. But his order does strike down the 1965 rule prohibiting contractors that do business with the government from taking race, gender and the other protected criteria into account.",
      "More broadly, revoking the 60-year-old Equal Employment Opportunity order eliminates a bedrock of civil rights protection for American workers, signaling an effort to target workplace issues that go beyond DEI, labor experts say. While DEI is shorthand for programs that encourage equality in the workplace for women, minorities and other groups, the Equal Employment Opportunity rule prohibited federal contractors from engaging in acts of discrimination, such as refusing to hire someone due to their race or paying an employee less because of their gender.",
      "\"It is still stunning to me that he took such an extraordinary step,\" said Fatima Goss Graves, CEO of the National Women's Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on gender justice. Revoking the rule signals \"he is going after something bigger: the basic and foundational idea that we should be able to work at workplaces without discrimination.\"",
      "She added, \"We agreed to that 60 years ago, and I'll add that people in this country support it, too.\"",
      "What was the Equal Employment Opportunity rule?",
      "The rule required federal contractors to \"take affirmative action\" to ensure that workers aren't discriminated against based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin. This covered everything from hiring to promotions and pay, with the Department of Labor tasked with overseeing and enforcing the rule.",
      "How does revoking the rule impact protections for workers?",
      "It's still illegal under U.S. law for employers to discriminate on the basis of race, gender or other traits, labor experts said.",
      "But rescinding the Equal Employment Opportunity rule could have a chilling effect on cases where workers at federal contractors allege they have been treated unfairly and could impact the Department of Labor's ability to pursue workplace discrimination cases, Josh Boxerman, government affairs manager at the National Employment Law Project, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Taking away this set of tools puts workers at a disadvantage,\" he added.",
      "Does this have an impact on private employers?",
      "While the Equal Employment Opportunity rule focuses on federal contractors, Mr. Trump's executive orders could spill over to private employers, said Alex Hontos, a partner at law firm Dorsey & Whitney and expert on government contracting.",
      "\"It's not just about government contractors and grantees,\" Hontos said. \"It is clearly a stepwise approach and is going to apply to the private sector. You see that at the back end of the [executive order], where attorneys general have been directed to put a plan together to either call out private-sector companies that are involved in DEI or to actually seek enforcement actions in some way.\"",
      "Even before Mr. Trump's orders banning DEI from federal agencies, corporations, including Meta,\u00a0Ford,\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart, have been stepping back from these programs. Those decisions followed a 2023 Supreme Court decision\u00a0banning affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservative political activists.",
      "Why is President Trump banning DEI and revoking the Equal Employment Opportunity rule?",
      "Mr. Trump's aim is to restore what the administration considers to be a merit-based hiring system, according to officials and his executive orders.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States to protect the civil rights of all Americans and to promote individual initiative, excellence and hard work,' the president wrote in the order to revoke the 1965 rule.",
      "DEI policies, he wrote, have led to \"illegal, pernicious discrimination that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing.\"",
      "Numerous lawsuits have taken aim at DEI programs, with some alleging that the policies discriminate against people who aren't minorities or that they violate some workers' rights to free speech, among other allegations,\u00a0according to New York University's Meltzer Center.",
      "\"The Trump administration isn't getting rid of the concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion as they are typically understood,\" a viewpoint from Erec Smith, research fellow at the Cato Institute and co-founder of Free Black Thought, a nonprofit dedicated to highlighting viewpoint diversity within Black communities. \"He's getting rid of the critical social justice version, which is inherently divisive.\"",
      "The order sends a clear message that the Trump administration does not support such initiatives.",
      "What will happen with DEI programs?",
      "DEI programs are being scrubbed from the federal government, according to the Trump administration's directives.",
      "All federal employees in DEI roles were placed on leave by 5 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday. Agencies were also told to \"take down all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) of DEIA [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility] offices\"; cancel upcoming DEI trainings; and terminate contracts with DEI-related contractors by the same time Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's Jan. 21 executive order requires federal agencies to come up with \"up to nine potential civil compliance investigations\" of publicly traded companies, large nonprofits and other private institutions with DEI programs that \"constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.\"",
      "That part of the executive order \"seems to be an attempt to intimidate the private sector,\" NELP's Boxerman said of the requirement to pursue civil investigations in the private sector. \"This seems to be a clear effort to name and shame companies that are doing the right thing,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Discount store chain Target said Friday that it would join rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that have come under attack from conservative activists and, as of this week, the White House.",
      "The Minneapolis-based retailer said the changes to its \"Belonging at the Bullseye\" strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.",
      "Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it already had planned to end the racial program this year. The company said Friday that it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.",
      "The goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.",
      "Target has long been a fierce corporate advocate for the rights of Black and LGBTQ+ people. In a memo to employees, Kiera Fernandez, Target's chief community impact and equity officer, as a \"next chapter\" in a decades-long process to create \"inclusive work and guest environments that welcome all.\"",
      "\"Many years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,\" Fernandez wrote in the memo, which Target shared Friday. \"And as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future.\"",
      "There's no doubt the U.S. civil rights landscape has undergone a massive transformation in the five years since much of corporate America adopted DEI goals in response to the Black Lives Matter protests that followed Floyd's death in Minneapolis.",
      "In 2020, Target pledged to give $10 million to social justice initiatives and to rebuild areas of the Twin Cities damaged by riots. At that time, Target leaders said they wanted to increase their Black workforce by 20% over the next three years.",
      "A 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions emboldened conservative groups to bring or threaten lawsuits targeting corporate initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "Walmart, McDonald's, Ford, Harley-Davison, John Deere and Lowe's are among the well-known consumer brands that reduced or phased out their DEI commitments in recent months.",
      "President Donald Trump this week signaled his administration's agreement with conservatives who argue that policies designed to increase minority representation by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation are unconstitutional.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending DEI programs within the federal government. The order cut funding for so-called DEI initiatives across all agencies in order to \"end DEI inside the federal government,\" according to Trump administration officials.",
      "A memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Tuesday evening called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave by Wednesday evening.",
      "Unlike some of the companies retooling or retiring their diversity initiatives, Target's work to build a more inclusive workforce predated 2020, and the company also was long seen as a trailblazer with respect to LGBTQ+ inclusion.",
      "But the employee memo shared Friday said Target no longer would participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they're connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.",
      "Getting corporations to withdraw from the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and to stop sponsoring Pride activities have been goals of DEI opponents.",
      "Steering clear of a backlash from conservative customers and organizations is something that Target has tried to navigate for a while. As transgender rights became a more prominent issue in 2016, the company declared that \"inclusivity is a core belief at Target\" and said it supported transgender employees and customers using whichever restroom or fitting room \"corresponds with their gender identity.\"",
      "But after some customers threatened to boycott Target stores, the company said that more stores would make available a single-toilet bathroom with a door that could be locked.",
      "In 2023, Target faced an anti-LGBTQ campaign that went viral on social media. The campaign\u00a0threatened employees and there were some instances of damaged products and displays in stores. In response, Target removed certain items that it said caused the most \"volatile\" reaction from opponents.",
      "The company did not stock its stores with Pride Month products in 2024.",
      "Still, some prominent companies have resisted public pressure to retreat from their diversity plans. On Thursday, Costco shareholders rejected a proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion practices.",

    "summary": "Republican lawmakers are floating a range of ideas to pay for an extension of President Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.",
    "story": [
      "A key economic priority for President Trump this year is to extend the provisions in his signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a 2017 law that lowered tax rates for most Americans, before they expire at the end of 2025. Now, Republican lawmakers have developed a 50-page laundry list of ideas for how to pay for those planned cuts.",
      "The plan from congressional Republicans,\u00a0published earlier by the New York Times, was confirmed by a person familiar with the document, who noted that it represents a menu of policy options for lawmakers to consider. The document also cites several new tax breaks proposed by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail last falls, such as eliminating taxes on overtime and tips.",
      "But extending the TCJA's provisions alone could prove costly, with the Congressional Budget Office forecasting a cost of $4.6 trillion over 10 years. Adding new tax breaks, such as Mr. Trump's promise to ditch taxes on overtime pay, could push up the bill even higher at a time when the nation's debt has spiraled to more than $36 trillion.",
      "According to the document, some ideas for funding those tax breaks include eliminating the mortgage home deduction, a popular break for homeowners, and the deductibility of student loan interest. Other methods to drum up more money include an across-the-board 10% import tariff \u2014 essentially, a universal tax on U.S. imports that would be paid by consumers.",
      "The plan also outlines ideas for cutting federal spending, primarily by trimming outlays for social safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. Overall, the document points to a potential tax overhaul that could put more money in the pockets of wealthier \u00a0Americans while cutting assistance for low- and middle-class taxpayers, experts say.",
      "\"If you are extending the tax cuts and enacting tariffs and cutting Medicaid, that will deliver benefits more among higher-income households, and more of a cost will be born by lower-income households,\" Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a tax-focused think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Adding a blanket 10% tariff could raise $1.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the document shared with Republican lawmakers. But tariffs are largely paid by consumers because companies tend to raise their prices to cover the extra import duties. Mr. Trump's tariffs could add $2,600 a year in costs for the typical U.S. family, according to an August\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic issues.",
      "Trump administration officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Tax breaks that could disappear",
      "Some long-standing tax breaks could face elimination, according to the document:",
      "Mortgage interest deduction: This could either be cut entirely or lowered to a $500,000 cap, with the former idea saving $1 trillion over a decade and the latter $50 billion over the same period.\"Head of household\" tax filing status: This filing status provides a larger standard deduction for unmarried adults with children. Eliminating it could save $192 billion over 10 years.\u00a0American Opportunity Credit: This $2,500 tax credit is given for educational expenses amassed over the first four years of a person's higher education. Revoking it would save $59 billion over a decade.\u00a0Child and Dependent Care tax credit: This credit helps families with young children pay for up to $2,100 in annual child care expenses. Waiving it would save $55 billion over a decade.Student loan interest deduction:\u00a0Scrapping this deduction, used by people with student loan debt, could save $50 billion over 10 years.\u00a0Lifetime Learning Credit: This nonrefundable tax credit is equal to 20% of qualified tuition and related expenses under $10,000. Repealing it would save $26 billion over 10 years.",

Removing this tax would cost the U.S. $370 billion over 10 years.\u00a0Raising or eliminating the SALT deduction cap: Mr. Trump's TCJA introduced a controversial $10,000 cap on deducting state and local taxes, or SALT. Under the latest Republican proposals, the cap could be eliminated or raised to higher thresholds, such as $20,000 for married couples. The cost could range from $100 billion to up to $1 trillion, depending on the size of the change.\u00a0Making auto loan interest tax deductible: This idea, which was\u00a0floated by Mr. Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign, could cost $61 billion over a decade.",

      "While campaigning last year, Mr. Trump proposed scrapping the $10,000 cap on the SALT deduction, which he introduced in his 2017 tax bill. The issue has become increasingly unpopular among Republicans and Democrats alike, as rising home values and property taxes across the nation means more homeowners are feeling the pinch from the deduction limit.",
      "\"The SALT cap was effectively one of the biggest pay-fors in the 2017 legislation, and raising it is expensive,\" the Tax Policy Center's Rosenberg said. \"The president recently signaled again that the most likely direction is for the SALT cap to be raised rather than to be eliminated.\"",

    "story": [
      "Economic losses from hurricanes and other natural disasters soared in the U.S. last year and were above average globally, reflecting another year of costly severe storms, floods and droughts.",
      "Damage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton helped push total economic losses from natural disasters in the U.S. to $217.8 billion last year, according to insurance broker Aon PLC. That figure represents an 85.3% increase from 2023, when losses totaled about $117.5 billion. It's also the largest annual tally of economic losses from natural disasters since 2017.",
      "Insured losses, or the portion of economic losses that are covered by insurance, also rose last year. They climbed 36% to $112.7 billion, the most since 2022. In some areas, homes are such great a risk that they're\u00a0too expensive to insure \u2014 if private insurance is even available at all.",
      "Hurricane Helene tore across six southeastern states last fall, costing $75 billion in economic losses, mainly due to inland and coastal flooding. according to Aon. Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton made landfall on the west coast of Florida, causing some $25 billion in economic losses.",
      "\"In 2024, one of the big differences is we had significant U.S. hurricane events that happened,\" said Liz Henderson, global head of climate risk advisory at Aon. \"When those events happen, they affect a large area and they affect areas with large values in terms of properties and people and content. So the losses from those events tend to be significantly higher.\"",
      "At least two other hurricanes, several severe \"convective\" storms and a draught contributed to the losses from natural disasters in the U.S. last year.",
      "In addition to the severe storms in the U.S., deadly floods in the Valencia region of Spain and other natural disasters drove worldwide economic losses from natural disasters to $368 billion last year, according to Aon. That's a 7.3% decline from 2023, but about 14% higher than the annual average going back to 2000. Global insured losses, meanwhile, climbed 15.1% to $145 billion.",
      "While it's impossible to predict the timing, location and losses from natural disasters, 2025 is not off to an encouraging start. The devastating wildfires that erupted in Los Angeles County on Jan. 7, killing at least 28 people and destroying more than 14,000 structures, are already projected to be among the costliest natural disasters.",
      "In a separate report last week, Aon estimated that total economic and insured losses for the two largest wildfires \u2014 the Palisades fire and the Eaton blaze burning just outside Los Angeles \u2014 could reach into the lower tens of billions of dollars, likely making them the costliest wildfires in U.S. history.",
      "Pacific Palisades, the Los Angeles neighborhood that's been\u00a0devastated by the Palisades fire, is emblematic of the insurance nightmare increasingly facing homeowners residing in regions prone to climate disasters.",
      "About 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades were dropped by State Farm in July, California Department of Insurance spokesman Michael Soller said in a Jan.16\u00a0 email to CBS MoneyWatch. An\u00a0analysis\u00a0of insurance data by CBS News San Francisco last year found that State Farm also dropped more than 2,000 policies in two other Los Angeles ZIP codes, which include the Brentwood, Calabasas, Hidden Hills and Monte Nido neighborhoods.",

    "summary": "Costco's public support of DEI programs contrasts with positions taken in recent months by other big U.S. brands",
    "story": [
      "Costco shareholders voted down a shareholder proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices.",
      "According to preliminary results shared by Costco executives at its annual meeting Thursday, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal.",
      "In a pre-recorded statement which was played at Costco's 2025 annual shareholders meeting on Jan. 23, the shareholder proposing the anti-DEI resolution, The National Center for Public Policy Research, said that \"Diversity, equity and inclusion may sound benign on the surface, but in reality it is weaponized language concealing a radical Marxist agenda.\"",
      "The shareholder continued to say that DEI \"comes at the expense of merit by not hiring and promoting completely, irrespective of race and sex.\"",
      "Prior to the shareholder meeting, Costco's board of directors had voted unanimously to ask investors to reject the motion. The board had said it believes \"our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary. The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information.\"",
      "Costco's defense of its DEI practices comes as other large U.S. corporations are shifting away from programs that encourage equality in the workplace for women, minorities and other groups. In recent weeks, companies including\u00a0Meta,\u00a0Ford,\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart\u00a0have ended their DEI programs, decisions that follow the 2023 Supreme Court decision\u00a0banning affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservative political activists.",
      "\"Our commitment to inclusion ... does not and has never included quotas or systematic preferences, nor does it mean compromising merit,\" said Tony E. James, Costco's board chair, said at Thursday's meeting. \"The demands of our business and our steadfast commitment to serve our members mean that we cannot afford to do anything but hire and promote the most qualified individuals,\"",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank based in Washington, had earlier submitted a\u00a0proposal\u00a0asking Costco to examine the risks of its DEI program, arguing that such initiatives hold \"litigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders.\"",
      "The think tank, which has made a similar proposal to Apple, cited the U.S. Supreme Court decision in July 2023 that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions.",
      "Costco: Diversity fosters \"creativity and innovation\"",
      "The directors' message to shareholders details how having diverse employees and suppliers has, in their view, fostered \"creativity and innovation in the merchandise and services that we offer\" and led to greater customer satisfaction among Costco members.",
      "In advance of the meeting, Neil Saunders, managing director of consulting firm GlobalData's retail division, said Costco could be confident the proposal would be rejected.",
      "\"I think people generally have confidence in Costco's management, and there's an attitude of 'Why rock the boat? It's sailing very nicely,'\" Saunders said.",
      "Costco's public stance in support of diversity, equity and inclusion programs contrasts with the positions taken in recent months by other big consumer brands that have backed away from DEI. Last week, more than 30 Walmart shareholders, including Amalgamated Bank and Oxfam America, asked the CEO of the nation's largest retailer to explain the business impact of curbing the company's DEI policies, a move they called \"disheartening.\"",
      "Emboldened by the Supreme Court's decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "On Monday, Trump signed an executive order aimed at terminating DEI programs within federal agencies. Conservatives have long condemned them, arguing they violate the U.S. Constitution by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation.",
      "The Trump administration's plan includes leveraging the Justice Department and other agencies to probe private companies pursuing training and hiring practices that conservative critics consider discriminatory against people who do not belong to minority groups, such as white men.",
      "Costco's financial performance",
      "As for Costco, the National Center for Public Policy Research alleged that at least 200,000 of the company's 300,000 employees worldwide \"are potentially victims of this type of illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight.\" If only a fraction of those employees were to sue Costco, the legal costs could be significant, the center said.",
      "Costco has a chief diversity officer, but the company's executive ranks do not reflect the diversity of its customers. Nearly 81% of the executives Costco had in place last year were white, and 72% of them were men, according to data published on its website. Saunders said members of Costco's management team typically stay a long time given the company's solid and stable financial performance.",
      "The warehouse giant's sales rose 7.5% in its most recent quarter versus the year-earlier period, while net income jumped 13% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, Costco's stock has soared about 36% during the past 12 months, outpacing the S&P 500's 26% gain over the same period.",
      "In other ways, Costco has been a bit of a maverick in the corporate world. It doesn't have an official corporate public relations team, and it hasn't focused on building up online business as much as rivals Walmart and Target.",
      "Apple's support of DEI",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research intends to present a proposal at Apple's Feb. 25 shareholder meeting that goes beyond what the think tank wants from Costco. The center's resolution asks the tech company to abolish its inclusion and equity department, policies and goals, describing them as \"consistent with, if not more radical than, most corporate DEI programs.",
      "Apple's board wants shareholders to vote down the proposal, saying the company strives \"to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\"",
      "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon this week joined the corporate leaders taking a stand in support of the expanded diversity goals some companies added after the 2020 police killing of George Floyd. Dimon defended his bank's DEI policies during an interview with CNBC.",
      "\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,\" he said, speaking Wednesday from the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. \"And wherever I go, red states, blue states, green states, mayors, governors and they said they like what we do.\"",
      "Trump's actions this week increase the potential legal risks for companies that resist the conservative backlash against DEI, according to David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law. But most big companies will have consulted their lawyers or performed an internal self-audit after the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling, Glasgow said.",
      "\"So if you are an Apple or another company who's done that, and you're confident in the legality of your existing DEI program, ... I think what you should do right now is stand firm,\" he said.",

      "\"Every car that comes out of any dealership is going to raise the prices,\" Maoli said. \"Parts come from all over the world.\"",
      "The average price of a new passenger vehicle in the U.S. in December was $49,740, according to Kelly Blue Blook.",
      "Maoli speculates that if tariffs are implemented, prices for new cars could jump anywhere from 5% to \"up to 15%.\"",
      "With higher prices for new cars, prices for used vehicles would also rise because of increased demand.",
      "Some of the biggest car brands, including Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, have plants in Mexico and Canada.",
      "And according to Maoli, more than half of the parts \u2014 such as batteries and motor components \u2014 for cars assembled at production plants in the U.S. are sourced elsewhere and could also get hit with tariffs, especially with the president also proposing new tariffs on China.",

    "summary": "Nearly 60% of Americans don't have enough money put away to handle common financial emergencies, according to Bankrate.",
    "story": [
      "Whether it's a busted refrigerator, car trouble or medical issues, unexpected costs are a part of life. But even such routine curveballs often spell serious financial trouble for many Americans.",
      "That's according to a new Bankrate report that surveyed more than 1,000 U.S. adults about their ability to handle a surprise bill. Despite the country's current\u00a0low unemployment rate, the annual study found that 59% of Americans in 2025 don't have enough savings to cover an unexpected $1,000 emergency expense.",
      "\"We are essentially a paycheck-to-paycheck nation,\" Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick said in a statement. \"Fewer Americans have the equivalent of a financial safety net to cover inevitable unexpected expenses, despite low unemployment and steady growth. This is one of the consequences of elevated prices stemming from inflation, the impacts of which are still being felt.\"",
      "A key issue in the 2024 presidential election, inflation and the rising\u00a0cost of everyday items\u00a0continues to impact Americans. Grocery inflation during the height of the coronavirus epidemic reached a\u00a0peak of 13.5% in 2022, while the overall rate of inflation for all products and services topped out at 9.1%.",
      "Although inflation has cooled to an annual rate of 2.9% as of December, prices for food, shelter and many other items remain elevated. Consumers also have found that many common products, from snacks to paper towels, have gotten smaller, a retailing tactic\u00a0known as \"shrinkflation\u00a0aimed at cutting a manufacturer's costs.",
      "In his Jan. 20 inaugural speech, President Trump said he would direct his cabinet \"to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.\"",
      "Whether the Trump administration can engineer such a feat remains to be seen, while polls suggest that many Americans are skeptical that prices will return to earth. Economists also warn that Mr. Trump's policies, which could include steep new tariffs on U.S. imports and the deportation millions of undocumented immigrants, could prove inflationary.",
      "Younger Americans worry most",
      "To be sure, the meteoric rise in the cost of food, housing and health care over the past several years has made it hard for many households to make ends meet, let alone save money. Bankrate's survey shows that 73% of Americans said they're saving less for unexpected expenses, compared with 68% in 2024.",
      "\"Though inflation is no longer rising as quickly as it did in recent years, more people this year feel the economy has affected their savings,\" according to the Bankrate report.",
      "Younger Americans tend to have the strongest concerns about their savings. A whopping 80% of Gen Zers worry about being able to cover immediate expenses if they were to suddenly lose their primary source of income, compared with 72% for Millennials and Gen Xers. Some 58% of Baby Boomers say they regularly fret about having enough money put away, a particular concern given that many are already retired.",
      "Borrower nation",
      "Only 41% of Americans said they would be able to tap their savings to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense, according to Bankrate's report. That's down 3% from 2024 and the lowest the percentage since 2021 (39%)",
      "Another 25% said they would use a credit card to pay for a $1,000 bill, 13% said they would turn to a family member for the money and 5% said they would take out a personal loan. In total, about 43% of respondents told Bankrate they would have to borrow money to pay for an emergency expense of $1,000.",
      "That's a concern given consumers collectively owe a record $1.14 trillion in credit card debt, figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u00a0show. Meanwhile, credit card rates continue to soar, hovering round 24%.",

To figure out how much to put away, add the total amount you spend each month on food, housing, gas and other bills.

      "In March 2022, the Federal Reserve started raising the federal funds rate, with banks following suit by hiking rates for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. But those increases were not matched with high interest rate payouts on savings accounts at banks including Bank of America, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo, according to the lawmakers.",

    "story": [
      "The Sackler family and Purdue Pharma, the maker of the addictive painkiller oxycontin, have reached a $7.4 billion settlement with a bipartisan coalition of 15 states for fueling the opioid crisis, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Thursday.",
      "The settlement bars the Sackler family from selling opioids in the U.S. and ends its control of Purdue. This comes seven months after the Supreme Court overturned a prior deal with Purdue that would have given the Sackler family immunity from future opioid lawsuits, a provision that is not part of the new deal.",
      "This is the largest settlement with contributors to the opioid crisis in the U.S. The Sackler family will pay the vast majority of the settlement \u2014 a total of $6.5 billion over 15 years \u2014 while Purdue will pay nearly $900 million up front, if it's approved by the court.",
      "Over half of the settlement will be distributed over the first few years, including almost $3 billion from the Sacklers. The Sacklers will make a $1.5 billion initial payment, adding another $500 million after one year, $500 million after two years and the remaining $400 million after three years.",
      "The funds will go to communities nationwide to support opioid addiction treatment, prevention and recovery programs over the next 15 years.",
      "\"Families throughout New York and across the nation are suffering from the immense pain and loss wrought by the opioid crisis,\" James said in a release announcing the settlement Thursday. \"The Sackler family relentlessly pursued profit at the expense of vulnerable patients and played a critical role in starting and fueling the opioid epidemic. While no amount of money will ever fully repair the damage they caused, this massive influx of funds will bring resources to communities in need so that we can heal.\"",
      "\"The Sacklers' no longer have control of Purdue will never be allowed to sell opioids in the United States again,\" she added.",
      "The deal leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids. The states involved in the settlement will appoint a board of trustees to oversee the company and determine its future.",
      "The previous Purdue bankruptcy settlement was struck down by the Supreme Court in June 2024. In a 5-4 decision, the justices said that Sackler family members could not be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic. The original settlement would have required the Sacklers and Purdue to pay over $4.5 billion.",
      "\"Hundreds of millions of dollars that would have gone to victims was stuck, and we had to go back to square one,\" said Cheryl Juaire, a mother who lost two sons to opioid addiction, at a press conference with James announcing the settlement.",
      "\"Three and a half years ago, in the midst of this case, I lost my second son Sean, also to an overdose. I buried him in the midst of an ongoing mediation,\" she said. \"I truly hope that no one ever has to feel the devastation I have felt in losing two of my three children.\"",
      "Juaire noted that the new deal is \"even more than the original deal\" but emphasized that \"this will only happen if the parties that stood in the way the last time will not do so again.\"",
      "James has secured up to $250 million for New York from the settlement to support opioid treatment and recovery programs. She negotiated the settlement along with attorney generals from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.",

      "More than two years after recalling about 1.7 million Ionic smartwatches sold globally, Google-owned Fitbit will pay a $12.2 million penalty for failing to alert consumers that the products can overheat and cause burns, federal regulators said Thursday.",
      "Fitbit received numerous reports of the lithium-ion batteries in the watches overheating during 2018, 2019 and continuing into 2020, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). In early 2020, Fitbit made an update to address the defect, but continued to hear from people suffering burns and did not report the issue to regulators as legally required.",
      "\"While health-conscious people wore Fitbit Ionic smartwatches to track their fitness, they had no idea that the watches were putting their safety at risk. They didn't know about the hazard because Fitbit said nothing,\" CPSC Commissioner Rich Trumka Jr. said Thursday in a statement.",
      "The CPSC and Fitbit announced a recall of the Ionic smartwatches in March of 2020, saying the company had received 115 reports in the U.S. of the batteries in the devices overheating. Domestic customers reported 78 burn injuries, two involving third-degree burns and four of second-degree burns; another 40 incidents were reported internationally.",
      "Fitbit discontinued production of its Ionic model, which was used to track activity, heart rate and sleep, in 2020.",

      "About 1 million of the recalled smartwatches were sold in the U.S. at retailers including Best Buy, Kohl's and Target, as well as online at Amazon.com and Fitbit.com from September 2017 through December 2021.

      "In addition to the $12.25 million civil penalty, the settlement agreement requires Fitbit to maintain internal controls and procedures to ensure compliance with the Consumer Product Safety Act. The company also agreed to submit an annual report regarding its compliance program and internal controls, the CPSC stated.",

      "Mr. Trump's 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia upended a tradition of U.S. presidents first heading to the United Kingdom as their first trip abroad. It also underscored his administration's close ties to the rulers of the oil-rich Gulf states as his eponymous real estate company has pursued deals across the region as well.",
      "The comments from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reported early Thursday by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, came in a phone call with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"The crown prince affirmed the kingdom's intention to broaden its investments and trade with the United States over the next four years, in the amount of $600 billion, and potentially beyond that,\" the report said.",
      "The readout didn't elaborate on where those investments and trade could be placed. The U.S. in recent years has increasingly pulled away from relying on Saudi oil exports, which were the bedrock of their relationship for decades. Saudi sovereign wealth funds have taken large stakes in American businesses while also looking at sports, as well.",
      "Saudi Arabia does, however, rely predominantly on U.S.-made weapons and defense systems, which could be a part of the investment.",
      "There was no immediate readout from the White House on the call. It also wasn't immediately clear if Mr. Trump's call with the crown prince was his first with a foreign leader since re-entering the White House. However, it was the first such call to be reported.",
      "The crown prince, the de facto ruler of the oil-rich kingdom, also spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio early Thursday.",

      "\"The first foreign trip typically has been with the U.K. but ... I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450 billion worth of our products,\" Mr. Trump told journalists in the Oval Office. \"If Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450 billion or $500 - we'll up it for all the inflation - I think I'd probably go.\"",

    "story": [
      "In one of his first acts after returning to the Oval Office this week, President Trump tasked federal agencies with developing ways to potentially ease prices for U.S. consumers. But experts warn that his administration's crackdown on immigration could both drive up inflation as well as hurt a range of businesses by shrinking the nation's workforce.",
      "\"A reduction in labor supply means upward pressure on wages, which has different sector implications including inflationary pressure, especially for food prices,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said labor shortages stemming from the Trump administration's push to remove undocumented immigrants could curtail the production of some products and services.",
      "\"Ultimately, the main way immigration affects inflation is that if jobs are left open and production is unable to keep up with demand, that's going to lead to higher prices,\" he said.",
      "What sectors depend most on immigrant labor?",
      "According to\u00a0estimates\u00a0from the nonpartisan Center for Migration Studies of New York and other groups, roughly 8.3 million undocumented immigrants work in the U.S, or just over 5% of the country's workforce.",
      "Undocumented immigrants account for about 20% of the agriculture industry's overall workforce, although that figure can rise to roughly half for some speciality farms, according to Capital Economics, which advises large investors.",
      "\"It's the key sector that comes up time and time again,\" Brown said, noting that harvesting delicate fruit is more labor-intensive than, for example, growing cereal crops. That means mass deportations could lead to price hikes in the fruit aisle.",
      "\"The inflationary impact could affect food overall, but particularly fresher fruits, rather than the ingredients in more processed foods,\" he said.",
      "Construction companies, including businesses focused on home renovations and landscaping, have the next highest share of undocumented workers and would also likely face a labor shortage if the government clamps down.",
      "\"With regard to home improvement projects those prices, they might become unaffordable to the point where people feel they can't do them anymore. And the lack of supply will be a big issue there, too,\" Brown said.",
      "Restaurants and food service businesses, which employ large numbers of undocumented workers, could be at particular risk if deportations flare. A shortage of workers would likely force such enterprises, including millions of small eateries around the U.S., to raise their wages to attract new employees. But that would also lead to hikes in menu prices, potentially driving away customers.",
      "\"They don't necessarily have the ability to bid up wages, so it might be that those places just shut down because they don't have the labor,\" Brown said.",
      "\"Removing large numbers of immigrants would drastically reduce the labor force, which could lead to rising wages, but potentially just higher prices for food, building and repairing homes, hotel stays and more things Americans hope to see lower prices for,\" added Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "That's because there are some jobs where even higher pay generally fails to attract U.S. born workers, like farming. \"Wages might not rise and instead we'd just see a short-term lack of availability of workers for harvesting crops,\" she said.",
      "Bier of the Cato Institute notes that removing undocumented workers could also have a ripple effect on legally employed workers. For example, the construction industry has an estimated 2 million undocumented workers, but their bosses are mostly Americans.",
      "\"A lot of immigrants do jobs that support jobs held by Americans,\" he said.",
      "\"The same thing is true in hospitality. Americans are more likely to be in management and supervisory roles, so if you pull a bunch of workers you're supervising, there will be fewer jobs for those supervisors and you'll see everyone leveling down,\" Bier added. \"The economic effects are going to be much more diffuse than people expect.\"",

      "At a White House briefing on Tuesday for the project's announcement, the executives behind the venture described Stargate as an AI project that could also prove to be transformative, albeit via Earth-based tech rather than intergalactic travel.",
      "\"This will help people's lives. This will help solve many, many issues ... with the power of AI,\" said SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who joined Mr. Trump at the briefing, along with Altman and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.",

      "Other potential sites for data centers across the nation are also being evaluated, according to a person familiar with the project.",
      "What type of projects will Stargate AI pursue?",
      "The data centers will be used by OpenAI, according to the person familiar with the project.",
      "During the press conference, Ellison highlighted AI's ability to transform health care, saying that the tools provided by OpenAI and Softbank are helping to develop a cancer vaccine.",
      "\"You can do early cancer detection with a blood test, and, using AI to look at the blood test, you can find the cancer that is seriously threatening the person,\" Ellison said. \"Once we gene sequence that gene tumor, you can vaccinate the person against that cancer, and you can make that mRNA vaccine robotically using AI within 48 hours.\"",
      "How many jobs could Stargate create?",
      "Mr. Trump claimed the venture would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately,\" while OpenAI, in a statement on its website, says Stargate will \"create hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\"",
      "New hires for the project will be situated close to the data center locations, according to the person familiar with the venture. Stargate will hire people for construction, operations and other areas, they said.",
      "What is President Trump's AI policy?",
      "Mr. Trump is signaling a sharp divergence from former President Biden's AI policy. Within hours after returning to the White House, Mr. Trump made a symbolic mark on the future of artificial intelligence by repealing Biden's guardrails for the fast-developing technology.",
      "What will come next from Mr. Trump and how it will diverge from his predecessor's effort to safeguard AI technology remains unclear. The new administration didn't respond to requests for comment about the repealed Biden policy.",
      "Even so, Wall Street interpreted the Stargate project as a sign the Trump administration will encourage investment and growth of the AI sector, especially as a way to bolster the nation's AI capabilities as it competes with China for tech dominance.",
      "\"The key role of Softbank, a Japanese company, in Stargate, highlights how Trump isn't hell-bent on excluding foreign firms from participating in America's quest for dominance in AI \u2013 provided they are headquartered in countries that are close allies of the U.S.,\" Capital Economics' Higgins wrote.",
      "He added, \"The new president seems much less keen than his predecessor on imposing checks and balances on the spread of AI.\"",
      "Why are some skeptical about Stargate?",

      "Musk also has a public feud with OpenAI and Altman, alleging in a lawsuit last year that the company and its CEO violated OpenAI's original mission statement by putting profits over benefiting humanity. After helping found OpenAI in 2015, Musk broke with the company, claiming that the AI firm had veered away from its founding agreement that it would use its technology to benefit the public and that it would open its technology for public use.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's DOGE is taking aim at the U.S. penny, pointing out that it costs more to manufacture than it's worth.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has a new target in its sights for trimming federal spending: the U.S. penny.",
      "In Tuesday X post, Musk's DOGE wrote that the U.S. spends about 3 cents to mint each penny, which, of course, is only valued at 1 cent.",
      "\"The penny costs over 3 cents to make and cost U.S. taxpayers over $179 million in FY2023,\" DOGE wrote. \"The Mint produced over 4.5 billion pennies in FY2023, around 40% of the 11.4 billion coins for circulation produced.\"",
      "In pointing out the penny's costliness, DOGE is taking aim at an issue that has sparked debate for years, although the price of manufacturing the cent has only grown over the past several years. In 2016, for instance, the U.S. was spending about 1.5 cents to mint each penny, or less than half of its current manufacturing cost.",
      "Still, the cent's $179 million in costs represents mere metaphorical pennies when it comes to DOGE's mandate to cut federal spending. President Donald Trump has said DOGE will provide recommendations to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\" Musk has said the group will aim to trim $500 billion in annual federal spending.",
      "DOGE co-leader\u00a0Vivek Ramaswamy, recently announced he is leaving the organization,\u00a0posting\u00a0on social media on Jan. 20 that he will be stepping back from the effort to run for Ohio governor.",

      "The penny's rising cost",
      "During the past year, the penny's costs have only continued to rise, with the U.S. Mint's 2024 annual report finding that one cent now costs about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute.",
      "Pennies are mostly made of zinc, with a copper overlay to give them their distinctive color. While zinc's price fluctuates from year to year, its cost per metric ton is now double what it was in 2016, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Federal officials have proposed suspending the penny in prior years, with former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew pushing the idea in 2015. Some economists have also advocated for dropping the penny from circulation, but there could be a costly downside to ditching the cent, as transactions would be rounded to 5-cent intervals, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said in a 2020 blog post.",
      "\"For a single item or small-value purchase, rounding up or down could represent a significant price change,\" the post noted.",
      "Other nations have ditched their equivalent of the penny, including Canada, which stopped minting its one-cent coin in 2012. One 2018 economic analysis found that Canadian consumers paid about $3.27 million in additional Canadian dollars at grocery stores each year due to prices being rounded higher after the change.",
      "\"On the other hand, there may be additional, hard-to-quantify costs to using pennies that would argue in favor of elimination. Counting pennies to make change takes time, and as the old business adage goes, time is money,\" the Richmond Fed noted.",
      "DOGE might want to set its sights beyond the lowly penny, as it's not the only coin that costs more to mint than it's worth. The U.S. Mint's 2024 annual report noted that it spends about 14 cents to make and distribute each nickel.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 08:38:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump campaigned on the promise to bring down the U.S. cost of living. That could be easier said than done.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, who while campaigning vowed to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" on Monday signaled his focus on the high cost of living in the U.S. by signing an executive order that requires \"all executive departments and agencies to deliver emergency price relief\" to Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 order blames several factors for the pandemic-era inflation surge that has left many households feeling financially pinched, including high federal spending under the Biden administration and costs from new regulations.",
      "\"It is critical to restore purchasing power to the American family and improve our quality of life,\" the executive order states.",
      "To accomplish that, Mr. Trump is ordering the departments and agencies that fall under the executive branch, including the departments of Commerce, Health and Human Services, Labor, and Energy, to take actions that lower prices for everything from housing and health costs to food and fuel.",
      "There's a lot riding on Mr. Trump's mandate given that U.S. voters last fall consistently ranked the economy and inflation as among their top issues. But whether Mr. Trump's order will meaningfully move the needle on inflation is uncertain, some economists say.",
      "\"Trump's cost of living order fails to address the root causes of inflation, namely corporate profiteering and broken supply chains,\" said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank. \"This order is a talking point, not a plan.\"",
      "Recent economic\u00a0research from the likes of Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, has found that spiking prices in 2021 and 2022 stemmed from factors such as supply-chain disruptions and increased commodity prices \u2014 forces that any president, including Mr. Trump, would struggle to control.",
      "The Trump administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "In the meantime, inflation has cooled dramatically since reaching a 40-year high in June 2022, although the consumer price index remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's goal of a 2% annual rate. While prices are rising more slowly, more than 4 in 10 Americans express pessimism about their own economic prospects over the next year due to the ongoing impact of inflation, Bankrate found in a December survey.",
      "Mr. Trump's plan: Deregulation, cheaper housing and more",
      "Mr. Trump's order targeting prices highlights several areas for federal departments to focus on, including reducing the number of federal regulations that Trump administration officials argue has driven up the cost of living for American families.",
      "\"In sum, unprecedented regulatory oppression from the Biden administration is estimated to have imposed almost $50,000 in costs on the average American household,\" the order states.",
      "That refers to an analysis from University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan, whose research found that the Biden administration's regulations may over time add a total of about $47,000 in added costs per household. Fuel emission rules from the Obama and Biden administrations are also forecast to boost the cost of vehicles by $6,000 each, Mulligan estimated.",
      "But eliminating federal regulations that protect workers and consumers won't lower the cost of living, Owens said. Americans have been struggling with cost-of-living issues for decades, ranging from soaring health care costs to rising housing prices \u2014 trends rooted in structural problems such as a shortage of available housing and the nation's complex for-profit health care system.",
      "To be sure, Mr. Trump nodded to some of those issues in his order, requiring federal departments to \"lower the cost of housing and expand housing supply\" and \"eliminate unnecessary administrative expenses and rent-seeking practices that increase health care costs.\"",
      "While those are ambitious goals, tackling housing costs is notoriously difficult given that new construction is often constrained by state and local laws, from zoning restrictions to environmental regulations \u2014 issues over which the federal government is unlikely to have much leverage.",
      "Lowering medical costs could help American households, which\u00a0spend more on health care than any other developed nation. Yet Mr. Trump also signed an executive order on Jan. 20 that revokes a Biden administration effort to lower prescription costs, which is seemingly at odds with his cost-of-living directive.",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump also signed a separate executive order on Jan. 20 declaring a national energy emergency, part of his administration's plan to ramp up domestic energy production and lower costs.",
      "\"The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is likely to have some convincing to do that he has a recipe for lowering prices. In a recent poll by CBS News, roughly 40% of people said they expected grocery prices to drop under the Trump administration, while 37% thought costs would rise.",
      "Another\u00a0survey, from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, revealed less confidence on the direction of prices:\u00a02 in 10 Americans said they are \"extremely\" or \"very\" confident that Mr. Trump will be able to make progress on lowering the cost of groceries, housing or health care this year.",
      "In an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Time Magazine, which named him 2024 Person of the Year, Mr. Trump acknowledged that bringing down food costs will be a difficult challenge.",
      "\"I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard. But I think that they will,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2025 14:44:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Senate Democrats are asking for documents related to allegations the nominee to lead the FBI, Kash Patel, prematurely confirmed hostage rescue details.",
    "story": [
      "Days before this week's high-stakes confirmation hearing of Kash Patel to be FBI director, a bureau insider has come forward with new information questioning Patel's judgment during sensitive hostage rescue missions, CBS News has learned.",
      "The whistleblower, whose identity is being withheld by Senate Democrats for fear of retaliation, worked with the FBI's Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, which leads the government's missions to rescue hostages overseas. The whistleblower\u00a0alleges that Patel violated firmly entrenched protocols to keep such operations under wraps until the captives are safely in U.S. hands and their families have been notified.",
      "In a letter obtained by CBS News, Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote that Patel, while serving on the National Security Council during the first Trump term, \"broke protocol regarding hostage rescues by publicly commenting without authorization on the then-in-progress retrieval of two Americans held captive by Iranian-backed militants in Yemen in October 2020.\"",
      "According to the letter, on Oct. 14 at 10:55 a.m., the Wall Street Journal published a story in which Patel confirmed that the two American captives and the remains of a third were exchanged for two hundred Houthi fighters who were being held in Saudi Arabia. According to the letter, the news report was published \"several hours before the hostages were in the confirmed custody of the United States.\" In the end the Americans returned home safely, but FBI officials involved in the mission were livid over Patel's leak, which they regarded as reckless and potentially risking tragic results.",
      "Democratic senators sent the letter Monday morning to Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Acting Treasury Secretary David Lebryk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. It asks for all records of communications between Patel and the FBI's Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell concerning the rescue of the captives, as well as any records reflecting authorization for him to disclose the hostage deal before there was confirmation that the Americans were safely in U.S, hands.",
      "No Republican senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee signed the letter.",
      "A source close to the confirmation said in response to the allegations, \"Mr. Patel was a public defender, decorated prosecutor and accomplished national security official that kept Americans safe. He has a track record of success in every branch of government, from the court room to congressional hearing room to the situation room. There is no veracity to this anonymous source's complaints about protocol.\"",
      "The Durbin letter offers a glimpse into the Democratic strategy for Thursday's confirmation hearing. Knowledgeable sources tell CBS News that senators will seek to show that Patel has engaged in a pattern of poor judgment and self-aggrandizement regarding sensitive life-and-death missions and use that portrayal to cast doubt on his fitness to lead the FBI.",
      "The letter says any official \"who puts missions or the lives of Americans in jeopardy for public notoriety and personal gain is unfit to lead the country's primary federal law enforcement and investigative agency.\"",
      "The Democrats plan to highlight another instance where Patel has been criticized for his handling of a sensitive operation aimed at freeing American captives. Two weeks after the Yemen hostage deal, Patel found himself in the middle of another high-risk operation. Philip Walton was a 27-year-old American who had been seized by armed men at his farm in Niger, near the Nigerian border.",
      "The kidnappers transported Walton to Nigeria and demanded a million dollars in ransom. There were also indications that the kidnappers were contemplating turning him over to a terrorist group operating in the region. Patel was accompanying President Trump on a visit to Fort Bragg, the military installation in North Carolina that is home to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command. While they were there, Patel received intelligence that Walton would be held at an encampment for several hours, enough time to stage a daring Seal Team 6 raid to rescue the hostage. Mr. Trump signed off on the operation, which involved parachuting into Northern Nigeria and trekking for miles to the compound where Walton was being held.",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper had greenlit the plan, but there were still some final questions that needed to be answered before he could give the go order \u2013 primarily whether the Nigerian government had given the U.S. permission to use its air space. According to Esper's memoir, Patel, who was the senior director for counterterrorism at the time, assured Defense Department officials that the State Department had received the necessary permission from the Nigerians. But Patel's information was incorrect: the Nigerians had not given their approval.",
      "By this time, Air Force planes carrying the Navy SEALs were in the air just a few miles from the Nigerian border. Esper wrote in his memoir, \"A Sacred Oath,\" he realized the government had to make an agonizing decision. He told the White House they could go forward with the operation and risk having their planes shot down \u2014 or abort the mission and miss a crucial opportunity to save Walton.\u00a0 But at the last minute, word came that the State Department had received clearance to use Nigerian airspace. The mission went forward, was executed flawlessly, and Walton was returned to safety.",
      "But Esper and other officials were furious at the role Patel had played, believing he had inserted himself into the operation in violation of regular protocol, and then nearly botched it by transmitting false information. According to Esper's account, Patel's carelessness carried significant risk for the SEALs.",
      "\"I was concerned that being packed in an aircraft burning holes in the sky for an extra hour or so would wear on the special operators, that it might affect their readiness somehow,\" he wrote in his memoir.",
      "Esper also wrote of the incident, \"My team suspected Patel made the approval story up, but they didn't have all the facts.\"",
      "Patel has denied Esper's version of events. In his own book, \"Government Gangsters,\" Patel portrays Esper as a \"deep-state\" actor who \"always seemed to be subverting the president's agenda,\" including by putting up obstacles to counterterrorism raids in Africa and the Middle East.\" He argued that Mr. Trump had the ultimate authority to order the mission.",
      "Last week, Durbin met with Patel and asked him about Esper's account of his role in the nearly botched Nigerian raid. Sources said Patel again refuted Esper's version of events. Durbin did not yet have the whistleblower's information about the Yemen hostage deal, but he is expected to closely question the FBI nominee about that episode at Thursday's confirmation hearing.",
      "However Patel's answers those questions, there is no suspense as to how Durbin and his fellow Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee will vote. After his meeting with Patel, Durbin issued a statement saying he will not vote to confirm Patel.",

      "U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta said Monday, \"[I]t would be improper for the court post-commutation to modify the original sentences,\" but because President Trump's clemency \"can reasonably be read to extinguish enforcement of Defendants' terms of supervised release,\" the judge vacated his order.",
      "Mehta on Friday had ordered the Oath Keeper members Rhodes, Kelly Meggs, Kenneth Harrelson, Jessica Watkins, Roberto Minuta, Edward Vallejo, David Moerchel, and Joseph Hacket to be barred from entering Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Capitol building \"without first obtaining the permission from the Court.\"",
      "The decision prompted staunch opposition from Washington, D.C. Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Martin, who wrote that the defendants, including Rhodes, were \"no longer subject to the terms of supervised release and probation.\"",
      "Mehta, in reversing his decision, said he ultimately found Martin's interpretation of President Trump's unconditional commutation\u00a0 to be \"reasonable.\"",
      "Last week, as part of the mass clemency Mr. Trump extended to those tied to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, he pardoned over 1,500 defendants, but opted to commute the sentences of Rhodes, his co-defendants and certain members of the Proud Boys group who were also charged with seditious conspiracy. Not all of those who received commutations were ultimately convicted of the seditious conspiracy charge.",
      "Days after receiving commutation, Rhodes and other Jan. 6 defendants appeared on Capitol Hill.",
      "The judge wrote that while the parties initially operated \"as if the commutations addressed only the custodial portions of Defendants' sentences but not their terms of supervised release,\" upon further review and in response to objections from the defendants, he found that once a commutation is issued for a defendant, they are \"required to take no further action to receive its benefit.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is set to vote Monday evening on the confirmation of Scott Bessent as treasury secretary, as Senate Republicans work to quickly install President Trump's picks for top administration posts.",
      "Bessent, 62, is the founder of Connecticut-based hedge fund Key Square Group and would be the first Senate-confirmed openly gay Cabinet member of a Republican administration.",
      "The nominee for treasury secretary appeared before the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month, which advanced Bessent's nomination on a bipartisan basis last week.",
      "\"Mr. Bessent has decades of academic, professional and leadership experience relevant to this position, as well as the gravitas, demeanor and character to be an effective secretary,\" Sen. Mike Crapo, the finance committee's chairman, said ahead of the vote to advance Bessent's nomination out of committee. \"There is no doubt that Mr. Bessent is an excellent choice for secretary of the treasury.\"",
      "Bessent outlined in his opening statement to the committee that he was born and raised in South Carolina's lowcountry, where he said his family struggled financially, and he first began working at the age of nine. He went on to attend Yale University and started working in finance. He and his husband, former New York City prosecutor John Freeman, have two children.",
      "\"My life has been the only-in-America story that I am determined to preserve for future generations,\" Bessent said.",
      "Bessent said his work in the private sector has given him a \"deep understanding\" of the economy and markets, which he said will be invaluable in crafting economic policy. But he acknowledged that he has never served in government and intends to lean on others for counsel.",
      "The billionaire, a former executive with Soros Fund Management, provided economic advice to the Trump campaign and has been a vocal supporter of Mr. Trump's policies in recent years \u2014 from tariffs to spending cuts.",
      "Bessent said during the committee hearing that he believes the president has a \"generational opportunity to unleash a new economic golden age that will create more jobs, wealth and prosperity for all Americans.\"",
      "\"Today, Americans face significant challenges in an economy that has not created enough opportunities for working men and women,\" Bessent said, pointing to an affordability crisis and housing shortage. He said the federal government has a \"significant spending problem,\" adding that \"we must work to get our fiscal house in order\" and adjust discretionary spending.",
      "As treasury secretary, Bessent would oversee the department that manages the nation's finances, as well as the IRS, the nation's tax agency.",
      "Among his priorities, Bessent called the extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, some of which are set to expire at year's end, the \"single most important economic issue of the day.\" If the tax cuts aren't extended, Bessent warned, the nation would face \"economic calamity.\"",
      "Bessent's confirmation vote comes as the Senate has since Mr. Trump took office last week\u00a0 confirmed a handful of his Cabinet and top administration picks, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "This week, the upper chamber is expected to push forward with a handful of other confirmation votes, while some of the most controversial nominees \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services and Kash Patel for FBI director \u2014 come before Senate committees for confirmation hearings.",

    "summary": "Earlier Sunday, Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he rejected deportation flights because the deportees were being transported in military aircraft.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump will hold off on imposing steep tariffs on Colombia after the country's government agreed to accept deported migrants being returned on military planes, the White House said Sunday night.",
      "Mr. Trump earlier on Sunday vowed swift and punishing retaliation after the Colombian government over the weekend blocked the arrival of deportation flights from the U.S., objecting to the Trump administration's efforts to use military planes to deport migrants.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on social media on Sunday that his administration would put in place several actions against Colombia, including a 25% tariff \u2014 that he said would be raised to 50% after one week \u2014 on all goods coming into the U.S. from Colombia.",
      "He also announced a travel ban and \"immediate visa revocation\" for Colombian government officials and \"their allies,\" visa sanctions on Colombian authorities and their relatives and enhanced customs inspections on travelers and cargo from Colombia.",
      "\"These measures are just the beginning,\" Mr. Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States!\"",
      "But late Sunday night, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"The Government of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump's terms, including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay. Based on this agreement, the fully drafted IEEPA tariffs and sanctions will be held in reserve, and not signed, unless Colombia fails to honor this agreement.\"",
      "\"The visa sanctions issued by the State Department, and enhanced inspections from Customs and Border Protection, will remain in effect until the first planeload of Colombian deportees is successfully returned,\" Leavitt's statement said.",
      "Colombia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement the country had \"overcome the impasse\" with the U.S., and said its foreign minister and ambassador would travel to Washington, D.C., \"in the next few hours\" to continue discussing the agreement.",
      "\"We will continue to receive Colombians who return as deportees, guaranteeing them dignified conditions, as citizens subject to rights,\" the Foreign Ministry said. The ministry's statement made no mention of U.S. military planes, but said Colombia's presidential plane would be used to return migrants who had been scheduled to be deported Sunday morning.",
      "A senior Trump administration official had earlier told CBS News the use of the presidential plane would not be enough to stave off Mr. Trump's proposed tariffs and sanctions.",
      "A senior administration official earlier Sunday said Mr. Trump's actions amounted to \"a clear message\" to countries that they \"have an obligation to accept repatriation flights.\"",
      "Prior to Sunday night's announced agreement, Colombian President Gustavo Petro said on social media \"Your blockade doesn't scare me,\" and said Colombia would respond to the raised tariffs with a 50% tariff of its own on U.S. goods. In reference to the travel ban, Petro said, \"I don't really like traveling to the U.S., it's a bit boring.\"",
      "Petro also predicted the U.S. could \"try to carry out a coup with your economic strength and your arrogance, like they did with Allende. ... Overthrow me, President, and the Americas and humanity will respond,\" Petro wrote.",
      "In a statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was Colombia's responsibility to take back citizens who are illegally in the U.S. \"in a serious and expeditious manner.\"",
      "\"Colombian President Petro had authorized flights and provided all needed authorizations and then canceled his authorization when the planes were in the air,\" Rubio said. \"As demonstrated by today's actions, we are unwavering in our commitment to end illegal immigration and bolster America's border security.\"",
      "Later Sunday, the State Department confirmed Rubio had \"ordered a suspension of visa issuance at the U.S. Embassy Bogota consular section.\"",
      "\"Secretary Rubio is now authorizing travel sanctions on individuals and their families, who were responsible for the interference of U.S. repatriation flight operations,\" the State Department said. \"Measures will continue until Colombia meets its obligations to accept the return of its own citizens. America will not back down when it comes to defending its national security interests.\"",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News that U.S. Customs and Border Protection was already implementing a travel ban on Colombian government officials and diplomats traveling with what are known as A and G visas as of Sunday night. The agency had also started enhanced customs inspections on cargo from Colombia, the official added. CBP later confirmed those actions in a public statement.",
      "Earlier on Sunday, Petro said he rejected the deportation flights because the deportees were being transported in military aircraft, arguing such a move treated migrants as criminals.",
      "\"The United States must establish a protocol for the dignified treatment of migrants before we receive them,\" Petro wrote on social media. He added that he would accept deportation flights, as long as they were conducted on civilian planes.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS that the Colombian migrants who were scheduled to be deported on Sunday on these planes were back in the U.S. and will remain in DHS custody until a new agreement was reached.",
      "Two U.S. officials told CBS News there were two Department of Defense planes with migrant deportees expected to land in Colombia on Sunday, after departing the San Diego area near the southern border. But those plans were scrapped overnight.",
      "One of the U.S. officials said the plan was to deport roughly 80 Colombian migrants on each military plane.",
      "Colombia's decision to block the U.S. deportation flights over the weekend was an early diplomatic setback for the Trump administration as it lays the foundation for its promised mass deportation campaign and crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "As part of that crackdown, President Trump has moved to vastly increase the role the U.S. military plays in immigration enforcement, declaring a national emergency to deploy an additional 1,500 Army soldiers and Marines to the southern border. The troops have been assigned to erect border barriers and help Customs and Border Protection in an operational capacity. Long-standing legal limits bar the use of soldiers for the civil enforcement of laws, including U.S. immigration law.",
      "Earlier in the week, the administration used military aircraft to deport Guatemalan migrants who had crossed the southern border illegally back to Guatemala, publicizing the move as the start of their mass deportation effort.",

    "summary": "The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic most likely originated from a laboratory.",
    "story": [
      "The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic most likely originated from a laboratory, according to an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even while acknowledging that the spy agency has \"low confidence\" in its own conclusion.",
      "The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of President Trump's pick to lead the agency, John Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director.",
      "\"CIA assesses with low confidence that a research-related origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely than a natural origin based on the available body of reporting. CIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,\" a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement, noting they \"will continue to evaluate any available credible new intelligence reporting or open-source information that could change CIA's assessment.\"",
      "Jake Sullivan, the Biden administration national security adviser, ordered a classified review in December of U.S. intelligence that had been gathered on the origins of COVID-19, one current and one former U.S. official confirmed to CBS News. Sullivan convened a panel of outside experts to assess the intelligence and asked the intelligence community to review its data and form a conclusion. Both officials told CBS News there was no new \"smoking gun,\" but rather a low-confidence assessment based on the same data. Burns ordered the review before leaving the CIA, citing high policymaker interest.",
      "The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the agency's assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory.",
      "Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities.",
      "Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China's virology labs.",
      "China said Monday it disagreed with the assessment.",
      "\"The conclusion that a laboratory leak is extremely unlikely was reached by the China-WHO joint expert team based on field visits to relevant laboratories in Wuhan,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said. \"This has been widely recognized by the international community and the scientific community.\"",
      "U.S. lawmakers have pressured America's spy agencies for more information about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths. It's a question with significant domestic and geopolitical implications as the world continues to grapple with the pandemic's legacy.",
      "Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Saturday he was \"pleased the CIA concluded in the final days of the Biden administration that the lab-leak theory is the most plausible explanation\" and he commended Ratcliffe for declassifying the assessment.",
      "\"Now, the most important thing is to make China pay for unleashing a plague on the world,\" Cotton said in a statement.",
      "Chinese authorities have dismissed speculation about COVID's origins as unhelpful and motivated by politics. On Saturday, a spokesperson for China's U.S. embassy said the CIA report has no credibility.",
      "\"We firmly oppose the politicization and stigmatization of the source of the virus, and once again call on everyone to respect science and stay away from conspiracy theories,\" embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press.",
      "While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably raccoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "Some official investigations, however, have raised the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago a report by the Energy Department concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the finding.",
      "The same year then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency believed the virus \"most likely\" spread after escaping from a lab.",
      "Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario, too.",
      "\"The lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense,\" Ratcliffe said in 2023.",

      "Though the resolution is unlikely to pass through the Republican-controlled Senate, its formal introduction could force some Republicans to publicly and declaratively object to the measure.

    "summary": "Perplexity is seeking to create a new $300-billion public company with TikTok's U.S. business and include investments from other investors.",
    "story": [
      "Perplexity AI has presented a new proposal to TikTok's parent company that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "The proposal, submitted last week, is a revision of a prior plan the artificial intelligence startup had presented to TikTok's parent ByteDance on Jan. 18, a day before the law that bans TikTok went into effect.",
      "The first proposal, which ByteDance hasn't responded to, sought to create a new structure that would merge San Francisco-based Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business and include investments from other investors.",
      "The new proposal would allow the U.S. government to own up to half of that new structure once it makes an initial public offering of at least $300 billion, said the person, who was not authorized to speak about the proposal. The person said Perplexity's proposal was revised based off of feedback from the Trump administration.",
      "If the plan is successful, the shares owned by the government would not have voting power, the person said. The government also would not get a seat on the new company's board.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Under the plan, ByteDance would not have to completely cut ties with TikTok, a favorable outcome for its investors. But it would have to allow a \"full U.S. board control,\" the person said.",
      "Under the proposal, the China-based tech company would contribute TikTok's U.S. business without the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app, according to a document seen by the Associated Press.",
      "The proposal seems to mirror a strategy Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary during President Donald Trump's first term, discussed Sunday on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures \u2014 that a new investor in TikTok could simply \"dilute down\" the Chinese ownership and satisfy the law. Mnuchin has previously expressed interest in investing in the company.",
      "\"But the technology needs to be disconnected from China,\" he added. \"It needs to be disconnected from ByteDance. There's absolutely no way that China would ever let us have something like that in China.\"",
      "The Perplexity proposal comes as several investors are expressing interest in TikTok. Mr. Trump said late Saturday that he expects a deal will be made in as soon as 30 days.",
      "On\u00a0a flight from Las Vegas to Miami on Air Force One, Mr. Trump also said he hadn't discussed a deal with Larry Ellison, CEO of software maker Oracle, despite\u00a0a report\u00a0that Oracle, along with outside investors, was considering taking over TikTok's global operation.",
      "\"Numerous people are talking to me. Very substantial people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary. ... I'd only do it if the United States benefits.\"",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, TikTok was to be banned in the United States by Jan. 19 if it did not cut ties with ByteDance. The Supreme Court upheld the law, but Mr. Trump then issued an executive order to halt enforcement of the law for 75 days.",
      "Mr. Trump, on Air Force One, noted that Ellison lives \"right down the road\" from his Mar-a-Lago estate, but added, \"I never spoke to Larry about TikTok. I've spoken to many people about TikTok and there's great interest in TikTok.\"",
      "TikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. a week ago, but went back online after Mr. Trump said he would postpone the ban. Mr. Trump had unsuccessfully attempted a U.S. ban of the platform during his first term. But he has since reversed his position and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters during last year's presidential election.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Mr. Trump's inauguration Jan. 20, along with some other tech leaders who've been forging friendlier ties with the new administration.",
      "Congress voted to ban TikTok in the U.S. out of concern that TikTok's ownership structure represented a security risk. The Biden administration argued in court for months that it was too much of a risk to allow a Chinese company to control the algorithm that fuels what people see on the app. Officials also raised concerns about user data collected on the platform.",

His other executive actions, including the ICE order, could face legal challenges.",
      "However, it was the church and schools order that drew ire from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Mark. J Seitz, migration committee chairman U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, told CBS News \"Many of these policies we see going against the basic tenets of our faith.\"",
      "Vance, a devout Catholic, sharply rebuked the bishops' condemnation. \"Because as a practicing Catholic, I was actually heartbroken by that statement,\" he said.",
      "Vance told Brennan the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops \"has, frankly, not been a good partner in common sense immigration enforcement that the American people voted for.\"",
      "Brennan asked Vance if he specifically supported immigration agents going into churches and schools, and \"conducting a raid or enforcement action in a church service, at a school.\"",
      "Vance said he \"supports us doing law enforcement against violent criminals, whether they're illegal immigrants or anybody else, in a way that keeps us safe.\"",
      "Vance asked if the bishops were more worried about their bottom line, noting they received over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants.",
      "He said he hopes \"as a devout Catholic, that they'll do better.\"",
      "In response, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said Sunday in a statement, \"Faithful to the teaching of Jesus Christ, the Catholic Church has a long history of serving refugees.\"",
      "\"In 1980, the bishops of the United States began partnering with the federal government to carry out this service when Congress created the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). Every person resettled through USRAP is vetted and approved for the program by the federal government while outside of the United States,\" the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said. \"In our agreements with the government, the USCCB receives funds to do this work; however, these funds are not sufficient to cover the entire cost of these programs. Nonetheless, this remains a work of mercy and ministry of the Church.\"",
      "Many resettlement refugee agencies are faith-based groups. On Friday many of these groups were also told some of their federal funding would be suspended days after Trump enacted an indefinite pause on admissions of refugees to the United States.",

    "summary": "The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, provides billions in funding to organizations to combat HIV.",
    "story": [
      "The foreign aid pause ordered by Secretary of State Marco Rubio will cause a stoppage of funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, as soon as Monday, according to two sources. This could interrupt the provision of anti-viral medications (ARVs) for millions.",
      "It is not clear whether local stockpiles of the drugs can make up for any delivery shortfalls that could occur during the pause, the sources said.",
      "While funding could be turned back on pending the outcome of a 90-day review, there is also growing concern among advocates that congressional support for PEPFAR is in peril due to a revelation earlier this month that groups receiving aid performed abortions, a violation of U.S. law.",
      "Reuters reported that four nurses in Mozambique had performed 21 abortions since 2021. That revelation may also be part of the upcoming State Department review.",
      "The State Department administers the PEPFAR program which began under the George W. Bush administration and is credited with saving millions of lives all over the world. It provides billions in funding to organizations to combat HIV and currently provides ARVs to more than 20 million people across 55 countries, according to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "President Trump issued an executive order triggering a 90-day review of U.S. foreign aid programs. CBS News obtained a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) memo sent Saturday that says the foreign aid pause \"means a complete halt\" with limited exceptions.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday he would like other countries to spend more on foreign aid.",
      "\"We're like a one-way street so we want other people to help us and we want other people to join us. We are spending billions and billions and billions of dollars and other countries that are wealthy are spending zero,\" the president told reporters aboard Air Force One.\u00a0 \"Why should we be the only ones?",
      "In a public letter addressed to Rubio on Friday, Reps. Gregory W. Meeks, Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Lois Frankel, Ranking Member of the House National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs (NSRP) Appropriations Subcommittee, wrote \"United States foreign assistance programs promote stability in other countries to help stop crises from expanding directly to our doorstep.\"",
      "\"Foreign assistance is not a handout; it is a strategic investment in our future that is vital for U.S. global leadership and a more resilient world,\" they added. \"It directly serves our national interests and demonstrates our credibility to allies, partners, and vulnerable people who rely on American assistance for survival.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 14:38:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Rep. Mike Turner, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said TikTok \"remains a national security threat\" despite President Trump's effort to maintain access to the popular video-sharing app in recent days.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Mike Turner, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday that TikTok \"remains a national security threat\" despite President Trump's effort to maintain access to the popular video-sharing app in recent days.",
      "\"Let's be clear. Tiktok is absolutely a national security threat,\" Turner said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "TikTok briefly shut down services in the U.S. last week facing a divestment deadline for its China-based parent company, ByteDance. But within hours, TikTok began restoring service to users when Mr. Trump vowed to intervene. And on Monday, the newly sworn-in president signed an executive order directing the Justice Department not to enforce the law, which the Supreme Court recently upheld, for 75 days.",
      "Turner, an Ohio Republican, outlined the reasoning behind the law passed last year by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden that gave ByteDance until Jan. 19 to divest or be cut off from U.S. app stores, saying that TikTok poses a national security risk on two fronts: \"its access to data and its ability to use itself as a propaganda tool.\"",
      "Turner argued that \"the only thing that would protect the United States and protect our citizens is divestiture,\" adding that \"the law that is the law of the land says that ByteDance needs to divest itself.\"",
      "Meanwhile, reports have circulated in recent days that the president is working on a deal to save TikTok through its sale. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One Saturday that \"numerous people\" are talking to him about buying TikTok, noting that he'll make a decision over the next 30 days. The president previously sought to ban the app over national security concerns during his first term.",
      "\"If we can save TikTok I think it would be a good thing,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that he has a \"warm spot\" for the app, citing his support among young people.",
      "Asked Sunday about the possibility of the president reaching a deal, Turner said \"we certainly hope that he gets a deal that recognizes the issue of national security.\"",
      "\"There is no role in which they can remain active, in which China can have access to this data,\" Turner added.",
      "The comments come after Turner was ousted\u00a0by House Speaker Mike Johnson as Intelligence Committee chairman earlier this month. Turner said at the time that the speaker fired him citing \"concerns from Mar-a-Lago.\" But Johnson has denied the claim. And on Sunday, the Ohio Republican said he'd been in touch with the president's team and was informed \"that was not the case.\"",
      "\"The one thing that he has said is that he wanted to take the committee in a different direction,\" Turner said, adding that he's \"a little concerned\" that the new direction could include a focus on \"the elusive Deep State\" rather than national security.",

    "summary": "The arrangement, known as a \"Safe Third Country\" agreement, would empower U.S. immigration officials to deport non-Salvadoran migrants to El Salvador.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration is developing an asylum agreement with El Salvador's government that would allow the U.S. to deport migrants to the small Central American country who are not from there, two sources familiar with the internal deliberations told CBS News.",
      "The arrangement, known as a \"Safe Third Country\" agreement, would empower U.S. immigration officials to deport non-Salvadoran migrants to El Salvador, blocking them from requesting asylum in the U.S. Instead, the migrants would be deported with instructions to seek asylum in El Salvador, which would be designated a \"safe third country.\"",
      "The plan, if finalized, would revive an agreement the first Trump administration brokered with El Salvador's government, though that accord was never implemented and was eventually terminated by former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "A safe third country agreement could be a significant breakthrough for the Trump administration's aggressive immigration plans, allowing it to deport migrants from different countries, including Venezuela, that limit or outright reject U.S. deportations of their citizens.",
      "One of the internal plans under consideration would allow the U.S. to send deportation flights to El Salvador that include suspected members of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang that President Trump has made a focal point of his crackdown on illegal immigration. Hours after his inauguration, Mr. Trump directed officials to start the process of designating Tren de Aragua a terrorist group.",
      "If that plan is implemented, it's unclear how El Salvador would handle the deported gang members. Under President Nayib Bukele, the Salvadoran government has subdued El Salvador's notorious gangs, including MS-13, through a mass incarceration campaign.",
      "Bukele's government is expected to be a key ally of the Trump administration. Bukele enjoys broad popularity in El Salvador, and among U.S. conservatives, mainly due to his anti-gang policies, which international groups say have involved due process violations.",
      "The White House said Mr. Trump and Bukele spoke over the phone on Thursday and discussed \"working together to stop illegal immigration and crack down on transnational gangs like Tren de Aragua.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has vowed to make curbing mass migration a top priority, is also scheduled to visit El Salvador in early February as part of a trip to Latin America set to start later this week.",
      "Representatives for the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Mr Trump has already moved swiftly to start his sweeping immigration crackdown, giving deportation officers broader authorities to arrest and deport unauthorized immigrants, shutting down access to the asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border and enlisting the vast resources of the American military for immigration enforcement through an emergency declaration.",
      "Military planes are now being used to deport migrants crossing the southern border illegally, and additional active-duty troops have been deployed there to erect barriers designed to repel unlawful crossings. Longstanding federal law generally prohibits the military from engaging in civilian law enforcement.",
      "A safe third country agreement would add yet another layer to Mr. Trump's efforts to seal off U.S. borders to migrants and asylum-seekers, through both physical barriers and far-reaching policy changes.",
      "It's unclear how such an arrangement would interact with Mr. Trump's other moves on asylum, including giving border agents the authority to rapidly deport migrants without allowing them to request legal refuge. His administration is also reinstating a rule, known as Remain-in-Mexico, that requires asylum claimants to stay outside of the U.S. while their cases are reviewed.",
      "Currently, the U.S. has one safe third country agreement. Under that arrangement, the U.S. and Canadian governments exchange asylum claimants crossing their shared border. The first Trump administration forged asylum deals with Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Only the one with Guatemala ever took effect, and all three accords were suspended once Biden took office.",

    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance's interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" is his first since he assumed the vice presidency.",
    "story": [
      "Although Vice President JD Vance said two weeks ago that those who committed violence during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot \"shouldn't be pardoned,\" he defended the 1,500 pardons President Trump issued last week, which included the most violent offenders.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Vance was asked by Brennan about the 1,500 pardons issued by Mr. Trump last week to people accused or convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol. She noted that just two weeks ago, in an interview on Fox News, Vance had said, 'If you protested peacefully on Jan. 6 and had Merrick Garland's Department of Justice treat you like a gang member, you should be pardoned. If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned.'\"",
      "She asked Vance, \"Did you counsel the president against these blanket pardons for 1,500 people \u2014 including those who committed violence?\"",
      "Vance, in his first interview since he became vice president, countered that she had omitted the next thing he had said in the Fox interview, that \"there are gray areas.\" He accused the Justice Department led by Merrick Garland of having \"denied constitutional protections in the prosecutions,\" and of applying \"double standards in how sentences were applied to the J6 protesters, versus other groups.\"",
      "Mr. Trump extended clemency to those convicted of violent and serious crimes, including assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy. He also ordered the attorney general to dismiss all pending indictments related to the Capitol riot, essentially eradicating the Biden Justice Department's massive effort to hold accountable those who participated in the assault.",
      "The vice president told Brennan that Mr. Trump had said defendants would be considered on a \"case-by-case basis, and that's exactly what we did. We looked at 1,600 cases.\" He accused the Biden Justice Department of having denied \"a lot of people\" their constitutional rights, and he said he believed Mr. Trump \"made the right decision.\"",
      "Brennan described two of the assaults against police officers on Jan. 6: \"Daniel Rodriguez used an electro-shock weapon against a policeman who was dragged out of the defensive line by plunging it into the officer's neck. He was in prison, sentenced to 12 years, 7 months. He got a pardon. Ronald McAbee hit a cop while wearing reinforced brass knuckle gloves, and he held one down on the ground as other rioters assailed the officer for over 20 seconds, causing a concussion. If you stand with law enforcement, how can you call these people unjustly imprisoned?\"",
      "Vance conceded, \"There's what the people actually did on January the 6th, and we're not saying that everybody did everything perfectly,\" but he blamed the Justice Department for \"unjustly prosecuting well over a thousand Americans in a way that was politically motivated.\"",
      "Asked again whether \"violence like that against a police officer ever justified,\" Vance said it \"is not justified,\" and then repeated his accusation that the Jan. 6 defendants were exposed to an unfair process, \"a double standard that was not applied to many people, including, of course, the Black Lives Matter rioters who killed over two dozen people and never had the weight of a weaponized Department of Justice come against them.\"",
      "In the wake of the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers in May 2020, millions participated in Black Lives Matter protests \u2014\u00a0over 2,000 in U.S. cities and in 60 countries around the world, according to The New York Times. According to the Trump-era Justice Department, 300 people were charged with federal crimes, including approximately 35 individuals who have been charged with assaulting a law enforcement officer and related offenses.",
      "\"We rectified a wrong,\" Vance said, \"and I stand by it.\"",
      "But one of Mr. Trump's staunchest allies, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, appearing on \"Meet the Press\" earlier Sunday, said he didn't \"like the idea of bailing people out of jail or parting people who burn down cities and big up cops, whether you're Republican or Democrat.\"",
      "Graham continued that the pardons were within Mr. Trump's \"legal authority,\" but he added, \"I fear that you will get more violence.\"",
      "\"Pardoning the people who went into the Capitol and beat up a police officer, violently, I think was a mistake, because it seems to suggest that's an okay thing to do,\" he said."

      "If the nominee can't unite your party, how is he going to lead three million people?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, look, I think Pete is a disrupter, and a lot of people don't like that disruption, but, Margaret, that disruption is incredibly necessary.",
      "If you think about all of those bipartisan massive votes, we have to ask ourselves, what did they get us? They got us a country where we fought many wars over the last 40 years, but haven't won a war about as long as I have been alive. They've got us a military with a major recruitment crisis, a procurement price crisis that's totally dysfunctional, where we buy airplanes for billions and billions of dollars, terrible cost overruns.",
      "The delivery dates are always delayed. So we need a big change. Now, admittedly, there are people who don't like that big change, but it is necessary, and it's explicitly what Donald J. Trump ran on and I think part of the reason why the American people elected him their 47th president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the main objective is changing all of that, that it's going to be Pete Hegseth alone?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I would say the main problem is \u2013 or \u2013 excuse me \u2013 the main thing that we want Pete Hegseth to do is to fix the problems at the Department of Defense. And, unfortunately, there are many.",
      "We've gotten into way too many wars that we don't have a plan for winning. We've gotten into way too many misadventures that we shouldn't have got into in the very first place. And our procurement process, Margaret, is incredibly broken. We're in an era\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are policy decisions.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, of course, they're policy decisions, but they're also logistical and implementation decisions.",
      "If you look at where we are with the rise of artificial intelligence, with the rise of drone technology and drone warfare, we have to really, top to bottom, change the way that we fund the procurement of weapons, the way that we arm our troops. This is a major period of disruption, and we think Pete Hegseth is the guy to lead the job.",
      "Now, there's another element to this, Margaret, too, which is we believe that military morale, at least until the election of President Trump, was historically low. You had the Army missing recruitment goals by tens of thousands of soldiers, and, already, recruitment is starting to pick up because Pete Hegseth is fundamentally a war fighter's leader at the Department of Defense.",
      "He is a guy who sees, not through the perspective of the generals or the bureaucrats. He looks at things through the perspective of the men and women that we send off to fight in our wars.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Both \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"The National Review,\" conservative publications, as you know, have been critical of Tulsi Gabbard.",
      "\"The Review\" called her an atrocious nominee who deserves to be defeated. They compared her defense of Edward Snowden, the fugitive, to \u2013 who stole U.S. secrets, to an attorney general who thinks the mob gets a bad rap.",
      "Her refusal to accept U.S. intelligence findings that Assad gassed his own people, they said was like a nominee for OMB director not being able to count.",
      "Does any of this give you pause putting her in charge of the U.S. intelligence community, yes or no?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: No, Margaret, look, these are publications that attacked Donald J. Trump obsessively, but those publications don't determine who the president is. The American people do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And ultimately supported him.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: And Donald J. Trump is the person who determines who his cabinet is, not these publications that I think, frankly, have lost relevance.",

      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Here's Tulsi Gabbard's \u2013 well, the Senate will provide advice and consent, as is its constitutional obligation, but I feel confident that Tulsi Gabbard will ultimately get through.",
      "Two things that are important to know about Tulsi. First of all, she is a career military servant who's had a classification at the highest levels for nearly two decades. She has impeccable character, impeccable record of service, and she also is a person who I think is going to bring some trust back to the intelligence services.",
      "The bureaucrats at our intelligence services have gotten completely out of control. They've been part of the weaponization of our political system, the weaponization of our justice system. We need to have good intelligence services who keep us safe, but part of that is restoring trust in those services, and we think Tulsi is the right person to do it.",
      "That's why the president\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She doesn't trust those intelligence services.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: She recognizes the bureaucrats have gotten out of control, and we need somebody there who's going to rein them in and return those services to their core mission of identifying information that's going to keep us safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You campaigned on lowering prices for consumers. We've seen all of these executive orders. Which one lowers prices?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: We have done a lot.",
      "And there have been a number of executive orders that have caused, already jobs to start coming back into our country, which is a core part of lowering prices. More capital investment, more job creation in our economy is one of the things that's going to drive down prices for all consumers, but also raise wages, so that people can afford to buy the things that they need.",
      "If you look at our slate of executive orders\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, grocery prices aren't going to come down?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: No, Margaret, prices are going to come down, but it's going to take a little bit of time, right?",
      "The president has been president for all of five days. I think that, in those five days, he's accomplished more than Joe Biden did in four years. It's been an incredible breakneck pace of activity. We're going to work with Congress. We're, of course, going to have more executive orders, and we're going to try \u2013 the way that you \u2013 you lower prices is that you encourage more capital investment into our country.",
      "And you asked specifically, what executive order is going to help lower prices. All of the stuff that we've done on energy, to explore more energy reserves, to develop more energy resources in the United States of America. One of the main drivers of increased prices under the Biden administration is that we had a massive increase in energy prices.",
      "Donald Trump has already taken multiple executive actions that are going to lower energy prices, and I do believe that means consumers are going to see lower prices at the pump and at the grocery store, but it's going to take a little bit of time. Rome wasn't built in a day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: And while we've done a whole lot, we can't undo all of the damage of Joe Biden's presidency in four days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there were a lot of things that contributed to higher energy prices. And there was record oil and gas production.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Yes, Joe Biden did many\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the price of eggs\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 many terrible things to\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 the things that people see\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 lead to an increase in prices. I agree, Margaret.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but all the things you experience at the grocery store are what people touch and feel. That's what \u2013 you were talking about bacon on the campaign trail.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Of course. Of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those things, when do consumers actually get to touch and feel a difference in their lives?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, but, Margaret, how does bacon get to the grocery store? It comes on trucks that are fueled by diesel fuel. If the diesel is way too expensive, the bacon is going to become more expensive. How do we grow the bacon? Our farmers need energy to produce it.",
      "So, if we lower energy prices, we are going to see lower prices for consumers, and that is what we're trying to fight for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the flurry of executive orders, most of them weren't about the economy. Many of them\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Many of them were, though, Margaret. We had \u2013 I think we've had \u2013 we've taken over\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You had a promise of tariffs by February 1.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: We've taken over 200 executive actions, some executive orders, other executive actions. Again, this is in less than a week, and a lot of them were focused on the economy, bringing investment into our country and lowering energy prices.",
      "We've also focused on safety, restoring public safety, ending weaponization of the Department of Justice. We've done a lot. And I think the president is to be commended for actually coming in and doing something with this incredible mandate the American people gave him. He's not sitting in the Oval Office doing nothing. He's doing the American people's business. And I think they're going to see a lot of good effects from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a lot of these announcements have yet to take effect.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president did say he wants to do something with an executive order in relation to federal emergency response. He said he may reform or eliminate FEMA.",
      "Instead of sending emergency responders, he may start to send a percentage of money to states to take care of themselves. But you know FEMA has specialized expertise that some of these states just don't have\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Oh, Margaret, I\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 in their arsenal.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I wish that they\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And how will states who are \u2013 who are lower-income states, the Mississippis, the Kentuckys, the Alabamas, be able to do this for themselves without federal help?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, the president, to be clear, is not saying we're going to leave anybody behind.",
      "He's saying that, in the way that we administer these resources, some of which is coming from the federal level, some of which is coming from the state level, we've got to get the bureaucrats out of the way and get the aid to the people who need it most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are the first responders.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Let's be honest, Margaret. You talk about the expertise from FEMA. FEMA in North Carolina, in California, in Florida with some of the hurricanes has often been a disaster. And it's not because we don't have good people at FEMA.",
      "It's because bureaucratic red tape and garbage prevents the rapid deployment of resources to the people who need it the most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the states are now going to have to do this themselves?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: The president is trying to encourage us to reform the way that we deliver emergency response in a way that gets resources to people who need it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, don't take him literally, is what you're saying?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: No, we should take the president at his word that FEMA needs desperate reform, because it does.",
      "Margaret, when I went to North Carolina as V.P.-elect, but before we were sworn in, people would talk about how FEMA would get resources, food, medicine, water to a warehouse, but then would have no plan to get it from the warehouse to the people in the mountains who were literally starving and thirsting to death.",
      "We can do so much better. And, under Donald Trump's leadership, we will.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they work with the state and local officials. So, now\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: They often don't work well enough. And, again, that's not because of the\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 it's going to be on the state and local officials?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: They \u2013 no, the FEMA management officials don't work well enough with state and local officials to get resources to the people who need it.",
      "We should expect \u2013 and this is, I think, one of the fundamental premises of President Trump's leadership. The American people should expect more of their government. When there's a terrible disaster, they should expect food, medicine and water to get to the people who need it.",
      "When there's a terrible fire in California, the fire hydrants ought to actually turn on. I am sick of the American people having such low expectations for their government. They should demand more of us, because it's the greatest country in the world, and that's what Donald Trump's leadership promises to bring back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So still count on the federal government, but watch that space.",
      "Let me ask you about another area that you campaigned on quite a lot, and there was a flurry of activity on. And that has to do with immigration.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops this week condemned some of the executive orders signed by President Trump, specifically those allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enter churches and to enter schools.",
      "Do you personally support the idea of conducting a raid or enforcement action in a church service, at a school?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, let me \u2013 let me address this.",
      "Of course, if you have a person who is convicted of a violent crime, whether they're an illegal immigrant or a non-illegal immigrant, you have to go and get that person to protect the public safety. That's not unique to immigration.",
      "But let me just address the \u2013 this particular issue, Margaret, because, as a practicing Catholic, I was actually heartbroken by that statement. And I think that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops needs to actually look in the mirror a little bit and recognize that when they receive over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants, are they worried about humanitarian concerns, or are they actually worried about their bottom line?",
      "We're going to enforce immigration law. We're going to protect the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Donald Trump promised to do that. And I believe the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, if they're worried about the humanitarian costs of immigration enforcement, let them talk about the children who have been sex-trafficked because of the wide-open border of Joe Biden.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you \u2013 you personally support them going into schools and churches?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Let them talk about people like Laken Riley, who were brutally murdered.",
      "I support us doing law enforcement against violent criminals, whether they're illegal immigrants or anybody else, in a way that keeps us safe. Let me ask this question, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Let's separate the immigration issue. If you had a violent murderer in a school, of course I want law enforcement\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 to go and get that person out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: So, then what's the point of the question?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You changed the regulation this week. That's the point of the question.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Exactly, to\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Giving the authority to go into churches\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Yes, exactly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 and go into schools.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: We empowered law enforcement to enforce the law everywhere to protect Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that also has a knock-on effect, a chilling effect, arguably, to people to not send their kids to school.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I \u2013 I desperately hope it has a chilling effect\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the churches\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 on illegal immigrants coming into our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think the U.S. Conference of Catholics Bishops is \u2013 are actively hiding criminals from law enforcement?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I think the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has, frankly, not been a good partner in commonsense immigration enforcement that the American people voted for.",
      "And I hope, again, as a devout Catholic, that they'll do better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are five legal challenges already to one of the other immigration actions, the order on birthright citizenship.",
      "A federal judge, appointed by Ronald Reagan, who I think you'd agree has some conservative credentials\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 paused the order to end birthright citizenship, calling it blatantly unconstitutional.",
      "How do you reconcile this challenge to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: So, I obviously disagree with that judge.",
      "And these things, some of them will be litigated. That's the nature of our constitutional system. But here's the basic idea of President Trump's view on this. If you are a lawful permanent resident or a legal immigrant who plans to stay, your children, of course, should become American citizens.",
      "But let's say you're the child of an ambassador. You don't become\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not part of it.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, that's an important principle.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's already a carve-out having to do with kids of diplomats.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: But we're saying that that carve-out should apply to anybody who doesn't plan to stay here.",
      "If you come here on vacation and you have a baby in an American hospital, that baby doesn't become an American citizen. If you're an illegal alien and you come here temporarily, hopefully, your child does not become an illegal \u2013 American citizen by virtue of just having been born on American soil.",
      "It's a very basic principle in American immigration law that, if you want to become an American citizen, and you've done it the right way, and the American people in their collective wisdom have welcomed you into our national community, then you become a citizen.",
      "But temporary residents, people who come in here, whether legally or illegally, and don't plan to stay\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 their children shouldn't become American citizens. I don't know any country that does that, or why we would be different.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but this is a country founded by immigrants.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, this is a country founded by\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a unique country.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: This is a very unique country, and it was founded by some immigrants and some settlers.",
      "But just because we were founded by immigrants doesn't mean that, 240 years later, that we have to have the dumbest immigration policy in the world. No country says that temporary visitors, their children will be given complete access to the benefits and blessings of American citizenship.",
      "America should actually look out for the interests of our citizens first, and that means, again, if you're here permanently and lawfully, your kid becomes an American citizen. If you're not here permanently, if you're not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 and don't plan to be, why would we make those people's children American citizens permanently?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about refugee admissions, which were just suspended by the president.",
      "That has nothing to do with the U.S. border. Refugee screening takes 18 to 24 months to go through. They are heavily vetted. Left literally at the airport this week were thousands of Afghans who \u2013 some of whom had worked with the United States government and were promised to come here.",
      "When you talked to us in August, you said: \"I don't think we should abandon anybody who's been properly vetted and helped us.\"",
      "Do you stand by that?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, Margaret, I don't agree that all these immigrants, or all these refugees have been properly vetted. In fact, we know that there are cases of people who allegedly were properly vetted and then were literally planning terrorist attacks in our country.",
      "That happened during the campaign, if you may remember. So, clearly, not all of these foreign nationals have been properly vetted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but there are 30,000 people in the pipeline, Afghan refugees. Do you stand by it?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: But my primary concern as the vice president, Margaret, is to look after the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: And now that we know that we have vetting problems with a lot of these refugee programs, we absolutely cannot unleash thousands of unvetted people into our country. It's not good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These people are vetted. These people are vetted.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Just like the guy who planned a terrorist attack in Oklahoma a few months ago? He was allegedly properly vetted, and many people in the media and the Democratic Party said that he was properly vetted. Clearly, he wasn't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I don't want my children to share a neighborhood with people who are not properly vetted. And because I don't want it for my kids, I'm not going to force any other American citizens' kids to do that either.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No. And that was a very particular case. It wasn't clear if he was radicalized when he got here or while he was living here, but\u2026",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two weeks ago, you were on FOX News, and you said: \"If you protested peacefully on January 6 and had Merrick Garland's Department of Justice treat you like a gang member, you should be pardoned. If you committed violence on that day, obviously, you shouldn't be pardoned.\"",
      "Did you counsel the president against these blanket pardons for 1,500 people\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, Margaret, I notice that you\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 including those who committed violence?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Margaret, I notice that you cut off the thing that I said immediately after that.",
      "The full quote is that, of course, there are gray areas. And here's the nature of the gray area. Merrick Garland's Department of Justice denied constitutional protections in the prosecutions. There were double standards in how sentences were applied to the J6 protesters versus other groups. What the president said consistently on the campaign\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Case-by-case basis.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 is that he was going to look at a case-by- case basis\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is blanket.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: And that's exactly what we did. We looked at 1,600 cases.",
      "And the thing that came out of it, Margaret, is that there was a massive denial of due process of liberty, and a lot of people were denied their constitutional rights. The president believes that. I believe that, and I think he made the right decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Daniel Rodriguez used an electroshock weapon against a policeman who was dragged out of the defensive line by plunging it into the officer's neck. He was imprisoned, sentenced to 12 years, seven months. He got a pardon.",
      "Ronald McAbee hit a cop while wearing reinforced brass-knuckle gloves, and he held one down on the ground as other rioters assailed the officer for over 20 seconds, causing a concussion.",
      "If you stand with law enforcement, how can you call these people unjustly imprisoned?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Margaret, you're separating \u2013 there's an important issue here.",
      "There's what the people actually did on January the 6th, and we're not saying that everybody did everything perfectly. And then what did Merrick Garland's Department of Justice do in unjustly prosecuting well over 1,000 Americans in a way that was politically motivated?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is violence like that against a police officer ever justified?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Violence against a police officer is not justified.",
      "But that doesn't mean that you should have Merrick Garland's weaponized Department of Justice expose you to incredibly unfair process, to denial of constitutional rights, and, frankly, to a double standard that was not applied to many people, including, of course, the Black Lives Matter rioters who killed over two dozen people and never had the weight of a weaponized Department of Justice come against them.",
      "The pardon power is not just for people who are angels or people who are perfect. And, of course, we love our law enforcement and want people to be peaceful with everybody, but especially with our good cops. That's a separate issue from what Merrick Garland's Department of Justice did. We rectified a wrong, and I stand by it.",

      "They didn't have as good of seating as my mom and a lot of other people who were there to support us. But, look, we believe fundamentally that big tech does have too much power, and there are two ways they can go about this. They can either respect America's \u2013 Americans' constitutional rights, they can stop engaging in censorship, and, if they don't, you can be absolutely sure that Donald Trump's leadership is not going to look too kindly on them.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER:: Well, this is very common that there's turnover when a new president comes in to do a review of what's happening within these agencies and in the I.G.s.",
      "I think there'll be a review as they put these individuals back, and some of the individuals will be replaced, obviously. But, you know, clearly they need to bring in their own team now. They need to look at what the performance is for these individuals. And it's very common as new administrations come in that specifically these positions be replaced.",

      "Inauguration Day, January 20th, the CEO of TikTok, whose company seemed a national security threat was U.S. law, was seated next to Tulsi Gabbard, the pick to run the intelligence community. Despite this national security law. You can see the picture of them right there.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-OH): Well, let's be clear, TikTok is absolutely a national security threat. The law passed by Congress, that came out of the House China Select Committee that was chaired by Michael Gallagher, that drafted this law, found that TikTok was a national security risk because of two things, its access to data and its ability to use itself as a propaganda tool by China itself, and the laws in China that allowed China to compel TikTok to manipulate itself, both its data and its access to China and its use of propaganda.",
      "The Supreme Court upheld this. It remains a national security threat. And because of that, the United States Congress, the law - that is the law of the land says that ByteDance need to divest itself.",

And that's sort of an admission by China as to what they're doing with TikTok. They won't let Twitter or X in, almost an admission as to what they're doing.",
      "Also, you know, ByteDance have said, well, we don't sell it. Another admission that it's really not a business. This is a propaganda tool. It is an access to data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Donald Trump's not convinced of that, because he issued an executive order saying he'll figure out a deal.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, he has said - and we certainly hope that - that he gets a deal that recognizes the issue of national security, because there is no role -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there was over 200 days to come to that deal and -",

      "Let me give you just two examples. And, by the way, I commend to people the - the Supreme Court decision because it lays out in incredible detail the national security threat. If there aren't - fi the data - if the app is on your phone, they have access to the data on your phone. And, you know, President Trump -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Outside of that app?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Outside of that app. And even the - the threat is to access that your phone has to other app and other datas. And that's why governments have prohibited the app being on government phones, U.S., U.K. And India has banned the - the whole app in its - in its country.",
      "And then, of course, there's the propaganda aspect of how this can be manipulated. Romania just set aside its entire presidential election because of concerns that TikTok has manipulated data and propaganda with respect to its presidential election. Grave concerns as to what can be done with this - with TikTok.",

Speaker Johnson ousted you from that position as chair recently. What can you share about - with us about the conversation you had and the explanation? Because you've run it in a bipartisan way.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Yes. And I think, you know, I think certainly bipartisanship is incredibly important. And after I had the conversation with the speaker, you and I - you and I spoke.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: The speaker related, you know, certainly as we, discussed, that, you know, an element included concerns from Mar-a-Lago. He's sense walked that back. President Trump's staff has been in touch with me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he flatly denied it.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: President Trump's staff has been in touch with me and said that that was not the case. The one thing that he has said is that he wanted to take the committee in a different direction.",
      "I'm a little concerned because his different direction indicates, you know, pursuing the elusive deep state. And, you know, my concern is, the focus should be on the committee of national security, which has what my focus has been. And, you know, state actors, non-state actors, those individuals who want to do our country harm. There certainly are - are bad actors and people that we need to pursue. And we certainly have done so. We find that there are laws that - that need to be changed to pursue people, to criminalize bad actions. And we certainly have done that.",
      "But there are people every day who get up in the intelligence community, who work hard to make certain that China, Russia, North Korea and Iran are prevented from doing Americans harm. And we need to focus on how we can work together to make certain we protect our country.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I - you know, I - I am - the speaker and I have, you know, a good relationship. The speaker has, at this point, appointed me to lead the - the NATO Parliamentary Assembly on behalf of the House. I remain on the Armed Services Committee. I'm going to remain in - with a strong role in national security. And I'm going to continue to focus on national security and on protecting the country.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you - so, you are concerned that the oversight in the congressional branch of the intelligence community will not happen and will instead by focused in a politicized way? Is that what I hear you saying?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I - I know that my focus was national security. And that's going to continue to be my focus in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very good.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And we'll have to - and we'll have to stay tuned for the rest.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very diplomatic.",
      "Before I let you go, Donald Trump pulled security details from those who face active threats from Iran, including the former CIA director and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Would you ask him to reconsider that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, obviously, I'm very concerned for - for Mike Pompeo.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Mike Turner, thank you for your time.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Thank you for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Colorado Democratic Congressman Jason Crow.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW (D-CO): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is so much news this week. And I want to just pick up, though, on the conversation about January 6th that we had with the vice president.",
      "You've spoken about your experiences that day in very, very vivid terms. You talked about helping other lawmakers shelter. They were fearing for their lives. To help them put on gas masks. There's a picture of you that day even fighting your way out of the chamber since you had combat experience.",
      "What's your response to the vice president's defense of pardoning some of these violent offenders?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, I don't want to hear Donald Trump or J.D. Vance or anyone else in this administration talk about backing the blue, talk about supporting law enforcement when they just released over 1,000 cop beaters, people who brutally beat our law enforcement.",
      "I was there. I saw it firsthand. America saw it firsthand. The video is available for anybody to view. The brutality, the injuries. Over 150 of these officers still have injuries, several of whom lost their lives because of the injuries and trauma incurred on that day. We even had the Fraternal Order of Police come out and issue a statement condemning the pardons.",
      "So, clearly, they're not interested in supporting law enforcement. This was a political decision and a really repugnant one at that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you more about that, but I have to address the elephant in the room too because Monday, hours before leaving office, Joe Biden, then still president, preemptively pardoned his own siblings and their spouses, even though they have not been charged with any crimes. Senator Tim Kaine said, \"the decision makes it harder for Democrats to stan on the high ground and make a critique of the Trump pardons.\"",
      "Do you agree it muddies moral clarity?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: No. What I think happens here is that it shows very clearly the decision of an outgoing president to try to protect his family when you have an incoming president, and those around him who are repeatedly threatening his family, right? That is the story here, that you have Donald Trump, who has doubled down, who has tripled down on threats against Joe Biden, on threats against outgoing administration officials, simply for doing their job in many cases. This is a president, President Trump, who continues to threaten political opponents and is making every move right now in the early days of his administration to try to put in motion things to go after and to use the force of government now to go after his political opponents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you on concerns about retribution. You were plain spoken when Joe Biden pardoned his son, Hunter, who had been convicted of multiple crimes. And, in fact, you said in very clear terms, you thought that it did create problems for Democrats.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, in that instance I did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You see a difference?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You know, I thought that there was a conflict of interest that undermined the integrity of the process. And what I would like to see overall is pardon reform. Very clearly, there needs to be some guardrails put in place and some reform of the pardon process. And I think most Americans would agree with this, to make sure that it's not misused. Because a lot of this is about the perception of America. You know, people need to know that the person sitting in the Oval Office has their best interests in mind at all times. And certainly not with Donald Trump right now can they have that feeling of trust and confidence because in five days into this administration the abuse is already rampant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You - to go back to January 6th, because there are comparisons being made. And I hear your point on pardon reform, which is basically saying presidents need guardrails on this stuff, even if they're Democrats.",
      "But one of the people pardoned by Donald Trump was Stewart Rhodes. He was released from an 18-year prison sentence for conspiring to violently stop Congress' role in the transfer of power.",
      "He was at the Capitol this Wednesday after receiving a pardon. This is a man who was recorded having said in 2021 that he wished he had brought rifles on January 6th and he spoke about hanging Nancy Pelosi.",
      "How do you make sense of that? How do lawmakers make sense of that? And are you concerned about political violence, not specifically necessarily just to him, but - but that this encourages more of that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, well, I'm sitting here last week in my office on Capitol Hill, and I turn on the TV and I see that a couple of floors below me Stewart Rhodes, as you mentioned, one of the heads of an armed militia group in America, is having coffee at the Dunkin' Donuts in the basement of my office building. So, of course, I felt uncomfortable about that, as did most of my colleagues.",
      "And I'm very focused on public safety. I always have been in this job. And you just cannot tell me that releasing militia leaders, insurrectionists, criminals back onto the street because it's what you did to placate your political base is making us any more safe, right? In an era of political violence, of extremist, where threats against members of Congress have quadrupled in the last couple of years, none of this is making us safe. It's actually creating an environment that gives permission to extremists to be more bold, to assert themselves. And we're going to see more of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to switch to what's happening in Colorado. Aurora, Colorado, is in your district. That is a location that president and candidate Trump talked quite a lot about, specifically as an example of immigration run amuck. He talks about the migrant Venezuelan gang, TDA, taking over parts of your city. Something local officials have pushed back on certainly. They were designated as a terrorist group by President Trump. Or he started the process to designate them.",
      "What does that do for the people of Aurora?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Wel, you know, I've pushed back pretty fiercely on Donald Trump's lies because this is my hometown. I live there. And I can tell you that Aurora, Colorado, is a place of great pride and great strength. We are a community of immigrants and refugees. Nearly 20 percent of my constituents were born outside of the United States. These are our business owners. These are our friends. They go to school with my children. They work in our community. They grow businesses in our community.",
      "And the rhetoric of Donald Trump, both on the campaign trail and now, demonizing these folks and telling gross lies and exaggerations is not only - not only impugns the reputation of a strong and vibrant community -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: But it makes those folks less safe. And I will stand up over and over again and push back against those lies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: At the same time it does nothing to advance the cause of comprehensive immigration reform, which we desperately need, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Anybody knows that our system is badly broken. And Donald Trump is not making the moves to fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Jason Crow. Congressman, thank you for your time.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The ceasefire deal in the Middle East appears to be holding, though portions are delayed. Four female Israel soldiers held captive by Hamas were released yesterday along with 200 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. If the deal holds, two American hostages are expected to be released in the coming weeks.",
      "Cartels - returning to the subject of immigration, we're joined now by CBS immigration and politics reporter, Camilo Montoya-Galvez, who is arguably the busiest person in the entire CBS bureau right now.",
      "Camilo, I want to have you bottom line some things.",
      "I understand you have new reporting about some of the plans for migrants being deported.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right. We can report that the Trump administration is currently working on striking an asylum agreement with the country of El Salvador to deport migrants from different countries across Latin America to the small country in Central America. This would be a so-called safe third country asylum agreement that would empower U.S. immigration officials, Margaret, to deport non-Salvadoran migrants to El Salvador with instructions to seek asylum there and not in the U.S.",
      "Importantly, I am told that one plan under consideration would allow the U.S. to deport Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members to El Salvador and have that country house them or detain them. And that would, obviously, be a significant development and break through potentially for the administration because, as you know, Venezuela, right now, currently does not accept U.S. deportations. And so, the administration is moving aggressively and quickly to really oversee a sweeping crackdown on immigration. We have seen the president invoke sweeping constitutional powers to essentially shut down the asylum system at the border. And he is also enlisting the vast resources of the military to really enhance immigration enforcement, not only deploying more troops, but using military planes to deport migrants.",
      "And, yes, there have been so far 1,500 troops deployed to the border. But one internal Customs and Border Protection memo we obtain, Margaret, shows that that number could rise to as many as 10,000 active duty troops.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's so much that you just laid out there. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to go to El Salvador in the coming days.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I imagine it's related to the news you just broke here.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And - and TDA is the gang we were just talking about with the congressman as well.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of how the U.S. military is being used, President Biden left 2,500 U.S. troops at the border.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what's actually different now that there's an extra 1,500?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Well, the work is not changing. What is changing is the number of troops on the ground. They are still assigned to do logistical and operational work and to assist Customs and Border Protection in an operational capacity by, for example, setting up border barriers to repel migrants from entering the country illegally and providing surveillance. They are not to be used to arrest or otherwise process migrants because, as you know, longstanding federal law prohibits the use of the military for civilian law enforcement. And that would include the enforcement of federal immigration laws.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it's the optics essentially that this is -",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: It's a show of force by the Biden -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a show of force?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: By the Trump administration, rather.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And what, in terms of the changes have occurred in terms of use of military? We were hearing about lots of deportations. Now it seems we're getting reports daily of military planes carrying migrants to Guatemala.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: An attempt, apparently, to Columbia as well.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right. So, the administration has already used military planes to deport migrants to the country of Guatemala. And, overnight, it attempted to send two military aircraft to Columbia, sending about 160 deportees from that country to Bogota, Columbia, the capital. But we are told now that the president of Columbia, Gustavo Petro, objected to the use of military planes and blocked those deportations. So, this shows that the administration will still face significant diplomatic challenges as it tries to oversee this aggressive immigration plan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden team was deporting to those countries. They were using civilian aircraft.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: ICE charter flights, correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the military planes were the problem there?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: And, again, it's a show of force by the Trump administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it. All right, bottom lining it for us. Thank you, Camilo.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week was a long and dramatic one, especially for the Washington area. We asked our John Dickerson for his thoughts on just one of the many actions taken by President Trump, the pardons of the 1,500 who had been charged for their roles in the attack on the nation's capital just over four years ago.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): Every morning, Capitol Police officers make good on their pledge to ensure that lawmakers, citizens and the press can move safely through the Capitol. They protect an idea that in that building passionate disputes can find peaceful resolution. Each day their willingness to sacrifice honors this American system, whether violence comes or not.",
      "On January 6, 2021, violence came, and they answered their oath's call. Heroes emerged. The lawmakers they protected praised their bravery.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-TX): Law enforcement went in, Capitol Police and Secret Service, they bravely confronted the terrorists. They bravely removed them. They secured the Capitol.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): One hundred and forty officers were injured, some sustained brain injuries, cracked ribs and even shattered spinal discs. In the following days, one officer, Brian Sicknick, would die from his physical wounds, while four others would take their own lives. A plaque was commissioned to honor them. Plaques are made of metal because they are meant to be as durable as the message, do not forget. A plaque transforms courage and sacrifice of an instant into lessons for the future in case lawmakers lose their way.",
      "The symbols of Inauguration Day do that, too. The Rotunda painting of General Washington giving up power, Lincoln's Bible, acts of heroism in service of democratic ideals, nourishment from the past to the present. All serve one idea, that the voice of the people is honored through a peaceful transfer of power. On Inauguration Day, both parties applauded this.",
      "Law enforcement stood guard over the peaceful transition, but the shared commitment to what they protected proved more fragile than their watch. By sundown, the president, sanctified by those symbols, and now the steward of the ideas they represent, pardoned the 1,500 rioters who had sought to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power on January 6th and overturn the vote of 81 million Americans. Among those whose crimes were erased, those who had pierced, electrocuted and smashed police officers. The lawmakers the officers had protected offered no defense.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): The president's made a decision. We move forward. There are better days ahead of us.",
      "MAN: We are not looking backward, we're looking forward.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): In this case, the past is a nuisance, which may be why that plaque has not been hung. What message does that send to the officers who protected lawmakers on January 6th, and still protect them today?",
      "Perhaps the ideas behind their pledge are not meant to be commemorated in iron after all, but have become as empty as the wall where that promised plaque was supposed to hang.",

      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot to get to with you. I want to ask you about this breaking news that President Trump fired 15 inspectors general. Those are the federal watchdogs who monitor for waste, fraud and abuse. He didn't give 30 days' notice, as legally required. Does this concern you that these agencies can't police themselves?",
      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Well, this is very common that there's turnover when a new president comes in to do a review of what's happening within these agencies and in the IGs. I think there'll be a review as they put these individuals back, and some of the individuals will be replaced, obviously. But you know, clearly they need to bring in their own team now. They need to look at what the performance is for these individuals. And it's very common as new administrations come in that specifically these positions be replaced.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're not concerned these are just going to be loyalists?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, every administration replaces them, so in the- in the end, they tend to be, I mean, what I have seen, and I think what we have seen throughout the- all administrations of these tend to be incredibly professional individuals that really are great watchdogs. And I think we'll see that from this administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What should happen now that the CIA has released this low-confidence assessment that it was most likely a lab leak, a research experiment versus naturally occurring virus that resulted in the COVID pandemic?",
      "REP. TURNER: The Biden administration really has been an impediment to getting to the answer here. Congress passed--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --This is their finding--",
      "REP. TURNER: --Right, but Congress passed, and the Biden administration signed an order declassifying the information concerning the lab leak theory and the issues with respect to COVID origins. And the administration still refused to release it. I think this is a great start, and really it's been unfortunate that the administration has been slow. This is a good turning point, because clearly this was not of natural origins.",

      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation now with Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner. Just to pick up on the topic of- of China, we've been talking about TikTok. The law stated that January 19, and the Supreme Court upheld this, that the owner ByteDance would have to sell TikTok to an American owner. Inauguration day, January 20, the CEO of Tiktok, whose company is deemed a national security threat under US law, was seated next to Tulsi Gabbard, the pick to run the intelligence community. Despite this national security law. You can see the picture of them right there, and Mr. Trump seems to have given them a reprieve. The editorial board of the Wall Street Journal said \"Mr. Trump's Tiktok order shows a Biden-like disdain for limits on his power.\" What do you make of this decision not to implement the law for at least a period of time?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, let's be clear. TikTok is absolutely a national security threat. The law passed by Congress that came out of the House China Select Committee, that was chaired by Mike Gallagher, that drafted this law, found that TikTok was a national security risk because of two things, its access to data and its ability to use itself as a propaganda tool by China itself and the laws in China that allowed China to compel Tiktok to manipulate itself, both its data and its access to China and its use of propaganda. The Supreme Court upheld this, it remains a national security threat, and because of that, the United States Congress, the law that is the law of the land, says that ByteDance needs to divest itself. Now, the only thing that would protect the United States and protect our citizens is divestiture.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Meaning selling--",
      "REP. TURNER: And that means that ByteDance needs to divest itself. Now, Elon Musk has said something very interesting. He said, you know- of course- he's noted that Twitter, his X, does not have access to China, and that's sort of an admission by China as to what they're doing with TikTok. They won't let Twitter or X in, almost an admission as to what they're doing. Also, ByteDance have said, well, we won't sell it, another admission that it's really not a business. This is a propaganda tool, it is access to data--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Donald Trump's not convinced of that, because he issued an executive order saying he'll figure out a deal.",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, he has said- and we certainly hope that he gets a deal that recognizes the issue of national security, because there--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But they had more than 200 days to come to that deal--",
      "REP. TURNER:\u00a0 -- There is no role to--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- And they're not selling--",
      "REP. TURNER: -- There is- there is- that's what they've said. There is no role in which they can remain active, in which China can have access to this data. Let me give you just two examples. And by the way, I commend to people the- the Supreme Court decision, because it lays out in incredible detail the national security threat. If there- are if the data- if the app is on your phone, they have access to the data on your phone and President Trump--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- outside of that app?",
      "REP. TURNER: -- Outside of that app. And even the- the threat is to the access that your phone has to other app and other datas, and that's why governments have prohibited the app being on government phones, US, UK. And India has banned the- the whole app in its- in its country. And then, of course, there's the propaganda aspect of how this can be manipulated. Romania just set aside its entire presidential election because of concerns that Tiktok has manipulated data and propaganda with respect to its presidential election. Grave concerns as to what can be done with this, with- with Tiktok.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to ask you as well about what's happening on Capitol Hill. You've been on this program many times as chair of the House Intelligence Committee. Speaker Johnson ousted you from that position as chair recently. What can you share about- with us about the conversation you had and the explanation, because you run it in a bipartisan way?",
      "REP. TURNER: Yes, and I think, you know, I think certainly, bipartisanship is incredibly important. And after I had the conversation with the Speaker, you and I- you and I spoke. The- the speaker related, you know, certainly, as we discussed that, you know, an element included concerns from Mar-a-Lago. He's since walked that back. President Trump's staff has been in touch with me--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well he flatly denied it--",
      "REP. TURNER: -- President Trump's staff has been in touch with me and said that that was not the case. The one thing that he has said is that he wanted to take the committee in a different direction. I'm a little concerned, because his different direction indicates pursuing the elusive Deep State. And my concern is the focus should be on the committee of national security, which is what my focus has been on state actors, non-state actors, those individuals who want to do our country harm. There certainly are bad actors and people that we need to pursue, and we certainly have done so where we find that there are laws that- that -that need to be changed to pursue people, to criminalize bad actions, and we certainly have done that. But there are people every day who get up in the intelligence community who work hard to make certain that China, Russia, North Korea and Iran are prevented from doing Americans harm, and we need to focus on how we can work together to make certain we protect our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because protecting the safety of Americans is a fundamental responsibility. But just to button one thing up, when you say the White House and Mar a Lago said that's not the case. They didn't ask for you to be replaced.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you saying the speaker lied?",
      "REP. TURNER: I'm not- I'm not- I'm not going to say that. I have- the Speaker and I have, you know- a good relationship to the Speaker, has at this point appointed me to lead the NATO Parliamentary Assembly on behalf of the House. I remain on the Armed Services Committee. I'm going to remain in- with a strong role in national security, and I'm going to continue to focus on national security and on protecting the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The new chair has voted against Ukraine aid. When you say the mission is pursuing the elusive deep state, what does that mean? Weaponizing the committee?",
      "REP. TURNER: I- I- we'll have to see as to what direction they go. I know that that's a concern\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Going after the Intelligence community?",
      "REP. TURNER: I know that that's going to be a concern. We'll have to see what direction they go. I do know that national security is going to continue to be an area of concern. It certainly was my focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you- so you are concerned that the oversight in the congressional branch of the intelligence community will not happen and will instead be focused in a politicized way? Is that what I hear you saying?",
      "REP. TURNER: I know that my focus was national security, and that's going to continue to be my focus in Congress--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Very quickly--",
      "REP. TURNER: --and we'll have to- and we'll have to stay tuned for the rest.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very diplomatic. Before I let you go, Donald Trump pulled security details from those who face active threats from Iran, including former CIA Director and Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo. Would you ask him to reconsider that?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, obviously, I'm very concerned for Mike Pompeo.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Alright. Mike Turner, thank you for your time. We'll be right back."

We even had the Fraternal Order of Police come out and- and issue a statement condemning the- the pardons. So clearly, they're not interested in supporting law enforcement. This was a political decision and- and a really repugnant one at that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you more about that, but I have to address the elephant in the room too, because Monday, hours before leaving office, Joe Biden, then still president, preemptively pardoned his own siblings and their spouses, even though they have not been charged with any crimes. Senator Tim Kaine said the decision makes it harder for Democrats to \"stand on the high ground and make a critique of the Trump pardons.\" Do you agree it muddies moral clarity?",
      "REP. CROW: No. What I think happens here is that it- it shows very clearly the decision of an outgoing president to try to protect his family when you have an in- incoming president, and those around him, who are repeatedly threatening his family, right? That- that is the story here, that you have Donald Trump, who has doubled down, who has tripled down, on threats against Joe Biden, on threats against outgoing administration officials, simply for doing their job in many cases. This is a president, President Trump, who continues to threaten political opponents and is making every move right now in the early days of his- of his administration, to try to put in motion things to go after and to use the force of government now to go after his political opponents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you on concerns about retribution, but you were plain spoken when Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter, who had been convicted of multiple crimes. And in fact, you said in very clear terms you- you thought that it did create problems for Democrats.",
      "REP. CROW: Yeah, in that instance, I did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You see a difference.",
      "REP. CROW: You know, I thought that there was a conflict of interest that undermined the integrity of the process. And what I would like to see overall is pardon reform. Very clearly, there needs to be some guardrails put in place and some reform of the pardon process, and I think most Americans would agree with this, to make sure that it's not misused, because a lot of this is about the perception of America. People need to know that the person sitting in the Oval Office has their best interests in mind at all times, and certainly not with Donald Trump right now, can- can they have that feeling of trust and confidence, because in- five days into this administration, the abuse is already rampant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You- to go back to January 6, because there are comparisons being made. And- and I hear your point on pardon reform, which is basically saying presidents need guardrails on this stuff, even if they're Democrats, but one of the people pardoned by Donald Trump was Stewart Rhodes. He was released from an 18 year prison sentence for conspiring to violently stop Congress's role in the transfer of power. He was at the capitol this Wednesday after receiving a pardon. This is a man who was recorded having said in 2021 that he wished he had brought rifles on January 6, and he spoke about hanging Nancy Pelosi. How do you make sense of that? How do lawmakers make sense of that? And are you concerned about political violence? Not specific, necessarily, just to him, but- but that this encourages more of that?",
      "REP. CROW: Yeah. Well, I'm sitting here last week in my office on Capitol Hill, and I turn on the TV and I see that a couple of floors below me, Stewart Rhodes, as you mentioned, one of the heads of a- an armed militia group in America, is having coffee at the Dunkin' Donuts in the basement of my office building. So of course, I felt uncomfortable about that, as did most of my colleagues, and I'm- I'm very focused on public safety. I always have been in this job. And you just cannot tell me that releasing militia leaders, insurrectionists, criminals, back onto the street because it's what you did to placate your political base, is making us any more safe, right? In an era of political violence, of extremism, where threats against members of Congress have quadrupled in the last couple of years. None of this is making us safe. It's actually creating an environment that gives permission to extremists to be more bold, to assert themselves. And we're going to see more of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to switch to what's happening in Colorado. Aurora, Colorado is in your district. That is a location that President and candidate Trump talked quite a lot about, specifically as an example of immigration run amok. He- he talks about this migrant Venezuelan gang, TdA, taking over parts of your city, something local officials have pushed back on, certainly. They were designated as a terrorist group by President Trump, or he started the process to designate them. What does that do for the people of Aurora?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, you know, I pushed back pretty fiercely on Donald Trump's lies, because this is my hometown. I live there, and I can tell you that Aurora, Colorado is a place of great pride and great strength. We are a community of immigrants and refugees. Nearly 20% of my constituents were born outside of the United States. These are our business owners. These are our friends. They go to school with my children. They work in our community. They grow businesses in our community. And the rhetoric of Donald Trump, both on the campaign trail and now, demonizing these folks and telling gross lies and exaggerations is not only- not only impugns the reputation of a strong and vibrant community, but it makes those folks less safe. And- and I will stand up over and over again and push back against those lies. At the same time, it does nothing to advance the cause of comprehensive immigration reform, which we desperately need--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, well--",
      "REP. CROW: --right? Anybody knows that our system is badly broken and Donald Trump is not making the move to fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Jason Crow, Congressman, thank you for your time. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance said Saturday that \"we believe fundamentally that big tech does have too much power,\" despite the prominent positioning of tech CEOs at President Trump's inauguration last week.",
      "\"They can either respect America's constitutional rights, they can stop engaging in censorship, and if they don't, you can be absolutely sure that Donald Trump's leadership is not going to look too kindly on them,\" Vance said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The comments came in response to the unusual attendance of a slate of tech CEOs at Mr. Trump's inauguration, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Tesla's Elon Musk, Apple's Tim Cook, and Google's Sundar Pichai. The tech titans, some of whom are among the richest men in the world and directed donations from their companies to Mr. Trump's inauguration, were seated in some of the most highly sought after seats in the Capitol Rotunda.",
      "Vance noted that the tech CEOs \"didn't have as good of seating as my mom and a lot of other people who were there to support us.\"",
      "In an August interview on \"Face the Nation\", the vice president outlined his thinking on big tech, saying that companies like Google are too powerful and censor American information, while possessing a \"monopoly over free speech\" that he argued ought to be broken up.",
      "The tech sphere went on to play an outsized role in Trump's 2024 election victory, with Musk spending more than a quarter of a billion dollars to back Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates. Musk became a key ally to the president and in November, Mr. Trump tapped the Tesla CEO to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, a new temporary agency aimed at reducing wasteful federal spending. Meanwhile, other tech CEOs cozied up to the president with visits to Mar-a-Lago ahead of the inauguration.",
      "But Vance said in Saturday's interview that big tech and the tech giants, despite their recent closeness to the president, are \"very much on notice.\"",

    "story": [
      "In his first interview since taking office, Vice President JD Vance on Saturday defended President Trump's flurry of executive orders, his\u00a0pardons\u00a0of hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants, and the new administration's\u00a0aggressive efforts\u00a0to deport undocumented immigrants.",
      "Vance dismissed concerns that the White House was not prioritizing U.S. economic fears, and argued that suspending the nation's refugee admissions program was justified.",
      "Here are some of the highlights of his wide-ranging interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Sunday.",
      "Vance calls new Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \"a disrupter\"",
      "Vance on Friday night was\u00a0forced to cast the tie-breaking vote\u00a0to push through the controversial confirmation of Pete Hegseth as defense secretary. This came after three Republican senators voted against Hegseth's nomination, leading to a brief 50-50 Senate stalemate, the smallest margin of approval for a defense secretary since the position was created.",
      "Hegseth's nomination had been questioned over allegations of alcohol abuse,\u00a0sexual assault\u00a0and financial mismanagement.",
      "\"I think Pete is a disrupter, and a lot of people don't like that disruption,\" said Vance of the tight vote.",
      "\"If you think about all of those bipartisan, massive votes, we have to ask ourselves, what did they get us?\" he went on. \"They got us a country where we fought many wars over the last 40 years, but haven't won a war about as long as I've been alive.\"",
      "Vance said Hegseth's primary task will be \"to fix the problems at the Department of Defense,\" which he said included increasing recruitment numbers and fixing an \"incredibly broken\" weapons procurement process.",
      "\"If you look at where we are with the rise of artificial intelligence, with the rise of drone technology and drone warfare, we have to really, top to bottom, change the way that we fund the procurement of weapons, the way that we arm our troops,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance \"confident\" Tulsi Gabbard will be confirmed",
      "Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Mr. Trump's\u00a0pick for director of national intelligence, has been oft-criticized for her contentious views on U.S. diplomatic issues.",
      "The Army National Guard veteran, who has no experience in the intelligence arena, received backlash for a 2017 trip she took to Syria in which she met with its since-deposed leader\u00a0Bashar al-Assad, despite evidence even at the time that Assad had used chemical weapons against his own people. She also said in 2019 that Assad \"is not the enemy of the United States because Syria does not pose a direct threat to the United States.\"",
      "Vance brushed aside the criticism\u00a0Gabbard's nomination\u00a0has received from some conservative media outlets, saying he is \"confident\" that she \"will ultimately get through.\" He described her as a \"career military servant who's had a classification at the highest levels for nearly two decades,\" and \"a person who I think is going to bring some trust back to the intelligence services.\"",
      "When pressed on how she will instill public trust in agencies \u2014 which Gabbard has expressed distrust of in the past \u2014 Vance responded that Gabbard \"recognizes the bureaucrats have gotten out of control, and we need somebody there who's going to rein them in and return those services to their core mission of identifying information that's going to keep us safe.\"",
      "Vance argues \"capital investment\" will \"help lower prices\"",
      "The Trump-Vance ticket campaigned on curbing inflation and lowering prices. When asked which of the Trump administration's early actions would help Americans financially, Vance cited \"a number of\u00a0 executive orders that have caused, already, jobs to start coming back into our country, which is a core part of lowering prices.\"",
      "\"Capital investment\" will \"help lower prices,\" Vance said.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order\u00a0declaring\u00a0a national energy emergency, this despite the fact that crude oil production in the U.S. reached a record last year under the Biden administration.",
      "\"You asked specifically what executive order is going to help lower prices, all of the stuff that we've done on energy, to explore more energy reserves, to develop more energy resources in the United States of America,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance couldn't say when consumers may begin to see prices tick down.",
      "\"How does bacon get to the grocery store? It comes on trucks that are fueled by diesel fuel,\" Vance said. \"If the diesel is way too expensive, the bacon is going to become more expensive. How do we grow the bacon? Our farmers need energy to produce it. So if we lower energy prices, we are going to see lower prices for consumers, and that is what we're trying to fight for.\"",
      "Vance alleges FEMA \"has often been a disaster\"",
      "While touring disaster zones Friday from Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and the wildfires in Los Angeles, Mr. Trump\u00a0disparaged\u00a0the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He said he\u00a0 planned to sign an executive order that would \"begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA, or maybe getting rid of FEMA.\"",
      "And when asked how low-income states like Mississippi and Alabama would recover from natural disasters without FEMA's help, Vance responded that Mr. Trump \"is not saying we're going to leave anybody behind,\" but instead \"get the bureaucrats out of the way and get the aid to the people who need it most.\"",
      "The vice president did not detail the particulars of what that would look like, but said FEMA \"has often been a disaster\" and criticized the agency for not working \"well enough with state and local officials to get resources to the people who need it.\"",
      "Vance on immigrant arrests near churches, schools: \"I desperately hope it has a chilling effect\"",
      "The Trump administration's first week has been marked by a wave of activity targeting U.S. immigration policy, including\u00a0sending hundreds of troops\u00a0to the southern border, halting\u00a0asylum proceedings\u00a0and\u00a0launching deportation flights\u00a0to Guatemala for what it called \"illegal immigrant criminals.\"",
      "Among the most controversial was an order\u00a0revoking\u00a0a Biden-era policy that barred immigration agents from arresting immigrants near schools and places of worship.",
      "When asked by Brennan if the move would have \"a chilling effect\" on parents who may be hesitant to send their children to school, Vance responded, \"I desperately hope it has a chilling effect\u2026on illegal immigrants coming into our country.\"",
      "The immigration orders\u00a0drew condemnation\u00a0this week in a statement from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Vance said that as a \"practicing Catholic,\" he was \"heartbroken\" by the group's statement, accusing the organization, without evidence, of potentially having ulterior motives.",
      "\"I think that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops needs to actually look in the mirror a little bit and recognize that when they receive over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants, are they worried about humanitarian concerns? Or are they actually worried about their bottom line?\"",
      "Vance on challenge to birthright citizenship: \"The dumbest immigration policy in the world\"",
      "A federal judge this week\u00a0blocked\u00a0Mr. Trump's order attempting to eliminate birthright citizenship, which is enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which says \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",
      "The judge, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, called the president's efforts \"blatantly unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"I obviously disagree with that judge,\" Vance told \"Face the Nation,\" citing the example of children of diplomats, for which there is already a carveout in the 14th Amendment.",
      "\"We're saying that that carve out should apply to anybody who doesn't plan to stay here,\" Vance said. \"If you come here on vacation and you have a baby in an American hospital, that baby doesn't become an American citizen. If you're an illegal alien and you come here temporarily, hopefully, your child does not become an American citizen by virtue of just having been born on American soil.\"",
      "When it was pointed out the U.S. is a nation of immigrants, Vance responded, \"This is a very unique country, and it was founded by some immigrants and some settlers. But just because we were founded by immigrants, doesn't mean that 240 years later that we have to have the dumbest immigration policy in the world. No country says that temporary visitors \u2014 their children will be given complete access to the benefits and blessings of American citizenship.\"",
      "But according to the\u00a0CIA's World Factbook, there are 30 nations with some form of birthright citizenship.",
      "Vance says Trump was right to suspend refugee program",
      "Hours after taking office on Jan. 20, Mr. Trump suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, leaving thousands of Afghans stranded at airports, some of whom had worked with the U.S. prior to its withdrawal from Afghanistan.",
      "Vance\u00a0previously\u00a0told \"Face the Nation\" in August that \"I don't think we should abandon anybody who's been properly vetted and actually helped us.\"",
      "The refugee program is an 18- to 24-month process that involves interviews, medical screenings and security vetting. Refugee applicants must prove they are fleeing persecution before being allowed into the U.S.",
      "Vance on Saturday seemed to reverse course, questioning whether the program had \"properly vetted\" the refugees.",
      "\"Now that we know that we have vetting problems with a lot of these refugee programs, we absolutely cannot unleash thousands of unvetted people into our country,\" Vance declared, without detailing how the refugee program's vetting process may be faulty.",
      "He provided the example of an Afghan national who came to the U.S. immediately after the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. The man\u00a0was arrested\u00a0in Oklahoma in October on federal charges of planning an election day terrorist attack in support of the Islamic State.",
      "\"He was allegedly properly vetted, and many people in the media and the Democratic Party said that he was properly vetted,\" Vance claimed of the suspect. \"Clearly, he wasn't.\"",
      "However, as CBS News has reported, that suspect did not arrive via the refugee process. Instead, he was paroled into the country, like most Afghan evacuees, and allowed to live in the country temporarily under that immigration authority while he applied for a Special Immigrant Visa.",
      "Vance on Trump's pardons of violent Jan. 6 offenders: \"We're not saying that everybody did everything perfectly\"",
      "As he had vowed during the campaign, Mr. Trump pardoned about 1,500 people who were charged in connection with the\u00a0Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "When asked why Jan. 6 defendants who had committed acts of violence deserved to be pardoned, Vance put blame on the Justice Department, saying \"it denied constitutional protections in the prosecutions,\" and he alleged, without evidence, that there were \"double standards in how sentences were applied to the J6 protesters versus other groups.\"",
      "On the blanket nature of the pardons, Vance said, \"What the president said consistently on the campaign\u2026is that he was going to look at a case by case basis\u2026and that's exactly what we did.\"",
      "\"We looked at 1,600 cases,\" Vance continued. \"And the thing that came out of it, Margaret, is that there was a massive denial of due process of liberty, and a lot of people were denied their constitutional rights. The president believes that. I believe that, and I think he made the right decision.\"",
      "A group of federal judges in Washington, D.C.,\u00a0blasted Trump's pardons\u00a0in a series of separate orders this week. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell said the charges had been \"fully supported\" by videos, photos, admissions by defendants themselves during plea hearings, and the testimony of law enforcement and congressional staff who were at the Capitol.",
      "Vance said that while \"violence against a police officer is not justified,\" former Attorney General Merrick Garland had \"weaponized\" the Justice Department.",
      "Vance on Silicon Valley's influence: \"We believe fundamentally that big tech does have too much power\"",
      "The in-person audience at President Trump's inauguration was a\u00a0who's who of tech giants, including Elon Musk, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.",
      "But when Vance spoke to \"Face the Nation\" in August, he said that companies like Google are \"too big, too powerful.\"",
      "\"We ought to take the Teddy Roosevelt approach to some of them. Break 'em up. Don't let them control what people are allowed to say,\" Vance said at the time.",
      "Amazon, Meta and OpenAI\u00a0were among several companies\u00a0that made $1 million donations to Mr. Trump's inaugural fund.",
      "When asked whether he still planned to take a hard stance against Big Tech, Vance said the tech leaders at the inauguration \"didn't have as good of seating as my mom.\"",
      "\"We believe fundamentally that big tech does have too much power,\" Vance said. \"They're very much on notice.\"",
      "Aimee Picchi, \n                                                  \n                                  Kathryn Watson, \n                                                  \n                                  Melissa Quinn and \n                                                  \n                                  Camilo Montoya-Galvez\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "The U.S. government has long interpreted the Constitution to mean that those born on American soil are citizens at birth, regardless of their parents' immigration status. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution says \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Vice President, if you're ready, we'll dive right in.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: Ready to go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, both defense secretaries from President Trump's last term were confirmed overwhelmingly, 90 percent of the vote. Pete Hegseth, it was a tie, bipartisan opposition, smallest margin since the job was created. You had to break that tie. If the nominee can't unite your party, how is he going to lead three million people?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, look, I think Pete is a disrupter, and a lot of people don't like that disruption, but Margaret that disruption is incredibly necessary. If you think about all of those bipartisan, massive votes, we have to ask ourselves, what did they get us? They got us a country where we fought many wars over the last 40 years, but haven't won a war about as long as I've been alive. They've got us a military with a major recruitment crisis, a procurement price crisis that's totally dysfunctional, where we buy airplanes for billions and billions of dollars, terrible cost overruns, the delivery dates are always delayed. So we need a big change. Now, admittedly, there are people who don't like that big change, but it is necessary, and it's explicitly what Donald J. Trump ran on and I think part of the reason why the American people elected him their 47th president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the main objective is changing all of that? That it's going to be Pete Hegseth alone?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: I'd say the main problem is- or excuse me, the main thing that we want Pete Hegseth to do is to fix the problems at the Department of Defense and unfortunately, there are many. We've gotten into way too many wars that we don't have a plan for winning. We've gotten into way too many misadventures that we shouldn't have got into in the very first place, and our procurement process, Margaret, is incredibly broken. We're in an era--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are policy decisions.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: --Well, of course, they're policy decisions, but they're also logistical and implementation decisions. If you look at where we are with the rise of artificial intelligence, with the rise of drone technology and drone warfare, we have to really, top to bottom, change the way that we fund the procurement of weapons, the way that we arm our troops. This is a major period of disruption, and we think Pete Hegseth is the guy to lead the job. Now there's another element to this Margaret too, which is we believe that military morale, at least until the election of President Trump, was historically low. You had the Army missing recruitment goals by tens of thousands of soldiers, and already recruitment is starting to pick up because Pete Hegseth is fundamentally a war fighter's leader at the Department of Defense. He is a guy who sees, not through the perspective of the generals or the bureaucrats, he looks at things through the perspective of the men and women that we send off to fight in our wars.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about other nominees. Both the Wall Street Journal and the National Review, conservative publications, as you know, have been critical of Tulsi Gabbard. The Review called her \"an atrocious nominee who deserves to be defeated.\" They compared her defense of Edward Snowden, the fugitive to- who stole U.S. secrets, to an attorney general who thinks the mob gets a bad rap. Her refusal to accept U.S. intelligence findings that Assad gassed his own people, they said was \"like a nominee for OMB Director not being able to count.\" Does any of this give you pause putting her in charge of the U.S. intelligence community? Yes or no?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: No, Margaret look, these are publications that attacked Donald J. Trump obsessively, but those publications don't determine who the president is, the American people do--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And ultimately supported him.",

      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, the Senate will provide advice and consent, as is its constitutional obligation, but I feel confident that Tulsi Gabbard will ultimately get through. Two things that are important to know about Tulsi. First of all, she is a career military servant who's had a classification at the highest levels for nearly two decades. She has impeccable character, impeccable record of service, and she also is a person who I think is going to bring some trust back to the intelligence services. The bureaucrats at our intelligence services have gotten completely out of control. They've been part of the weaponization of our political system, the weaponization of our justice system. We need to have good intelligence services who keep us safe, but part of that is restoring trust in those services, and we think Tulsi is the right person to do it. That's why the president--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She doesn't trust those intelligence services.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: She recognizes the bureaucrats have gotten out of control, and we need somebody there who's going to rein them in and return those services to their core mission of identifying information that's going to keep us safe.",

      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Yes, it has.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You campaigned on lowering prices for consumers. We've seen all of these executive orders. Which one lowers prices?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, first of all, we have done a lot, and there have been a number of executive orders that have caused, already, jobs to start coming back into our country, which is a core part of lowering prices. More capital investment, more job creation in our economy, is one of the things that's going to drive down prices for all consumers, but also raise wages so that people can afford to buy the things that they need. If you look at our slate of executive orders--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, grocery prices aren't going to come down?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: No, Margaret, prices are going to come down, but it's going to take a little bit of time, right? The president has been president for all of five days. I think that in those five days, he's accomplished more than Joe Biden did in four years. It's been an incredible breakneck pace of activity. We're going to work with Congress. We're of course going to have more executive orders, and we're going to try- the way that you- you lower prices is that you encourage more capital investment into our country, and you asked specifically what executive order is going to help lower prices. All of the stuff that we've done on energy, to explore more energy reserves, to develop more energy resources in the United States of America. One of the main drivers of increased prices under the Biden Administration is that we had a massive increase in energy prices. Donald Trump has already taken multiple executive actions that are going to lower energy prices, and I do believe that means consumers are going to see lower prices at the pump and at the grocery store, but it's going to take a little bit of time. Rome wasn't built in a day--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE --and while we've done a whole lot, we can't undo all of the damage of Joe Biden's presidency in four days--",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those things- when do consumers actually get to touch and feel a difference in their lives?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, but Margaret, how does bacon get to the grocery store? It comes on trucks that are fueled by diesel fuel. If the diesel is way too expensive, the bacon is going to become more expensive. How do we grow the bacon? Our farmers need energy to produce it. So if we lower energy prices, we are going to see lower prices for consumers, and that is what we're trying to fight for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the flurry of executive orders, most of them weren't about the economy. Many of them--",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Many of them were, though, Margaret. We had- I think we've taken over--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You had a promise of tariffs by February 1.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: --We've taken over 200 executive actions, some executive orders, other executive actions. Again, this is in less than a week, and a lot of them were focused on the economy, bringing investment into our country and lowering energy prices. We've also focused on safety, restoring public safety, ending weaponization of the Department of Justice. We've done a lot, and I think the president is to be commended for actually coming in and doing something with this incredible mandate the American people gave him. He's not sitting in the Oval Office doing nothing. He's doing the American people's business, and I think they're going to see a lot of good effects from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a lot of these announcements have yet to take effect.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president did say he wants to do something with an executive order in relation to federal emergency response. He said he may reform or eliminate FEMA instead of sending emergency responders, he may start to send a percentage of money to states to take care of themselves. But you know, FEMA has specialized expertise that some of these states just don't have--",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Oh, Margaret, I--",

      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, the president, to be clear, is not saying we're going to leave anybody behind. He's saying that in- the way that we administer these resources, some of which is coming from the federal level, some of which is coming from the state level, we've got to get the bureaucrats out of the way and get the aid to the people who need it most--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But these are the first responders--",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: --Let's be honest, Margaret. You talk about the expertise from FEMA. FEMA in North Carolina, in California, in Florida with some of the hurricanes, has often been a disaster. And it's not because we don't have good people at FEMA. It's because bureaucratic red tape and garbage prevents the rapid deployment of resources to people who need it the most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the states are now going to have to do this themselves?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --So don't take him literally, is what you're saying?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: No- we should take the president at his word that FEMA needs desperate reform, because it does. Margaret, when I went to North Carolina as VP-elect, but before we were sworn in, people would talk about how FEMA would get resources, food, medicine, water, to a warehouse, but then would have no plan to get it from the warehouse to the people in the mountains who were literally starving and thirsting to death. We can do so much better, and under Donald Trump's leadership, we will.",

We should expect- and this is, I think, one of the fundamental premises of President Trump's leadership. The American people should expect more of their government. When there's a terrible disaster, they should expect food, medicine and water to get to the people who need it. When there's a terrible fire in California, the fire hydrants ought to actually turn on. I am sick of the American people having such low expectations for their government. They should demand more of us, because it's the greatest country in the world, and that's what Donald Trump's leadership promises to bring back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So still count on the federal government, but watch that space. Let me ask you about another area that you campaigned on quite a lot, and there was a flurry of activity on. And that has to do with immigration.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops this week condemned some of the executive orders signed by President Trump, specifically those allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enter churches and to enter schools. Do you personally support the idea of conducting a raid or enforcement action in a church service, at a school?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, let me, let me address this. Of course, if you have a person who is convicted of a violent crime, whether they're an illegal immigrant or a non-illegal immigrant, you have to go and get that person to protect the public safety. That's not unique to immigration. But let me just address the- this particular issue, Margaret. Because as a practicing Catholic, I was actually heartbroken by that statement. And I think that the US Conference of Catholic Bishops needs to actually look in the mirror a little bit and recognize that when they receive over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants, are they worried about humanitarian concerns? Or are they actually worried about their bottom line? We're going to enforce immigration law. We're going to protect the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Donald Trump promised to do that. And I believe the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, if they're worried about the humanitarian costs of immigration enforcement, let them talk about the children who have been sex trafficked because of the wide open border of Joe Biden--",

      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: --Sure--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --paused the order to end birthright citizenship, calling it \"blatantly unconstitutional.\" How do you reconcile this challenge to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: So, I obviously disagree with that judge and these things- some of them will be litigated. That's the nature of our constitutional system. But here's the basic idea of President Trump's view on this. If you are a lawful permanent resident or a legal immigrant who plans to stay, your children, of course, should become American citizens. But let's say you're the child of an ambassador, you don't become--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --but that's not part of it.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, that's an important principle--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --there's already a carveout having to do with kids of diplomats.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: But we're saying that that carve out should apply to anybody who doesn't plan to stay here. If you come here on vacation and you have a baby in an American hospital, that baby doesn't become an American citizen. If you're an illegal alien and you come here temporarily, hopefully, your child does not become an ille- American citizen by virtue of just having been born on American soil. It's a very basic principle in American immigration law, that if you want to become an American citizen, and you've done it the right way, and the American people in their collective wisdom have welcomed you into our national community, then you become a citizen. But temporary residents, people who come in here, whether legally or illegally, and don't plan to stay, their children shouldn't become American citizens. I don't know any country that does that, or why we would be different.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is a country founded by immigrants.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, this is a country founded by--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --This is a unique country.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: This is a very unique country, and it was founded by some immigrants and some settlers. But just because we were founded by immigrants, doesn't mean that 240 years later that we have to have the dumbest immigration policy in the world. No country says that temporary visitors- their children will be given complete access to the benefits and blessings of American citizenship. America should actually look out for the interests of our citizens first, and that means, again, if you're here permanently and lawfully, your kid becomes an American citizen. If you're not here permanently, if you're not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah--",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: --and don't plan to be, why would we make those people's children American citizens permanently?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about refugee admissions, which were just suspended by the president. That has nothing to do with the U.S. border. Refugee screening takes 18 to 24 months to go through. They are heavily vetted. Left literally at the airport this week were thousands of Afghans who- some of whom had worked with the United States government and were promised to come here. When you talked to us in August, you said, \"I don't think we should abandon anybody who's been properly vetted and helped us.\" Do you stand by that?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE:\u00a0 Well, Margaret, I don't agree that all these immigrants, or all these refugees, have been properly vetted. In fact, we know that there are cases of people who allegedly were properly vetted and then were literally planning terrorist attacks in our country. That happened during the campaign if you may remember. So clearly, not all of these foreign nationals have been properly vetted--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --no, but there are 30,000 people in the pipeline- Afghan refugees. Do you stand by it--",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: --but my primary concern as the vice president, Margaret, is to look after the American people\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --So, no.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: And now that we know that we have vetting problems with a lot of these refugee programs, we absolutely cannot unleash thousands of unvetted people into our country. It's not good--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These people are vetted. These people are vetted--",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: --Just like the guy who planned a terrorist attack in Oklahoma a few months ago? He was allegedly properly vetted, and many people in the media and the Democratic Party said that he was properly vetted. Clearly he wasn't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. The--",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: I don't want my children to share a neighborhood with people who are not properly vetted, and because I don't want it for my kids, I'm not going to force any other American citizens kids to do that either.",

      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: I don't really care, Margaret. I don't want that person in my country, and I think most Americans agree with me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Anyway. I need to move on to something, because I know we're running out of time here. Two weeks ago, you were on Fox News, and you said, \"if you protested peacefully on January 6 and had Merrick Garland's Department of Justice treat you like a gang member, you should be pardoned. If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned.\" Did you counsel the president against these blanket pardons for 1,500 people--",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, Margaret, I noticed that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --including those who committed violence?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Margaret, I noticed that you cut off the thing that I said immediately after that. The full quote is that, of course, there are gray areas. And here's the nature of the gray area. Merrick Garland's Department of Justice denied constitutional protections in the prosecutions. There were double standards in how sentences were applied to the J6 protesters versus other groups. What the president said consistently on the campaign--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Case by case basis.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: --is that he was going to look at a case by case basis--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is blanket.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: --and that's exactly what we did. We looked at 1,600 cases. And the thing that came out of it, Margaret, is that there was a massive denial of due process of liberty, and a lot of people were denied their constitutional rights. The president believes that. I believe that, and I think he made the right decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Daniel Rodriguez used an electro sho- shock weapon against a policeman who was dragged out of the defensive line by plunging it into the officer's neck. He was in prison, sentenced to 12 years, 7 months. He got a pardon. Ronald McAbee hit a cop while wearing reinforced brass knuckle gloves, and he held one down on the ground as other rioters assailed the officer for over 20 seconds, causing a concussion. If you stand with law enforcement, how can you call these people unjustly imprisoned?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Margaret, you're separating- there's an important issue here. There's what the people actually did on January the 6th, and we're not saying that everybody did everything perfectly. And then what did Merrick Garland's Department of Justice do in unjustly prosecuting well over a thousand Americans in a way that was politically motivated--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is violence like that against a police officer ever justified?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Violence against a police officer is not justified. But that doesn't mean that you should have Merrick Garland's weaponized Department of Justice expose you to incredibly unfair process, to denial of constitutional rights, and frankly, to a double standard that was not applied to many people, including, of course, the Black Lives Ma- Matter rioters who killed over two dozen people and never had the weight of a weaponized Department of Justice come against them. The pardon power is not just for people who are angels or people who are perfect. And of course, we love our law enforcement and want people to be peaceful, with everybody, but especially with our good cops. That's a separate issue from what Merrick Garland's Department of Justice did. We rectified a wrong, and I stand by it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm being told we're out of time, but I want to quickly ask you--",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Sure, please.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration has directed refugee resettlement groups to stop using some federal funds in light of the president's suspension of American foreign aid, according to a U.S. State Department memo obtained by CBS News.",
      "While refugee resettlement groups are still scrambling to interpret the scope of the funding freeze, advocates believe the move will affect their efforts to integrate refugees into communities across the United States.",
      "John Slocum, the executive director of Refugee Council USA, a coalition of groups supporting those displaced by violence, said the Trump administration's funding suspension would be \"unfathomably cruel\" if it affects reception services for refugees.",
      "\"This unprecedented decision undermines our moral and legal obligations to those we promised to protect - and to the communities who welcome them,\" Slocum said. \"These core services serve as a lifeline for resettled refugees and Afghan Special Immigrant Visa holders who assisted the U.S. mission.\"",
      "Hours after taking office, Trump enacted an indefinite pause on admissions of refugees, who are identified as people fleeing war and violence overseas and who undergo a years-long vetting process before being admitted into the U.S. legally. It will not be restarted until the president determines resuming refugee arrivals is \"in the interests of the United States.\"",
      "Those who help refugees said the funding pause order could hinder their ability to provide critical assistance to refugees already in the U.S., including Afghans who aided the American war effort in Afghanistan.",
      "Refugee advocates fear the directive could affect funds resettlement agencies use to help refugees during their first 90 days in the U.S. as part of a government-overseen reception program. That assistance includes casework, childcare, food and housing aid and other key social services designed to place refugees on a path to self-sufficiency in the U.S.",
      "In a notice on Friday, resettlement agencies, many of which are faith-based groups, were told some of their federal funding awards were \"immediately suspended.\"",
      "\"Effectively immediately upon receipt of this Notice of Suspension the Recipient must stop all work under the award(s) and not incur any new costs after the effective date cited above,\" the memo to resettlement agencies says. \"The Recipient must cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible.\"",

      "Satellite imagery suggested that unlike previous \"megabergs,\" this rogue was not crumbling into smaller chunks as it plodded through the Southern Ocean, Andrew Meijers, a physical oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, told AFP on Friday.",
      "He said predicting its exact course was difficult but prevailing currents suggested the colossus would reach the shallow continental shelf around South Georgia in two to four weeks.",
      "But what might happen next is anyone's guess, he said.",
      "It could avoid the shelf and get carried into open water beyond South Georgia, a British overseas territory some 870 miles east of the Falkland Islands.",
      "Or it could strike the sloping bottom and get stuck for months or break up into pieces.",
      "Meijers said this scenario could seriously impede seals and penguins trying to feed and raise their young on the island. The island hosts 1.3 million pairs of Chinstrap penguins \u2014 one of the world's largest colonies \u2014 about 5 million seals, and 65 million breeding birds.",
      "\"Icebergs have grounded there in the past and that has caused significant mortality to penguin chicks and seal pups,\" he said.",
      "Roughly 1,550 square miles across, the world's biggest and oldest iceberg, known as A23a, calved from the Antarctic shelf in 1986. Before its calving in 1986, the colossal iceberg hosted a Soviet research station. falley",
      "It remained stuck for over 30 years before finally breaking free in 2020, its lumbering journey north sometimes delayed by ocean forces that kept it spinning in place. In 2023, the British Antarctic Survey posted a time-lapse of satellite imagery, showing the iceberg's movement.",
      "\"Game of Thrones-esque\" iceberg",

      "A23a has followed roughly the same path as previous massive icebergs, passing the east side of the Antarctica Peninsula through the Weddell Sea along a route called \"iceberg alley.\" That is the same current of water that famed explorer Ernest Shackleton used in 1916 to make his storied escape from Antarctica after losing his ship, the Endurance. The legendary\u00a0shipwreck was discovered\u00a0off the coast of Antarctica in 2022.",
      "Weighing a little under a trillion tons, this monster block of freshwater was being whisked along by the world's most powerful ocean \"jet stream\" -- the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.",
      "Raul Cordero from Chile's University of Santiago, who is also part of the National Antarctic Research Committee, said he was confident the iceberg would sidestep South Georgia.",
      "\"The island acts as an obstacle for ocean currents and therefore usually diverts the water long before it reaches the island,\" he said.",
      "\"The iceberg is moved by that water flow, so the chances of it hitting are not that high,\" though chunks could, he said.",
      "Another scientist, glaciologist Soledad Tiranti currently on an Argentinian exploration voyage in the Antarctic, said that icebergs such as A23a \"are so deep that before reaching an island or mainland they generally get stuck\" on the seabed.",
      "It is summer in South Georgia and resident penguins and seals along its southern coastline are foraging in the frosty waters to bring back food to fatten their young.",
      "\"If the iceberg parks there, it'll either block physically where they feed from, or they'll have to go around it,\" said Meijers.",
      "\"That burns a huge amount of extra energy for them, so that's less energy for the pups and chicks, which causes increased mortality.\"",
      "The seal and penguin populations on South Georgia have already been having a \"bad season\" with an outbreak of bird flu \"and that (iceberg) would make it significantly worse,\" he said.",
      "As A23a ultimately melted it could seed the water with nutrients that encourage phytoplankton growth, feeding whales and other species, and allowing scientists to study how such blooms absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",
      "While icebergs are natural phenomena, Meijers said the rate at which they were being lost from Antarctica was increasing, likely due to human induced climate change.",

    "story": [
      "A Chinese artificial intelligence company called DeepSeek is grabbing America's attention \u2014 and sending a shock wave through Wall Street \u2014 due to its new tech, which some experts say rivals that of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "DeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after Mr. Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday morning, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17% as of 2:08 p.m. Eastern Time while ASML shed 7.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3.5%, or 698 points, in afternoon trade, while the S&P 500 declined 1.7%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",

Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "In the meantime, major tech companies including Meta and Microsoft are slated to report earnings this week, where investors will likely hear more from their executives about their AI plans and their thoughts on DeepSeek, experts said.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",

    "summary": "The $500 billion Stargate project is projected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Here's what's known so far.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the new $500 billion Stargate AI venture from OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle on Tuesday, he promised it would ensure \"the future of technology\" in the U.S. So far, Wall Street appears to agree, with some analysts speculating about its potential to transform the tech industry.",
      "But the project is also sparking some questions and skepticism, including pointed criticism from one of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "\"They don't actually have the money,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media app he owns. \"SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\"",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman countered that claim,\u00a0replying to Musk, \"wrong, as you surely know.\"",
      "Whatever the case might be, there are plenty of questions swirling about Stargate, which takes its name from a science-fiction movie and TV show about portals that transport people to other galaxies.",
      "At a White House briefing on Tuesday for the project's announcement, the executives behind the venture described Stargate as an AI project that could also prove to be transformative, albeit via Earth-based tech rather than intergalactic travel.",
      "\"This will help people's lives. This will help solve many, many issues ... with the power of AI,\" said SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who joined Mr. Trump at the briefing, along with Altman and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.",
      "\"I think this will be the most important project of this era,\" added Altman.",
      "Here's what we know about the project so far.",
      "What is the Stargate project?",
      "Stargate is a venture that has the backing of OpenAI, Oracle and Japanese company Softbank, with the latter promising an initial investment of $100 billion, according to Tuesday's announcement.",
      "The goal, said Son, is to ramp that investment to $500 billion within 4 years, or before the end of Mr. Trump's current term.",
      "Softbank will hold financial responsibility for the project, while OpenAI will oversee the operations, according to a research note from Capital Economics chief economist John Higgins. \"Donald Trump's ringing endorsement of Stargate is another shot in the arm for artificial intelligence (AI) in the early days of his second presidency,\" he noted.",
      "Where will Stargate be located?",
      "Stargate investment will be directed toward constructing data centers to support AI development, according to the announcement.",
      "Already, there are data centers under construction in Texas, with the first one located in Abilene, Oracle's Ellison said at the press conference. The goal is to construct 10 data centers initially, with plans to expand to 20 locations of about half a million square feet each, he added.",
      "Other potential sites for data centers across the nation are also being evaluated, according to a person familiar with the project.",
      "What type of projects will Stargate AI pursue?",
      "The data centers will be used by OpenAI, according to the person familiar with the project.",
      "During the press conference, Ellison highlighted AI's ability to transform health care, saying that the tools provided by OpenAI and Softbank are helping to develop a cancer vaccine.",
      "\"You can do early cancer detection with a blood test, and, using AI to look at the blood test, you can find the cancer that is seriously threatening the person,\" Ellison said. \"Once we gene sequence that gene tumor, you can vaccinate the person against that cancer, and you can make that mRNA vaccine robotically using AI within 48 hours.\"",
      "How many jobs could Stargate create?",
      "Mr. Trump claimed the venture would create \"over 100,000 American jobs almost immediately,\" while OpenAI, in a statement on its website, says Stargate will \"create hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\"",
      "New hires for the project will be situated close to the data center locations, according to the person familiar with the venture. Stargate will hire people for construction, operations and other areas, they said.",
      "What is President Trump's AI policy?",
      "Mr. Trump is signaling a sharp divergence from former President Biden's AI policy. Within hours after returning to the White House, Mr. Trump made a symbolic mark on the future of artificial intelligence by repealing Biden's guardrails for the fast-developing technology.",
      "What will come next from Mr. Trump and how it will diverge from his predecessor's effort to safeguard AI technology remains unclear. The new administration didn't respond to requests for comment about the repealed Biden policy.",
      "Even so, Wall Street interpreted the Stargate project as a sign the Trump administration will encourage investment and growth of the AI sector, especially as a way to bolster the nation's AI capabilities as it competes with China for tech dominance.",
      "\"The key role of Softbank, a Japanese company, in Stargate, highlights how Trump isn't hell-bent on excluding foreign firms from participating in America's quest for dominance in AI \u2013 provided they are headquartered in countries that are close allies of the U.S.,\" Capital Economics' Higgins wrote.",
      "He added, \"The new president seems much less keen than his predecessor on imposing checks and balances on the spread of AI.\"",
      "Why are some skeptical about Stargate?",
      "Aside from Musk, others have raised questions about whether Stargate's investment will actually reach $500 billion, with Higgins of Capital Economics writing, \"Whether that much will ultimately get spent remains to be seen.\"",
      "Musk also has a public feud with OpenAI and Altman, alleging in a lawsuit last year that the company and its CEO violated OpenAI's original mission statement by putting profits over benefiting humanity. After helping found OpenAI in 2015, Musk broke with the company, claiming that the AI firm had veered away from its founding agreement that it would use its technology to benefit the public and that it would open its technology for public use.",

    "story": [
      "Monterey County supervisors on Tuesday declared a state of emergency in response to last week's major fire at the Vistra lithium battery plant in Moss Landing.",
      "The emergency declaration came during a special meeting where officials gave updates on the fire and ongoing response. While the fire has burned itself out, there are still a lot of questions from local leaders and neighbors about what's next.",
      "\"This was the beginning,\" said Josh Contreras as he showed photos he took of the incident from his houseboat.",
      "The images show a fireball on the horizon, not even a mile away.",
      "\"I walked up the docks, and then I took more photos,\" he said. \"Because you could see the flames, probably almost as tall as the towers that stand here.\"",
      "The fire at the Moss Landing Vistra Power Plant, located about 90 miles south of San Francisco,\u00a0broke out last Thursday afternoon, escalating in the early evening to the point where the incident\u00a0triggered evacuations for about 1,200 Monterey County residents\u00a0in the area and shut down a section of Highway 1 in both directions.",
      "Concerned over the potentially toxic runoff if fire crews turned hoses on the burning lithium batteries, officials instead are allowing the to burn itself out.",
      "Officials\u00a0said the fire was largely out as of late Friday morning\u00a0during a press conference, but it flared up significantly for a few hours that afternoon before dying down again. Officials were eventually able to lift the evacuation orders by early Friday evening. The stretch of Highway 1 near the plant remained closed until Sunday.",
      "Now that the fire is out, he is one of the many people living in the area what lies in the future for the facility.",
      "\"If they do battery packs, they should keep it in more deserted areas,\" Contreras said.",
      "\"This technology is ahead of the government's ability to regulate it,\" Monterey County Supervisor Glenn Church said during the emergency meeting Tuesday. \"And the industry's ability to control it.\"",
      "Supervisors were asking similar questions about the fire. A representative from Vistra said were just getting access to the burned-out lithium battery facility. The incident was enough for Church, who last week likened the fire to a \"Three Mile Island\" event for the emerging industry -- to draw this conclusion:",
      "\"Battery storage is essential for the future. And that's the direction we're going,\" Church noted. \"But -- as I said last night and I've tried to emphasize -- we just can't put that above safety. That's got to be the priority at this point.\"",
      "Church is calling for the Vistra facility to remain closed until an independent investigation can determine the cause of the incident.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we're on a pretty steep learning curve with battery safety still,\" said Dustin Mulvaney, a professor of environmental sciences at San Jose State University. \"And we're still figuring out ways that these batteries catch on fire. We're still figuring out how to best suppress them.\"",
      "Mulvaney  said the Moss Landing facility fire will be a wake-up call for the entire industry, right down to the people who insure the batteries. A lot of people will want to know what went wrong, and where, in a plant that is a hodgepodge of lithium battery technology.",
      "\"That site is actually an example of different ways to design it,\" Mulvaney explained. \"Because it was built in different phases. They took advantage of different opportunities to put things in different places. But this example will cause the industry to reflect on how they built these things. Because they have to be better neighbors to the community.\"",
      "Those who live in the community are reflecting on what it means to have this plant as a neighbor.",
      "\"Yeah. It should be out in the desert,\" said plant neighbor Julie Nieman. \"Somewhere in Nevada, out in the desert where people aren't around. Why would you put it where people live, in this beautiful area by the ocean?\"",
      "With the exception of one closed roadway beside the plant, things in Moss Landing are pretty much back to normal. The parks and beaches have to reopened, though some people have raised additional questions about the impact the fire had on the environment, particularly the sensitive Elkhorn Slough Reserve.

      "For 14-year-old Ben Cohen-Vigder, accidentally losing his smartphone on the school bus last February ended up gaining him so much more.",
      "\"I was without my phone for like two days and I realized how my days were so much longer and full,\" Ben said.",
      "It was so much better that the 8th grade lacrosse goalie made the radical choice to get a flip phone, giving him the ability to communicate without all the smart features \u2014 and distractions.",
      "A growing number of experts are sounding the alarm about increased screen time and the effect it has on kids and teens. In a 2023 advisory on social media use and mental health, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy recommended creating \"tech-free zones\" and encouraging kids to \"foster in-person friendships.\" Meanwhile, several states have taken steps to ban cellphones in schools.",
      "Swapping smartphones for flip phones",
      "Ben said he used to average up to five hours of screen time per day. Once he switched to a flip phone, it went down to about 30 minutes. So, CBS News asked four of Ben's friends, Carson, Ranita, Jamison and Maya \u2014 all 8th graders in New Jersey \u2014 to try flip phones for a week. Maya said her average screen time at the beginning of the week was more than 10 hours, spent mostly watching TV and on Tiktok.",
      "They were curious but skeptical about the experiment. Jamison said he wasn't doing as well as he wanted to in school and thought his phone use could be a \"big factor in that.\" Although Ranita plays three sports, she admitted wasting time on her phone, watching 30 minutes of scrolling turn into an hour without noticing. Carson agreed to participate, but the avid basketball player was nervous. Maya, who loves studying English and just started rowing, was hoping the trial would help her sleep better at night.",
      "The day CBS News sat down with the teens and took their iPhones and iPads and gave them flip phones, the reactions were a mix of laughing, shaking and confusion. They spent time gathered around the kitchen table with Ben teaching them how to use these foreign devices, including learning how to text without a \"modern\" keyboard.",
      "They left with instructions to try and stay in the spirit of the experiment, not using friends or parents phones as crutches \u2014 and of course the promise they'd get their smart devices back in a week.",
      "Carson didn't make it and asked for his phone back within 24 hours, saying he sat staring at the wall until he had basketball practice after school. The others stuck it out, sending in mostly positive reviews in video diaries taken on their parents phones throughout the experiment.",
      "\"I've been sleeping a lot better, a lot less tired during the day,\" Maya said.",
      "Jamison said it was helping him finish his homework faster. Ranita reported that she was frustrated not having her digital wallet and felt other conveniences of her phone were missing.",
      "Screen time linked to anxiety and depression in teens",
      "Experts' concerns about increased screen time are not unfounded. Half of American teenagers aged 12 to 18 had four hours or more of daily screen time during a period between July 2021 and December 2023. Almost 23% had three hours of daily screen time, 17.8% had two hours, 6.1% had one hour, and only 3% had less than one hour, according to a report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",

      "\"It doesn't have to be something as drastic as completely getting rid of all your social media. I have an Instagram account that I will use on  my computer, but it's more about doing small things that you can bring together to just fix that constant need,\" Ben said.",
      "Ben's mom, Jenn Cohen-Vigder, hopes more parents will take notice.",

    "summary": "Trump on Monday signed an executive order to create Elon Musk's DOGE, with a mandate to improve federal IT systems.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order officially creating the Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative helmed by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. The executive order included fresh details about DOGE's goals and structure, such as a mandate to upgrade the government's IT systems.",
      "Mr. Trump first announced DOGE in November with a statement that said the effort would \"provide advice and guidance from outside of Government.\" The goal, he added in November, would be to provide recommendations to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in a November Wall Street Journal opinion article that they aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal costs by targeting \"expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's executive order says that DOGE will in fact be housed within the executive branch, rather than operating as an outside advisory committee. The EO also states that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on improving government websites and tech \u2014 will be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "DOGE's purpose will be to \"implement the President's DOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,\" the EO states.",
      "The executive order doesn't include any details about cutting federal spending, slashing regulations or restructuring federal agencies. To be sure, the lack of a mention in the EO about cost-cutting doesn't mean that DOGE won't also tackle those issues, as well as taking on a mandate to upgrade federal IT systems.",
      "The Trump administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE lawsuits",
      "The EO comes as DOGE faces multiple lawsuits\u00a0over its structure and efforts so far, with the cases filed shortly after Mr. Trump's inauguration on Monday. The lawsuits claim that because DOGE was operating as a federal advisory committee, it was in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA.",
      "FACA regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, requiring them to operate transparently and publicly, as well as include representation from people who could be affected by their operations.",
      "But with Mr. Trump's EO establishing DOGE as a unit within the executive branch, it appears that the effort will not be operating as a federal advisory committee. Democracy Forward, which is representing some of the groups suing DOGE, said the executive order doesn't alter their plans.",
      "\"Our legal team is reviewing yesterday's executive orders. DOGE has been operating secretly and out of compliance with federal law for some time, which yesterday's executive orders could not impact,\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.",
      "And National Security Counselors, another public service group that is suing DOGE, said that it doesn't \"have any reason to believe that the entity created by the recent executive order is the same animal as the advisory committee we are litigating about.\"",
      "\"The executive order has definitely muddied the waters a bit, but at the end of the day, the deciding factor will be what the new U.S. DOGE Service actually does and how,\" said Kel McClanahan, executive director of National Security Counselors, said on Tuesday. \"It is difficult to imagine the sprawling DOGE written about by Musk and Ramaswamy slamming on its brakes and taking a job modernizing agency IT systems.\"",
      "Ramaswamy leaving DOGE",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE is losing one of its co-leaders, with Ramaswamy posting on social media on Jan. 20 that he is stepping back from the effort. Ramaswamy intends to announce a campaign for Ohio governor as soon as the end of January, CBS News has reported.",
      "\"It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE. I'm confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government,\" Ramaswamy wrote.",
      "According to Mr. Trump's EO, DOGE will be a \"temporary organization\" that will focus on \"advancing the President's 18-month DOGE agenda.\" The EO says that DOGE will come to an end on July 4, 2026.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2025 14:44:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Senate Democrats are asking for documents related to allegations the nominee to lead the FBI, Kash Patel, prematurely confirmed hostage rescue details.",
    "story": [
      "Days before this week's high-stakes confirmation hearing of Kash Patel to be FBI director, a bureau insider has come forward with new information questioning Patel's judgment during sensitive hostage rescue missions, CBS News has learned.",
      "The whistleblower, whose identity is being withheld by Senate Democrats for fear of retaliation, worked with the FBI's Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, which leads the government's missions to rescue hostages overseas. The whistleblower\u00a0alleges that Patel violated firmly entrenched protocols to keep such operations under wraps until the captives are safely in U.S. hands and their families have been notified.",
      "In a letter obtained by CBS News, Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote that Patel, while serving on the National Security Council during the first Trump term, \"broke protocol regarding hostage rescues by publicly commenting without authorization on the then-in-progress retrieval of two Americans held captive by Iranian-backed militants in Yemen in October 2020.\"",
      "According to the letter, on Oct. 14 at 10:55 a.m., the Wall Street Journal published a story in which Patel confirmed that the two American captives and the remains of a third were exchanged for two hundred Houthi fighters who were being held in Saudi Arabia. According to the letter, the news report was published \"several hours before the hostages were in the confirmed custody of the United States.\" In the end the Americans returned home safely, but FBI officials involved in the mission were livid over Patel's leak, which they regarded as reckless and potentially risking tragic results.",
      "Democratic senators sent the letter Monday morning to Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Acting Treasury Secretary David Lebryk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. It asks for all records of communications between Patel and the FBI's Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell concerning the rescue of the captives, as well as any records reflecting authorization for him to disclose the hostage deal before there was confirmation that the Americans were safely in U.S, hands.",
      "No Republican senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee signed the letter.",
      "A source close to the confirmation said in response to the allegations, \"Mr. Patel was a public defender, decorated prosecutor and accomplished national security official that kept Americans safe. He has a track record of success in every branch of government, from the court room to congressional hearing room to the situation room. There is no veracity to this anonymous source's complaints about protocol.\"",
      "The Durbin letter offers a glimpse into the Democratic strategy for Thursday's confirmation hearing. Knowledgeable sources tell CBS News that senators will seek to show that Patel has engaged in a pattern of poor judgment and self-aggrandizement regarding sensitive life-and-death missions and use that portrayal to cast doubt on his fitness to lead the FBI.",
      "The letter says any official \"who puts missions or the lives of Americans in jeopardy for public notoriety and personal gain is unfit to lead the country's primary federal law enforcement and investigative agency.\"",
      "The Democrats plan to highlight another instance where Patel has been criticized for his handling of a sensitive operation aimed at freeing American captives. Two weeks after the Yemen hostage deal, Patel found himself in the middle of another high-risk operation. Philip Walton was a 27-year-old American who had been seized by armed men at his farm in Niger, near the Nigerian border.",
      "The kidnappers transported Walton to Nigeria and demanded a million dollars in ransom. There were also indications that the kidnappers were contemplating turning him over to a terrorist group operating in the region. Patel was accompanying President Trump on a visit to Fort Bragg, the military installation in North Carolina that is home to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command. While they were there, Patel received intelligence that Walton would be held at an encampment for several hours, enough time to stage a daring Seal Team 6 raid to rescue the hostage. Mr. Trump signed off on the operation, which involved parachuting into Northern Nigeria and trekking for miles to the compound where Walton was being held.",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper had greenlit the plan, but there were still some final questions that needed to be answered before he could give the go order \u2013 primarily whether the Nigerian government had given the U.S. permission to use its air space. According to Esper's memoir, Patel, who was the senior director for counterterrorism at the time, assured Defense Department officials that the State Department had received the necessary permission from the Nigerians. But Patel's information was incorrect: the Nigerians had not given their approval.",
      "By this time, Air Force planes carrying the Navy SEALs were in the air just a few miles from the Nigerian border. Esper wrote in his memoir, \"A Sacred Oath,\" he realized the government had to make an agonizing decision. He told the White House they could go forward with the operation and risk having their planes shot down \u2014 or abort the mission and miss a crucial opportunity to save Walton.\u00a0 But at the last minute, word came that the State Department had received clearance to use Nigerian airspace. The mission went forward, was executed flawlessly, and Walton was returned to safety.",
      "But Esper and other officials were furious at the role Patel had played, believing he had inserted himself into the operation in violation of regular protocol, and then nearly botched it by transmitting false information. According to Esper's account, Patel's carelessness carried significant risk for the SEALs.",
      "\"I was concerned that being packed in an aircraft burning holes in the sky for an extra hour or so would wear on the special operators, that it might affect their readiness somehow,\" he wrote in his memoir.",
      "Esper also wrote of the incident, \"My team suspected Patel made the approval story up, but they didn't have all the facts.\"",
      "Patel has denied Esper's version of events. In his own book, \"Government Gangsters,\" Patel portrays Esper as a \"deep-state\" actor who \"always seemed to be subverting the president's agenda,\" including by putting up obstacles to counterterrorism raids in Africa and the Middle East.\" He argued that Mr. Trump had the ultimate authority to order the mission.",
      "Last week, Durbin met with Patel and asked him about Esper's account of his role in the nearly botched Nigerian raid. Sources said Patel again refuted Esper's version of events. Durbin did not yet have the whistleblower's information about the Yemen hostage deal, but he is expected to closely question the FBI nominee about that episode at Thursday's confirmation hearing.",
      "However Patel's answers those questions, there is no suspense as to how Durbin and his fellow Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee will vote. After his meeting with Patel, Durbin issued a statement saying he will not vote to confirm Patel.",

      "The federal judge who presided over the seditious conspiracy trial of far-right Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes rescinded an order that\u00a0barred Rhodes and his co-defendants from traveling to Washington, D.C. The Justice Department had called on him to modify the sentences of the group members, who were serving years-long sentences after their convictions on crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta said Monday, \"[I]t would be improper for the court post-commutation to modify the original sentences,\" but because President Trump's clemency \"can reasonably be read to extinguish enforcement of Defendants' terms of supervised release,\" the judge vacated his order.",
      "Mehta on Friday had ordered the Oath Keeper members Rhodes, Kelly Meggs, Kenneth Harrelson, Jessica Watkins, Roberto Minuta, Edward Vallejo, David Moerchel, and Joseph Hacket to be barred from entering Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Capitol building \"without first obtaining the permission from the Court.\"",
      "The decision prompted staunch opposition from Washington, D.C. Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Martin, who wrote that the defendants, including Rhodes, were \"no longer subject to the terms of supervised release and probation.\"",
      "Mehta, in reversing his decision, said he ultimately found Martin's interpretation of President Trump's unconditional commutation\u00a0 to be \"reasonable.\"",
      "Last week, as part of the mass clemency Mr. Trump extended to those tied to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, he pardoned over 1,500 defendants, but opted to commute the sentences of Rhodes, his co-defendants and certain members of the Proud Boys group who were also charged with seditious conspiracy. Not all of those who received commutations were ultimately convicted of the seditious conspiracy charge.",

Kennedy Jr., has a long history of\u00a0raising doubts about vaccines \u2014 despite decades of evidence showing they've saved millions of people from debilitating illness or death.",
      "\"People forget what it used to be (before vaccines),\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said on\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus,\"\u00a0pointing to data showing a huge decline in cases and deaths from these diseases compared with pre-vaccine levels.",
      "\"If you look at the 10 top childhood illnesses every year, vaccines prevent more than 1 million cases and more than 10,000 deaths\" in the U.S., he said. Worldwide, the numbers are even greater, with an estimated 2-3 million lives saved by childhood vaccinations each year.",
      "Here's what else to know about the impact of vaccines.",
      "How do vaccines work?",
      "Vaccines work by imitating organisms like viruses and bacteria without making you sick. \"That gives your immune system a chance to build up defenses so you're better prepared to fight a future infection,\" LaPook said.",
      "Your immune system creates specific defenses called antibodies against the imitation pathogen \u2014 known as an antigen \u2014 introduced by the vaccine. \"An antigen might be a germ that has been killed or changed so it cannot cause disease. It can be something that looks or behaves like a pathogen, a harmless part of a pathogen, or instructions for the body to manufacture the harmless part,\" according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.",
      "Then if you encounter the actual pathogen later in life, your immune system is prepared to respond quickly to fight it.",
      "Some vaccines effectively block illness, while others help prevent you from getting more severely sick if infected. So while it is true you can still get some illnesses after you've been vaccinated \u2014 like the flu or COVID, for example \u2014 the vaccines are still helpful in reducing the risk of severe illness or death.",
      "If your body has a strong immune reaction to a vaccine, you might feel tired or experience body aches, headache, swollen lymph nodes or even a fever, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. These potential side effects are normal and typically last no more than a day or two.",
      "What do vaccines accomplish?",
      "Vaccines have vastly reduced deaths in early childhood and largely eradicated certain diseases that used to cause dreaded epidemics.",
      "A recent\u00a0study led by the World Health Organization\u00a0estimates that vaccines, including immunizations against polio, measles and 12 other once-common diseases, have saved an estimated 154 million lives worldwide over the past 50 years. Measles vaccines alone have averted the deaths of about 94 million people, the analysis found.",
      "In recent years, however, with\u00a0backsliding\u00a0immunization rates, health officials are starting to see the effects of skipping shots.",
      "\"We don't have to remember too far back to see what happens because of vaccination rates, when there aren't requirements and people don't have access,\" Dr. Carolyn Bridges, the CDC's former associate director for adult immunizations, recently\u00a0told CBS News, citing a\u00a0polio case\u00a0that emerged in New York\u00a0in 2022.",
      "\"That's just mind-boggling that we can have a polio resurgence, in a country with all of our resources. It doesn't take all that much for diseases still circulating in other places to retake hold.\"",
      "Polio cases and deaths before and after vaccines",
      "Outbreaks of polio once killed thousands of Americans and left many survivors paralyzed, until the disease was virtually eliminated in the U.S. by vaccines that first rolled out in the 1950s.",
      "For decades now, the polio vaccine (inactivated polio vaccine or IPV) has been part of the routine childhood immunization schedule in the U.S., as it's the best way to protect against the virus. There is no cure.",
      "A total of four doses is recommended for the best level of protection. Research shows two doses of IPV provide about 90% protection while three doses provide at least 99% protection.",
      "Measles cases and deaths before and after vaccines",
      "Despite being easily preventable\u00a0with a readily available vaccine,\u00a0measles cases\u00a0have been\u00a0on the rise in recent years, due largely to an uptick in people skipping vaccination. Measles is highly contagious, and lower vaccination rates give it an opening to spread.",
      "Before the vaccine became available in the 1960s, measles was very common in childhood. About 48,000 Americans were hospitalized for it each year, and about 500, mostly children, would die.",
      "One dose of the MMR vaccine, which covers measles, mumps and rubella, is 93% effective\u00a0against measles and the recommended two doses is 97% effective, research shows.",
      "Most people who are vaccinated will be protected for life, major health organizations say.",
      "Rubella cases and deaths before and after vaccines",
      "Rubella, also known as German measles, is especially dangerous during pregnancy, when it can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or severe birth defects.",
      "During a major outbreak in the U.S. in the mid-1960s, before the vaccine, records show 11,000 pregnant women lost their babies, 2,100 newborns died, and about 20,000 babies were born with lifelong disabilities due to the virus.",
      "The MMR vaccine, first introduced in 1971, is about 97% effective at preventing rubella after just one dose, research shows.",

      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after Mr. Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday morning, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17% as of 2:08 p.m. Eastern Time while ASML shed 7.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3.5%, or 698 points, in afternoon trade, while the S&P 500 declined 1.7%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "In the meantime, major tech companies including Meta and Microsoft are slated to report earnings this week, where investors will likely hear more from their executives about their AI plans and their thoughts on DeepSeek, experts said.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",

But the law did not provide additional financing or staff to help implement the law or deal with the increased workload, the Social Security Administration (SSA) noted in an update Friday.",
      "\"SSA's ability to implement the law in a timely manner and without negatively affecting day-to-day customer service relies on funding,\" according to the agency. \"Though SSA is helping some affected beneficiaries now, under SSA's current budget, SSA expects that it could take more than one year to adjust benefits and pay all retroactive benefits.\"",
      "Ongoing staffing shortages, compounded by a hiring freeze since November 2024, will make the task of servicing people \"more difficult,\" SSA stated. All Social Security recipients, including those not affected by the new law, will face delays and increased wait times as SSA contends with the new workload, according to the agency.",

      "Signed into law\u00a0in December by former President Joe Biden, the Social Security Fairness Act expands benefits for millions by eliminating two federal policies that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program and that reduced benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "The benefits hike under the new law would be retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "Processing the changes is complex and much of the work has to be done manually on a case-by-case basis, SSA said. Some people's benefits will increase very little, while others could be looking at more than $1,000 more a month, it said.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 19:33:50 -0500",
    "summary": "Perplexity is seeking to create a new $300-billion public company with TikTok's U.S. business and include investments from other investors.",
    "story": [
      "Perplexity AI has presented a new proposal to TikTok's parent company that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "The proposal, submitted last week, is a revision of a prior plan the artificial intelligence startup had presented to TikTok's parent ByteDance on Jan. 18, a day before the law that bans TikTok went into effect.",
      "The first proposal, which ByteDance hasn't responded to, sought to create a new structure that would merge San Francisco-based Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business and include investments from other investors.",
      "The new proposal would allow the U.S. government to own up to half of that new structure once it makes an initial public offering of at least $300 billion, said the person, who was not authorized to speak about the proposal. The person said Perplexity's proposal was revised based off of feedback from the Trump administration.",
      "If the plan is successful, the shares owned by the government would not have voting power, the person said. The government also would not get a seat on the new company's board.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Under the plan, ByteDance would not have to completely cut ties with TikTok, a favorable outcome for its investors. But it would have to allow a \"full U.S. board control,\" the person said.",
      "Under the proposal, the China-based tech company would contribute TikTok's U.S. business without the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app, according to a document seen by the Associated Press.",
      "The proposal seems to mirror a strategy Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary during President Donald Trump's first term, discussed Sunday on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures \u2014 that a new investor in TikTok could simply \"dilute down\" the Chinese ownership and satisfy the law. Mnuchin has previously expressed interest in investing in the company.",
      "\"But the technology needs to be disconnected from China,\" he added. \"It needs to be disconnected from ByteDance. There's absolutely no way that China would ever let us have something like that in China.\"",
      "The Perplexity proposal comes as several investors are expressing interest in TikTok. Mr. Trump said late Saturday that he expects a deal will be made in as soon as 30 days.",
      "On\u00a0a flight from Las Vegas to Miami on Air Force One, Mr. Trump also said he hadn't discussed a deal with Larry Ellison, CEO of software maker Oracle, despite\u00a0a report\u00a0that Oracle, along with outside investors, was considering taking over TikTok's global operation.",
      "\"Numerous people are talking to me. Very substantial people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary. ... I'd only do it if the United States benefits.\"",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, TikTok was to be banned in the United States by Jan. 19 if it did not cut ties with ByteDance. The Supreme Court upheld the law, but Mr. Trump then issued an executive order to halt enforcement of the law for 75 days.",
      "Mr. Trump, on Air Force One, noted that Ellison lives \"right down the road\" from his Mar-a-Lago estate, but added, \"I never spoke to Larry about TikTok. I've spoken to many people about TikTok and there's great interest in TikTok.\"",
      "TikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. a week ago, but went back online after Mr. Trump said he would postpone the ban. Mr. Trump had unsuccessfully attempted a U.S. ban of the platform during his first term. But he has since reversed his position and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters during last year's presidential election.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Mr. Trump's inauguration Jan. 20, along with some other tech leaders who've been forging friendlier ties with the new administration.",
      "Congress voted to ban TikTok in the U.S. out of concern that TikTok's ownership structure represented a security risk. The Biden administration argued in court for months that it was too much of a risk to allow a Chinese company to control the algorithm that fuels what people see on the app. Officials also raised concerns about user data collected on the platform.",
      "However, to date, the U.S. hasn't provided public evidence of TikTok handing user data to Chinese authorities or allowing them to tinker with its algorithm.",

The aquarium will work to determine if the baby shark was born via parthenogenesis, also known as asexual reproduction, or via delayed fertilization. A DNA analysis once the pup is big enough for a blood draw will provide answers, but it will likely take months.",
      "\"We are very excited in the coming months to confirm whether this was indeed a case of parthenogenesis or if it was delayed fertilization,\" Barrick said. \"It really proves that life... uh... finds a way,\" he added, referencing 1993's \"Jurassic Park,\" in which Jeff Goldblum says the same thing while discussing how a group of all female dinosaurs could reproduce.",
      "While Yoko the shark, currently being monitored off exhibit, is \"thriving,\" the aquarium warned that sharks born through rare reproductive events can face significant challenges.",

      "A former high-ranking Belarusian diplomat told AP that Nuhfer's arrest was linked to the 2020 protests, although he did not give details.

      "\"Let's be clear. Tiktok is absolutely a national security threat,\" Turner said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "TikTok briefly shut down services in the U.S. last week facing a divestment deadline for its China-based parent company, ByteDance. But within hours, TikTok began restoring service to users when Mr. Trump vowed to intervene. And on Monday, the newly sworn-in president signed an executive order directing the Justice Department not to enforce the law, which the Supreme Court recently upheld, for 75 days.",
      "Turner, an Ohio Republican, outlined the reasoning behind the law passed last year by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden that gave ByteDance until Jan. 19 to divest or be cut off from U.S. app stores, saying that TikTok poses a national security risk on two fronts: \"its access to data and its ability to use itself as a propaganda tool.\"",
      "Turner argued that \"the only thing that would protect the United States and protect our citizens is divestiture,\" adding that \"the law that is the law of the land says that ByteDance needs to divest itself.\"",
      "Meanwhile, reports have circulated in recent days that the president is working on a deal to save TikTok through its sale. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One Saturday that \"numerous people\" are talking to him about buying TikTok, noting that he'll make a decision over the next 30 days. The president previously sought to ban the app over national security concerns during his first term.",
      "\"If we can save TikTok I think it would be a good thing,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that he has a \"warm spot\" for the app, citing his support among young people.",

      "The comments come after Turner was ousted\u00a0by House Speaker Mike Johnson as Intelligence Committee chairman earlier this month. Turner said at the time that the speaker fired him citing \"concerns from Mar-a-Lago.\" But Johnson has denied the claim. And on Sunday, the Ohio Republican said he'd been in touch with the president's team and was informed \"that was not the case.\"",
      "\"The one thing that he has said is that he wanted to take the committee in a different direction,\" Turner said, adding that he's \"a little concerned\" that the new direction could include a focus on \"the elusive Deep State\" rather than national security.",

They got us a country where we fought many wars over the last 40 years, but haven't won a war about as long as I have been alive. They've got us a military with a major recruitment crisis, a procurement price crisis that's totally dysfunctional, where we buy airplanes for billions and billions of dollars, terrible cost overruns.",

      "We've gotten into way too many wars that we don't have a plan for winning. We've gotten into way too many misadventures that we shouldn't have got into in the very first place. And our procurement process, Margaret, is incredibly broken. We're in an era\u2026",

This is a major period of disruption, and we think Pete Hegseth is the guy to lead the job.",
      "Now, there's another element to this, Margaret, too, which is we believe that military morale, at least until the election of President Trump, was historically low. You had the Army missing recruitment goals by tens of thousands of soldiers, and, already, recruitment is starting to pick up because Pete Hegseth is fundamentally a war fighter's leader at the Department of Defense.",

She has impeccable character, impeccable record of service, and she also is a person who I think is going to bring some trust back to the intelligence services.",
      "The bureaucrats at our intelligence services have gotten completely out of control. They've been part of the weaponization of our political system, the weaponization of our justice system.

It's been an incredible breakneck pace of activity. We're going to work with Congress. We're, of course, going to have more executive orders, and we're going to try \u2013 the way that you \u2013 you lower prices is that you encourage more capital investment into our country.",
      "And you asked specifically, what executive order is going to help lower prices. All of the stuff that we've done on energy, to explore more energy reserves, to develop more energy resources in the United States of America. One of the main drivers of increased prices under the Biden administration is that we had a massive increase in energy prices.",
      "Donald Trump has already taken multiple executive actions that are going to lower energy prices, and I do believe that means consumers are going to see lower prices at the pump and at the grocery store, but it's going to take a little bit of time. Rome wasn't built in a day.",

      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: We've taken over 200 executive actions, some executive orders, other executive actions. Again, this is in less than a week, and a lot of them were focused on the economy, bringing investment into our country and lowering energy prices.",
      "We've also focused on safety, restoring public safety, ending weaponization of the Department of Justice. We've done a lot. And I think the president is to be commended for actually coming in and doing something with this incredible mandate the American people gave him. He's not sitting in the Oval Office doing nothing. He's doing the American people's business. And I think they're going to see a lot of good effects from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a lot of these announcements have yet to take effect.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president did say he wants to do something with an executive order in relation to federal emergency response. He said he may reform or eliminate FEMA.",
      "Instead of sending emergency responders, he may start to send a percentage of money to states to take care of themselves. But you know FEMA has specialized expertise that some of these states just don't have\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Oh, Margaret, I\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 in their arsenal.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I wish that they\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And how will states who are \u2013 who are lower-income states, the Mississippis, the Kentuckys, the Alabamas, be able to do this for themselves without federal help?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, the president, to be clear, is not saying we're going to leave anybody behind.",
      "He's saying that, in the way that we administer these resources, some of which is coming from the federal level, some of which is coming from the state level, we've got to get the bureaucrats out of the way and get the aid to the people who need it most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are the first responders.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Let's be honest, Margaret. You talk about the expertise from FEMA. FEMA in North Carolina, in California, in Florida with some of the hurricanes has often been a disaster. And it's not because we don't have good people at FEMA.",
      "It's because bureaucratic red tape and garbage prevents the rapid deployment of resources to the people who need it the most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the states are now going to have to do this themselves?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: The president is trying to encourage us to reform the way that we deliver emergency response in a way that gets resources to people who need it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, don't take him literally, is what you're saying?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: No, we should take the president at his word that FEMA needs desperate reform, because it does.",
      "Margaret, when I went to North Carolina as V.P.-elect, but before we were sworn in, people would talk about how FEMA would get resources, food, medicine, water to a warehouse, but then would have no plan to get it from the warehouse to the people in the mountains who were literally starving and thirsting to death.",
      "We can do so much better. And, under Donald Trump's leadership, we will.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they work with the state and local officials. So, now\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: They often don't work well enough. And, again, that's not because of the\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 it's going to be on the state and local officials?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: They \u2013 no, the FEMA management officials don't work well enough with state and local officials to get resources to the people who need it.",
      "We should expect \u2013 and this is, I think, one of the fundamental premises of President Trump's leadership. The American people should expect more of their government. When there's a terrible disaster, they should expect food, medicine and water to get to the people who need it.",
      "When there's a terrible fire in California, the fire hydrants ought to actually turn on. I am sick of the American people having such low expectations for their government. They should demand more of us, because it's the greatest country in the world, and that's what Donald Trump's leadership promises to bring back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So still count on the federal government, but watch that space.",
      "Let me ask you about another area that you campaigned on quite a lot, and there was a flurry of activity on. And that has to do with immigration.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops this week condemned some of the executive orders signed by President Trump, specifically those allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enter churches and to enter schools.",
      "Do you personally support the idea of conducting a raid or enforcement action in a church service, at a school?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, let me \u2013 let me address this.",
      "Of course, if you have a person who is convicted of a violent crime, whether they're an illegal immigrant or a non-illegal immigrant, you have to go and get that person to protect the public safety. That's not unique to immigration.",
      "But let me just address the \u2013 this particular issue, Margaret, because, as a practicing Catholic, I was actually heartbroken by that statement. And I think that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops needs to actually look in the mirror a little bit and recognize that when they receive over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants, are they worried about humanitarian concerns, or are they actually worried about their bottom line?",
      "We're going to enforce immigration law. We're going to protect the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Donald Trump promised to do that. And I believe the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, if they're worried about the humanitarian costs of immigration enforcement, let them talk about the children who have been sex-trafficked because of the wide-open border of Joe Biden.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you \u2013 you personally support them going into schools and churches?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Let them talk about people like Laken Riley, who were brutally murdered.",
      "I support us doing law enforcement against violent criminals, whether they're illegal immigrants or anybody else, in a way that keeps us safe. Let me ask this question, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Let's separate the immigration issue. If you had a violent murderer in a school, of course I want law enforcement\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 to go and get that person out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: So, then what's the point of the question?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You changed the regulation this week. That's the point of the question.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Exactly, to\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Giving the authority to go into churches\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Yes, exactly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 and go into schools.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: We empowered law enforcement to enforce the law everywhere to protect Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that also has a knock-on effect, a chilling effect, arguably, to people to not send their kids to school.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I \u2013 I desperately hope it has a chilling effect\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the churches\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 on illegal immigrants coming into our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think the U.S. Conference of Catholics Bishops is \u2013 are actively hiding criminals from law enforcement?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I think the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has, frankly, not been a good partner in commonsense immigration enforcement that the American people voted for.",
      "And I hope, again, as a devout Catholic, that they'll do better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are five legal challenges already to one of the other immigration actions, the order on birthright citizenship.",
      "A federal judge, appointed by Ronald Reagan, who I think you'd agree has some conservative credentials\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 paused the order to end birthright citizenship, calling it blatantly unconstitutional.",
      "How do you reconcile this challenge to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: So, I obviously disagree with that judge.",
      "And these things, some of them will be litigated. That's the nature of our constitutional system. But here's the basic idea of President Trump's view on this. If you are a lawful permanent resident or a legal immigrant who plans to stay, your children, of course, should become American citizens.",
      "But let's say you're the child of an ambassador. You don't become\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not part of it.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, that's an important principle.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's already a carve-out having to do with kids of diplomats.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: But we're saying that that carve-out should apply to anybody who doesn't plan to stay here.",
      "If you come here on vacation and you have a baby in an American hospital, that baby doesn't become an American citizen. If you're an illegal alien and you come here temporarily, hopefully, your child does not become an illegal \u2013 American citizen by virtue of just having been born on American soil.",
      "It's a very basic principle in American immigration law that, if you want to become an American citizen, and you've done it the right way, and the American people in their collective wisdom have welcomed you into our national community, then you become a citizen.",
      "But temporary residents, people who come in here, whether legally or illegally, and don't plan to stay\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 their children shouldn't become American citizens. I don't know any country that does that, or why we would be different.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but this is a country founded by immigrants.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, this is a country founded by\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a unique country.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: This is a very unique country, and it was founded by some immigrants and some settlers.",
      "But just because we were founded by immigrants doesn't mean that, 240 years later, that we have to have the dumbest immigration policy in the world. No country says that temporary visitors, their children will be given complete access to the benefits and blessings of American citizenship.",
      "America should actually look out for the interests of our citizens first, and that means, again, if you're here permanently and lawfully, your kid becomes an American citizen. If you're not here permanently, if you're not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 and don't plan to be, why would we make those people's children American citizens permanently?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about refugee admissions, which were just suspended by the president.",
      "That has nothing to do with the U.S. border. Refugee screening takes 18 to 24 months to go through. They are heavily vetted. Left literally at the airport this week were thousands of Afghans who \u2013 some of whom had worked with the United States government and were promised to come here.",
      "When you talked to us in August, you said: \"I don't think we should abandon anybody who's been properly vetted and helped us.\"",
      "Do you stand by that?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, Margaret, I don't agree that all these immigrants, or all these refugees have been properly vetted. In fact, we know that there are cases of people who allegedly were properly vetted and then were literally planning terrorist attacks in our country.",
      "That happened during the campaign, if you may remember. So, clearly, not all of these foreign nationals have been properly vetted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but there are 30,000 people in the pipeline, Afghan refugees. Do you stand by it?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: But my primary concern as the vice president, Margaret, is to look after the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: And now that we know that we have vetting problems with a lot of these refugee programs, we absolutely cannot unleash thousands of unvetted people into our country. It's not good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These people are vetted. These people are vetted.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Just like the guy who planned a terrorist attack in Oklahoma a few months ago? He was allegedly properly vetted, and many people in the media and the Democratic Party said that he was properly vetted. Clearly, he wasn't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I don't want my children to share a neighborhood with people who are not properly vetted. And because I don't want it for my kids, I'm not going to force any other American citizens' kids to do that either.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No. And that was a very particular case. It wasn't clear if he was radicalized when he got here or while he was living here, but\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: I don't really care, Margaret. I don't want that person in my country, and I think most Americans agree with me.",

      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two weeks ago, you were on FOX News, and you said: \"If you protested peacefully on January 6 and had Merrick Garland's Department of Justice treat you like a gang member, you should be pardoned. If you committed violence on that day, obviously, you shouldn't be pardoned.\"",
      "Did you counsel the president against these blanket pardons for 1,500 people\u2026",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, Margaret, I notice that you\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 including those who committed violence?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Margaret, I notice that you cut off the thing that I said immediately after that.",
      "The full quote is that, of course, there are gray areas. And here's the nature of the gray area. Merrick Garland's Department of Justice denied constitutional protections in the prosecutions. There were double standards in how sentences were applied to the J6 protesters versus other groups. What the president said consistently on the campaign\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Case-by-case basis.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 is that he was going to look at a case-by- case basis\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is blanket.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: And that's exactly what we did. We looked at 1,600 cases.",
      "And the thing that came out of it, Margaret, is that there was a massive denial of due process of liberty, and a lot of people were denied their constitutional rights. The president believes that. I believe that, and I think he made the right decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Daniel Rodriguez used an electroshock weapon against a policeman who was dragged out of the defensive line by plunging it into the officer's neck. He was imprisoned, sentenced to 12 years, seven months. He got a pardon.",
      "Ronald McAbee hit a cop while wearing reinforced brass-knuckle gloves, and he held one down on the ground as other rioters assailed the officer for over 20 seconds, causing a concussion.",
      "If you stand with law enforcement, how can you call these people unjustly imprisoned?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Margaret, you're separating \u2013 there's an important issue here.",
      "There's what the people actually did on January the 6th, and we're not saying that everybody did everything perfectly. And then what did Merrick Garland's Department of Justice do in unjustly prosecuting well over 1,000 Americans in a way that was politically motivated?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is violence like that against a police officer ever justified?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Violence against a police officer is not justified.",
      "But that doesn't mean that you should have Merrick Garland's weaponized Department of Justice expose you to incredibly unfair process, to denial of constitutional rights, and, frankly, to a double standard that was not applied to many people, including, of course, the Black Lives Matter rioters who killed over two dozen people and never had the weight of a weaponized Department of Justice come against them.",
      "The pardon power is not just for people who are angels or people who are perfect. And, of course, we love our law enforcement and want people to be peaceful with everybody, but especially with our good cops. That's a separate issue from what Merrick Garland's Department of Justice did. We rectified a wrong, and I stand by it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm being told we're out of time, but I want to quickly ask you.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Sure. Please.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The richest men in the world were at that Capitol on Inauguration Day, heads of Amazon, Google, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.",

      "They've now donated to the Trump inauguration. Are you still going to break up big tech?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: So, you know who else was at the inauguration was my mom, and a lot of people who just supported the president and fought every single day to get \u2013 get his election and to make it\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They gave $1 million each to the inauguration.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 and to make it \u2013 and to make it possible.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They got pretty good seating.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: \u2026 who were on that \u2013 who were on that stage, Margaret.",
      "They didn't have as good of seating as my mom and a lot of other people who were there to support us. But, look, we believe fundamentally that big tech does have too much power, and there are two ways they can go about this. They can either respect America's \u2013 Americans' constitutional rights, they can stop engaging in censorship, and, if they don't, you can be absolutely sure that Donald Trump's leadership is not going to look too kindly on them.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER:: Well, this is very common that there's turnover when a new president comes in to do a review of what's happening within these agencies and in the I.G.s.",
      "I think there'll be a review as they put these individuals back, and some of the individuals will be replaced, obviously. But, you know, clearly they need to bring in their own team now. They need to look at what the performance is for these individuals. And it's very common as new administrations come in that specifically these positions be replaced.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is their finding\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER:: Right, but Congress passed and the Biden administration signed an order declassifying the information concerning the lab leak theory and the issues with respect to COVID origins.",

      "Inauguration Day, January 20th, the CEO of TikTok, whose company seemed a national security threat was U.S. law, was seated next to Tulsi Gabbard, the pick to run the intelligence community. Despite this national security law. You can see the picture of them right there.",
      "And Mr. Trump seems to have given them a reprieve. The editorial board of \"The Wall Street Journal\" said, \"Mr. Trump's TikTok order shows a Biden- like disdain for limits on his power.\"",
      "What do you make of this decision not to implement the law for at least a period of time?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-OH): Well, let's be clear, TikTok is absolutely a national security threat. The law passed by Congress, that came out of the House China Select Committee that was chaired by Michael Gallagher, that drafted this law, found that TikTok was a national security risk because of two things, its access to data and its ability to use itself as a propaganda tool by China itself, and the laws in China that allowed China to compel TikTok to manipulate itself, both its data and its access to China and its use of propaganda.",
      "The Supreme Court upheld this. It remains a national security threat. And because of that, the United States Congress, the law - that is the law of the land says that ByteDance need to divest itself.",
      "Now, the only thing that would protect the United States, and protect our citizens, is divestiture.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Maning, sell it.",

      "Now, Elon Musk has said something very interesting. He has said, you know, of course he's noted that Twitter, his X, does not have access to China. And that's sort of an admission by China as to what they're doing with TikTok. They won't let Twitter or X in, almost an admission as to what they're doing.",
      "Also, you know, ByteDance have said, well, we don't sell it. Another admission that it's really not a business. This is a propaganda tool. It is an access to data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Donald Trump's not convinced of that, because he issued an executive order saying he'll figure out a deal.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, he has said - and we certainly hope that - that he gets a deal that recognizes the issue of national security, because there is no role -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there was over 200 days to come to that deal and -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: There is - there is no role in which -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not selling.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: There is - there is no role. That's what they've said, there is no role in which they can remain active in which China can have access to this data.",
      "Let me give you just two examples. And, by the way, I commend to people the - the Supreme Court decision because it lays out in incredible detail the national security threat. If there aren't - fi the data - if the app is on your phone, they have access to the data on your phone. And, you know, President Trump -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Outside of that app?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Outside of that app. And even the - the threat is to access that your phone has to other app and other datas. And that's why governments have prohibited the app being on government phones, U.S., U.K. And India has banned the - the whole app in its - in its country.",
      "And then, of course, there's the propaganda aspect of how this can be manipulated. Romania just set aside its entire presidential election because of concerns that TikTok has manipulated data and propaganda with respect to its presidential election. Grave concerns as to what can be done with this - with TikTok.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about what's happening on Capitol Hill. You've been on this program many times as chair of the House Intelligence Committee. Speaker Johnson ousted you from that position as chair recently. What can you share about - with us about the conversation you had and the explanation? Because you've run it in a bipartisan way.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Yes. And I think, you know, I think certainly bipartisanship is incredibly important. And after I had the conversation with the speaker, you and I - you and I spoke.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: The speaker related, you know, certainly as we, discussed, that, you know, an element included concerns from Mar-a-Lago. He's sense walked that back. President Trump's staff has been in touch with me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he flatly denied it.",

And, you know, my concern is, the focus should be on the committee of national security, which has what my focus has been. And, you know, state actors, non-state actors, those individuals who want to do our country harm. There certainly are - are bad actors and people that we need to pursue. And we certainly have done so. We find that there are laws that - that need to be changed to pursue people, to criminalize bad actions. And we certainly have done that.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is so much news this week. And I want to just pick up, though, on the conversation about January 6th that we had with the vice president.",
      "You've spoken about your experiences that day in very, very vivid terms. You talked about helping other lawmakers shelter. They were fearing for their lives. To help them put on gas masks. There's a picture of you that day even fighting your way out of the chamber since you had combat experience.",
      "What's your response to the vice president's defense of pardoning some of these violent offenders?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Well, I don't want to hear Donald Trump or J.D. Vance or anyone else in this administration talk about backing the blue, talk about supporting law enforcement when they just released over 1,000 cop beaters, people who brutally beat our law enforcement.",
      "I was there. I saw it firsthand. America saw it firsthand. The video is available for anybody to view. The brutality, the injuries. Over 150 of these officers still have injuries, several of whom lost their lives because of the injuries and trauma incurred on that day. We even had the Fraternal Order of Police come out and issue a statement condemning the pardons.",
      "So, clearly, they're not interested in supporting law enforcement. This was a political decision and a really repugnant one at that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you more about that, but I have to address the elephant in the room too because Monday, hours before leaving office, Joe Biden, then still president, preemptively pardoned his own siblings and their spouses, even though they have not been charged with any crimes. Senator Tim Kaine said, \"the decision makes it harder for Democrats to stan on the high ground and make a critique of the Trump pardons.\"",
      "Do you agree it muddies moral clarity?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: No. What I think happens here is that it shows very clearly the decision of an outgoing president to try to protect his family when you have an incoming president, and those around him who are repeatedly threatening his family, right? That is the story here, that you have Donald Trump, who has doubled down, who has tripled down on threats against Joe Biden, on threats against outgoing administration officials, simply for doing their job in many cases. This is a president, President Trump, who continues to threaten political opponents and is making every move right now in the early days of his administration to try to put in motion things to go after and to use the force of government now to go after his political opponents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you on concerns about retribution. You were plain spoken when Joe Biden pardoned his son, Hunter, who had been convicted of multiple crimes. And, in fact, you said in very clear terms, you thought that it did create problems for Democrats.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, in that instance I did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You see a difference?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You know, I thought that there was a conflict of interest that undermined the integrity of the process. And what I would like to see overall is pardon reform. Very clearly, there needs to be some guardrails put in place and some reform of the pardon process. And I think most Americans would agree with this, to make sure that it's not misused. Because a lot of this is about the perception of America. You know, people need to know that the person sitting in the Oval Office has their best interests in mind at all times. And certainly not with Donald Trump right now can they have that feeling of trust and confidence because in five days into this administration the abuse is already rampant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You - to go back to January 6th, because there are comparisons being made. And I hear your point on pardon reform, which is basically saying presidents need guardrails on this stuff, even if they're Democrats.",
      "But one of the people pardoned by Donald Trump was Stewart Rhodes. He was released from an 18-year prison sentence for conspiring to violently stop Congress' role in the transfer of power.",
      "He was at the Capitol this Wednesday after receiving a pardon. This is a man who was recorded having said in 2021 that he wished he had brought rifles on January 6th and he spoke about hanging Nancy Pelosi.",
      "How do you make sense of that? How do lawmakers make sense of that? And are you concerned about political violence, not specifically necessarily just to him, but - but that this encourages more of that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, well, I'm sitting here last week in my office on Capitol Hill, and I turn on the TV and I see that a couple of floors below me Stewart Rhodes, as you mentioned, one of the heads of an armed militia group in America, is having coffee at the Dunkin' Donuts in the basement of my office building. So, of course, I felt uncomfortable about that, as did most of my colleagues.",
      "And I'm very focused on public safety. I always have been in this job. And you just cannot tell me that releasing militia leaders, insurrectionists, criminals back onto the street because it's what you did to placate your political base is making us any more safe, right? In an era of political violence, of extremist, where threats against members of Congress have quadrupled in the last couple of years, none of this is making us safe. It's actually creating an environment that gives permission to extremists to be more bold, to assert themselves. And we're going to see more of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to switch to what's happening in Colorado. Aurora, Colorado, is in your district. That is a location that president and candidate Trump talked quite a lot about, specifically as an example of immigration run amuck. He talks about the migrant Venezuelan gang, TDA, taking over parts of your city. Something local officials have pushed back on certainly. They were designated as a terrorist group by President Trump. Or he started the process to designate them.",
      "What does that do for the people of Aurora?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Wel, you know, I've pushed back pretty fiercely on Donald Trump's lies because this is my hometown. I live there. And I can tell you that Aurora, Colorado, is a place of great pride and great strength. We are a community of immigrants and refugees. Nearly 20 percent of my constituents were born outside of the United States. These are our business owners. These are our friends. They go to school with my children. They work in our community. They grow businesses in our community.",
      "And the rhetoric of Donald Trump, both on the campaign trail and now, demonizing these folks and telling gross lies and exaggerations is not only - not only impugns the reputation of a strong and vibrant community -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: But it makes those folks less safe. And I will stand up over and over again and push back against those lies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: At the same time it does nothing to advance the cause of comprehensive immigration reform, which we desperately need, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Anybody knows that our system is badly broken. And Donald Trump is not making the moves to fix it.",

      "I understand you have new reporting about some of the plans for migrants being deported.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right. We can report that the Trump administration is currently working on striking an asylum agreement with the country of El Salvador to deport migrants from different countries across Latin America to the small country in Central America. This would be a so-called safe third country asylum agreement that would empower U.S. immigration officials, Margaret, to deport non-Salvadoran migrants to El Salvador with instructions to seek asylum there and not in the U.S.",
      "Importantly, I am told that one plan under consideration would allow the U.S. to deport Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members to El Salvador and have that country house them or detain them. And that would, obviously, be a significant development and break through potentially for the administration because, as you know, Venezuela, right now, currently does not accept U.S. deportations. And so, the administration is moving aggressively and quickly to really oversee a sweeping crackdown on immigration. We have seen the president invoke sweeping constitutional powers to essentially shut down the asylum system at the border. And he is also enlisting the vast resources of the military to really enhance immigration enforcement, not only deploying more troops, but using military planes to deport migrants.",
      "And, yes, there have been so far 1,500 troops deployed to the border. But one internal Customs and Border Protection memo we obtain, Margaret, shows that that number could rise to as many as 10,000 active duty troops.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's so much that you just laid out there. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to go to El Salvador in the coming days.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I imagine it's related to the news you just broke here.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And - and TDA is the gang we were just talking about with the congressman as well.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of how the U.S. military is being used, President Biden left 2,500 U.S. troops at the border.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what's actually different now that there's an extra 1,500?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Well, the work is not changing. What is changing is the number of troops on the ground. They are still assigned to do logistical and operational work and to assist Customs and Border Protection in an operational capacity by, for example, setting up border barriers to repel migrants from entering the country illegally and providing surveillance. They are not to be used to arrest or otherwise process migrants because, as you know, longstanding federal law prohibits the use of the military for civilian law enforcement. And that would include the enforcement of federal immigration laws.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it's the optics essentially that this is -",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: It's a show of force by the Biden -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a show of force?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: By the Trump administration, rather.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And what, in terms of the changes have occurred in terms of use of military? We were hearing about lots of deportations. Now it seems we're getting reports daily of military planes carrying migrants to Guatemala.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: An attempt, apparently, to Columbia as well.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right. So, the administration has already used military planes to deport migrants to the country of Guatemala. And, overnight, it attempted to send two military aircraft to Columbia, sending about 160 deportees from that country to Bogota, Columbia, the capital. But we are told now that the president of Columbia, Gustavo Petro, objected to the use of military planes and blocked those deportations. So, this shows that the administration will still face significant diplomatic challenges as it tries to oversee this aggressive immigration plan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden team was deporting to those countries. They were using civilian aircraft.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: ICE charter flights, correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the military planes were the problem there?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: And, again, it's a show of force by the Trump administration.",

      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): Every morning, Capitol Police officers make good on their pledge to ensure that lawmakers, citizens and the press can move safely through the Capitol. They protect an idea that in that building passionate disputes can find peaceful resolution. Each day their willingness to sacrifice honors this American system, whether violence comes or not.",
      "On January 6, 2021, violence came, and they answered their oath's call. Heroes emerged. The lawmakers they protected praised their bravery.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-TX): Law enforcement went in, Capitol Police and Secret Service, they bravely confronted the terrorists. They bravely removed them. They secured the Capitol.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): One hundred and forty officers were injured, some sustained brain injuries, cracked ribs and even shattered spinal discs. In the following days, one officer, Brian Sicknick, would die from his physical wounds, while four others would take their own lives. A plaque was commissioned to honor them. Plaques are made of metal because they are meant to be as durable as the message, do not forget. A plaque transforms courage and sacrifice of an instant into lessons for the future in case lawmakers lose their way.",
      "The symbols of Inauguration Day do that, too. The Rotunda painting of General Washington giving up power, Lincoln's Bible, acts of heroism in service of democratic ideals, nourishment from the past to the present. All serve one idea, that the voice of the people is honored through a peaceful transfer of power. On Inauguration Day, both parties applauded this.",
      "Law enforcement stood guard over the peaceful transition, but the shared commitment to what they protected proved more fragile than their watch. By sundown, the president, sanctified by those symbols, and now the steward of the ideas they represent, pardoned the 1,500 rioters who had sought to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power on January 6th and overturn the vote of 81 million Americans. Among those whose crimes were erased, those who had pierced, electrocuted and smashed police officers. The lawmakers the officers had protected offered no defense.",

      "MAN: We are not looking backward, we're looking forward.",

      "He said predicting its exact course was difficult but prevailing currents suggested the colossus would reach the shallow continental shelf around South Georgia in two to four weeks.",
      "But what might happen next is anyone's guess, he said.",
      "It could avoid the shelf and get carried into open water beyond South Georgia, a British overseas territory some 870 miles east of the Falkland Islands.",
      "Or it could strike the sloping bottom and get stuck for months or break up into pieces.",
      "Meijers said this scenario could seriously impede seals and penguins trying to feed and raise their young on the island. The island hosts 1.3 million pairs of Chinstrap penguins \u2014 one of the world's largest colonies \u2014 about 5 million seals, and 65 million breeding birds.",
      "\"Icebergs have grounded there in the past and that has caused significant mortality to penguin chicks and seal pups,\" he said.",
      "Roughly 1,550 square miles across, the world's biggest and oldest iceberg, known as A23a, calved from the Antarctic shelf in 1986. Before its calving in 1986, the colossal iceberg hosted a Soviet research station. falley",
      "It remained stuck for over 30 years before finally breaking free in 2020, its lumbering journey north sometimes delayed by ocean forces that kept it spinning in place. In 2023, the British Antarctic Survey posted a time-lapse of satellite imagery, showing the iceberg's movement.",

      "A23a has followed roughly the same path as previous massive icebergs, passing the east side of the Antarctica Peninsula through the Weddell Sea along a route called \"iceberg alley.\" That is the same current of water that famed explorer Ernest Shackleton used in 1916 to make his storied escape from Antarctica after losing his ship, the Endurance. The legendary\u00a0shipwreck was discovered\u00a0off the coast of Antarctica in 2022.",
      "Weighing a little under a trillion tons, this monster block of freshwater was being whisked along by the world's most powerful ocean \"jet stream\" -- the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.",
      "Raul Cordero from Chile's University of Santiago, who is also part of the National Antarctic Research Committee, said he was confident the iceberg would sidestep South Georgia.",
      "\"The island acts as an obstacle for ocean currents and therefore usually diverts the water long before it reaches the island,\" he said.",
      "\"The iceberg is moved by that water flow, so the chances of it hitting are not that high,\" though chunks could, he said.",
      "Another scientist, glaciologist Soledad Tiranti currently on an Argentinian exploration voyage in the Antarctic, said that icebergs such as A23a \"are so deep that before reaching an island or mainland they generally get stuck\" on the seabed.",
      "It is summer in South Georgia and resident penguins and seals along its southern coastline are foraging in the frosty waters to bring back food to fatten their young.",
      "\"If the iceberg parks there, it'll either block physically where they feed from, or they'll have to go around it,\" said Meijers.",
      "\"That burns a huge amount of extra energy for them, so that's less energy for the pups and chicks, which causes increased mortality.\"",
      "The seal and penguin populations on South Georgia have already been having a \"bad season\" with an outbreak of bird flu \"and that (iceberg) would make it significantly worse,\" he said.",
      "As A23a ultimately melted it could seed the water with nutrients that encourage phytoplankton growth, feeding whales and other species, and allowing scientists to study how such blooms absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",

    "summary": "Survivors of the Nazi's notorious Auschwitz death camp are taking center stage at the memorial service to mark 80 years since its liberation by Soviet troops.",
    "story": [
      "Oswiecim, Poland \u2014 A memorial service to mark 80 years since the liberation of Auschwitz\u00a0by Soviet troops was held Monday at the site of the former death camp, a ceremony that was widely treated as the last major observance that any notable number of survivors would be able to attend.",
      "Nazi German forces murdered some 1.1 million people at the site in southern Poland, which was under German occupation during World War II. Most of the victims were Jews killed on an industrial scale in gas chambers, but the Germans also murdered many Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, gay people and others who were targeted for elimination in the Nazi racial ideology.",
      "Among those who traveled to the site was 86-year-old Tova Friedman, who was 6 when she was among the 7,000 people liberated on Jan. 27, 1945. She believes it will the be last gathering of survivors at Auschwitz and she came from her home in New Jersey to add her voice to those warning about rising hatred and antisemitism.",
      "\"The world has become toxic,\" she told The Associated Press a day before the observances in nearby Krakow. \"I realize that we're in a crisis again, that there is so much hatred around, so much distrust, that if we don't stop, it may get worse and worse. There may be another terrible destruction.\"",
      "Auschwitz quickly became a potent symbol of the horrors of the Holocaust. Its notorious \"selection process\" for prisoners arriving at the camp's train platform determined life or death in mere moments. Families were torn apart, with children, the elderly, and the disabled often sent immediately to their deaths.",
      "As CBS News reporter Anna Noryskiewicz reported from the memorial on Monday, the vast majority of prisoners who survived the initial selection went on to endure unimaginable suffering and were still eventually murdered, often after grueling forced labor in sub-zero temperatures or cruel medical experiments.",
      "Survivors have described Auschwitz as a hell on Earth \u2014 a place where life lost all meaning. Their harrowing testimonies at the memorial service on Monday were to reveal the depths of the cruelty inflicted on so many people, but also the resilience of the human spirit.",
      "Polish President Andrzej Duda, whose nation lost 6 million citizens during the war, placed a candle Monday at Auschwitz's Death Wall, where many prisoners were executed, among them Poles who resisted the occupation of their country. He was surrounded by elderly survivors of the camp, who were assisted by family members.",
      "\"We Poles, on whose land \u2014 occupied by Nazi Germans at that time \u2014 the Germans built this extermination industry and this concentration camp, are today the guardians of memory,\" Duda told reporters afterward. He spoke of the \"unimaginable harm\" inflicted on so many people, especially the Jewish people.",
      "In all, the Germans murdered 6 million Jews from all over Europe, annihilating two-thirds of Europe's Jews and one-third of all Jews worldwide. In 2005, the United Nations designated Jan. 27 as International Holocaust Remembrance Day.",
      "Later in the day, world leaders and royalty will join with elderly camp survivors, the youngest of whom are in their 80s. Politicians, however, have not been asked to speak this year by the event's organizers. Due to the advanced age of the survivors, organizers have chosen to make them the center of the observances.",
      "Among the leaders in attendance were Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Germany had never sent both of its highest state representatives to the observances before, according to German news agency dpa.",
      "It is a sign of Germany's continued commitment to take responsibility for the nation's crimes, even amid a growing far-right movement that would like to forget them.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were also attending, along with Britain's King Charles III and kings and queens from Spain, Denmark and Norway.",
      "The White House said Washington would be represented by U.S. special Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, among others.",
      "Russian representatives were in the past central guests at the observances in recognition of the Soviet liberation of the camp, and the huge losses suffered by Soviet forces in the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany. But they have not been welcome since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, also arrived in Poland Monday to attend the memorial.",
      "\"We must overcome the hatred that gives rise to abuse and murder. We must prevent forgetfulness,\" he said in a statement before he arrived. \"It is everyone's mission to do everything possible to prevent evil from winning.\"",

    "summary": "Israel is letting thousands of Palestinians return to northern Gaza for the first time since the early weeks of the war with Hamas\u200b, as a fragile ceasefire endures\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "Tens of thousands of Palestinians returned to the most heavily destroyed part of the Gaza Strip on Monday as Israel lifted its closure of the north for the first time since the early weeks of the 15-month war with Hamas in accordance with a fragile ceasefire.",
      "Massive crowds of people carrying their belongings on foot stretched along a main highway running next to the coast in a stunning reversal of the mass exodus from the north at the start of the war, which many Palestinians had feared Israel would make permanent.",
      "The opening was delayed for two days over a dispute between Hamas and Israel, which said the militant group had changed the order of the hostages it released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Mediators resolved the dispute overnight.",
      "For thousands of Palestinians in Gaza: \"The joy of return\"",
      "Starting at 7 a.m. local time on Monday, Palestinians were allowed to cross on foot without inspection through part of the so-called Netzarim corridor, a military zone bisecting the territory just south of Gaza City that Israel carved out early in the war. A checkpoint for vehicles was to open later with an inspection mechanism, the details of which weren't immediately known.",
      "Palestinians who've been sheltering in squalid tent camps and schools-turned-shelters for over a year are eager to return to their homes \u2014 even knowing that they have likely been damaged or destroyed. Many had feared Israel would make their exodus permanent, and expressed similar concerns about an idea floated by President Trump to resettle large numbers of Palestinians in Egypt and Jordan.",
      "\"We want to go see my mother and father,\" said Ahmad Adas. \"It's been a long time.\"",
      "\"I've been waiting for three days to go to my parents. We are tired, I want to go to Gaza (City), we're not coming back here,\" added Mohammed Adas. They'd both spent several days with thousands of others on the southern side of the Israeli checkpoint, waiting to cross before the dispute between Israel and Hamas was resolved.",
      "Ismail Abu Matter, a father of four who had waited for three days before crossing with his family, described scenes of jubilation on the other side, with people singing, praying and crying as they were reunited with relatives.",
      "\"It's the joy of return,\" said Abu Matter, whose family was among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. \"We had thought we wouldn't return, like our ancestors.\"",
      "Hamas called the return \"a victory for our people, and a declaration of failure and defeat for the (Israeli) occupation and transfer plans.\"",
      "The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas and securing the release of dozens of hostages captured in the militants' Oct. 7, 2023 attack, which triggered the fighting.",
      "Israel ordered the wholescale evacuation of the north in the opening days of the war and sealed it off shortly after ground troops moved in. Around a million people fled to the south in October 2023, while hundreds of thousands remained in the north, which had some of the heaviest fighting and worst destruction of the war.",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israel would continue to enforce the ceasefire and that anyone violating it or threatening Israeli forces \"will bear the full cost.\"",
      "\"We will not allow a return to the reality of Oct. 7,\" he wrote on the platform X.",
      "Israel had delayed the opening of the crossing, which was supposed to happen over the weekend, saying it wouldn't allow Palestinians north until a female civilian hostage, Arbel Yehoud, was released. It also accused Hamas of failing to provide information on whether the remaining hostages set to be freed in the first phase are alive or dead.",
      "Hamas in turn accused Israel of violating the agreement by not opening the crossing.",
      "Hamas provides info on hostages to be released in 1st phase of ceasefire",
      "The Gulf nation of Qatar, a key mediator with Hamas, announced early Monday that an agreement had been reached to release Yehoud along with two other hostages before Friday.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that the hostage release \u2014 which will include female soldier Agam Berger \u2014 will take place on Thursday. That release will be in addition to the one already set for next Saturday, when three more hostages should be released.",
      "Hamas also handed over a list of required information about all the hostages set to be released during the ceasefire's six-week first phase. Israeli government spokesman David Mencer told journalists the list received overnight from Hamas showed that eight of the 33 hostages to be released during the first phase are dead, meaning 25 are still alive.",
      "The families have been informed, Mencer said.",
      "During the first phase of the ceasefire, which runs until early March, Hamas has agreed to free a total of 33 hostages in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The militants have released seven hostages, including four female soldiers early Saturday, in the current ceasefire, in exchange for more than 300 prisoners, including many serving life sentences for deadly attacks on Israelis.",
      "Israeli officials say 87 of the 251 hostages abducted by Hamas during the group's bloody Oct. 7, 2023 attack remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 34 who have been confirmed dead by the Israeli military.",
      "The second, and far more difficult phase of the agreement hasn't been negotiated yet. Hamas says it won't release the remaining 60 or so hostages unless Israel ends the war, while Netanyahu says he's still committed to destroying the militant group and ending its nearly 18-year rule over Gaza.",
      "As CBS News' Ramy Inocencio reported Monday, several Israeli media outlets were saying President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, was to visit Israel this week. The goal is to keep the ceasefire on track and get to the second phase, when older Israeli men and younger male soldiers will hopefully be freed. There are three American dual nationals included among that group.",
      "Hamas started the war when thousands of its fighters stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Around 90 hostages are still inside Gaza, and Israel believes around a third are dead.",
      "Israel's air and ground war has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry. It doesn't say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "Israeli bombardment and ground operations have displaced around 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million people, often multiple times, and flattened entire neighborhoods.",
      "Ceasefire holds after clashes over Israel's Lebanon withdrawal",
      "Separately, Israeli forces in southern Lebanon\u00a0opened fire Sunday on protesters\u00a0demanding their withdrawal in line with\u00a0a ceasefire agreement in Israel's linked, parallel conflict with the Iran-backed group Hezbollah. At least 22 people were killed and 124 others injured in the clashes, Lebanese health officials reported.",
      "Hours later, the White House said Israel and Lebanon had agreed to extend the deadline for Israeli troops to depart southern Lebanon to Feb. 18, after Israel requested more time to withdraw beyond the 60-day deadline stipulated in the ceasefire agreement that halted the Israel-Hezbollah war in late November.",
      "Israel has said it needs to stay longer because the Lebanese army hasn't deployed to all areas of southern Lebanon to ensure that Hezbollah doesn't reestablish its presence in the area. The Lebanese army has said it can't deploy until Israeli forces withdraw.",

      "The Japanese network Fuji Television and its parent company said Monday that its president and chairperson were resigning immediately to take responsibility for a widening sex assault scandal linked to one of Japan's top TV celebrities.",
      "The scandal centers on Masahiro Nakai, a former leader of Japan's once-hugely popular boy band SMAP, and his costly settlement with a woman over the alleged sex assault at a 2023 dinner party that Fuji TV staff allegedly helped to organize.",
      "The allegations surfaced in magazine articles in December and have since triggered claims of systematic cover-ups by Fuji TV executives. The public outrage over the lack of transparency and explanation at the network's news conference earlier this month have led to an avalanche of advertising losses at Fuji, one of the networks where Nakai worked.",
      "Fuji Television Network President Koichi Minato said his company mishandled the case.",
      "\"We are very sorry that we mishandled the case because of our lack of awareness about human rights and corporate governance ... and as a result our responses to the involved woman were inadequate,\" Minato said. \"We are very sorry to have destroyed our credibility.\"",
      "Car manufacturers Nissan and Toyota were among the companies that pulled advertising from Fuji TV, BBC News reported.",
      "Minato said the case violated the woman's human rights, without providing details on grounds of privacy. He said it was handled as an \"extraordinary\" case requiring maximum confidentiality and sensitivity for the woman's mental health and was shared by a small group of officials. The company had continued allowing Nakai to appear on Fuji shows for a year and six months, he said, but denied covering up the case because it involved a big star.",
      "Minato said he did not think what happened was sexual assault and that the case was not reported to the company's compliance office until the magazine report came out.",
      "He also denied a Fuji TV employee's involvement but said allegations that the employee had previously organized barbecue and other parties for Nakai needed to be investigated.",
      "Fuji officials also acknowledged that female announcers and other female employees have in the past participated at parties for stars, talent agency executives and sponsors, though they denied any sexual services. Minato said he believed top officials were complacent about the outdated gender roles and they now need to \"update their mindset.\"",
      "Nakai last Thursday announced his retirement from show business\u00a0in Japan, which has already been hit by a series of sexual assault allegations in recent years in what is seen as a delayed #MeToo movement that began in Western nations in the 2010s. He said he was taking responsibility for the \"trouble\" and massive business losses as a result.",
      "\"I alone am responsible for everything\" and \"sincerely apologize,\" Nakai said.",
      "He had previously issued a statement saying some of what had been reported was \"different from the facts.\"",
      "Minato said he last saw the woman last summer when she visited his office to tell him she was quitting.",
      "Shukan Bunshun weekly, one of the magazines that exposed the scandal, also alleged that Fuji TV has long exploited its female announcers to entertain stars like Nakai.",
      "The chair of the companies, Shuji Kanoh, was also resigning in a decision made at a board meeting prior to the Jan. 17 news conference, officials said.",
      "Japan's entertainment industry is in the midst of a wave of sexual assault cases, including the abuses of hundreds of boys and young men by late talent mogul Johnny Kitagawa, whose now-defunct agency Johnny & Associates managed many boy bands, including the one to which Nakai belonged.",
      "One of Japan's most popular comedians, 61-year-old Hitoshi Matsumoto, has also been accused of sexual assault by two women.",

      "Doral, Florida \u2014\u00a0President Trump's push to have Egypt and Jordan take in large numbers of Palestinian refugees from besieged Gaza fell flat with those countries' governments and left a key congressional ally in Washington perplexed on Sunday.",
      "Fighting that broke out in the territory after ruling Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023 is paused due to a fragile ceasefire, but most of Gaza's population has been left homeless by the Israeli military campaign. Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday aboard Air Force One that moving some 1.5 million people away from Gaza might mean that \"we just clean out that whole thing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump relayed what he told Jordan's King Abdullah when the two held a call earlier Saturday: \"I said to him, 'I'd love for you to take on more because I'm looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it's a mess.'\"",
      "He said he was making a similar appeal to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi during a conversation they were having while Trump was at his Doral resort in Florida on Sunday. Mr. Trump said he would \"like Egypt to take people and I'd like Jordan to take people.\"",
      "Hamas, Egypt and Jordan reject Trump's Gaza suggestion",
      "Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians were allowed by Israeli forces on Monday to start returning to their towns and villages in the decimated northern half of Gaza, sparking a mass migration seen as a powerful repudiation of the concept of any mass-deportation from Gaza.",
      "In a statement posted online Monday, spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou of the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group Hamas, which has ruled over Gaza for almost two decades, said the scenes of people returning in vast numbers to the north \"represent another failure of the occupation in achieving the goals of the war of extermination and destruction, and a message of defiance to any new attempt to displace them.\"",
      "\"The steadfastness of our people on their land and their return from the south of the Gaza Strip to its north represents the end of the Zionist dream of displacing them and liquidating their just cause,\" said al-Qanou.",
      "Egypt and Jordan, along with the Palestinians, worry that Israel would never allow the Palestinians to return to Gaza if they are made to leave. Both Egypt and Jordan also have perpetually struggling economies and their governments, as well as those of other Arab states, fear massive destabilization of their own countries and the region from any such influx of refugees.",
      "Jordan already is home to more than 2 million Palestinian refugees. Egypt has warned of the security implications of transferring large numbers of Palestinians to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, bordering Gaza.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested that resettling most of Gaza's population of 2.3 million could be temporary or long term.",
      "Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said Sunday that his country's opposition to what Trump floated was \"firm and unwavering.\"",
      "Some Israel officials had raised the idea early in the war.",
      "Egypt's foreign minister issued a statement saying that the temporary or long-term transfer of Palestinians \"risks expanding the conflict in the region.\"",
      "In the statement, the ministry reaffirmed \"Egypt's commitment to the principles and parameters of a political solution to the Palestinian issue, stressing that it remains the central issue in the Middle East. The delay in resolving it, ending the occupation, and restoring the stolen rights of the Palestinian people is the root cause of instability in the region.",
      "\"In this context, Egypt reiterates its continued support for the steadfastness of the Palestinian people on their land and their adherence to their legitimate rights in their land and homeland, as well as to the principles of international law and international humanitarian law. It also emphasizes its rejection of any infringement upon those inalienable rights, whether through settlement activities, annexation of land, or the eviction of the rightful owners through displacement or encouraging the transfer or uprooting of Palestinians from their land, whether temporarily or permanently.\"",
      "Mr. Trump does have some leverage over Jordan, which is a debt-strapped, but strategically important U.S. ally and is heavily dependent on foreign aid. The U.S. is historically the single-largest provider of that aid, including more than $1.6 billion through the State Department in 2023. Much of that comes as support for Jordan's security forces and direct budget support.",
      "Jordan in return has been a vital regional partner to the U.S. in trying to help keep the region stable. Jordan hosts some 3,000 U.S. troops. Yet, on Friday, new Secretary of State Marco Rubio exempted security assistance to Israel and Egypt, but not to Jordan when he laid out the details of a freeze on foreign assistance that Mr. Trump ordered on his first day in office.",
      "European officials react to Trump's suggestion",
      "Germany's government also rejected the idea of a mass-displacement of Palestinians on Monday, with a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry telling reporters in Berlin that the country shared the view of \"the European Union, our Arab partners, the United Nations... that the Palestinian population must not be expelled from Gaza and Gaza must not be permanently occupied or recolonized by Israel.\"",
      "In Italy, right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who attended Mr. Trump's inauguration and has sought to position herself as an interlocutor between the new U.S. administration and Europe, tried to downplay the president's Gaza suggestion.",
      "\"Trump is right when he says that the reconstruction of Gaza is obviously one of the main challenges we face, and that to succeed, however, a great deal of involvement from the international community is needed,\" she told reporters during a visit to Saudi Arabia. \"As for the issue of refugees, I don't think, here again, that we are faced with a defined plan [from Mr. Trump]. I think we are rather faced with discussions with regional actors, who certainly need to be involved in this.\"",
      "ga\"These are certainly very complex matters, but the fact that they are being discussed, even at an informal level with the actors in the region, in my opinion means that we want to work seriously on the issue of the reconstruction of Gaza,\" the Italian leader said.",
      "\"I don't know what he's talking about,\" says Sen. Lindsey Graham",
      "Meanwhile, in the U.S., even some Republicans loyal to Mr. Trump were left trying to make sense of his words.",
      "\"I really don't know,'' said Sen. Lindsey Graham, when asked on CNN's \"State of the Union\" about what the president meant by the \"clean out\" remark. Graham, who is close to Mr. Trump, said the suggestion was not feasible.",
      "\"The idea that all the Palestinians are going to leave and go somewhere else, I don't see that to be overly practical,\" said Graham, a veteran GOP senator from South Carolina. He said Mr. Trump should keep talking to Mideast leaders, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and officials in the United Arab Emirates.",
      "\"I don't know what he's talking about. But go talk to MBS, go talk to UAE, go talk to Egypt,\" Graham said. \"What is their plan for the Palestinians? Do they want them all to leave?\"",
      "Trump drops hold on 2,000-pound bomb shipment to Israel",
      "Mr. Trump, a staunch supporter of Israel, also announced Saturday that he had directed the U.S. to release a supply of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel. Former President Joe Biden had imposed a hold on the specific weapons due to concerns about their effects on Gaza's civilian population.",
      "Egypt and Jordan have made peace with Israel but support the creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, territories that Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War. They fear that the permanent displacement of Gaza's population could make that so-called \"two-state solution\" impossible.",
      "Mr. Trump is also seen in the Middle East as being less supportive of an eventual two-state solution than previous U.S. administrations, and Israel's current government has all but ruled out the creation of an independent Palestinian state.",
      "In making his case for such a massive population shift, Mr. Trump said Gaza is \"literally a demolition site right now.\"",
      "\"I'd rather get involved with some of the Arab nations, and build housing in a different location,\" he said of people displaced in Gaza. \"Where they can maybe live in peace for a change.\"",

      "Mr. Trump earlier on Sunday vowed swift and punishing retaliation after the Colombian government over the weekend blocked the arrival of deportation flights from the U.S., objecting to the Trump administration's efforts to use military planes to deport migrants.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on social media on Sunday that his administration would put in place several actions against Colombia, including a 25% tariff \u2014 that he said would be raised to 50% after one week \u2014 on all goods coming into the U.S. from Colombia.",
      "He also announced a travel ban and \"immediate visa revocation\" for Colombian government officials and \"their allies,\" visa sanctions on Colombian authorities and their relatives and enhanced customs inspections on travelers and cargo from Colombia.",
      "\"These measures are just the beginning,\" Mr. Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States!\"",
      "But late Sunday night, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"The Government of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump's terms, including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay. Based on this agreement, the fully drafted IEEPA tariffs and sanctions will be held in reserve, and not signed, unless Colombia fails to honor this agreement.\"",
      "\"The visa sanctions issued by the State Department, and enhanced inspections from Customs and Border Protection, will remain in effect until the first planeload of Colombian deportees is successfully returned,\" Leavitt's statement said.",
      "Colombia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement the country had \"overcome the impasse\" with the U.S., and said its foreign minister and ambassador would travel to Washington, D.C., \"in the next few hours\" to continue discussing the agreement.",
      "\"We will continue to receive Colombians who return as deportees, guaranteeing them dignified conditions, as citizens subject to rights,\" the Foreign Ministry said. The ministry's statement made no mention of U.S. military planes, but said Colombia's presidential plane would be used to return migrants who had been scheduled to be deported Sunday morning.",
      "A senior Trump administration official had earlier told CBS News the use of the presidential plane would not be enough to stave off Mr. Trump's proposed tariffs and sanctions.",
      "A senior administration official earlier Sunday said Mr. Trump's actions amounted to \"a clear message\" to countries that they \"have an obligation to accept repatriation flights.\"",
      "Prior to Sunday night's announced agreement, Colombian President Gustavo Petro said on social media \"Your blockade doesn't scare me,\" and said Colombia would respond to the raised tariffs with a 50% tariff of its own on U.S. goods. In reference to the travel ban, Petro said, \"I don't really like traveling to the U.S., it's a bit boring.\"",
      "Petro also predicted the U.S. could \"try to carry out a coup with your economic strength and your arrogance, like they did with Allende. ... Overthrow me, President, and the Americas and humanity will respond,\" Petro wrote.",
      "In a statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was Colombia's responsibility to take back citizens who are illegally in the U.S. \"in a serious and expeditious manner.\"",
      "\"Colombian President Petro had authorized flights and provided all needed authorizations and then canceled his authorization when the planes were in the air,\" Rubio said. \"As demonstrated by today's actions, we are unwavering in our commitment to end illegal immigration and bolster America's border security.\"",
      "Later Sunday, the State Department confirmed Rubio had \"ordered a suspension of visa issuance at the U.S. Embassy Bogota consular section.\"",
      "\"Secretary Rubio is now authorizing travel sanctions on individuals and their families, who were responsible for the interference of U.S. repatriation flight operations,\" the State Department said. \"Measures will continue until Colombia meets its obligations to accept the return of its own citizens. America will not back down when it comes to defending its national security interests.\"",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News that U.S. Customs and Border Protection was already implementing a travel ban on Colombian government officials and diplomats traveling with what are known as A and G visas as of Sunday night. The agency had also started enhanced customs inspections on cargo from Colombia, the official added. CBP later confirmed those actions in a public statement.",

      "Two U.S. officials told CBS News there were two Department of Defense planes with migrant deportees expected to land in Colombia on Sunday, after departing the San Diego area near the southern border. But those plans were scrapped overnight.",
      "One of the U.S. officials said the plan was to deport roughly 80 Colombian migrants on each military plane.",
      "Colombia's decision to block the U.S. deportation flights over the weekend was an early diplomatic setback for the Trump administration as it lays the foundation for its promised mass deportation campaign and crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "As part of that crackdown, President Trump has moved to vastly increase the role the U.S. military plays in immigration enforcement, declaring a national emergency to deploy an additional 1,500 Army soldiers and Marines to the southern border. The troops have been assigned to erect border barriers and help Customs and Border Protection in an operational capacity. Long-standing legal limits bar the use of soldiers for the civil enforcement of laws, including U.S. immigration law.",

      "The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic most likely originated from a laboratory, according to an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even while acknowledging that the spy agency has \"low confidence\" in its own conclusion.",
      "The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of President Trump's pick to lead the agency, John Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director.",
      "\"CIA assesses with low confidence that a research-related origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely than a natural origin based on the available body of reporting. CIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,\" a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement, noting they \"will continue to evaluate any available credible new intelligence reporting or open-source information that could change CIA's assessment.\"",
      "Jake Sullivan, the Biden administration national security adviser, ordered a classified review in December of U.S. intelligence that had been gathered on the origins of COVID-19, one current and one former U.S. official confirmed to CBS News. Sullivan convened a panel of outside experts to assess the intelligence and asked the intelligence community to review its data and form a conclusion. Both officials told CBS News there was no new \"smoking gun,\" but rather a low-confidence assessment based on the same data. Burns ordered the review before leaving the CIA, citing high policymaker interest.",
      "The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the agency's assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory.",
      "Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities.",
      "Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China's virology labs.",
      "China said Monday it disagreed with the assessment.",
      "\"The conclusion that a laboratory leak is extremely unlikely was reached by the China-WHO joint expert team based on field visits to relevant laboratories in Wuhan,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said. \"This has been widely recognized by the international community and the scientific community.\"",
      "U.S. lawmakers have pressured America's spy agencies for more information about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths. It's a question with significant domestic and geopolitical implications as the world continues to grapple with the pandemic's legacy.",
      "Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Saturday he was \"pleased the CIA concluded in the final days of the Biden administration that the lab-leak theory is the most plausible explanation\" and he commended Ratcliffe for declassifying the assessment.",
      "\"Now, the most important thing is to make China pay for unleashing a plague on the world,\" Cotton said in a statement.",
      "Chinese authorities have dismissed speculation about COVID's origins as unhelpful and motivated by politics. On Saturday, a spokesperson for China's U.S. embassy said the CIA report has no credibility.",
      "\"We firmly oppose the politicization and stigmatization of the source of the virus, and once again call on everyone to respect science and stay away from conspiracy theories,\" embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press.",
      "While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably raccoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "Some official investigations, however, have raised the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago a report by the Energy Department concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the finding.",

      "Lukashenko's opponents, many of whom are imprisoned or exiled abroad by his unrelenting crackdown on dissent and free speech, have called Sunday's election a sham. The last election in 2020 triggered months of mass protests unprecedented in Belarusian history.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration is developing an asylum agreement with El Salvador's government that would allow the U.S. to deport migrants to the small Central American country who are not from there, two sources familiar with the internal deliberations told CBS News.",
      "The arrangement, known as a \"Safe Third Country\" agreement, would empower U.S. immigration officials to deport non-Salvadoran migrants to El Salvador, blocking them from requesting asylum in the U.S. Instead, the migrants would be deported with instructions to seek asylum in El Salvador, which would be designated a \"safe third country.\"",
      "The plan, if finalized, would revive an agreement the first Trump administration brokered with El Salvador's government, though that accord was never implemented and was eventually terminated by former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "A safe third country agreement could be a significant breakthrough for the Trump administration's aggressive immigration plans, allowing it to deport migrants from different countries, including Venezuela, that limit or outright reject U.S. deportations of their citizens.",
      "One of the internal plans under consideration would allow the U.S. to send deportation flights to El Salvador that include suspected members of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang that President Trump has made a focal point of his crackdown on illegal immigration. Hours after his inauguration, Mr. Trump directed officials to start the process of designating Tren de Aragua a terrorist group.",
      "If that plan is implemented, it's unclear how El Salvador would handle the deported gang members. Under President Nayib Bukele, the Salvadoran government has subdued El Salvador's notorious gangs, including MS-13, through a mass incarceration campaign.",
      "Bukele's government is expected to be a key ally of the Trump administration. Bukele enjoys broad popularity in El Salvador, and among U.S. conservatives, mainly due to his anti-gang policies, which international groups say have involved due process violations.",
      "The White House said Mr. Trump and Bukele spoke over the phone on Thursday and discussed \"working together to stop illegal immigration and crack down on transnational gangs like Tren de Aragua.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has vowed to make curbing mass migration a top priority, is also scheduled to visit El Salvador in early February as part of a trip to Latin America set to start later this week.",
      "Representatives for the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Mr Trump has already moved swiftly to start his sweeping immigration crackdown, giving deportation officers broader authorities to arrest and deport unauthorized immigrants, shutting down access to the asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border and enlisting the vast resources of the American military for immigration enforcement through an emergency declaration.",
      "Military planes are now being used to deport migrants crossing the southern border illegally, and additional active-duty troops have been deployed there to erect barriers designed to repel unlawful crossings. Longstanding federal law generally prohibits the military from engaging in civilian law enforcement.",
      "A safe third country agreement would add yet another layer to Mr. Trump's efforts to seal off U.S. borders to migrants and asylum-seekers, through both physical barriers and far-reaching policy changes.",
      "It's unclear how such an arrangement would interact with Mr. Trump's other moves on asylum, including giving border agents the authority to rapidly deport migrants without allowing them to request legal refuge. His administration is also reinstating a rule, known as Remain-in-Mexico, that requires asylum claimants to stay outside of the U.S. while their cases are reviewed.",
      "Currently, the U.S. has one safe third country agreement. Under that arrangement, the U.S. and Canadian governments exchange asylum claimants crossing their shared border. The first Trump administration forged asylum deals with Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Only the one with Guatemala ever took effect, and all three accords were suspended once Biden took office.",

    "story": [
      "South Korean prosecutors on Sunday indicted impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on rebellion in connection with his short-lived imposition of martial law, news reports said, a criminal charge that could put him to death or jail for life if convicted.",
      "This is the latest blow to Yoon, who was impeached and arrested over his Dec. 3 martial law decree that plunged the country into huge political turmoil, shaking South Korean politics  and financial markets as well as the country's international image. Separate from criminal judicial proceedings, the Constitutional Court is now deliberating whether to formally dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him.",
      "South Korean media outlets, including Yonhap news agency, reported that the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office indicted Yoon over rebellion. Calls to the prosecutors' office and Yoon's lawyers went unanswered.",
      "Yoon, a conservative, has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing, calling his martial law a legitimate act of governance meant to raise public awareness of the danger of the liberal-controlled National Assembly which obstructed his agenda and impeached top officials. During his announcement of martial law, Yoon called the assembly \"a den of criminals\" and vowed to eliminate \"shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.\"",
      "After declaring martial law on Dec. 3, Yoon sent troops and police officers to the assembly, but enough lawmakers still managed to enter an assembly chamber to vote down Yoon's decree unanimously, forcing his Cabinet to lift it.",
      "The martial law imposition, the first of its kind in South Korea in more than 40 years, lasted only six hours. However, it evoked painful memories of past dictatorial rules in the 1960s-80s when military-backed rulers used martial laws and emergency decrees to suppress opponents.",
      "South Korea's constitution gives the president the power to declare martial law to keep order in wartime and other comparable emergency states, but many experts say the country wasn't under such conditions when Yoon declared martial law.",
      "Yoon insists he had no intentions of disrupting assembly work including its floor vote on his decree and that the dispatch of troops and police forces was meant to maintain order. But commanders of military units sent to the assembly have told assembly hearings or investigators that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers.",
      "Investigations on Yoon have intensified the country's already serious internal division, with rival protesters regularly staging rallies in downtown Seoul.",
      "After a local court on Jan. 19 approved a formal arrest warrant to extend Yoon's detainment, dozens of his supporters stormed the court building, destroying windows, doors and other property. They also attacked police officers with bricks, steel pipes and other objects. The violence left 17 police officers injured, and police said they detained 46 protesters.",
      "Yoon earlier resisted efforts by investigative authorities to question or detain him. He then was apprehended on Jan. 15 in a massive law enforcement operation at his presidential compound.",
      "Leading Yoon's investigation was the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, but since his detainment Yoon has refused to attend CIO's questioning, saying it has no legal authority to investigate rebellion allegations. The CIO has said it can investigate Yoon's rebellion allegation as it's related to his abuse of power and other allegations.",
      "Yoon has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but the privilege does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "The CIO handed over Yoon's case to the Seoul prosecutors' office Friday and asked it to indict him on rebellion, abuse of power and obstruction of the National Assembly. By law in South Korea, the leader of a rebellion can face life in prison or the death penalty.",
      "In a statement Saturday, Yoon's defense team urged prosecutors to immediately release Yoon and launch an investigation on the CIO.",

      "Jannik Sinner\u00a0claimed his second consecutive\u00a0Australian Open\u00a0championship on Sunday, never facing a single break point and using his complete game to outplay and frustrate\u00a0Alexander Zverev\u00a0for a 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory in the final.",
      "Sinner, a 23-year-old Italian, is the youngest man to leave Melbourne Park with the trophy two years in a row since Jim Courier in 1992-93.",
      "Sinner rose to No. 1 last June, remaining there every week since, and the gap between him and No. 2-ranked Zverev was pronounced as can be in Rod Laver Arena. This was the first Australian Open final between the men at No. 1 and No. 2 since 2019, when\u00a0No. 1 Novak Djokovic defeated No. 2 Rafael Nadal\u00a0\u2014 also in straight sets.",
      "Here's how dominant Sinner has been since the start of last season: He has won three of the five major tournaments, including the U.S. Open in September, and his record in that span is 80-6 with a total of nine tournament titles. His current unbeaten run covers 21 matches, dating to last year.",
      "The only thing that's clouded the past 12 months for Sinner, it seems, is a doping case in which he was cleared by a ruling that the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed. He tested positive for a trace amount of an anabolic steroid twice last March but blamed it on an accidental exposure involving two members of his team who have since been fired. Sinner was initially exonerated in August; a hearing in the WADA appeal is scheduled for April.",
      "While Sinner became the eighth man in the Open era (which began in 1968) to start his career 3-0 in Grand Slam finals, Zverev is the seventh to be 0-3, adding this loss to those at the 2020 U.S. Open and the 2024 French Open.",
      "Those earlier setbacks both came in five sets. This contest was not that close. Not at all.",
      "There truly was only one moment that felt as if it contained a hint of tension. It was late in the second set, which Zverev was two points from owning when he led 5-4 and got to love-30 on Sinner's serve. But a break point \u2014 and a set point \u2014 never arrived there.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday the U.S. has not stopped military aid to Ukraine after newly sworn-in U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he would pause foreign aid grants for 90 days.",
      "Zelenskyy did not clarify whether humanitarian aid had been paused. Ukraine relies on the U.S. for 40% of its military needs.",
      "\"I am focused on military aid; it has not been stopped, thank God,\" he said at a press conference with Moldovan President Maia Sandu.",
      "The two leaders met in Kyiv on Saturday to discuss the energy needs of Moldova's Russian-occupied Transnistria region, which saw its natural gas supplies halted on Jan. 1 due to Ukraine's decision to stop Russian gas transit. Ukraine has said it can offer coal to the Transnistrian authorities to make up for the shortfall.",
      "The future of U.S. aid to Ukraine remains uncertain as President Trump begins his second term in office. The American leader has repeatedly said he wouldn't have allowed Russia's invasion of Ukraine to start if he had been in office, although he was president as fighting grew in the east of the country between Kyiv's forces and separatists aligned with Moscow, ahead of Putin sending in tens of thousands of troops in 2022.",
      "On Thursday, Mr. Trump told Fox News that Zelenskyy should have made a deal with Putin to avoid the conflict. A day earlier, Trump also threatened to impose stiff tariffs and sanctions on Russia if an agreement isn't reached to end the fighting in Ukraine.",

      "The order, which was obtained by CBS News, said that across the U.S. government, \"it is currently impossible to access sufficient information in one place to determine whether the foreign assistance policies and interests supported by appropriations are not duplicated, are effective, and are consistent with President Trump's foreign policy.\"",
      "Speaking in Kyiv on Saturday, Zelenskyy said he had enjoyed \"good meetings and conversations with President Trump\" and that he believed the U.S. leader would succeed in his desire to end the war.",

      "For the past year, Russian forces have been waging an intense campaign to punch holes in Ukraine's defenses in the Donetsk region and weaken Kyiv's grip on the eastern parts of the country. The sustained and costly offensive has compelled Kyiv to give up a series of towns, villages and hamlets.",

      "Viruses by the numbers",

      "Citing four sources who spoke on condition of anonymity about a purported internal call with ICE officials on Saturday, The Washington Post first reported about the new objective, categorizing the 1,200 to 1,500 daily targets as \"quotas.\"",
      "During the call, each ICE field office was told to aim for 75 arrests per day and that management would be held responsible if the quotas were not reached, they said.\u00a0The Post also reported that current and former ICE officials said that they are concerned that the quotas make it more likely that agents will \"engage in more indiscriminate enforcement tactics or face accusations of civil rights violations.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reportedly told the Post via an email that, \"your story is false,\" but did not elaborate. When asked about the report, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) clarified, telling Fox News Digital, \"Goals is the correct phrasing.\"",

      "Fox News Digital also reached out to Leavitt and ICE regarding the report.",
      "Later in its report, the Washington Post cited another unnamed ICE official who reportedly said that the agency already has a long list of criminal suspects, so agents could continue to target public safety and national security threats to reach the quotas.",
      "Last week, acting DHS Secretary Benjamine Huffman rescinded a directive that had prevented ICE from carrying out immigration enforcement at sensitive locations such as churches, schools and doctor\u2019s offices. Huffman said the reversal ensured criminals, including murderers and rapists, cannot use those areas to hide. Trump\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan, further defended the decision on Sunday, explaining that many MS-13 gang members are often around age 14 and ICE agents are well-trained and should have the discretion to weed out public safety and national security threats.",

      "\"The aperture right now is constrained to public safety threats, national security threats as a smaller population,\" Homan said. \"We're going to do the same priority base as President Trump's promise. But as that aperture opens, there'll be more arrests nationwide.\"",
      "In sanctuary cities, Homan said, ICE is locked out of jails. That means instead of being able to safely apprehend targets already in custody before they are released back onto the streets, ICE agents must conduct enforcement operations in the community, increasing the risk of collateral arrests of illegal immigrants not charged with violent offenses but who law enforcement find associating with criminal illegal immigrants and take into custody as well.",

      "While nearly two dozen states are suing to stop President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants, some legal experts, such as Hans von Spakovsky with the Heritage Foundation, say the order is perfectly legal under the 14th Amendment and should be upheld by the courts.",
      "\"I strongly believe that Donald Trump is correct, that we need to enforce the 14th Amendment as it was originally intended,\" Spakovsky told Fox News Digital. \"No doubt there will be lawsuits against it, it'll get to the U.S. Supreme Court, and if the court follows the actual legislative intent and history, they will uphold what Donald Trump has done.\"",
      "As Trump has moved quickly to clamp down on illegal immigration, his most controversial move yet was to issue an executive order ending birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants.",
      "The order titled the \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship\" states that \"the privilege of United States citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the United States\" when that person\u2019s parents are either unlawfully present in the U.S. or when the parents\u2019 presence is lawful but temporary.",

      "However, Spakovsky, who is a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation and an authority on civil rights and immigration, told Fox News Digital that the 14th Amendment was never meant to include the children of individuals in the country illegally or temporarily and that this broad interpretation has led to widespread \"birth tourism\" and abuse.",

All those who push birthright citizenship just point to that first phrase and ignore the second,\" he said. \"I've done a lot of research on this. I've looked at the original passage of the 14th Amendment and what that phrase meant subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.

So, they are not citizens of the U.S.,\" he said.",

      "With so much of our lives having moved online, identity thieves are having an easier time than ever. Your most important accounts \u2013 banking, credit, Social Security \u2013 are all digital. Thieves don\u2019t need to know much about you to steal your identity, just a few pieces of personal information can be enough. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics,\u00a024 million Americans reported identity theft in the past 12 months. In their lifetime,\u00a01 in 3 Americans (more than 110 million people) have experienced identity theft. Here\u2019s the part many people don\u2019t realize: You might have already been a target. Maybe your identity was stolen, and the thieves failed, or maybe your good online habits saved you without you even knowing, which brings us to the next lesson: prevention.",

      "You don\u2019t need to spend a fortune to guard against identity theft. While professional services can be helpful, most of what you need comes down to better habits and awareness. Here are some simple steps you can take today:",
      "1) Check your accounts regularly:\u00a0Review your bank, credit card and Social Security accounts for transactions you didn\u2019t make,\u00a0failed login attempts and password reset requests you didn\u2019t initiate.",
      "2) Keep an eye on your mail:\u00a0Look for letters regarding accounts you didn\u2019t open, notices of data breaches and transaction summaries that don\u2019t match your records.",
      "3) Monitor your email inbox:\u00a0Be alert for password reset emails you didn\u2019t request, confirmation of new accounts you didn\u2019t open, receipts for purchases you didn\u2019t make.",
      "4) Use two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a02FA adds extra layers of security to your accounts. Even if a thief has your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without a second step, like a code sent via text message or app-based verification. While logging in might take an extra moment, it\u2019s worth it; 2FA dramatically increases account security.",
      "5) Check your credit report annually: Visit AnnualCreditReport.com to get your free credit report once a year. Use it to spot suspicious activity early. If you see something unusual, take action right away.",
      "6) Use strong passwords: Use complex passwords and a\u00a0password manager to secure your online accounts. Strong passwords are your first line of defense against cyber threats.",
      "7) Stop oversharing: Limit the personal information you share on social media and other platforms. It\u2019s a treasure trove for cybercriminals who use it to craft convincing fraud campaigns targeted specifically at you.",

      "1) Contact the affected institution: Contact the company immediately if you notice something unusual, like a suspicious charge or an unfamiliar account. They\u2019ll guide you through securing your account.",
      "2) Change your passwords: Update the password for the affected account and any others using the same credentials. Use strong, unique passwords for each account to avoid further risks.",
      "3) Report the theft to the FTC: Visit\u00a0IdentityTheft.gov to report identity theft and get personalized recovery steps.",
      "4) Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "Credit card fraud can happen in several ways, often without you even realizing it. One common method is when fraudsters get hold of your card information through\u00a0data breaches at online stores or banks, which means your details get leaked without your knowledge.",
      "Another sneaky tactic is\u00a0phishing, where scammers trick you into giving away your card info by posing as legitimate companies via emails or fake websites.",
      "There\u2019s also the risk of \"card skimming,\" where devices at ATMs or gas stations secretly capture your card details when you swipe it. In some cases, fraudsters might also exploit weak security on\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks or compromised apps to access your information while you\u2019re shopping online.",

      "OUTSMART THE SCAMMERS: HOW THE SNEAKY CEO APPLE GIFT CARD SCAM ALMOST GOT ME",
      "Credit card fraud is way too common",
      "A report from Security.org reveals that\u00a052 million Americans experienced credit card fraud in 2023, a figure even higher than the\u00a0one reported by the FTC. With four out of five American adults owning at least one credit card, the report found that three in five cardholders have faced unauthorized charges \u2014 an estimated 128 million victims. Even more concerning, 75% of these victims reported having their credit card information stolen more than once.",
      "The typical unauthorized transaction is around $100, which adds up to approximately $5 billion in criminal purchases each year. Interestingly, most unauthorized transactions involve credit cards that weren\u2019t physically lost or stolen, highlighting the growing risks of online fraud and data breaches.",

      "The need for identity theft protection",
      "Data breaches are one of the main ways credit card fraud happens. Hackers often get unauthorized access to sensitive information stored by businesses or institutions. When a retailer, financial institution or online store experiences a data breach, the hackers usually go after the payment systems where customer credit card details are kept.",
      "If these systems aren\u2019t properly secured, hackers can grab things like credit card numbers, expiration dates and sometimes even security codes. Once they have that info, they can either use it themselves or sell it to others.",
      "But it\u2019s not just credit card information at risk.\u00a0Data breaches can also expose personal details like names, email addresses and phone numbers. Scammers can then use this stolen info to launch phishing attacks, pretending to be trusted companies and tricking you into giving away more sensitive information.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "This is why identity theft monitoring is so important. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of some identity theft protection services is that they have identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees\u00a0and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "10 ways to protect yourself from credit card fraud",
      "1. Notify your credit card issuer immediately: If you notice fraudulent charges on your credit card, start by calling the number on the back of your credit card. From there, you should get more detailed information on what to do next.",
      "2. Monitor your statements regularly: One of the best ways to catch credit card fraud early is to keep an eye on your statements. Review your transactions regularly to spot any unfamiliar charges. The sooner you notice something suspicious, the quicker you can report it to your credit card company and prevent further damage.",
      "3. Regularly check your credit report: In addition to monitoring your credit card statements, periodically review your credit report to catch any unauthorized accounts opened in your name.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords: Always use strong, unique passwords for your online accounts, especially those that store payment details. Avoid using easily guessable information, and consider using a\u00a0password manager to store and generate secure passwords. This reduces the chances of fraudsters accessing your accounts.",
      "5. Use credit card alerts:\u00a0Set up transaction alerts with your credit card company. This way, you\u2019ll receive a notification via email or text for every transaction made with your card. If you receive an alert for a purchase you didn\u2019t make, you can take immediate action to report it and prevent further charges.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Be Cautious with public Wi-Fi:\u00a0Avoid making purchases or entering sensitive information when connected to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks because they\u2019re often not secure. If you need to make an online purchase while on the go, consider using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to encrypt your connection and keep your credit card details safe from hackers.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Don't store credit card info on browsers and websites:\u00a0Storing your credit card information on browsers or websites can make it convenient, but it also exposes you to a higher risk of fraud. If your browser or the website\u2019s security gets compromised, hackers could gain access to your saved card details. To stay safe, avoid saving your credit card information and manually enter it each time you make a purchase. If a site offers to save your details for future use, think twice before accepting. It's better to take the extra step to enter your information each time, ensuring your data stays secure.",
      "8. Use EMV chip technology: When making in-person purchases, always use the chip reader instead of swiping your card. Chip technology provides an extra layer of security against fraud.",
      "9. Be wary of phishing attempts and have strong antivirus software: Be cautious of unsolicited emails, texts or phone calls asking for your credit card information. Legitimate companies typically don't request sensitive information through these channels. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "10. Keep your card in sight:\u00a0When using your card in restaurants or stores, try to keep it within view. This reduces the risk of someone copying your card details.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It's clear that credit card fraud is more prevalent than ever, affecting millions of Americans each year. The good news is that there are effective steps to protect yourself from becoming a victim. By staying vigilant and employing best practices \u2014 like monitoring your statements and using strong passwords \u2014 you can significantly reduce your risk.

      "It's easier than you think to check for tracking software on your device. Tech expert Kurt Knutsson offers you some tips to help stay secure.",
      "Nowadays, almost every app you download asks for location permissions, meaning it wants to track where you are and your movements. For an app like Google Maps, requesting location access makes perfect sense. It's also reasonable for apps like Uber or DoorDash, which rely on location for their services.",
      "However, many apps that have nothing to do with location still ask for it, and we often grant these permissions without thinking twice. When you give an app access to your location, that data is stored and, in some cases, might even be sold. According to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, this practice is not uncommon.",

The data was gathered through secretly embedded software in mobile apps, such as Life360.\u00a0\"Allstate and other insurers then used the covertly obtained data to justify raising Texans\u2019 insurance rates,\" the press release stated.",
      "The insurance provider allegedly collected trillions of miles' worth of location data from more than 45 million Americans nationwide. The data was reportedly used to build the \"world\u2019s largest driving behavior database.\" When customers sought a quote or renewed their coverage, Allstate and other insurance companies allegedly used the database to justify raising car insurance premiums.",

      "5 ways to stay safe from unwanted tracking",
      "1. Avoid installing the insurance company\u2019s app:\u00a0Many insurance companies encourage users to download their apps to \"simplify\" claims, payments or policy management. However, these apps often collect and track your location data under the guise of improving their services. If the app is not absolutely essential, manage your account through the company\u2019s website or contact customer service directly instead.",
      "2. Don\u2019t give location permissions unnecessarily:\u00a0When an app requests location access, ask yourself whether it genuinely needs this information to function. For example, a weather app may need approximate location data, but a flashlight app does not.\u00a0 Always choose \"Deny\" or \"Allow only while using the app\" unless absolutely necessary. Most modern devices also allow you to provide an approximate location rather than a precise one, which is a safer option when location access is unavoidable.",
      "3. Review and manage app permissions regularly:\u00a0Over time, you may forget which apps have been granted permissions. Regularly go through your device\u2019s app settings to check and adjust permissions. On most devices, you can access this under\u00a0settings >\u00a0privacy >\u00a0app permissions (specific steps vary by operating system). Revoke access for any apps that don\u2019t need it or seem suspicious.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Turn off location services when not in use:\u00a0Keep location services off when you don\u2019t need them. This reduces the chances of apps or devices tracking you passively in the background. For tasks like mapping or food delivery, turn location services on temporarily, then turn them off when you\u2019re done. For added security, avoid connecting to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks, which can also be used to track your location indirectly.",
      "5. Use privacy-focused tools and apps: Invest in tools designed to safeguard your privacy. Virtual private networks (VPNs) can mask your location online and prevent unwanted tracking while browsing.\u00a0 VPNs will also protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFS AS THE LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If Allstate is indeed unlawfully collecting and selling people\u2019s location data, Attorney General Paxton is right to hold them accountable by filing a lawsuit. In an era where cybercriminals exploit every opportunity to scam individuals, companies that fail to protect customer data are unacceptable and should face consequences. Data has become the new oil, and everyone seems eager to exploit it \u2014 often at the expense of ordinary people.

    "summary": "Here are five easy smartphone rules from the National Security Agency that you can follow to better protect your mobile device from hackers and scammers.",
    "story": [

      "Can\u2019t remember the last time you turned your phone off? Is Bluetooth always on? Do you plug into any charger you can find?",
      "Win a pair of $329 Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\u00a0Enter here, no purchase necessary!",
      "If you answered yes to any of these questions, the NSA says you\u2019re playing a crapshoot with your privacy. The National Security Agency\u2019s purpose is to listen and collect communications from satellites, cellphones and anywhere else, really.",
      "THESE MISTAKES COULD TANK YOUR CREDIT SCORE",
      "Let\u2019s take a deeper look at five smartphone rules they use that you can, too.",
      "1. Restart your phone once a week",
      "It\u2019s dead simple and absolutely worth doing. Turn off your phone, wait 10 seconds, then turn it back on. This works to combat zero-click exploits where a hacker can get in simply by sending you the right code.",
      "Heads up: A restart won\u2019t work for other types of malware. If your phone becomes infected,\u00a0you\u2019ll need to do a full factory reset.",
      "2. Disable Bluetooth when you don\u2019t need it",
      "Bluetooth works similarly to Wi-Fi and cellular networks but performs simpler tasks at shorter ranges. You don\u2019t need a cellular signal or network connection to use Bluetooth, and it doesn\u2019t use data. And like any other connection, it\u2019s not 100% safe.",
      "A driver is pictured holding an iced coffee and a mobile phone while in the car. (iStock)",
      "Hackers and scammers must be close to you to use Bluetooth to hijack your phone. But in just about any public space, you\u2019re arm\u2019s length from strangers.",
      "The NSA\u2019s advice: Turn off Bluetooth when you\u2019re not using it. It\u2019ll help battery life, too.",
      "On an iPhone, go to Settings > Bluetooth and switch it off. You can also swipe down from the top right of your screen to open the Control Center and tap the Bluetooth icon.The same steps work for Android phones. Go to Settings > Connected Devices > Connection Preferences > Bluetooth and switch it off. (Note: Steps may vary based on your phone\u2019s model. Look or search for Bluetooth if these steps don\u2019t match your phone.)",
      "On an iPhone, go to Settings > Bluetooth and switch it off. You can also swipe down from the top right of your screen to open the Control Center and tap the Bluetooth icon.",

      "Airplane mode also disables Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, among other things, so it works in a pinch \u2014 but you won\u2019t receive calls or texts.",
      "THE STEP I TAKE TO CLEAR MY INBOX EVERY JANUARY",
      "3. Skip public USB ports",
      "In spaces like the airport or coffee shop, hackers can use them to install malware or steal your data. Now, actual cases of juice jacking are rare in the U.S. but it\u2019s still a real threat. They happen through USB connections, so if a kiosk has actual power outlets to charge your phone using your own adapter, you\u2019re good to go.",
      "Stay away from USB ports of any size, especially when traveling overseas. USB standards are international, and foreign hackers can target USB ports in hotels or rentals to steal your data, even if you\u2019re not using a kiosk.",
      "More and more public kiosks have wireless charging pads instead of USBs. This method doesn\u2019t exchange data directly with your phone, so it\u2019s virus-free by default.",
      "If you\u2019re desperate for juice, you can use a USB connection safely \u2026 with the right cable. Pack a\u00a0charge-only cable for your trip. They\u2019re cheap and compact, and they don\u2019t allow for data transfers.",
      "A business person is seen working on a laptop. (iStock)",
      "4. Don\u2019t use public Wi-Fi",
      "It's a playground for snoopers. Public Wi-Fi is open to everyone, and every device is susceptible, whether it\u2019s your smartphone, laptop or tablet.",
      "Just because a public Wi-Fi network pops up and asks if you want to join doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s legitimate. If you\u2019re at a coffee shop or hotel, ask an employee for the specific name of their Wi-Fi network. Scammers will sometimes create networks called \"Coffee Shop\" or \"Hotel Guest\" to make you believe you\u2019re connecting to the real thing when, actually, you\u2019re not.",
      "Here\u2019s a good rule of thumb: If it requires a username and password to log in, you should only access that site from your own private network. If you do need to access sensitive sites or info on a public network, don\u2019t do it without a VPN enabled.",
      "AI ISN\u2019T GOING ANYWHERE: PROMPTS TO MAKE LIFE EASIER",
      "5. Cover your mic and camera",
      "The NSA says it\u2019s best to use a protective case that drowns out your microphone and covers your camera when you\u2019re not using it.",
      "In \"hot-miking\" attacks, hackers activate your microphone without you knowing it so they can listen into your conversations. It happens when your device has been compromised in some way, usually through malware or an app that\u2019s exploiting permissions you granted. Most folks aren\u2019t targets for attacks like this, but I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry.",

Remove your personal data from data brokers\u2019 databases: Either by searching for your name on people search sites and requesting removals, one by one, or by using a data removal service. Data removal services automate data removal for you and let you track where exactly your data has been found and whether it was removed, not only on people search sites, which are public data brokers, but also on hidden, private databases where you can\u2019t look yourself up (and these are the worst).",
      "Once your data is removed, data removal services monitor data brokers for your data and remove it again as needed (because it has a tendency to be re-listed after a while). This way, you prevent data broker companies from compiling a full profile on you and selling it to the first bidder, whether that\u2019s a hacker, a marketing agency or an insurance company.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "5. Use a VPN (virtual private network) when browsing: Encrypt your online activities and mask your digital location to add an extra layer of anonymity and protection. A reliable\u00a0VPN can help shield your personal information from potential interceptors and data miners.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

While you can\u2019t prevent breaches from happening, you can take steps to minimize the risks and protect your personal information. Think of it as adding locks to your digital doors: set your social media to private, use a VPN and clean up unused apps.

      "Step to boot your PC in safe mode (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "When you are troubleshooting any problem on your PC, you should boot your computer in safe mode. If your PC is in safe mode and no longer experiences the restart loop, this means that the default Windows 11 settings and drivers aren't causing the issue. This allows you to narrow down the sources of problems causing your Windows 11 PC to crash, making it easier to troubleshoot. Here's what you need to do to boot in safe mode:",

      "Fix #2 - Remove any new software",
      "If your automatic rebooting problem began after installing a new app, uninstall that app and monitor your PC. If you still notice your PC restarting, there's a chance that the app has infected your system settings before you uninstalled it. To fix this, you'll need to restore the system. To do a system restore, you should first boot your PC in safe mode and then follow these steps:",

      "An overheating laptop or desktop will try to prevent damage to critical hardware components by shutting itself down. This is one of the leading causes of a Windows 11 PC getting stuck in a restart loop. If you've noticed your desktop giving off a lot more heat than usual or a laptop feeling hot to the touch, chances are you have an overheating issue.",
      "A computer's CPU and GPU generate the most heat, so I recommend monitoring those hardware pieces to see if they are overheating. You don't need any additional software to monitor the temperatures of your GPU, as some temperature readings are built into Windows 11. Here's how to check your hardware temperatures in Windows 11:",

However, there's a multitude of free-to-use apps that manufacturers have developed to measure your CPU temperature, including Core Temp, HWMonitor or Open Hardware Monitor.",
      "When you open one of these monitoring tools, you'll be able to view your PC's stats, including CPU and GPU temperatures and loads. If your CPU or GPU is running too hot, try cleaning the components to remove dust. For custom-built desktops, adding more exhaust fans to the case can improve airflow and cooling.

      "A computer will randomly restart when it has a failing power supply unit (PSU). If you have an issue with your power supply, you'll know if your computer won't restart or turn on. In addition to causing shut-offs and restart loops, a faulty power supply can also cause a blue screen of death error. In severe cases, you might even smell a burning scent or witness smoke coming from your PC's power supply exhaust vent. If you use a laptop with PSU issues, you cannot send your computer to a repair shop or the manufacturer for repair.",
      "Desktop PC owners have it a bit easier, assuming they have a pre-built PC that can be altered easily. If you do have a desktop, turn off and unplug your computer before going into the case to investigate if dust build-up is affecting your PSU. If your PSU fails, you must purchase and install a new one.",

      "If you have automatic restart enabled in Windows 11, your PC will restart every time it encounters a system failure. You can easily disable this future within the Windows 11 command prompt. Here's what you need to do:",

      "Step to repair your system files (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "An issue with your Windows 11 system files may be causing your PC to constantly restart. If you think a corrupted system file is why your PC keeps restarting, there's a quick and easy fix you can do within the Windows Powershell. The System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in tool that will scan your Windows system files for corruption or any other changes. If a system file has been modified, it will automatically replace the file with the correct version. Here's how to run the SFC command:",

      "Press Enter",
      "Leave the command prompt window open until the command completes, which could take some time",
      "If there's no problem with your Windows system files, after the scan, you'll see a message that says, \"Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.\" If you instead see a message saying, \"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them,\" you should try running SFC again but in safe mode.",
      "Fix #8 - Check for RAM issues in the command prompt",
      "Your PC might be restarting itself because it doesn't have access to enough random access memory (RAM). Windows 11 may become unstable without enough RAM in your computer, causing the OS to randomly reboot. You can use the built-in Memory Diagnostics Tool in Windows 11 to check your computer for issues related to RAM. Here's what you need to do:",
      "Press the Windows Key\u00a0and RType mdsched.exe in the text boxClick OKSelect Restart Now and Check for Problems",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "These are the best fixes for a computer that is constantly restarting. While you can perform these fixes at home, it might be your best bet to send your computer to a repair shop or back to the manufacturer if you continue having an issue with your Windows 11 PC being stuck in a restart loop after these fixes. It also may be time to invest in a new laptop if you are experiencing a system slowdown and random restarting on your Windows 11 PC, but I would recommend trying to fix the problem first before buying a new machine.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2025 20:00:29 GMT",
    "summary": "A group of Quaker congregations are suing the Department of Homeland Security.",
    "story": [
      "A group of Quaker congregations is suing the Department of Homeland Security for changing a policy that prevented Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from carrying out operations in so-called \u201csensitive locations\u201d such as houses of worship, playgrounds, schools and hospitals without approval from supervisors.",
      "The policy, which had been in place under multiple administrations \u2014 including during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 was rescinded last week.",
      "The lawsuit, which was filed in federal district court in Maryland on Monday, alleges, \u201cThe very threat of that [immigration] enforcement deters congregants from attending services, especially members of immigrant communities,\u201d and argues that attending religious services is at the heart of the \u201cguarantee of religious liberty.\u201d",
      "Faith leaders, local officials and educators have objected to the policy reversal and have been vocal about their opposition, but the suit appears to be the first from a faith-based organization challenging the change in court.",
      "\u201cA week ago today, President Trump swore an oath to defend the Constitution and yet today religious institutions that have existed since the 1600s in our country are having to go to court to challenge what is a violation of every individual\u2019s constitutional right to worship and associate freely,\u201d said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which is providing the lawyers representing the Quaker groups.",
      "Perryman said the lawsuit addresses more than churches that act as sanctuaries.\u00a0\u201cThe troubling nature of the policy goes beyond just houses of worship with sanctuary programs \u2014 it is that ICE could enter religious and sacred spaces whenever it wants,\u201d she said.",
      "Noah Merrill, secretary of the New England Yearly Meeting of Friends, one of the plaintiffs in the suit, told NBC News in an email:  \"Quaker meetings for worship seek to be a sanctuary and a refuge for all, and this new and invasive practice tangibly erodes that possibility by creating unnecessary anxiety, confusion, and chilling of our members\u2019 and neighbors\u2019 willingness to share with us in the worship which sustains our lives. This undermines our communities and, we believe, violates our religious freedom.\"",
      "According to the lawsuit, the policy that protected \u201csensitive locations\u201d from immigration enforcement without prior approval dates back to the early 1990s.\u00a0It was meant to allow undocumented people to operate freely in certain public areas with the idea that doing so would ultimately benefit not just them, but also the larger community \u2014 for example, by allowing children to be in school during the day, and letting sick people visit hospitals without fear of deportation.",
      "The plaintiffs in this lawsuit are several regional umbrella groups representing Quaker congregations in the mid-Atlantic and New England.",
      "P.J. Lechleitner, who served as acting ICE director from July 2023 until last week, told NBC News on Monday that he does not expect ICE raids at houses of worship even with the end of the policy.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be seeing a lot of target operations \u2026 in churches or places of worship or schools or whatever,\u201d he said, \u201cunless there\u2019s a real operational and public safety, national security, need to do so.\u201d"

      "The ceasefire\u2019s first phase, which is set to run until early March,  includes the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The second phase has yet to be fully negotiated.",
      "The fragile truce was placed in jeopardy Saturday after Israel prevented Palestinian civilians from moving back to their homes in northern Gaza. It said Hamas had violated the agreement because it had not released hostage Arbel Yehoud.",
      "Hamas also accused Israel of breaking the deal, but on Monday, Qatar, one of the leading mediators in the talks to bring an end to the fighting, said in a statement that Yehoud would be freed along with two other hostages before Friday.",
      "Three other captives are also set be released Saturday, and many in Israel are hopeful that Kfir Bibas, the youngest hostage still in captivity in the Gaza Strip, will be among those released.",
      "Kfir\u00a0was just shy of 9 months old when he was kidnapped during the\u00a0Hamas-led terrorist\u00a0attack on Oct. 7, 2023, along with his 5-year-old brother, Ariel, and his parents, Yarden and Shiri Bibas.",
      "He turned 2 earlier this month, having never known a birthday outside captivity.",
      "While all other child hostages were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners during a one-week ceasefire in November 2023, the Bibas family never emerged from Gaza, and on one of the final days of the brief pause in fighting, Hamas said in a statement that the toddler had been killed in an Israeli airstrike along with his mom and brother.",
      "Around 250 people were taken hostage and 1,200 people were killed on Oct. 7. After Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza in response, more than 47,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to health officials in the enclave."

JB Pritzker told CNN on Sunday he supports deporting people convicted of violent crimes, but disagrees with targeting those who follow the law, saying:\u00a0\u201cThese are not people who are causing problems in our country, and what we need is a path to citizenship for them.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A group of Quaker congregations is suing the Department of Homeland Security for changing a policy that prevented Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from carrying out operations in so-called \u201csensitive locations\u201d such as houses of worship, playgrounds, schools and hospitals without approval from supervisors.",
      "The policy, which had been in place under multiple administrations \u2014 including during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 was rescinded last week.",
      "The lawsuit, which was filed in federal district court in Maryland on Monday, alleges, \u201cThe very threat of that [immigration] enforcement deters congregants from attending services, especially members of immigrant communities,\u201d and argues that attending religious services is at the heart of the \u201cguarantee of religious liberty.\u201d",
      "Faith leaders, local officials and educators have objected to the policy reversal and have been vocal about their opposition, but the suit appears to be the first from a faith-based organization challenging the change in court.",
      "\u201cA week ago today, President Trump swore an oath to defend the Constitution and yet today religious institutions that have existed since the 1600s in our country are having to go to court to challenge what is a violation of every individual\u2019s constitutional right to worship and associate freely,\u201d said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which is providing the lawyers representing the Quaker groups.",
      "Perryman said the lawsuit addresses more than churches that act as sanctuaries.\u00a0\u201cThe troubling nature of the policy goes beyond just houses of worship with sanctuary programs \u2014 it is that ICE could enter religious and sacred spaces whenever it wants,\u201d she said.",
      "Noah Merrill, secretary of the New England Yearly Meeting of Friends, one of the plaintiffs in the suit, told NBC News in an email:  \"Quaker meetings for worship seek to be a sanctuary and a refuge for all, and this new and invasive practice tangibly erodes that possibility by creating unnecessary anxiety, confusion, and chilling of our members\u2019 and neighbors\u2019 willingness to share with us in the worship which sustains our lives. This undermines our communities and, we believe, violates our religious freedom.\"",
      "According to the lawsuit, the policy that protected \u201csensitive locations\u201d from immigration enforcement without prior approval dates back to the early 1990s.\u00a0It was meant to allow undocumented people to operate freely in certain public areas with the idea that doing so would ultimately benefit not just them, but also the larger community \u2014 for example, by allowing children to be in school during the day, and letting sick people visit hospitals without fear of deportation.",
      "The plaintiffs in this lawsuit are several regional umbrella groups representing Quaker congregations in the mid-Atlantic and New England.",
      "P.J. Lechleitner, who served as acting ICE director from July 2023 until last week, told NBC News on Monday that he does not expect ICE raids at houses of worship even with the end of the policy.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be seeing a lot of target operations \u2026 in churches or places of worship or schools or whatever,\u201d he said, \u201cunless there\u2019s a real operational and public safety, national security, need to do so.\u201d"

      "Buzz about the company, which was founded in 2023 and released its R1 model last week, has spread to tech analysts, investors and developers, who say that the hype \u2014 and ensuing fear of falling behind in the ever-changing AI hype cycle \u2014 may be warranted. Especially in the era of the generative AI arms race, where tech giants and startups alike are racing to ensure they don\u2019t fall behind in a market\u00a0predicted to top $1 trillion\u00a0in revenue within a decade.",

Estimates differ on exactly how much DeepSeek\u2019s R1 costs, or how many GPUs went into it. Jefferies analysts estimated that a recent version had a \u201ctraining cost of only US$5.6m (assuming US$2/H800 hour rental cost). That is less than 10% of the cost of\u00a0Meta\u2019s Llama.\u201d",

      "The plunge came amid a global tech stock sell-off over fears about America's leadership in the AI sector. Those fears were largely sparked by advances claimed by a Chinese artificial intelligence startup.",
      "Shares of the chipmaker, one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom in tech stocks, plummeted as much as 18%. That pushed Nvidia's market value below $3 trillion. Still, shares of the firm are up more than 480% over the last two years.",
      "The drop accounted for more than $520 billion in lost market value though. If shares of the tech giant close at this level, it would be the biggest market value drop in U.S. stock market history, according to Bloomberg. And it would be nearly double the second worst drop in history, also seen by Nvidia shareholders in September 2024, when the company shed $279 billion in value.",
      "For some perspective, the amount of market value lost by Nvidia on Monday is more than the entire market value of Exxon Mobil, Costco, Home Depot or Bank of America.",

The surge didn't stop there, with the company soaring past Alphabet, Microsoft and the most valuable company in the world: Apple. At its most recent peak, Nvidia reached a towering $3.7 trillion.",
      "With Monday's losses, Apple has retaken the title of world's most valuable company and Nvidia's value sank to around $2.8 trillion.",
      "Nvidia's drop also pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower by more than 130 points. Nvidia joined the prestigious 30-stock index in November, replacing rival chipmaker Intel. The Nasdaq Composite, which more closely tracks publicly traded tech companies, slid around 3%.",

      "To help you determine if you\u2019re at risk for having dust mites, we asked allergy experts to explain what exactly they are, how to determine if you have them and what to do if you do.",

      "What are dust mites?",
      "Though it sounds like a type of dirt or debris, dust mites are actually living things. \u201cDust mites are a microscopic insect-like species that belong to the arachnid family, along with spiders and ticks,\u201d says Michael Rubino, a mold and air quality expert and founder of HomeCleanse. \u201cThey are invisible to the naked eye and often live within household dust, eating organic matter such as skin cells and pollen.\u201d",
      "Most commonly, these pests are found in items made from fabric and textiles \u2014 like mattresses, pillows, bedding, rugs, drapes, upholstered furniture, clothing and even stuffed animals or toys, says Dr. Sukhkarn Bains, an allergist-immunologist at the Los Angeles Center for Ear, Nose, Throat and Allergy. Rubino points out that they\u2019re typically found on porous surfaces, where microscopic dust can easily collect. This dust comes from microscopic skin flakes that have shed, which the mites then eat.",
      "Are dust mites harmful?",
      "Some good news: Dust mites are generally not considered to be a major health hazard. \u201cThis is because they don\u2019t transmit diseases or bite like bed bugs do,\u201d says Rubino. \u201cHowever, the tiny amounts of feces, urine and body fragments they leave behind do contain proteins that can trigger allergic reactions in some people.\u201d",
      "Wondering how such tiny particles can cause such an allergic ruckus? \u201cThey settle on surfaces throughout your home, mixing with dust, and can easily become airborne when disturbed,\u201d says Rubino. \u201cDue to their tiny size, they can be inhaled into the body, where the immune system identifies them as foreign invaders. This recognition can prompt a response aimed at eliminating these particles, potentially leading to chronic allergy symptoms over time.\u201d",
      "Some people may notice these allergies pop up immediately, while others may find that a dust mite allergy develops over time after repeated exposure, says Bains, who adds that those with pre-existing allergies are at a higher risk of also being allergic to dust mites.",
      "Signs you have a dust mite allergy",
      "The most common symptoms of a dust mite allergy include nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, watery eyes and wheezing, says Bains. \u201cLess common, though still possible, some people also experience hives.\u201d",
      "As mentioned, those with other allergies are most at risk for developing a dust mite allergy. \u201cChildren and individuals with pre-existing conditions like asthma are also more at risk,\u201d says Rubino. \u201cThose exposed to high levels of dust mites are also more likely to experience symptoms.\u201d",
      "How to treat a dust mite allergy",
      "If you suspect you may be dealing with a dust mite allergy, a doctor who specializes in allergic reactions should be able to help confirm it. A doctor will be able to prescribe medications like antihistamines and intranasal steroids to deal with symptoms, says Bains. But if you want to fully treat a dust mite allergy, the only way to do it is by undergoing allergy immunotherapy, according to Bains. \u201cThis is where an individual undergoes regular therapy either by subcutaneous or sublingual delivery to effectively desensitize them to dust mite,\u201d he says. \u201cAllergy immunotherapy typically takes about three to five years.\u201d",
      "Yes, you read that right \u2014 it\u2019s a long process that can also be quite expensive if not covered by your insurance. Mostly, this type of treatment is reserved for those who find they have severely uncomfortable reactions to dust mite exposure. Most of those who suffer can handle the allergy through the aforementioned treatments that mitigate symptoms. The other key factor in handling those allergies is to try to get rid of dust mites themselves.",
      "How to get rid of dust mites",
      "First, know that there is no shame in having dust mites. In fact, according to The American Lung Association, roughly four out of five homes contain these pests. One reason so many homes have dust mites is because it can be tricky to get rid of them, says Bains. Here\u2019s what our experts suggest doing to try to kick them out of your home:",
      "Maintain indoor humidity. Aim for between 35 and 50 percent, any hotter and you are creating the warm, moist environment that dust mites thrive in, says Rubino.Wash with hot water. Once a week, throw your bedding and blankets in the washing machine and use hot water. Stick with machine washable items. When choosing fabric-related items for your home, try to stick to items you can easily throw in the washing machine. Lack of regular washing is one of the most common causes of dust mites, says Bains. Vacuum regularly. Use a HEPA vacuum regularly on the surface of your mattress. This can help pull away the dust and skin cells that mites feed on.Protect your stuff. Use mattress and pillow protectors to prevent dust mites from embedding themselves into these items, says Rubino. These protectors should also be washed regularly to keep them clean.",

    "summary": "Multiple defectors from North Korea spoke to NBC News about the mindset of soldiers sent to fight for Russia in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Few people understand what may be going through the minds of North Korean soldiers fighting and dying for Russia in the war against Ukraine. But Lee Chul Eun is one of them.",
      "Lee, 38, a North Korean defector and former soldier now living in South Korea, said it is \u201cdevastating\u201d to see troops from the reclusive, communist-ruled North being sent abroad by leader Kim Jong Un, \u201conly to then give up their youth for a land that is not even theirs but the foreign land of Russia.\u201d",
      "He is one of multiple defectors who spoke to NBC News about the training, conditions and mindset of North Korean soldiers, including their willingness to take their own lives if necessary.",
      "Lee said his former colleagues \u201care essentially just sent out to be cannon fodder on the front lines.\u201d",
      "For the first time since they arrived in Russia in the fall, North Korean soldiers have been captured alive by Ukrainian forces, with video and photos showing one man with bandages around his jawline and another with bandaged hands.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who announced the prisoners\u2019 apprehension earlier this month, said they were living proof that North Korea had entered the war, in a major escalation of the yearslong conflict.",
      "The U.S. and allies say there are more than 11,000 North Korean troops fighting in the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion in August. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has confirmed the reports.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it is not easy to capture a North Korean soldier,\u201d Ryu Sung Hyu said in an interview in the South Korean capital, Seoul.",
      "All North Korean recruits are taught a song that includes a verse about saving their last bullet for themselves to avoid capture, said Ryu, who served in the North Korean military until 2019, when he escaped to freedom in South Korea.",
      "According to South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, there was at least one recent incident in which a North Korean soldier, faced with possible capture by Ukrainian forces, tried to detonate a grenade while shouting Kim\u2019s name but was killed before he could succeed.",
      "The South Korean military said last week that North Korea is preparing to send additional troops to Russia after about 300 of its soldiers were killed and 2,700 others were injured. The high casualty rate was due to the soldiers\u2019 poor understanding of modern warfare, as well as the way they were being deployed by Russia, South Korean lawmakers said.",
      "Their willingness to fight and die for Russia could be a major factor in determining the course of the Ukraine war, as well as the level of American military aid to Ukraine under President Donald Trump, who has expressed skepticism over continued U.S. support.",
      "Kim is thought to be providing Russian President Vladimir Putin with troops and weapons in hope of receiving technical assistance with his nuclear and ballistic missile programs. His flurry of weapons testing has continued with three launches already this year, including multiple short-range ballistic missiles, a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile and strategic cruise missiles.",
      "Trump drew ire from South Korea on Tuesday after he described the reclusive regime as a \u201cnuclear power,\u201d a phrase that U.S. officials have long refrained from using, as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.",
      "Kim is sending troops to Russia for two reasons, \u201cboth of which are driven by desperation,\u201d said Ahn Chan Il, who served in the North Korean military for over a decade and defected to South Korea in 1979. The first is to earn foreign currency, which is in short supply in North Korea under United Nations sanctions imposed over its weapons programs.",
      "The deployment also provides valuable experience for the North Korean military, which has not been deployed overseas since the Vietnam War.",
      "Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council this month that fighting alongside Russia makes North Korea \u201cmore capable of waging war against its neighbors.\u201d",
      "Lee, who spent five years in the North Korean military, said the troops had been sent to Russia as mercenaries rather than soldiers, noting that they weren\u2019t wearing their uniforms. South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service has said they were given Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, along with forged identification documents.",
      "\u201cEven if they die there it does not matter, because North Korea sent them out without officially recognizing them,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey were sent there not to bring honor to the country, but to give up their lives and bring back lots of money.\u201d",
      "'No longer a part of the society'",
      "Military service is compulsory in North Korea, which has one of the world\u2019s largest standing armies. Soldiers undergo three months of basic training before being assigned to a unit, said Lee, who came to South Korea in 2016 after swimming for six hours from the North.",
      "\u201cAs soldiers,\u201d Lee said, \u201cthey are told they are individuals who are now no longer a part of the society and their families, and must follow the orders of the supreme leader,\u201d meaning Kim.",
      "They have no trouble believing this, having been indoctrinated by North Korean propaganda from childhood, said Lee.",
      "North Korean soldiers spend most of their time not actually being soldiers but working on farms and construction projects, Lee and others said.",
      "\u201cI think I only fired three bullets per year,\u201d said Lee Hyun-seung, who served in the North Korean military for more than three years. When he moved to a more elite unit, he said, \u201cwe had more like 20 bullets.\u201d",
      "Asked whether he thought the North Korean troops could help Russia win the war, Lee \u2014 whose family defected in 2014 and who now lives in the U.S. \u2014 was skeptical.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not that sure,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I know their training and I know they are not well trained.\u201d",
      "For North Korean soldiers, who receive food and clothing but are otherwise essentially unpaid, the main enemy is hunger.",
      "North Korea struggles with food shortages as Kim devotes the majority of resources to his weapons programs, meaning that, like most of the broader population, soldiers suffer from malnutrition and can even starve to death.",
      "Meals are made up mainly of plain rice, corn or potatoes, sometimes mixed with grass or even tree bark, said Lee Chun Eul.",
      "He said his feelings about North Korea changed gradually, largely due to his exposure to foreign media that finds its way into the country despite tight government controls \u2014 \u201cJames Bond\u201d was a favorite of his growing up in the 1990s. More recently, the North Korean government has been alarmed by the popularity of South Korean TV dramas, sentencing two teenagers to 12 years of hard labor for watching them.",
      "\u201cWhen I look at North Korean mercenaries sent to Russia, I wonder if they would still have joined if they had watched as much foreign media as I did in North Korea,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI also wonder if the North Korean regime and Kim Jong Un\u2019s dictatorship would still be in place.\u201d",
      "The defectors say they hope the North Korean troops fighting in Russia will take the opportunity to leave like they did.",
      "\u201cWhen North Korean workers, who have lived their entire lives trapped in a restrictive system, experience life abroad, they come to see North Korea as nothing short of a prison,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cOnce they realize what freedom could mean, it\u2019s hard to imagine they wouldn\u2019t consider breaking free to live a freer life.\u201d",
      "In addition to finding freedom, they could provide the U.S. and others with valuable intelligence regarding the North Korean military\u2019s strategies and capabilities, which are often exaggerated by the North Korean government.",
      "Ahn and other North Koreans who defected as soldiers have offered Ukraine their assistance against the North Korean troops.",
      "\u201cHowever, rather than directly participating in the war, our focus is on psychological warfare to change the mindset of North Korean soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough platforms like YouTube or leaflets, we aim to deliver messages to the North Korean troops, urging them not to die meaningless deaths and instead seek freedom.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, they watch with heavy hearts as casualties mount among North Korean soldiers whose experiences they know only too well.",
      "\u201cThese young people did not go knowing they were going to die,\u201d Lee said, \u201cbut died because they did not know.",

    "story": [
      "After two decades of releasing chart-topping hits, Miranda Lambert has certainly earned the right to be called a country superstar. Now, her icon status has officially been solidified.",
      "At the\u00a02024 People\u2019s Choice Country Awards, the singer received the Country Icon Award, an accolade that came hot on the heels of the release of her 10th studio album.",
      "Aptly named \"Postcards from Texas,\" it's the first album Lambert has made in Texas since she was 18 years old.",
      "\"It felt really full circle,\" she said of the experience while talking with TODAY's Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager in September 2024.",
      "While reflecting on her Country Icon Award, the singer, now 41, said it feels \"crazy\" to think that she's an icon at this point in her life.",
      "\u201cI feel like some days I\u2019m just getting started in some ways. So to already have an icon status, it means the world. But it\u2019s also like, \u2018All right, well I got to uphold this. So I got to keep going,'\u201d she said.",
      "Before appearing on TODAY's fourth hour at that time, Lambert sat down with TODAY.com to answer eight questions before 8 a.m. in\u00a0our original video series \u201c8 Before 8.\u201d",
      "From personal to professional questions, Lambert didn't hold back in her responses. She dished on country icons who inspire her, her favorite tattoo and her new album. Plus, she assessed husband Brendan McLoughlin's songwriting abilities.",
      "How did you come up with the name of your album 'Postcards from Texas'?",
      "The name \"Postcards from Texas\" kind of felt right for the record because there are so many influences on this record that have sort of made me who I am as an artist musically. And I felt like each was a little snapshot of the last 20 years of inspiration.",
      "What was the inspiration for your new song 'Wranglers'?",
      "My new song \"Wranglers\" was written by my good friend Audra Mae, and I think the inspiration was just life and girl talk. We were talking about experiences we had had, and we were writing songs and drinking tequila.",
      "And then a month later she sent me \"Wranglers,\" and she was like, \"I took our stories and I wrote them. Hope you don\u2019t mind.\" So I just love it. It\u2019s like \u2014 it really reminds me of something I would've put on some of my earlier records.",
      "What music icons have inspired you over the years?",
      "So many people have inspired me, but country, specifically. The obvious ones: Dolly (Parton) and Reba (McEntire) because they are our queens, Loretta Lynn. But on this record, specifically, I feel like George Strait had a lot of influence for me. We call him the king in Texas for a reason.",

      "Describe the process of writing 'Dammit Randy' with your husband.",
      "I did write a song with my husband called \"Dammit Randy\" on this record. I had my husband writing songs here in 2020 when we were all home and bored, and he actually turned out to be pretty good. He is a retired NYPD officer, so songwriting is not his (thing). Now, he has it on his resume because he\u2019s really proud.",
      "We were kind of wrapping up songs for this record, and my friend Jon Randall picked up a guitar and that usually means we\u2019re going to write a song. And Brendan was watching football and kind of kept popping lines in. And so I was like, \"If you\u2019re going to do this, we\u2019re not going to watch the game and write songs. You got to pick a side.\" And so, he ended up writing some of my favorite lines in the song.",
      "You got married after 3 months of dating. How did you know your husband was the one?",
      "You know, my husband\u2019s my person, and it\u2019s taken a journey to get there and figure that out. But I\u2019m also a person that really believes in love and taking a risk. And if you don\u2019t, you know, I know that loving big can also mean hurting big. But to me, it\u2019s definitely worth it.",
      "This is your 10th studio album. What are 10 things you can\u2019t live without?",
      "Ten things I can\u2019t live without: Dogs, dogs, country music, my husband. Not in that order. I should have probably put him before the dogs, but he would expect nothing less. Tito's and Cheetos and girl time. Can\u2019t live without girl time. And cowboy boots and Texas Longhorns.",

      "In the first installation, \"Fourth Wing,\" our heroine is thrust into the cutthroat world of Basgiath, a fantasy war college, forced to give up her ambitions of recording history and instead, learn to ride a dragon. So far the romantasy series (\"romance\" plus \"fantasy,\" for the uninitiated) has seen Violet handle a brutal year at school, a burgeoning rebellion and plenty of relationship drama.",
      "But from the first chapter, it's clear that Violet will have a markedly different experience at Basgiath compared to the other members of the Riders Quadrant.",
      "Violet experiences a chronic illness, specifically a condition that resembles Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which affects the strength of one\u2019s joints and connective tissue, though it's not named as such in the book.",
      "Yarros, who has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome herself, says writing Violet\u2019s story was \u201ccathartic\u201d for her. Detailing how Violet was able to survive in the world of dragons and war, relying on her wits and ability to find alternate paths to success, allowed Yarros to draw parallels to how she lives day-to-day.",
      "\u201cIt was cathartic to say, \u2018Hey, you can have a saddle. You can still be a rider. You just have to do it a little differently,\u2019\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cI can do everything that other writers can. I just have to do it differently. My legs have to be up for POTS flares. I have to support underneath my knees so that my joints don\u2019t, you know, go all wonky on me.",
      "\"It\u2019s just knowing what accommodations I needed. And it was through writing \u2018Fourth Wing\u2019 that I found those,\" she adds.",
      "Some readers say Violet has offered representation for those who experience chronic illness. And it's difficult to overstate just how many readers of Yarros' series there are.",
      "\"Fourth Wing,\" which came out in April 2023, propelled Yarros to the New York Times bestseller list. As of this writing, \"Fourth Wing\" is No. 1 on the combined print and e-book fiction list, and it's been on the list for 78 weeks. (Its sequel, \"Iron Flame,\" comes in at No. 3, with 52 weeks on the list.) On social media, specifically its bookish corners, \"Onyx Storm\" has been the talk of the town, with creators posting detailed recaps of the first two books, fervent theories and most importantly, their excitement to return to the world of Navarre.",
      "Yarros is on top of the book world. But before our interview, I'm met with immediate friendliness, an offer to sign my copy of her book and even passing self-deprecating jokes. (\"Defeated by a microphone,\" she jokes as she works to attach a mic to her shirt for the interview.)",
      "Before we start, she stares into the camera, ever the professional. But she seems to release some nerves when I tell her she can just look at me instead.",

      "\"How they start, how they end, how Book 5 starts, how the series ends \u2014\u00a0that's all plotted out and done,\" she tells TODAY.com.",
      "When it comes time to actually write the books, Yarros says she sometimes alters course from her outline. For example, Violet facing the Gauntlet, a vertical obstacle course that riders must complete before they have a chance to bond with a dragon, was not initially part of her plan.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018You know, they really need to prove themselves.\u2019 They really need to do something that\u2019s like, \u2018This is how I can ride a dragon,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI just drew the Gauntlet, and suddenly it was \u2014 I was writing it.\u201d",
      "The world of the \"Empyrean\" series is expansive, and only growing with each subsequent book. While \"Fourth Wing\" was primarily set at Basgiath War College, its twisty ending saw Violet's understanding of her continent flipped on its head. She's since encountered new lands, populations and mythical creatures.",
      "How they start, how they end, how Book 5 starts, how the series ends \u2014 that's all plotted out and done.\u201d",

      "But for the sake of organization, she keeps everyone in check via a detailed guide to the world.",
      "\"I keep an extensive bible that tells you who the character is, who their dragon is, what their signet is, what has happened to them, what their body looks like, where their scars are, everything like that,\" Yarros says. \"I keep it all meticulously, jot it down so that my editors don\u2019t, you know, come after me with spatulas.\"",
      "The complicated love interests of the 'Empyrean'",
      "With dragons, signets (essentially, special powers) and war, the \"Empyrean\" series is filled with fantasy elements. But the books are also known for their high-stakes romance and steamy scenes.",
      "Violet's main love interest is Xaden, a rebellion leader with a tendency to keep secrets. Their story has taken a classic enemies-to-lovers arc. Fans swoon over Xaden's intense love, but his at-times questionable decisions make him the series' de facto \"bad boy.\"  With plenty of story ahead, there's a lot of room for things to change.",
      "(Warning: Major spoilers from \"Fourth Wing\" and \"Iron Flame\" ahead.)",
      "The end of \"Iron Flame\" marked a major turning point for Violet and Xaden. In a last ditch effort to save Violet, Xaden turned venin, meaning he gave up part of his soul for power.",
      "Up until this point, the venin had been cast as the series' big bad, the ultimate evil as they suck humans dry of their power. With \"Onyx Storm,\" Yarros faced the challenge of her popular \"bad boy\" actually going evil.",
      "\u201cI think as people, sometimes we see other people, and we think they are the epitome of evil, but no one takes a look to see how they get there and what drives someone to their motivations,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think the love of power often corrupts people. And in \u2018Fourth Wing,\u2019 it\u2019s taking a power that turns you venin. So really it\u2019s, yes, he\u2019s turning there, but he did it for such a righteous purpose, and sometimes that still turns us into monsters.\u201d",
      "Yarros says what \u201creally fascinates\u201d her is \u201cknowing where our limitations are as people.\u201d",
      "\"You've been given this gift, but can you wield it for good?\" she says. \"And if not, can you maintain your sanity and your morality?\u201d",
      "\"Iron Flame\" also introduced the potential redemption of Dain Aetos, a more controversial character. When readers first meet Dain, he's Violet\u2019s childhood best friend and a potential love interest. But over the course of the first book, Dain and Violet grow distant, and he eventually betrays her, choosing his life of rule-following over Violet.",
      "I already knew when I was writing \u2018Fourth Wing\u2019 and what was happening to Dain, where Dain would go in \u2018Iron Flame.\u2019\u201d",
      "rebecca Yarros",
      "\u201cI love Dain,\u201d Yarros says. \u201cAnd I think all 21-year-old kids are flawed. And I think especially when you take 20-year-old kids and you put them in a war college designed to beat the humanity out of them, and she\u2019s seeing him after his first year. So, he makes mistakes.\u201d",
      "Some of those mistakes? Insisting Violet sneak out of the Riders Quadrant for her own safety, using his power to read her memories without her knowledge and reporting what he saw.",
      "\u201cAs someone with chronic illness, we all have someone who tells us to sit down, and, 'You can\u2019t do that, and, 'Be careful.' And that person is not evil. That person is just overprotective, and (Dain) is,\" Yarros says.",
      "\u201cHis biggest mistake is that when his best friend stops speaking to him, he violates her boundaries,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut so does Xaden, and no one seems to give Xaden quite the rap they give Dain.\u201d",
      "In \"Iron Flame,\" Dain surprises Violet (and some readers) when he rescues her from an interrogation, going against the leadership he had demonstrated ultimate loyalty to.",
      "But Yarros always planned for that twist.",
      "\u201cI already knew when I was writing \u2018Fourth Wing\u2019 and what was happening to Dain, where Dain would go in \u2018Iron Flame,\u2019 and where that scene in the interrogation chamber was going,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you read the interrogation scene, it reads both ways. So, it reads as though he\u2019s going to kill her, but it also reads as though he\u2019s saying, \u2018If you just trusted me last year, none of this would have happened.\u2019\u201d",
      "Writing 'Onyx Storm' and what's next",
      "Before the \"Empyrean\" series, Yarros had mainly written romances, such as 2019's \"The Last Letter\" and \"Full Measures\" in 2014.",
      "When she started writing \"Fourth Wing,\" she says she was at a point in her life where she felt unwilling to accept accommodations or limitations. She wanted to cram in 12 to 15 hours worth of writing a day, despite her body saying she shouldn't. Writing Violet's adaptation encouraged her to follow suit.",
      "\"It was me kind of talking to myself about what I needed to do to slow down, to protect my own body,\" she says. \"And I think I\u2019m finally starting to listen to it two-and-a-half years later.\"",
      "While \"Fourth Wing\" and \"Iron Flame\" published just seven months apart, \"Onyx Storm\" didn't hit shelves until about 14 months after the second book. Yarros needed a break \u2014\u00a0part of which she spent writing another book.",
      "Yarros says she felt she needed to prove to herself she could write another book, so she went back to her roots and drafted a contemporary romance called \"Variation,\" which published in October 2024.",
      "It was me kind of talking to myself about what I needed to do to slow down, to protect my own body. And I think I\u2019m finally starting to listen to it two-and-a-half years later.\u201d",
      "rebecca Yarros",
      "\u201cThat really set my feet back down. It reminded me, 'Hey, you can write a book. You can do this.' And then I went into 'Onyx,'\" she says.",
      "As for what she can share about the series' fourth book? Not much.",
      "Yarros says she makes a playlist to guide her through writing each novel. On Jan. 21, she released the playlist she made for writing and editing \"Onyx Storm.\"",
      "Yarros says she's already made the fourth book's playlist. However, she doesn't want to share any of the songs on the playlist.",
      "\"I think it would scare everyone,\" she says.",
      "Yarros did reveal, however, that her usual muse Taylor Swift makes some necessary appearances on the playlist.",
      "\"Oh, obviously Taylor Swift,\" she says. \"That was the first song that went on there is a Taylor Swift song.\"",
      "\"I can tell you, it\u2019s off of \u2018TTPD\u2019 ('The Tortured Poets Department'),\" she adds."

      "For his second performance of the night, Chalamet played \u201cTomorrow Is a Long Time,\u201d which was featured on \u201cBob Dylan\u2019s Greatest Hits Vol. II\u201d in 1971.",
      "The Academy Award nominated actor played the song solo at first. Chalamet sat on a stool on the dark stage with just his acoustic guitar to start the song before he was eventually joined by his band to round out the performance.",
      "Chalamet got a thumbs up from Dylan fans after his performances, with one user commenting on YouTube, \u201cThis Bob Dylan fan approves. You\u2019ve gone above and beyond.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a pretty big Dylan fan, I appreciate these deep cuts,\u201d another fan of the iconic artist wrote. \u201cGreat choices.\u201d",
      "Another YouTube user commended Chalamet's talent, writing, \u201cSeriously everything I see this kid in he just transforms - insanely talented.\u201d",
      "Some fans noted they became \"emotional\" watching Chalamet perform, with one fan writing, \"The second song was so emotional.  Anyone else out there shed a tear?\"",
      "One fan even joked, \u201cok I\u2019ve seen enough give him an Oscar.\u201d",
      "But not everyone was a fan. One person on X didn't appear to be thrilled by the actor's vocal abilities, writing, \u201cBe honest... it\u2019s not great! I you wanna watch actors who can sing... Cynthia Erivo \u2014 Ariana Grande. Your welcome.\u201d",
      "Chalamet transformed into Dylan in order to portray the musician in \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d which included showcasing his musical skills.",
      "The actor sang all of the songs for the film and performed them live on camera. He also put in several years of work leading up to the movie, including starting guitar lessons in 2019 as well as learning how to play the harmonica.",
      "Chalamet had no trouble poking fun at himself during the episode, including calling out the absurdity of him being the musical guest.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so grateful \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 is still doing weird stuff like this 50 years in,\u201d Chalamet said at the end of his monologue. \u201cThey\u2019re either really nice for letting me do this, or incredibly mean and this is all a big prank. I sincerely can\u2019t tell.\u201d",
      "Less than a month after Nikki Glaser joked about his facial hair at the Golden Globes, Chalamet noted in his monologue that it was his first time hosting with a \u201clittle stache and a little goatee.\u201d",
      "He even made a point to have the camera do a close up to capture all \u201c37 hairs\u201d on his face (he counted).",
      "Chalamet also had no trouble bringing up his past award show losses, at one point showing a montage of himself looking despondent in the crowd every time his name wasn't announced.",
      "Even when he tried to re-create a winning moment during the monologue, Kenan Thompson\u2019s name was called instead and Chalamet had to sit in the audience and watch the comedian give his acceptance speech."

    "summary": "Bill Gates is looking back on his divorce from ex-wife Melinda French Gates, calling the decision \u201cthe mistake I most regret.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "Bill Gates is looking back on his divorce from ex-wife Melinda French Gates, calling the decision \u201cthe mistake I most regret.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Sunday Times published Jan. 25, the 69-year-old billionaire reflected on the aftermath of ending a 27-year marriage to French Gates, with whom he shares three children.",
      "When asked if his divorce is his only \u201cfailure\u201d in his life so far, Gates said it belongs \u201cat the top of the list.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are others but none that matter. The divorce thing was miserable for me and Melinda for at least two years,\u201d he told the publication, adding that the two aren\u2019t strangers to one another.",
      "\u201cMelinda and I still see each other \u2014 we have three kids and two grandchildren so there are family events,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe kids are doing well. They have good values.\u201d",
      "Gates and French Gates revealed they planned to end their marriage in May 2021 in identical statements shared to social media at the time.",
      "\u201cAfter a great deal of thought and a lot of work on our relationship, we have made the decision to end our marriage,\u201d read the statement. \u201cOver the last 27 years, we have raised three incredible children and build a foundation that works all over the world to enable all people to lead healthy, productive lives.\u201d",
      "In his interview with The Sunday Times, Gates said his marriage to French Gates kept him \u201cgrounded\u201d amid massive success, and he reflected on what their 27 years together taught him about love.",
      "\u201cThere is a certain wonderfulness to spending your entire adult life with one person because of the memories and depth of things you have done and having kids together,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Melinda and I met, I was fairly successful but not ridiculously successful \u2014 that came during the time that we were together. So, she saw me through a lot. When we got divorced it was tough and then she made the decision to leave the foundation \u2014 I was disappointed that she took the option to go off.\u201d",
      "Since the divorce, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has become solely Gates\u2019. The Microsoft founder is currently dating Paula Hurd, widow of former Oracle CEO Mark Hurd, and told the outlet he\u2019s \u201cmore cheerful\u201d nowadays.",
      "In May 2022, Gates reflected on his marriage and subsequent divorce when speaking to TODAY co-anchor Savannah Guthrie.",
      "\u201cThe divorce is definitely a sad thing,\u201d the billionaire Microsoft co-founder told Savannah Guthrie on TODAY at the time. \u201cI have responsibility for causing a lot of pain to my family. It was a tough year. I feel good that all of us are moving forward now.",
      "Gates' response came after French Gates was asked about reports that her ex husband had multiple affairs during their marriage. In a March 2022 interview with \u201cCBS Mornings,\u201d she responded, \u201cthose are questions Bill needs to answer.\u201d",
      "When Savannah asked Gates if he had been unfaithful in his marriage, he responded, \u201cI certainly made mistakes and I take responsibility,\u201d but didn\u2019t elaborate at the time.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think delving into the particulars at this point is constructive, but yes, I caused pain, and I feel terrible about that,\u201d Gates added.",
      "The former couple met in 1987 when French Gates was working as a product manager for Microsoft. They wed in 1994 and later welcomed three kids: Jennifer Gates, Rory Gates and Phoebe Gates. They also share two grandchildren."

      "This year\u2019s conference championship games are something of a contrast. One game pits two teams that are well versed in postseason football, while the other features a popular pick to make the Super Bowl against a squad few anticipated reaching this stage. The winners of the two games will meet in Super Bowl 59, set to be played Feb. 9 in New Orleans.",
      "Which teams are playing in the AFC and NFC championship games?",
      "The sixth-seeded Washington Commanders will visit the second-seeded Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC championship. In the AFC championship, the top-seeded Kansas City Chiefs will host the second-seeded Buffalo Bills.",
      "When are the AFC and NFC championship games?",
      "Both games are Sunday, Jan. 26. The NFC championship will be played at 3 p.m. ET, while the AFC championship will take place at 6:30 p.m. ET.",
      "How can I watch the AFC and NFC championship games?",
      "The NFC championship will air on Fox and Fox Deportes. The AFC championship will be on CBS and Paramount+.",
      "What can fans expect from each game?",
      "The Eagles will go as far as star running back Saquon Barkley takes them. He has been a beast in his first season with the team and led the way with 205 rushing yards when the Eagles outlasted the Los Angeles Rams in a close divisional round playoff game. Barkley\u2019s penchant for big runs helps offset a passing game that has been sluggish of late for the Eagles.",
      "The Commanders continue to improve each week, with their fairy-tale season reaching new heights when they upset the NFC\u2019s top-seeded Detroit Lions in the divisional round. Led by star rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, the Commanders, who haven\u2019t made it this far in the postseason since 1992, possess a high-octane offense, which may be critical since their defense isn\u2019t great against the run.",
      "As NFC East rivals, both teams are also familiar with each other, having split their two regular-season games. This matchup also marks the first time two NFC East teams have met in the NFC championship since Washington fell to the New York Giants in 1987.",
      "The AFC side features a pair of teams that have plenty of recent postseason history and that many expected to make it to this point. The Chiefs, the winner of two straight Super Bowls, held off the Houston Texans in the divisional round. They don\u2019t do any one thing to overwhelm opponents, but one thing they do very well? Win. The Chiefs will be making their seventh consecutive appearance in the AFC title game.",
      "The Bills beat the Baltimore Ravens in a tight game in the divisional round. A perpetually snakebitten franchise (remember, they lost four straight Super Bowls in the 1990s), the Bills and superstar Josh Allen \u2014 who has the most playoff wins by any quarterback without a Super Bowl start, per CBS Sports  \u2014 don\u2019t lack talent or confidence and have been on the cusp of making the Super Bowl the last few seasons. Allen\u2019s ability to make plays could be the difference as the Bills have a golden opportunity to knock off the defending champions and finally return to the Super Bowl.",
      "The Bills, who have lost seven straight road playoff games dating back three decades, beat the Chiefs, 30-21, in Week 11 in a game played in Buffalo. The Chiefs are a mind-boggling 15-2 in playoff games played since 2020 (they beat the Bills in three of those games, including a win in the 2021 AFC championship), so, yeah, they\u2019re battle-tested."

      "Drake, whose real name is Aubrey Drake Graham, filed an 81-page federal lawsuit Jan. 15 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which was obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "In his lawsuit, the Canadian rapper alleges that UMG \u201capproved, published, and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track that falsely accuses Drake of being a pedophile and calls for violent retribution against him.\u201d",
      "Drake is seeking nominal, punitive and compensatory damages, \u201cincluding general, actual, consequential, and special damages, in an amount to be determined at trial.\u201d He is also asking a judge to order UMG to state that the statements made in \u201cNot Like Us\u201d are false and order them to \u201cstop making statements about the popularity of the Recording, Image, or Video in \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019\u201d in addition to paying related attorney fees.",

      "The suit also details several violent break-in attempts at Drake\u2019s Toronto home that he and his legal team believe were \u201cproximately caused by\u201d the lyrics of \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Hamas has told Israel that eight of 26 Israeli hostages set to be released as part of the first phase of the ceasefire are dead, a Middle Eastern official briefed on the matter told NBC News on Monday.",
      "It is believed to be the first time that the militant group has said exactly how many hostages are dead or alive. Later, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said these numbers matched information gleaned by Israeli intelligence.",
      "The first three Israeli hostages \u2014 Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and\u00a0Emily Damari, a\u00a0dual British citizen \u2014 were freed earlier this month in exchange for 90 Palestinian detainees \u2014 mostly women and children.",
      "On Saturday, four female Israeli soldiers were released in exchange for 200 Palestinian prisoners, many of whom were serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks.",
      "The ceasefire\u2019s first phase, which is set to run until early March,  includes the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The second phase has yet to be fully negotiated.",
      "The fragile truce was placed in jeopardy Saturday after Israel prevented Palestinian civilians from moving back to their homes in northern Gaza. It said Hamas had violated the agreement because it had not released hostage Arbel Yehoud.",
      "Hamas also accused Israel of breaking the deal, but on Monday, Qatar, one of the leading mediators in the talks to bring an end to the fighting, said in a statement that Yehoud would be freed along with two other hostages before Friday.",
      "Three other captives are also set be released Saturday, and many in Israel are hopeful that Kfir Bibas, the youngest hostage still in captivity in the Gaza Strip, will be among those released.",
      "Kfir\u00a0was just shy of 9 months old when he was kidnapped during the\u00a0Hamas-led terrorist\u00a0attack on Oct. 7, 2023, along with his 5-year-old brother, Ariel, and his parents, Yarden and Shiri Bibas.",
      "He turned 2 earlier this month, having never known a birthday outside captivity.",
      "While all other child hostages were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners during a one-week ceasefire in November 2023, the Bibas family never emerged from Gaza, and on one of the final days of the brief pause in fighting, Hamas said in a statement that the toddler had been killed in an Israeli airstrike along with his mom and brother.",
      "Around 250 people were taken hostage and 1,200 people were killed on Oct. 7. After Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza in response, more than 47,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to health officials in the enclave."

    "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2025 17:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Multiple defectors from North Korea spoke to NBC News about the mindset of soldiers sent to fight for Russia in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Few people understand what may be going through the minds of North Korean soldiers fighting and dying for Russia in the war against Ukraine. But Lee Chul Eun is one of them.",
      "Lee, 38, a North Korean defector and former soldier now living in South Korea, said it is \u201cdevastating\u201d to see troops from the reclusive, communist-ruled North being sent abroad by leader Kim Jong Un, \u201conly to then give up their youth for a land that is not even theirs but the foreign land of Russia.\u201d",
      "He is one of multiple defectors who spoke to NBC News about the training, conditions and mindset of North Korean soldiers, including their willingness to take their own lives if necessary.",
      "Lee said his former colleagues \u201care essentially just sent out to be cannon fodder on the front lines.\u201d",
      "For the first time since they arrived in Russia in the fall, North Korean soldiers have been captured alive by Ukrainian forces, with video and photos showing one man with bandages around his jawline and another with bandaged hands.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who announced the prisoners\u2019 apprehension earlier this month, said they were living proof that North Korea had entered the war, in a major escalation of the yearslong conflict.",
      "The U.S. and allies say there are more than 11,000 North Korean troops fighting in the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion in August. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has confirmed the reports.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it is not easy to capture a North Korean soldier,\u201d Ryu Sung Hyu said in an interview in the South Korean capital, Seoul.",
      "All North Korean recruits are taught a song that includes a verse about saving their last bullet for themselves to avoid capture, said Ryu, who served in the North Korean military until 2019, when he escaped to freedom in South Korea.",
      "According to South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, there was at least one recent incident in which a North Korean soldier, faced with possible capture by Ukrainian forces, tried to detonate a grenade while shouting Kim\u2019s name but was killed before he could succeed.",
      "The South Korean military said last week that North Korea is preparing to send additional troops to Russia after about 300 of its soldiers were killed and 2,700 others were injured. The high casualty rate was due to the soldiers\u2019 poor understanding of modern warfare, as well as the way they were being deployed by Russia, South Korean lawmakers said.",
      "Their willingness to fight and die for Russia could be a major factor in determining the course of the Ukraine war, as well as the level of American military aid to Ukraine under President Donald Trump, who has expressed skepticism over continued U.S. support.",
      "Kim is thought to be providing Russian President Vladimir Putin with troops and weapons in hope of receiving technical assistance with his nuclear and ballistic missile programs. His flurry of weapons testing has continued with three launches already this year, including multiple short-range ballistic missiles, a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile and strategic cruise missiles.",
      "Trump drew ire from South Korea on Tuesday after he described the reclusive regime as a \u201cnuclear power,\u201d a phrase that U.S. officials have long refrained from using, as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.",
      "Kim is sending troops to Russia for two reasons, \u201cboth of which are driven by desperation,\u201d said Ahn Chan Il, who served in the North Korean military for over a decade and defected to South Korea in 1979. The first is to earn foreign currency, which is in short supply in North Korea under United Nations sanctions imposed over its weapons programs.",
      "The deployment also provides valuable experience for the North Korean military, which has not been deployed overseas since the Vietnam War.",
      "Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council this month that fighting alongside Russia makes North Korea \u201cmore capable of waging war against its neighbors.\u201d",
      "Lee, who spent five years in the North Korean military, said the troops had been sent to Russia as mercenaries rather than soldiers, noting that they weren\u2019t wearing their uniforms. South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service has said they were given Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, along with forged identification documents.",
      "\u201cEven if they die there it does not matter, because North Korea sent them out without officially recognizing them,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey were sent there not to bring honor to the country, but to give up their lives and bring back lots of money.\u201d",
      "'No longer a part of the society'",
      "Military service is compulsory in North Korea, which has one of the world\u2019s largest standing armies. Soldiers undergo three months of basic training before being assigned to a unit, said Lee, who came to South Korea in 2016 after swimming for six hours from the North.",
      "\u201cAs soldiers,\u201d Lee said, \u201cthey are told they are individuals who are now no longer a part of the society and their families, and must follow the orders of the supreme leader,\u201d meaning Kim.",
      "They have no trouble believing this, having been indoctrinated by North Korean propaganda from childhood, said Lee.",
      "North Korean soldiers spend most of their time not actually being soldiers but working on farms and construction projects, Lee and others said.",
      "\u201cI think I only fired three bullets per year,\u201d said Lee Hyun-seung, who served in the North Korean military for more than three years. When he moved to a more elite unit, he said, \u201cwe had more like 20 bullets.\u201d",
      "Asked whether he thought the North Korean troops could help Russia win the war, Lee \u2014 whose family defected in 2014 and who now lives in the U.S. \u2014 was skeptical.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not that sure,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I know their training and I know they are not well trained.\u201d",
      "For North Korean soldiers, who receive food and clothing but are otherwise essentially unpaid, the main enemy is hunger.",
      "North Korea struggles with food shortages as Kim devotes the majority of resources to his weapons programs, meaning that, like most of the broader population, soldiers suffer from malnutrition and can even starve to death.",
      "Meals are made up mainly of plain rice, corn or potatoes, sometimes mixed with grass or even tree bark, said Lee Chun Eul.",
      "He said his feelings about North Korea changed gradually, largely due to his exposure to foreign media that finds its way into the country despite tight government controls \u2014 \u201cJames Bond\u201d was a favorite of his growing up in the 1990s. More recently, the North Korean government has been alarmed by the popularity of South Korean TV dramas, sentencing two teenagers to 12 years of hard labor for watching them.",
      "\u201cWhen I look at North Korean mercenaries sent to Russia, I wonder if they would still have joined if they had watched as much foreign media as I did in North Korea,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI also wonder if the North Korean regime and Kim Jong Un\u2019s dictatorship would still be in place.\u201d",
      "The defectors say they hope the North Korean troops fighting in Russia will take the opportunity to leave like they did.",
      "\u201cWhen North Korean workers, who have lived their entire lives trapped in a restrictive system, experience life abroad, they come to see North Korea as nothing short of a prison,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cOnce they realize what freedom could mean, it\u2019s hard to imagine they wouldn\u2019t consider breaking free to live a freer life.\u201d",
      "In addition to finding freedom, they could provide the U.S. and others with valuable intelligence regarding the North Korean military\u2019s strategies and capabilities, which are often exaggerated by the North Korean government.",
      "Ahn and other North Koreans who defected as soldiers have offered Ukraine their assistance against the North Korean troops.",
      "\u201cHowever, rather than directly participating in the war, our focus is on psychological warfare to change the mindset of North Korean soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough platforms like YouTube or leaflets, we aim to deliver messages to the North Korean troops, urging them not to die meaningless deaths and instead seek freedom.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, they watch with heavy hearts as casualties mount among North Korean soldiers whose experiences they know only too well.",
      "\u201cThese young people did not go knowing they were going to die,\u201d Lee said, \u201cbut died because they did not know.",
      "Janis Mackey Frayer and Stella Kim reported from Seoul, South Korea, and Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong."

      "While the Israeli prime minister\u2019s office had yet to respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment regarding Trump\u2019s remarks, the president\u2019s sentiments were welcomed by ultranationalist Israeli politicians, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, who resigned as national security minister after Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s government voted to accept the ceasefire agreement.",
      "Smotrich called the idea of finding new homes for Gaza residents \u201cwonderful,\u201d telling Israeli broadcaster Channel 12 on Sunday that \u201conly out-of-the-box thinking and new solutions will bring peace and security.\u201d",

      "The future of the ceasefire may now hinge on what happens with one specific hostage: 29-year-old Arbel Yehud.",

      "Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for the Israeli military, added that Hamas had violated the ceasefire by not first releasing civilian hostages as part of the agreement, including Shiri Bibas, 33, who was abducted during the Hamas-led terror attack of Oct. 7 2023, with her two sons, 2-year-old Kfir and 5-year-old Ariel.",

    "title": "Trump says China controls the Panama Canal \u2014 but here's how it really works",
    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 10:35:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Experts dispute President Donald Trump\u2019s claims that the Panama Canal is controlled by China and overcharging U.S. ships.",
    "story": [
      "A quarter-century after the U.S. handed control of the Panama Canal to Panama, President Donald Trump wants to take it back.",
      "Early this month, Trump suggested he would consider using military force to regain control of the canal from Panama, one of the U.S.'s closest allies in Latin America, describing it as \u201cvital\u201d for national security.",
      "But his gripe is more with U.S. rival China, which he says is \u201coperating\u201d a critical waterway that serves as a transit point for almost 5% of the world's maritime trade.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t give it to China,\u201d Trump said Monday during his inaugural address. \u201cWe gave it to Panama, and we\u2019re taking it back.\u201d",
      "Panama strongly rebuked Trump\u2019s comments, with President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino saying the canal \u201cis and will continue to be Panama\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Mulino also rejected Trump\u2019s claim that China controls the canal.",
      "\u201cThere is no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration,\u201d he said Monday in a statement in Spanish.",
      "China said it agreed with the Panamanian president, saying the canal \u201cis not under the direct or indirect control of any power.\u201d\u201cChina does not participate in the management or operation of the canal and has never interfered in matters related to it,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. \u201cWe have always respected Panama\u2019s sovereignty over the canal and recognized it as a permanently neutral international waterway.\u201d",
      "The neutrality of the nearly 50-mile canal, through which nearly 15,000 ships transit each year, is enshrined in Panama\u2019s Constitution and is enforced by the autonomous Panama Canal Authority.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what has made the Panama Canal so successful, and why it\u2019s still one of the main commercial arteries of the world \u2014 because of this neutrality,\u201d said Beatriz Garc\u00eda Nice, a Latin America program associate at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington.",
      "The United States began building the canal in 1904, the year after Panama gained independence from Colombia with U.S. support. The project was completed in 1914 as part of efforts to cut the transit time for U.S. commercial and military ships that previously had to go all the way to the tip of South America just to get from one U.S. coast to the other.",
      "By the mid-20th century, control of the canal had become a source of tension between the U.S. and Panama, erupting into anti-American riots in 1964 that resulted in the deaths of four U.S. soldiers and more than 20 Panamanians.",
      "On Dec. 31, 1999, the U.S. relinquished control of the canal to Panama under a treaty negotiated by President Jimmy Carter and ratified by the Senate in 1978 in what Trump has called \u201ca terrible mistake.\u201d The U.S. retained the permanent right to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality.",
      "Several international companies that now manage ports along the canal, including the Seattle-based SSA Marine, which operates a cargo terminal on the Atlantic side, won their rights in bidding processes that were described as fair and nondiscriminatory by U.S. officials at the time.\u00a0In 1997, Hutchison Ports, a private company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong that manages 53 ports around the world, won the rights to manage two ports \u2014 Balboa on the Pacific side and Crist\u00f3bal on the Atlantic side.",
      "The Trump administration argues that China could use those ports to turn the Panama Canal into a \u201cchoke point\u201d against the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf these companies control both ends of that canal in a time of conflict, and the Chinese tell them, \u2018Shut it down and don\u2019t let the U.S. go through there,\u2019 we\u2019ve got a big, big problem,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week during his Senate confirmation hearing, \u201ca big economic problem and a big national security and defense problem.\u201d",
      "Though at opposite ends of the canal, the ports are not gateways to the waterway \u2014 ships do not have to pass through them to enter the canal. Instead, the ports mostly serve as places to handle cargo.",
      "\u201cIt would take an act of war, effectively, for the Chinese to shut it down,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask a port company to shut down a canal.\u201d",
      "Trump also claimed that the U.S. has been \u201covercharged\u201d for its ships to sail through the canal, saying that Panama was in \u201cviolation\u201d of the treaty.\u201cAmerican ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form. And that includes the United States Navy,\u201d he said in the inaugural address.",
      "Because the waterway, which is fed by a freshwater lake, is seeing its water levels decrease because of a warming climate, the Panama Canal Authority has limited the number of ships that can pass through daily and raised fees for all ships regardless of the country they belong to.",
      "\u201cThe fees have been raised across the board in a professional, transparent manner, nothing less, nothing more,\u201d Sabatini said. \u201cIt is simply like any different toll that is managed professionally and independently.\u201d",
      "Sabatini and Nice say the growing accusations could hurt U.S. relations with Panama, where China has been making inroads.",
      "\u201cWhat this is doing is questioning even further if the United States is a reliable partner, especially in face of the Chinese influence that is already in the region,\u201d Nice said.",
      "As for Trump\u2019s threat to use military force to retake the canal, Sabatini said such a drastic action would require Senate approval.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an international treaty, it was approved by the U.S. Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not something that the executive can unilaterally decide to revoke.\u201d",
      "Still, the Panama Canal Authority has launched an audit of Hutchison Ports, which Nice said was an attempt to placate Washington.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to not confront one of your biggest allies and are saying, \u2018If this is going to help and sort of bring down the temperature, then we will do it,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Hutchison Ports said it was fully cooperating with the audit and remained committed \u201cto excellence and ethics in each of our operations,\u201d Bloomberg News reported, citing a statement. The company did not respond to an NBC News request for comment.",
      "Trump also vastly overstated the number of Americans killed during construction of the canal, saying 38,000 lives were lost. About 5,600 out of 56,000 workers are believed to have died from injury or disease during the U.S. phase of construction, according to the Panama Canal Authority, most of whom were from the Caribbean.",
      "For many Panamanians, the canal\u2019s independence is a matter of pride.",
      "\u201cThe Canal was not a concession from anyone. It was the result of generational struggles that culminated in 1999,\u201d President Mulino said. \u201cSince then until now, for 25 years, without interruption, we have managed and expanded it responsibly to serve the world and its commerce, including the United States.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "In a freewheeling Inauguration Day of speeches, casual remarks and formal balls, President Donald Trump wasted no time trying to shape the world in his unmistakable image.",
      "Unlike four years ago, when his term began in a flurry of unpreparedness, this time Trump let fly with a series of actions and statements that seek to scrub many of former President Joe Biden\u2019s decisions and replace them with Trump's own stark imprimatur.",
      "From tariffs, TikTok and the Middle East to the climate crisis and world health, here are the headlines of Trump\u2019s foreign policy moves during the first 24 hours of a term set to last 1,461 days \u2014 and how the world reacted.",
      "Russia",
      "The president previously claimed he would end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office. \u201cThis is only half a day. I have another half a day left,\u201d he said Monday.",
      "That idea sparked alarm in Europe, which worries that Trump could force Ukraine into a negotiation that favors Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has more recently stretched this timeline to as long as six months, which some have taken as a signal of support for Ukraine.",
      "On Monday, Trump appeared to criticize Putin \u2014 one of the authoritarian leaders he has spoken warmly about in the past, saying he is \u201cnot doing so well.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not making him look very good,\u201d Trump said of how the war is going for Putin, adding that he was \u201cdestroying Russia by not making a deal.\u201d",
      "When asked Tuesday about Trump\u2019s comments, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that \u201cwe respect the choice of the American people\u201d and that \u201cTrump has also repeatedly given reason to say that they also respect the choice of the Russian people.\u201d",
      "Middle East",
      "On the nascent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, something his team helped broker, the president said he was \u201cnot confident\u201d that the truce would last, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s not our war. It\u2019s their war.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials credit Trump's Middle East peace envoy, Steve Witkoff,\u00a0with helping get that deal over the line.",
      "On Gaza \u2014 where Israeli airstrikes have displaced most of the population and killed more than 46,000 people, according to local authorities \u2014 he hinted at his real estate background.",
      "\u201cGaza is like a massive demolition site. That place has really got to be rebuilt in a different way,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit\u2019s a phenomenal location on the sea, best weather. ... Some beautiful things could be done with it.\u201d",
      "Trump also rescinded Biden\u2019s sanctions on Israel settlers in the occupied West Bank, who have been accused of violence against Palestinians.",
      "The president\u2019s first term was characterized by a succession of pro-Israel moves, including moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and ditching the Iran nuclear deal. The 2020 Abraham Accords, establishing relations between Israel and several Middle Eastern and North African countries, was perhaps the first Trump administration\u2019s biggest foreign policy achievement.",
      "North Korea",
      "In South Korea, there was palpable nervousness after Trump referred to North Korea as a \u201cnuclear power.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials have long refrained from using the phrase as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state. South Korea said Tuesday that North Korea \u201ccan never be recognized\u201d as such.",
      "Among the norm-busting sagas of the president's first term was his nuclear brinkmanship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. The two traded personal insults and nuclear threats, before Trump told  the world that \"we fell in love.\"",
      "China",
      "While campaigning in 2024, Trump suggested he could slap a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, risking a rerun of the Beijing trade war he fought during his first term.",
      "Now he suggests these tariffs could be used to force through a deal in which the U.S. acquires half of the social media platform TikTok. An executive order Trump signed Monday postponed for 75 days a Biden law that requires the Chinese tech giant ByteDance to sell its stake in TikTok or see the platform banned in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. should be entitled to get half of TikTok,\u201d Trump told reporters. Asked about ByteDance\u2019s close ties with the Chinese government, he said he \u201ccould see a deal\u201d in which the U.S. \u201cpolices it a little \u2014 maybe a lot.\u201d",
      "Trump also reiterated his comments about the Panama Canal and \u201ctaking it back,\u201d claiming the key waterway was being controlled by China.",

      "Europe's far right",
      "While U.S. inaugurations have historically been largely domestic affairs, figures on the global political right \u2014 including some on its extreme hard-right populist fringes \u2014 were invited to Washington on Monday.",
      "Among them were lawmakers from Alternative for Germany, a far-right nationalist party under surveillance by Berlin for suspected extremism that Trump ally Elon Musk has recently championed.",
      "Italy\u2019s staunch anti-immigration Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also attended.",
      "Hungary's populist prime minister, Viktor Orban, a longtime Trump ally, said Trump's inauguration would aid the far-right's political assault on the European Union's mainstream.",
      "\u201cSo the great attack can start,\" he said at an event in Budapest. \"Hereby I launch the second phase of the offensive that aims to occupy Brussels.\u201d",
      "He is an arch antagonist of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who offered her own assessment.",
      "\u201cWe have entered a new era of harsh geostrategic competition,\u201d she said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cBreaking the bonds in the global economy is in no one\u2019s interest.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump alarmed European leaders by suggesting he might not defend them against Russia unless they paid more toward defense. He reiterated his latest demand Monday for those countries to contribute 5% of their gross domestic products toward defense, more than double NATO's recommendation.",
      "He has also unnerved Denmark by suggesting he might take its autonomous territory of Greenland by force.",
      "Climate change",
      "As expected, one of Trump\u2019s first executive orders was to leave the 2016 Paris climate change accord, in which countries agreed to limit post-industrial temperature rises to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "This will put the United States alongside Yemen, Iran and Libya as nonsignatories to the deal, which Trump said was a \u201crip-off\u201d but experts say is still humanity\u2019s best hope at limiting catastrophe.",
      "Earlier this month, the Biden administration announced a ban \u2014 which would require an act of Congress to reverse \u2014 on new offshore oil and gas drilling along most of the U.S. coastline.",
      "Even so, the Paris agreement does not \"reflect our country\u2019s values,\u201d the White House said, with Trump instead promising to \"drill, baby, drill.\u201d",
      "The WHO",
      "It was likewise anticipated that Trump would junk Washington\u2019s role in the World Health Organization. He has alleged that the global health body aided Chinese government efforts to \u201cmislead the world\u201d over Covid \u2014 something both the WHO and Beijing deny.",
      "The U.S. is by far the WHO\u2019s biggest financial backer, providing 18% of its $6.8 billion budget. Signing an executive order to leave the WHO, Trump said that China\u2019s lower contribution but higher population \u201cseems a little unfair to me.\u201d",
      "Experts say that leaving the organization could undermine worldwide programs to tackle diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS."

      "The\u00a0localizer\u00a0aids navigation of an aircraft making an approach to the runway, and the structure built of reinforced concrete and earth at Muan airport supporting the system\u2019s antennae most likely contributed to the high death toll, experts have said.",
      "The investigation will tear down the engines, examine components in depth, analyze in-flight and air traffic control data, and investigate the embankment, localizers and evidence of bird strike, the report said about its next steps.",

      "The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement said the hostage release \u2014 which will include soldier Agam Berger \u2014 will take place Thursday, and it confirmed that Palestinians can move north on Monday. Israel\u2019s military said people can start crossing on foot at 7 a.m.",

      "The release of Yehoud and two others is in addition to the one already set for next Saturday, when three hostages should be released.",
      "In addition, Hamas in a statement said the militant group had handed over a list of required information about all hostages to be released in the ceasefire\u2019s six-week first phase. The Israeli prime minister\u2019s office confirmed it had received it.",

      "Israel has pulled back from several areas of Gaza under the ceasefire, which came into effect last Sunday. The military has warned people to stay away from its forces, which still operate in a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border and in the Netzarim corridor.",
      "Hamas freed four female Israeli soldiers on Saturday, and Israel released some 200 Palestinian prisoners, most of whom were serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks. But Israel said Yehoud should have been released ahead of the soldiers.",

Around 90 hostages are still in Gaza, and Israeli authorities believe at least a third, and up to half, have died.",

The second \u2014 and far more difficult \u2014 phase, has yet to be negotiated. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war, while Israel has threatened to resume its offensive until Hamas is destroyed.",
      "Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. More than 100 were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023.

Seven have been freed in the latest ceasefire.",

      "But his opponents, many of whom are imprisoned or exiled abroad by his unrelenting crackdown on dissent and free speech, would disagree. They call the election a sham \u2014 much like the last one in 2020 that triggered months of protests that were unprecedented in the history of the country of 9 million people.",
      "The crackdown saw more than 65,000 arrests, with thousands beaten, bringing\u00a0condemnation and sanctions\u00a0from the West.",
      "His iron-fisted rule since 1994 \u2014 Lukashenko took office two years after the demise of the Soviet Union \u2014 earned him the nickname of \u201cEurope\u2019s Last Dictator,\u201d relying on subsidies and political support from close ally Russia.",

      "\u201cThe trauma of the 2020 protests was so deep that Lukashenko this time decided not to take risks and opted for the most reliable option when balloting looks more like a special operation to retain power than an election,\u201d Belarusian political analyst Valery Karbalevich said.",

      "At home, early voting that began Tuesday has created fertile ground for irregularities with ballot boxes unguarded until election day, the opposition said. A record 41.81% of voters cast ballots in five days of early voting. Meanwhile, Viasna activists reported internet issues across the country, and alleged Lukashenko\u2019s government was blocking access to VPN services commonly used to evade censorship.",
      "Polling stations have removed the curtains covering ballot boxes, and voters are forbidden from photographing their ballots \u2014 a response to the opposition\u2019s call in 2020 for voters to take pictures to make it more difficult for authorities to rig the vote.",
      "Police conducted large-scale drills before the election. An Interior Ministry video showed helmeted riot police beating their shields with truncheons as a way to prepare for protest dispersals. Another featured an officer arresting a man posing as a voter, twisting his arm next to a ballot box.",
      "Belarus initially refused to allow observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored previous elections. It changed course this month and invited the OSCE \u2014 when it was already too late to organize a monitoring mission.",

      "\u201cUntil 2020, Lukashenko could maneuver and play Russia against the West, but now when Belarus\u2019 status is close to that of Russia\u2019s satellite, this North Korea-style election ties the Belarusian leader to the Kremlin even stronger, shortening the leash,\u201d said Artyom Shraybman, a Belarus expert with the Carnegie Russia and Eurasia Center.",

      "In an apparent reference to Germany\u2019s Nazi history, the head of the Trump administration\u2019s Department of\u00a0Government\u00a0Efficiency, whose smiling face was projected onto a vast screen, told a roaring crowd that \u201cchildren should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great-grandparents.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is too much focus on past guilt, and we need to move beyond that,\u201d he added at the rally in the eastern German city of Halle.",

      "The AfD has successfully used Germany\u2019s debate over immigration to bolster its popularity. The party adopted an explicitly anti-Islam policy in May 2016, and its 2017 election manifesto included a section on why \u201cIslam does not belong to Germany.\u201d",
      "The topic of immigration was one of many Musk discussed during an X broadcast earlier this month in which he spent more than an hour speaking with AfD co-leader Alice Weidel.",
      "As he has become increasingly vocal about his apparent move to the right of the political spectrum, Musk has thrown his support behind numerous right-wing causes, including the United Kingdom\u2019s hard-right Reform UK party and Italy\u2019s far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, calling her a \u201cprecious genius.\u201d",
      "But his most zealous support has been for the AfD, which heads into February\u2019s elections polling in second place after the collapse of Germany\u2019s left-led coalition government.",
      "While other German political parties have refused to join coalitions with the AfD due to its extreme positions, Musk has given the group a significant boost, most notably \u2014 before Saturday at least \u2014 with his X interview with Weidel.",
      "In the conversation, Weidel said that AfD is \u201cexactly the opposite\u201d of Adolf Hitler\u2019s party, adding that it\u2019s Europe\u2019s left-wing political parties who are antisemitic.",
      "\u201cWe are wrongly framed the entire time,\u201d she said."

      "The charges are unprecedented for a South Korean president, and if convicted,\u00a0Yoon\u00a0could face years in prison for his shock martial law decree, which sought to ban political and parliamentary activity and control the media.",
      "His move set off a wave of\u00a0political upheaval\u00a0in Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy and a top U.S. ally, with the prime minister also impeached and suspended from power and a number of top military officials indicted for their roles in the alleged insurrection.",

      "Over the weekend a court twice refused prosecutors\u2019 request to extend his detention while they conducted further investigation, but with the charges they have again requested that he be kept in custody, media reports said.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers had urged the prosecutors to release him immediately from what they call illegal custody.",

      "BEIJING \u2014 For women in China, it may feel as if there is little to laugh about these days.",
      "The world\u2019s second-largest economy is struggling to recover from the pandemic, and the government is cracking down on feminist activism as it encourages women to embrace \u201ctraditional\u201d female roles as wives and mothers.",
      "But women were laughing nonetheless, as amateur performers told jokes about office and family life to a small but engaged audience of about 20 people, mostly young women, at a Western restaurant in Beijing on a recent winter evening.",
      "Alex Wang, the only female performer out of about half a dozen that night, said she felt \u201cempowered\u201d when she first got on stage a few years ago.",
      "Though \u201cbeing funny is the most important thing,\u201d she said in an interview after her performance, \u201cI want to grow not just as a comedian but as a woman finding her voice in this space.\u201d",
      "The growing role of women in China\u2019s stand-up scene, along with the recent success of funny female-oriented films, reflect one way feminism is breaking into the Chinese mainstream: through comedy.",
      "The feminist movement is facing strong resistance in China, even as women attain new educational heights and make strides in the workplace.",
      "For the first time in decades, there is not a single woman among the 24 members of the Politburo, the senior leadership of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.\u00a0President Xi Jinping has personally called on women to embrace a \u201cchildbearing culture\u201d as the world\u2019s once-most-populous country struggles with low birth rates.",
      "The government has made no secret of its crackdown on feminist activity. In June, Chinese journalist and #MeToo activist Huang Xueqin was sentenced to five years in prison for subversion.",
      "But even Chinese state media had praise for \u201cHer Story,\u201d a feminist comedy directed by and starring women that was a box-office hit in China late last year. The state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily lauded the film\u2019s portrayal of the \u201chumorous and absurd\u201d aspects of daily life.",
      "The film has been described as China\u2019s answer to the 2023 hit \u201cBarbie,\u201d openly calling out stereotypes about women, sexuality, single parenting and divorce \u2014 all issues that can be sensitive here.",
      "\u201cHer Story\u201d may be able to get around that in part because its social critique is couched in comedy, said Feng Yuan, the founding director of Beijing Equality, a women\u2019s rights and gender equality nongovernment organization.",
      "In addition to helping evade censors, comedy is a \u201chandy tool to speak out your anger,\u201d she said.",
      "The film tells the story of Wang Tiemei, a newly unemployed single mother of a 9-year-old daughter, and their young female neighbor Xiao Ye in Shanghai. Despite their different personalities, the two women form a strong bond as they navigate personal challenges, including Wang\u2019s abusive ex-husband.",
      "Its frank tone has also inspired discussions about female sexuality akin to those set off by recent U.S. films such as the Nicole Kidman-starring erotic thriller \u201cBabygirl.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare to see stories about single moms or just women\u2019s lives in general,\u201d Zhang Tong, 25, said at a Beijing theater last month after seeing \u201cHer Story,\u201d which she called \u201cquite moving.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will help more women, especially young women, understand themselves better and feel empowered to live for themselves,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHer Story\u201d has made 720 million yuan ($99 million) since its release on Nov. 22, according to the Chinese box office site Maoyan, and has a score of 9.1 out of 10 on Douban, a Chinese film rating site.",
      "Though the film did not crack China\u2019s top 10 highest-grossing films last year, another movie directed by and starring women, \u201cYolo,\u201d topped the list at 3.4 billion yuan ($470 million). Its director, Chinese comedian Jia Ling, also directed the 2021 female-oriented comedy \u201cHi, Mom,\u201d which grossed more than 5.4 billion yuan ($742 million), making her the world\u2019s top-grossing female filmmaker until Greta Gerwig with \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "The success of these films marks a shift in the Chinese box office, the second-largest in the world after the United States, where the biggest movies have typically been male-dominated, patriotism-themed blockbusters.",
      "\u201cMy movie delivers something different from others, showing some novelty, so people like it,\u201d Shao Yihui, the director of \u201cHer Story,\u201d told state-run broadcaster CCTV.",
      "Women who perform stand-up comedy in China say they are also offering something different in an industry that only a few years ago was a sea of men.",
      "Wang said her jokes are informed partly by her experience as a woman.",
      "\u201cFor example, earlier I had a bit where I made fun of those awful guys who think everyone in the world is into them,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve also done material on topics like period stigma.\u201d",
      "She cited the influence of Yang Li, who is perhaps the most recognizable female figure in Chinese stand-up comedy. At her peak, she performed in front of millions of viewers on national television, delivering punchlines on the male psyche.",
      "\u201cI think what she and other everyday female comedians talk about, especially from a female perspective, really reflects the current state of society,\u201d Wang said. \u201cTheir material brings attention to issues women face, and you can clearly see how those jokes resonate with people.\u201d",
      "But they don\u2019t resonate with everyone.",
      "In October, Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com ended a promotional campaign featuring Yang after men offended by her ribbing flooded social media with complaints and accused of her of provoking \u201cgender antagonism,\u201d a term also used by Chinese state media to criticize feminism.",
      "As feminists have raised their voices in China, so have those with misogynist views, Feng said, and Yang made for a clear target.",
      "\u201cThey are always looking for some outlet to release their anger,\u201d she said.",
      "Chinese comedians say they have to be mindful of censors as well as fragile egos and cultural sensitivities. In 2023, a Chinese entertainment firm representing a stand-up comic was fined almost $2 million after he was accused of insulting the People\u2019s Liberation Army during a Beijing performance. The entire industry went to ground for more than a year, with stand-up comedy not returning to Chinese television until last fall.",
      "\u201cFor a Chinese audience, a lot of topics, it is kind of like we are not sure if we can laugh at that,\u201d said Nico Toomuch, 34, a stand-up comedian in Beijing.",
      "That hasn\u2019t stopped Toomuch, who has been performing since 2016, from joking about everything from marriage to menstruation and depression \u2014 drawing in part on her strengths as a woman.",
      "\u201cWe are more sensitive, emotional, and we are better at observing things,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we can take a joke, so we can deliver one.\u201d"

In the nearby Baltic Sea, NATO ships are hunting Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cShadow Fleet\u201d accused of cutting undersea communications cables. And in Europe\u2019s skies there are plans to construct a vast missile defense system, similar to Israel\u2019s \u201cIron Dome\u201d but with the explicit purpose of shooting down rockets launched by Moscow.",
      "European governments and citizens worry that an emboldened Kremlin may turn his armies their way after Ukraine. There is also widespread nervousness that the new U.S. president \u2014 an isolationist \u2014 has suggested he may not defend America\u2019s historical NATO allies if they are attacked by Russia.",
      "While President Donald Trump this week criticized Vladimir Putin,  Trump has showed few signs of a meaningful shift from that position. On Thursday, he said in an interview with Fox News that Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cwas fighting a much bigger entity,\u201d and that \u201che shouldn\u2019t have done that, because we could have made a deal.\u201d",
      "He said little new about NATO or Europe, only reiterating his latest demand for European allies to pay 5% of their GDP toward defense \u2014 more than twice the NATO recommendation \u2014 and lamenting how much more Washington has spent than Brussels toward supporting Ukraine\u2019s defense.",
      "\u201cNATO has to pay more,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous because it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean in between.\u201d",
      "The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. European officials have repeatedly stated that Putin is preparing for a war with the West. For many, this is already happening, with think tank analysts, governments and NATO itself accusing Moscow of \u201chybrid warfare\u201d attacks \u2014 from election interference to trying to crash airliners with firebombs.",
      "\u201cThe Europeans are taking this very seriously,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe between 2014 and late 2017.",
      "In particular, countries in Eastern Europe nearer the Russian border \u201cknow that this is for real, because they live there,\u201d Hodges added. \u201cIt\u2019s only those people who live in Western Europe or the U.S., far away from the Bear, who say: \u2018Come on, this is not going to happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "The core tenet of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is that allies will defend any fellow member under attack. The only time this \u201cArticle 5\u201d promise has been triggered was after 9/11, when Europe helped the United States patrol its skies in an act of solidarity. The main message of that stipulation is that if a country attacks Europe, it will also be at war with Washington, and its intended audience is Russia.",
      "But Trump has repeatedly suggested he would ignore Europe\u2019s distress call.",
      "Plenty of those in Europe\u2019s corridors of power agree that a complacent continent has for too long relied on Washington\u2019s protection. French President Emmanuel Macron, a longtime proponent of European self-reliance,\u00a0said Monday that Trump\u2019s second term should serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the continent.",
      "In comments made at a defense conference on Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, agreed with Trump\u2019s assessment of European spending, saying that \u201cRussia poses an existential threat to our security today, tomorrow and for as long as we underinvest in our defense.\u201d",
      "Many of these critics remain nonetheless alarmed.",
      "\u201cWhile every president has complained that European countries don\u2019t do enough, there never was a question about American commitment,\u201d said Hodges. \u201cThis causes a lot of anxiety.\u201d",
      "In the short term, Trump and key members of his incoming administration have vowed to quickly end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, likely impossible without huge territorial concessions from Kyiv. Effectively giving Russia a win would be a signal to the Kremlin that aggression is rewarded and the West has no appetite to intervene, critics say.",
      "\u201cRussia is preparing for a war with the West,\u201d German foreign intelligence chief Bruno Kahl said in a November speech.",
      "For years, experts and government officials have accused Moscow of spreading disinformation, launching cyberattacks and using any other means necessary to meddle in the elections of democratic countries.",
      "Though Moscow denies it. Western officials and experts are near united in agreeing that this campaign only seems to be expanding.",
      "Last month, Finnish authorities seized an oil tanker they suspected of having severed undersea power and internet cables. That was among a spate of incidents that prompted NATO to launch operation \u201cBaltic Sentry,\u201d stepping up maritime patrols.",
      "Meanwhile, Western officials said Russia was responsible for sending two incendiary devices to DHL logistics hubs in Germany and the United Kingdom in July as part of a wider sabotage campaign to possibly start fires aboard North America-bound aircraft.",
      "In response, Europe has reversed decades of military underfunding, with most of its big powers now hitting the NATO guideline of 2% of GDP spent on defense. Spending started to increase in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea, although Trump is widely credited for accelerating it.",
      "On Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s defense commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, announced that Lithuania intends to spend between 5% and 6% of its GDP on defense in the coming years.",
      "Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has focused minds further.",
      "In March, the European Union allocated 500 million euros (around $515 million) to double shell ammunition production to 2 million units per year. And 22 countries have now joined the European Sky Shield Initiative, a continentwide missile defense system designed to protect against Russian attacks.",
      "\u201cEurope must be prepared for the most extreme military contingencies,\u201d a spokesperson for the bloc told NBC News in an email when asked whether the continent was preparing for a worst-case scenario of war with Russia. \u201cPut simply: to prevent war we need to spend more. If we wait more, it\u2019ll cost us more.\u201d",
      "Asked if that change was prompted by Trump\u2019s suggestion he may not defend Europe as well as Putin, the spokesperson referred only to the Russian president, whose war in Ukraine they said \u201cchallenges the international rules-based order itself.\u201d",
      "For its part, Ukraine\u2019s reaction to the re-election and inauguration of Trump has been assiduously diplomatic. On Inauguration Day, Zelenskyy said in a post on X that Trump \u201cis always decisive\u201d and that his second term was an opportunity to \u201cachieve a long-term and just peace.\u201d",
      "Whatever the impetus, \u201cthe mindset has changed big time,\u201d said Vytis Jurkonis, who leads the Lithuanian office of Freedom House, an international pro-democracy group.",
      "\u201cWe need to make it very clear to the Kremlin that any attack against a NATO member is going to cost and have consequences,\u201d said Jurkonis, who also teaches politics at Lithuania\u2019s Vilnius University.",
      "The Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are particularly vulnerable, perched on the Baltic Sea between mainland Russia and the heavily militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.",
      "For decades occupied by the Soviet Union, these now-Westernized states are only now constructing \u201cthe Baltic Defense Line,\u201d a frontier hundreds of miles long dotted with anti-tank trenches and pillboxes. Lithuania has already purchased warehouses full of \u201cdragon\u2019s teeth\u201d \u2014 concrete pyramids designed to stop tanks \u2014 and plans to mine its bridges to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, its defense ministry told NBC News.",
      "Lithuania recently said it would raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, the highest in NATO and far more, proportionally, than Washington\u2019s 3.4%. That\u2019s still lower than Russia, with the Kremlin effectively reordering its economy along a war footing and committing at least 6.2% of its inflation-hit finances to its military.",
      "In western Scandinavia, meanwhile, Norway has updated its emergency preparedness booklet that it hands out to all citizens, telling them how much water, food and other supplies to stockpile in case of \u201cacts of war.\u201d The 20-page document has historically focused on extreme weather and accidents, but its most recent version notes that \u201cwe live in an increasingly turbulent world\u201d and warns that \u201cin the event of an act of war, you may be notified that you should seek shelter.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Swedish church authorities \u2014 on guidance from Sweden\u2019s armed forces \u2014 have begun looking for extra cemetery space should such a conflict reach their shores. And Germany committed around 100 million euros to reinstate public sirens that were removed when the Iron Curtain fell.",
      "And yet there are plenty of observers who believe that Europe is not doing nearly enough.",
      "Western European countries such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom have only committed \u201csmall percentage uplifts to defense budgets, which is nothing like the transformative investment\u201d in Eastern Europe, said Keir Giles, a leading defense analyst at London\u2019s Chatham House think tank.",
      "For Giles, author of \u201cWho Will Defend Europe? An Awakened Russia and a Sleeping Continent,\u201d the problem is that \u201ccountries further away are still pretending that war is something that happens to other people.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s more, efforts are further complicated by the political situation. Europe\u2019s mainstream parties are being challenged by populists, who often mix their vehement opposition to immigration with a softer \u2014 and sometimes even friendly \u2014 stance toward Russia.",
      "That\u2019s a problem for those who argue Russia\u2019s war on Europe has already begun.",
      "\u201cAnybody who isn\u2019t worried hasn\u2019t been paying attention,\u201d said Giles."

      "The military alliance and joint drills between South Korea and the U.S. were to blame for the growing tensions in the region, the ministry said in a statement carried by KCNA.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Mexico denied a U.S. military plane access to land Thursday, at least temporarily frustrating the Trump administration's plans to deport immigrants to the country, according to two U.S. defense officials and a third person familiar with the situation.",
      "Two Guatemala-bound Air Force C-17s, carrying about 80 people apiece, flew deportees out of the U.S. Thursday night, the sources said. The third flight, slotted for Mexico, never took off.",
      "It was not immediately clear why Mexico blocked the flight, but tensions between the U.S. and Mexico, neighbors and longtime allies, have risen since President Donald Trump won the November election. Trump has threatened to slap 25% across-the-board tariffs on Mexico in retaliation for migrants crossing the border the countries share. But he has not yet put them in effect.",
      "A White House official said in a text message that \u201cthe flights thing was an administrative issue and was quickly rectified.\u201d",
      "After the publication of this article, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt tweeted, \"Yesterday, Mexico accepted a record 4 deportation flights in 1 day!\"",
      "A White House official did not clarify whether they were military, commercial or private flights.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security official later told NBC News that the four deportation flights accepted by Mexico on Thursday were run by Ice Air Operations and were government-chartered flights, not military aircraft.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's government has said it opposes Trump taking \"unilateral\" action to implement restrictive immigration standards \u2014 including the reinstatement of a \"remain in Mexico\" policy that forces migrants to stay in that country while they await adjudication of asylum claims. Flying deportees into a foreign country requires the cooperation of that nation's government.",
      "In a statement, Mexico's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not go into detail on why the U.S. plane was not allowed to land in the country.",
      "\u201cMexico has a very good relationship with the United States government and we cooperate with respect for our sovereignty on a wide range of issues, including migration,\" the statement read. \"When it comes to repatriations, we will always welcome the arrival of Mexicans to our territory with open arms. Mexico embraces you.\u201d",
      "On Friday, Guatemala received three flights from the U.S. with Guatemalan nationals who had been sent back to their home country. A spokesperson for the Guatemalan Migration Institute told NBC News that two of Friday's flights were on military aircraft and the other was on a non-military plane. The total number of Guatemalans who arrived in Guatemala City from the three flights was about 265.",
      "The military deportation flights are part of a broader Trump administration crackdown on illegal immigration that has been set in motion with executive orders signed in his first week in office. During his campaign, he vowed to stop illegal immigration into the U.S. and pursue a campaign of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants already living in the country.",
      "In addition to the flights, he has enlisted the military to beef up its presence on the border with an additional 1,500 troops."
