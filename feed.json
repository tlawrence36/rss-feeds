      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Corinne Bailey Rae is working on a children's picture book that draws upon her early memories of music.",
      "The Grammy-winning singer-songwriter has a deal with Rocky Pond Books, an imprint of Penguin Young Readers, for \u201cPut Your Records On.\u201d Named for her signature hit and illustrated by Gillian Eilidh O\u2019Mara, the book is scheduled to come out March 3, 2026, and tells the story of a young girl's initiation into her great aunt's record collection.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a child, music helped me find myself. Through songs I discovered that others felt what I felt,\" Rae said in a statement released Wednesday. \"Playing music grew my confidence and writing and performing my own music allowed me to fully express myself. I want every child to know that they have music in their heart and a voice that should be heard.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump is taking his seat in the president's box for opening night of the award-winning musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d at the Kennedy Center",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is set to take a seat at Wednesday's opening night of the award-winning musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\" at the Kennedy Center, where he replaced the previous leadership with loyalists, had himself installed as chairman and pledged to rid the performing arts venue of programming he has complained is \u201cwoke\u201d and too focused on leftist ideology and political correctness.",
      "The Republican president's attendance at the sold-out showing of the Tony Award-winning tale of redemption in 19th century France comes as he has focused more than any recent predecessor on the arts center along the Potomac River that is a memorial to a slain Democratic president.",
      "Presidents' involvement in the Kennedy Center's affairs had been limited to naming members to the board of trustees and attending the taping of its annual honors program in the fall.",
      "But after returning to office in January, Trump stunned the arts world by firing the Kennedy Center's longtime director and board and replacing them with loyalists, who then named him as chairman, and promising to overhaul its programming, management and even appearance as part of an effort to put his stamp on the national arts scene.",
      "Trump's appearance in the Opera House on Wednesday, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, will also mark his first time at a Kennedy Center performance as president. He avoided the venue after entertainment industry pushback to his policies in his first term in office, breaking with presidential tradition by never attending the annual Kennedy Center Honors taping.",
      "His moves have upset some of the center's patrons and performers.",
      "In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters.",
      "Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump's takeover, and several touring productions, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d have canceled planned runs at the center. Artists such as actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens scrapped scheduled appearances, and Kennedy Center consultants including musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming have resigned.",
      "Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d cast members.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has adopted a more aggressive posture toward the arts. The White House has taken steps to cancel millions of dollars in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups, and Trump\u2019s budget blueprint proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "Trump has also targeted Smithsonian museums by signing executive orders to restrict their funding and by attempting to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery.",
      "Trump hosted the board at the White House for dinner in May and said congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250 million for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center. He claimed that \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d had been spent at the center but \u201cthey certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\u201d",
      "He characterized previous programming as \u201cout of control with rampant political propaganda\u201d and said it featured \u201csome very inappropriate shows,\u201d including a \u201cMarxist anti-police performance\u201d and \u201cLesbian-only Shakespeare.\u201d",
      "Trump cited some drag show performances as a reason to take control of the center, though next season's theater lineup includes \u201dMrs. Doubtfire,\" which tells the story of a divorced man who disguises himself as a female nanny so he can spend time with his children.",
      "Trump also visited the Kennedy Center in March to preside over a board meeting and take a tour.",
      "The Kennedy Center, which is supported by government money and private donations, opened in 1971 and for decades has been seen as an apolitical celebration of the arts.",
      "It was first conceived in the late 1950s, during the administration of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a National Culture Center. In the early 1960s, Democratic President John F. Kennedy launched a fundraising initiative, and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed into law a 1964 bill renaming the project the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.",

      "German news agency dpa reported that his family confirmed he died at the university hospital in his hometown of D\u00fcsseldorf in western Germany Tuesday night. They did not give a cause of death.",
      "For decades, Uecker, who was often dubbed \u201cthe nail artist,\u201d created art by hammering carpenter\u2019s nails into chairs, pianos, sewing machines and canvases. His works can be found in museums and collections across the globe.",
      "In his art work, seemingly endless numbers of nails, which would by themselves perhaps be perceived as potentially aggressive and hurtful, turned into harmonic, almost organic creations. His reliefs with the tightly hewn nails are reminiscent of waving grasses or fields of algae in a marine landscape.",
      "Uecker himself described his nail art as diary-like landscapes of the soul, which he called an \u201cexpression of the poetic power of man,\u201d dpa reported.",
      "Hendrik W\u00fcst, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia which includes state capital D\u00fcsseldorf, called Uecker \u201cone of the most important and influential artists in German post-war history\u201d and said that with his life\u2019s work, he influenced generations of young artists and \u201ccontributed to an open and dynamic society.\"",
      "Born on March 13, 1930, in the village of Wendorf on the Baltic Sea, Uecker moved to D\u00fcsseldorf in the mid-1950s, where he studied and later also taught at the city's prestigious art academy.",
      "In one of his most spectacular appearances or art happenings, he rode on the back of a camel through the hallways of the venerable academy in 1978. Together with fellow artist Gerhard Richter, he \u201coccupied\u201d the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden museum in 1968, with both kissing in front of the cameras.",
      "The son of a farmer, he traveled the world with a humanitarian message of peace and exhibited in countless countries, including dictatorships and totalitarian states. He painted ash pictures after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986, and exhibited human rights messages painted on fabric in Beijing.",
      "He also painted \u201cVerletzungsw\u00f6rter,\u201d or words of violence, killing and torment in many languages and foreign scripts on large canvases. In 2023, Uecker erected a stone memorial in Weimar in memory of the victims of the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald.",
      "\u201cThe theme of my artistic work is the vulnerability of man by man,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cDuring the years, there has been a sort of evolutionary history, you could say. And you could see these animals as sort of natural historical objects,\u201d the 77-year old artist told The Associated Press before the installation\u2019s opening.",
      "The Strandbeesten Mortuary, as the exhibition is called, follows the various versions of the mobile sculptures since 1990 when Jansen created the first one from plastic pipes and tape. As the animals evolved, Jansen incorporated plastic bottles, wooden planks, cloth and cardboard.",
      "The life and death cycle of these famous animals \u2014 formed mostly out of PVC pipes \u2014 has left behind an impressive fossil record, which is on display at the exhibition.",
      "Marloes Koster, who organized the exhibition for Delft\u2019s Prinsenhof Museum, said that Jansen\u2019s ultimate goal is to create a beast that will live forever.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not there yet, so these are the ones that didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she added.",
      "The museum is undergoing major renovations, so Koster and her colleagues have been putting together arts and culture events at alternative venues around the city while the building is shut.",
      "Born near the North Sea, Jansen grew up captivated by the wind that often hits the Dutch coastline. He harnessed it to allow his animals to \u201cwalk\u201d along the beach. Every year, he creates a new strandbeest and, at the end of the summer, declares the animal dead.",
      "\u201cAll summer I do experiments, and in the fall I\u2019m a little bit wiser (about) how these animals should survive in the future,\u201d Jansen said.",
      "Many of the visitors to the opening of the exhibition had followed Jansen\u2019s work for years and were keen to understand how the strandbeesten had changed over time.",
      "\u201cYou see a kind of development in the way he does things. So they start out very simple, and then it gets increasingly complicated. So they evolve,\u201d said Cor Nonhof, a Delft local who had come to see the exhibition with his wife.",
      "Even at the opening, Jansen was already keen to return to the beach to work on the latest evolution of his strandbeesten.",

      "In the heart of Spain\u2019s capital, the famous Sobrino de Bot\u00edn restaurant proudly holds the title of being the world\u2019s oldest restaurant",
      "MADRID -- In the heart of Spain's capital, Sobrino de Bot\u00edn holds a coveted Guinness World Record as the world's oldest restaurant. Exactly three hundred years after it opened its doors, Bot\u00edn welcomes droves of daily visitors hungry for Castilian fare with a side of history.",
      "But on the outskirts of Madrid, far from the souvenir shops and tourist sites, a rustic tavern named Casa Pedro makes a bold claim. Its owners assert the establishment endured not just the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s and the Napoleonic invasion in the early 1800s, but even the War of Spanish Succession at the start of the 18th century \u2014 a lineage that would make Casa Pedro older than Bot\u00edn and a strong contender for the title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve been around since 1702,\u2019 but ... you can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said manager and eighth-generation proprietor Irene Gui\u00f1ales. \u201cIf you look at the restaurant\u2019s logo, it says \u2018Casa Pedro, since 1702,\u2019 so we said, \u2018Damn it, let\u2019s try to prove it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gui\u00f1ales, 51, remembers her grandfather swearing by Casa Pedro\u2019s age, but she was aware that decades-old hearsay from a proud old-timer wouldn't be enough to prove it. Her family hired a historian and has so far turned up documents dating the restaurant's operations to at least 1750.",
      "That puts them within striking distance of Bot\u00edn\u2019s record.",
      "Both taverns are family-owned. Both offer Castilian classics like stewed tripe and roast suckling pig. They are decorated with charming Spanish tiles, feature ceilings with exposed wooden beams and underground wine cellars. And both enjoy a rich, star-studded history.",
      "Bot\u00edn's celebrated past includes a roster of literary patrons like Truman Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Graham Greene. In his book \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Ernest Hemingway described it as \u201cone of the best restaurants in the world.\" While Casa Pedro may not have boasted the same artistic pedigree, it boasts its own VIPs. Its walls are adorned with decades-old photographs of former Spanish King Juan Carlos I dining in one of its many rooms. The current Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI dines there, too, albeit more inconspicuously than his father.",
      "But the similarities between the two hotspots end there.",
      "Casa Pedro was once a stop on the only road heading north from the Spanish capital toward France. Its clientele is largely local regulars, like David Gonz\u00e1lez and Mayte Villena, who for years have spent every Friday lunching at the tavern.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't change a thing for us,\u201d Villena said about the restaurant someday securing the Guinness title.",
      "Bot\u00edn, on the other hand, is a stone\u2019s throw from Madrid\u2019s famed Plaza Mayor, where any day of the week tour guides are herding groups around town \u2014 and often straight through the restaurant's front door.",
      "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a third-generation proprietor of Bot\u00edn, concedes that the Guinness accolade awarded in 1987 has helped business, but said the restaurant had enough history to draw visitors even before.",
      "\u201cIt has a certain magic,\u201d he said.",
      "The question then becomes: How can either restaurant definitively claim the title? Guinness provides its specific guidelines for the superlative only to applicants, according to spokesperson Kylie Galloway, noting that it entails \u201csubstantial evidence and documentation of the restaurant\u2019s operation over the years.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said that Guinness required Bot\u00edn show that it has continuously operated in the same location with the same name.",
      "The only time the restaurant closed was during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Casa Pedro.",
      "That criteria would mean that restaurants that are even older \u2014 Paris' Le Procope, which says it was founded in 1686, or Beijing\u2019s Bianyifang, founded in 1416, or the 1673-established White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island \u2014 aren't eligible for the designation.",
      "La Campana, in Rome\u2019s historic center, claims over 500 years of operation, citing documents on its menu and in a self-published history. Its owners say they have compiled the requisite paperwork and plan to submit it to Guinness.",
      "Gui\u00f1ales and her husband couldn't consult archives from the former town of Fuencarral, now a Madrid neighborhood. Those papers went up in flames during the Spanish Civil War. Instead, they delved into Spanish national archives, where they found land registries of the area from the First Marquess of Ensenada (1743-1754) that showed the existence of a tavern, wine cellar and inn in the small town as of 1750.",
      "In their spare time, the couple continues to hunt for records proving that Casa Pedro indeed dates back to 1702, as is proclaimed on its walls, takeout bags and sugar packets.",
      "But even if they dig up the final documents and wrest the Guinness honor from Bot\u00edn, Gui\u00f1ales concedes that her restaurant's quiet location makes it unlikely to draw Bot\u00edn\u2019s clientele in central Madrid.",
      "\u201cTo think that we could reach that public would be incredible,\u201d Gui\u00f1ales said. \u201cIt's a dream, but it's a dream.\u201d",

      "Morris also said he\u2019d rarely seen stories set in the kind of youth group he\u2019d grown up in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just never seen that little world written about in a way that I thought was like, accurate or, like, that got what it was about,\u201d he said.",
      "Published last year by New York-based First Second Books, \u201cYouth Group\u201d tells the story of Kay Radford, a theater kid who winds up joining the Stone Mission megachurch youth group after her parents split up. Her mom is a true believer but lonely. Kay is more skeptical but lonely as well and angry at her dad.",
      "\u201cChurch might help with all this,\u201d Kay\u2019s mom tells her early on. \u201cI think we both could use some community.\u201d",
      "At the youth group, Kay is met by youth leader Meg Parks, a kind but sometimes over-the-top youth leader in pink; a bearded, hippy pastor who turns the \u201cPina Colada song\u201d \u2014 the Rupert Holmes hit \u201cEscape\u201d \u2014 into a metaphor for spiritual seeking; and a band that churns out parodies like \u201cI Saw the Christ\u201d sung to the melody of Ace of Base\u2019s \u201cThe Sign.\u201d",
      "Though fictional, the songs fit the kind of pop culture reference \u2014 sometimes known as a \u201cJesus juke\u201d \u2014 that youth groups can be known for.",
      "\u201cI always think there\u2019s something funny about that move, where you take a secular piece of entertainment, like a song that\u2019s in the zeitgeist, or a popular movie and try and give the hidden religious message,\u201d Morris said.",
      "Kay eventually discovers the youth pastor and some of the older Stone Mission kids also fight demons. That fight becomes personal after one of the demons goes after her dad, and Kay decides to join the battle. Along the way, the Stone Mission kids team up with youth groups from other faiths \u2014 Temple Beth Israel, Immaculate Heart parish and the Polaris Coven \u2014 to fight off a demon invasion with the help of some training by an order of nuns.",
      "Morris said he and illustrator Bowen McCurdy wanted to tell a story that was more than just satire. And while he no longer embraces the faith of his youth, Morris still sees value in the lessons he learned, like the importance of loving your neighbor.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to tell a story of people from a lot of different religions coming together with a common goal,\u201d he said.",
      "Matthew Cressler, a religion scholar and creator of the webcomic series \u201cBad Catholics, Good Trouble,\u201d said comics with evangelical or denominational settings like \u201cYouth Group\u201d are uncommon. Religion in comics, he said, is often seen as \u201ca marker of difference\u201d: for example, Kamala Khan, the Muslim-American hero known as Ms. Marvel, or Matt Murdock, better known as Daredevil, who is Irish-Catholic. In the 1960s, when Daredevil was created, Catholics were still seen as outsiders to the American mainstream, and many of the most popular heroes, like Batman, were seen as Mainline Protestants.",
      "While there were comics for evangelicals, they were often evangelistic, like the controversial Jack Chick tracts or the Christianized adventures of Archie and his friends, published by Spire Comics starting in the 1970s. And evangelicals have often downplayed the kind of sacramental imagery and architecture found in mainline or Catholic settings and try to avoid the kind of visuals needed for comics, said Cressler.",
      "Matthew Brake, founder and editor of online publication Pop Culture and Theology, said non-denominational churches often have a \u201clet\u2019s go to the mall aesthetic\u201d and lack the visual clout of Catholicism.",
      "\u201cNondenominational churches are sort of a cultural underdog,\u201d he said.",
      "That may change, Brake said, as creators like Morris, who grew up in non-denominational settings, come of age. And those settings often contain surprises. Although they are most known for things like worship music and purity culture, megachurches also provide space to talk about things like social justice.",
      "Still, he wonders if many nondenominational Christians would be the kinds of fans that would enjoy a book like \u201cYouth Group\u201d or \u201cPreacher,\u201d a late-1990s comic about an evangelical pastor who ends up possessed by a supernatural being.",
      "David Canham, who reviews comics for the secular pop-culture website AIPT \u2014 short for \u201cAdventures in Poor Taste\u201d \u2014 had mixed feelings about \u201cYouth Group.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst off, there\u2019s plenty of \u201990s nostalgia \u2014 a good-natured tongue-in-cheek look back at many of the silly and absurd things about \u201990s culture, with a focus on evangelical Christian culture,\u201d he wrote when the book came out. \u201c\u2018Youth Group\u2019 delivers on this point.\u201d",
      "But the book\u2019s take on pluralism \u2014 the idea that all religion is on the same side \u2014 turned him off as an evangelical Christian. \u201cI don\u2019t want to recommend a book that promotes a worldview that so strongly disagrees with my own beliefs,\u201d he wrote.",
      "At first, Morris said he was worried the book might offend Christians and atheists alike. Some evangelicals might feel the book mocks their faith, while atheists might think the book overlooks the shortcomings of religious groups.",
      "Both those criticisms would be fair, he said. Religious groups get a lot of things wrong, and yet churches and other faith groups remain important to their members. Morris said he tried to walk a fine line of gently poking fun at faith while showing why it still has an impact on people\u2019s lives, and how the friendships made in youth groups may long endure.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want the humor to be like, church is stupid, or say, \u2018look at this dumb church stuff,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted it to be funny and familiar.\u201d",
      "Morris said he wanted to capture the mixed feelings people have about the faiths in which they grew up. While he appreciated Bible teachings like caring for the needy, some of the politics and social messages, especially about LGBTQ+ folks, were a turnoff, he said.",
      "Religion, he said, is complicated.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of wonderful memories, and there\u2019s a lot of stuff that gives me the ick,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that\u2019s in the book. I hope you can see how a religious upbringing can be upsetting and wonderful \u2014 comforting but also makes you mad.\u201d",

Color-wrapped buses bearing BTS members\u2019 faces lined the streets while red and yellow balloons floated above and a decorated food truck provided free coffee and water, adding to the festive atmosphere.",
      "Many supporters wore masks, conscious of potential backlash after the band\u2019s label discouraged attendance citing safety concerns. Despite the challenges, fans like Anaesi from Portugal said the 20-hour journey to Yeoncheon, a town near the tense border with North Korea, was worth it.",
      "\u201cPortugal is a small country, but inside of Portugal, BTS is a king,\u201d she said. Anaesi, who discovered BTS on YouTube, said the group \u201csaved\u201d her from depression. \u201cSo for me BTS is my angel,\u201d she said.

      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",
      "The law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges.",
      "However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service until age 30 after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",
      "There was heated public debate in 2022 over whether to offer special exemptions of mandatory military service for BTS members, until the group\u2019s management agency announced in October 2022 that all seven members would fulfill their duties.",

The Tennessee Bar Association posted on its website that Dobbins had been out walking her dog when she was hit.",

      "At the same time, Victoria Heuermann acknowledged there were times when he stayed home while the family went on vacation and that she was around 10 to 13 years old when the killings happened.

      "\u201cWhether or not I believe my dad did it or not, I\u2019m on the fence about that,\u201d said the now 28-year-old. \u201cPart of me thinks he didn\u2019t do it, but at the same time, I don\u2019t know, he could have just totally had a double life.\u201d",

      "At the same time, she revealed that in July 2009, around the time one of his alleged victims went missing, Heuermann suddenly renovated a bathroom while she and their two children visited her family in Iceland.

      "Oscar-nominated \u201cPast Lives\u201d filmmaker Celine Song's new film \u201cMaterialists\u201d was inspired by the brief time she worked as a matchmaker in New York",
      "Before Celine Song was an Oscar-nominated filmmaker, she was a playwright in New York who needed day jobs to pay rent. That\u2019s how she found herself as a professional matchmaker.",
      "What may have begun as a purely transactional gig, a way for her to keep making her art in an expensive city, taught her more about people\u2019s wants and needs and the true contents of their hearts than she could have ever imagined.",
      "\u201cI always wanted to write something about it because there seemed to be a story in it that is massive and very epic in proportion,\u201d Song said. \u201cIt affects every human being on Earth.\"",
      "And while waiting for her breakout film \u201cPast Lives\u201d to debut, she did. That film is \u201cMaterialists,\u201d a modern-day New York love story starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans that\u2019s heading to theaters this weekend. Johnson is the matchmaker presented with two different types of men for herself \u2014 one a poor struggling actor and ex-boyfriend, the other a wealthy \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 and the internet has already been drawing battle lines. But, like \u201cPast Lives\u201d wasn\u2019t really about a love triangle, \u201cMaterialists\u201d is about something more than the question of which guy is the \u201ccorrect\u201d choice.",
      "Song and Johnson spoke with The Associated Press about the film, falling in love and the modern marketplace of dating. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "SONG: We met up thinking that we were just going to get to know each other and be friends and I walked away from that conversation \u2014 this is just from my perspective \u2014 but I think I was still sitting there when I texted my producers and the studio being like, \u201cI think I\u2019ve found my Lucy.\u201d That\u2019s how casting works for me, it\u2019s always about falling in love. It\u2019s very connected to what we talk about in the film. Like, there\u2019s no mathematical anything. It just the feeling that you get talking to someone and you\u2019re like, oh I just know.",
      "JOHNSON: I knew you had this movie that you were about to start making. I was basically told it was too late. I was like, but I really want to meet her because she\u2019s so smart, and I\u2019ve seen interviews and obviously had seen \u201cPast Lives.\u201d I just wanted talk and get to know her as an artist and a person and so I went into this being like there\u2019s no chance that I\u2019ll be in this movie, but maybe she\u2019ll make another one. We just had such a good time talking, I didn\u2019t even know that I was someone she was thinking about. A few weeks later we spoke. It was very romantic.",
      "JOHNSON: She\u2019s sort of at the top of her game in her work and is very disconnected from her heart and focused on being a perfectionist and getting people to get married. On the surface, you see her as a very transactional person and not really invested in people\u2019s souls, but she actually is and really does want the best for them. She\u2019s also on her own journey of trying to figure out what it is she wants for herself in this life, and, essentially, do you fight for the thing that you think you want, or do you fight for that thing that you know you need? Is that right, Celine?",
      "SONG: That\u2019s so good.",
      "SONG: It was never going to be a conversation about which flavor of a person. It\u2019s actually so much more about this marketplace of dating that all of us live in if you\u2019re single, and also the marketplace that Dakota\u2019s character is navigating. She knows the math better than anyone else in the film. She\u2019s an excellent matchmaker.",
      "Pedro plays somebody who is probably, in straight dating, someone of the highest possible value. Chris\u2019 character, in the spectrum in the marketplace of values of dating, is someone who is of the lowest value possible. I find them to be such adorable characters, very worthy of an adoration.",

But that\u2019s actually how people are. Marriage used to be a business deal. It was like, my father wants your cows and my mother needs your wheat and whatever. It was a trade-off. But now there\u2019s all these books about how we expect our partner to fulfill every single aspect of our needs.

    "story": [
      "Harm reductions initiatives are becoming more commonplace at major music festivals, both through partnerships with festival organizers as well as volunteer efforts done without explicit permission",
      "NEW YORK -- The sounds of muffled percussion and audience cheers reverberate throughout the grounds. Brand activations, makeshift bars and restaurant pop-ups control traffic as a sea of bodies move from set to set. Sandwiched between is a row of nonprofits across familiar causes: hunger, housing and voter registration.",
      "It's a common music festival scene, until closer inspection. There is a new table, This Must Be the Place. The Ohio-based nonprofit offers attendees free opioid overdose reversal treatment and training on how to use it, an education acquired in under two minutes. Just a few years ago, their inclusion might've been unthinkable amid murky regulations and a lack of public awareness surrounding harm reduction.",
      "Advocates say drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, making them ideal locations for harm reduction activities. While more music festivals are allowing such activities, activists are pushing for expanded efforts as some festivals remain cautious.",
      "Founded by William Perry and Ingela Travers-Hayward in 2022, This Must Be The Place has since given away an estimated $4.5 million in naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication, at festivals and smaller community events.",
      "In the very beginning, without a \u201cproof of concept,\u201d as Perry describes it, they had trouble partnering with festivals. Eventually, a few festivals in the Midwest agreed to let them table, which \u201cgot us in the door with Bonnaroo in 2022,\u201d says Perry, referring to the major U.S. festival operated by C3 Presents, one of the largest concert promoters on the planet. Now they have a presence at 35 major U.S. festivals \u2014 including Lollapalooza, Governors Ball and Besame Mucho \u2014 where they collaborate directly with C3 and their security personnel.",
      "The organization's growth overlaps with advancing federal regulations. According to Daliah Heller, vice president of overdose prevention initiatives at the global public health nonprofit Vital Strategies, naloxone distribution used to be determined by state regulations until 2023, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the first over-the-counter nasal spray.",
      "\u201cWe no longer need the prescription laws to be amended to allow for the distribution of naloxone,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it's like buying aspirin \u2014 it's over the counter.\u201d",
      "Last year, This Must Be the Place gave away 46,146 units of Narcan \u2014 a brand name for naloxone \u2014 through their national festival outreach.",
      "Emmett Beliveau, chief operating officer of C3 Presents, says working with This Must Be the Place was C3\u2019s first time implementing public-facing harm reduction strategies, in addition to the promoter's existing medical programs.",
      "Bringing the organization into C3\u2019s festivals was \u201cnot in response to anything that has happened at one of our festivals,\u201d he says, but rather because of the \u201cnumber of fatalities happening in our communities.\u201d",
      "Some activists believe attendees are most responsive to receiving harm reduction education from peers instead of authority figures. And so, for the last three years, a nonprofit dedicated to combating accidental drug overdoses among young adults, Team Awareness Combating Overdose, has distributed fentanyl test strips and Narcan at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.",
      "Former TACO CEO Kameran Mody says that music festivals are ideal locations for distribution and education because \u201cmusic and the use of drugs are synonymous with each other.\u201d",
      "TACO distributes through what Mody describes as \u201cguerrilla-style marketing.\u201d They enlist volunteers, train them on how to use naloxone, and ship Narcan and test strips to them to bring into the festival.",
      "They do not involve the festival organizers. Representatives for Coachella did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "In 2023, a TACO volunteer administered Narcan to an unresponsive Coachella attendee exhibiting signs of an overdose. The organization says the attendee regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cThat was one of our biggest successes,\u201d Mody says.",
      "In 2019, at Bonnaroo, a 27-year-old man was found dead at his campsite \u2014 right after harm reduction activists had picketed the Tennessee festival because it didn't allow drug testing. The toxicology report found ecstasy and fentanyl in his system.",
      "At the time, under state law, test strips were criminalized and classified as drug paraphernalia. That\u2019s changed: In 2022, Tennessee decriminalized fentanyl test strips. By the end of 2023, 44 other states and D.C. had done the same.",
      "But in some states, drug paraphernalia laws are written in a way that isn't completely transparent \u2014 there are test strips that are not fentanyl-specific, Heller points out \u2014 and criminalization and social stigmas endure.",
      "Some have found workarounds. \u201cEven in the states where the legalities were a bit unclear, instead of just coming in and hoping things worked out, we would reach out to the health department, and say \u2018We run this project, how do feel about it?\u2019\u201d says Perry. \u201cWe would end up with letters from the highest-ranking health official, either in the county or in the state, saying \u2018We approve of this.\u2019 That circumvented any roadblocks.\u201d",
      "Some festivals, though, might be hesitant to use test strips because \u201cit\u2019s tough for them to admit that drugs are being used,\u201d Mody says. Some festivals have even banned naloxone.",
      "While This Must Be The Place distributes fentanyl test strips at some Ohio events, C3 doesn't distribute test strips at its events and does not plan to. Beliveau doesn't believe fentanyl test strips are effective and expressed concern they could encourage drug use. Test strips, which can detect fentanyl in pills, powders or injectables, are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a low-cost means of helping prevent drug overdoses.",
      "At a three-day electronic music festival in Mexico City earlier this year, a booth provided free, anonymous drug testing. The initiative, known as \u201cCheca tu Sustancia\u201d (Check Your Substance), was spearheaded by the Instituto RIA, a Mexico-based drug policy research and advocacy organization.",
      "When unexpected substances are detected, users received detailed information on what they are, their risks, potential interactions with other substances and dosage adjustments, empowering them to make informed choices.",
      "Perry says they are aware of smaller festivals in the United States conducting drug checking, but \u201cthey do it in a very underground and whisper network way\u201d to avoid criminalization.",
      "What Perry says his organization would like to see at music festivals in the future would be harm reduction areas \u2014 sections where attendees who have taken drugs can be monitored, not to \u201cget them into trouble\u201d but to ensure safety.",
      "Heller says there are a number of groups working to destigmatize drugs, promote decriminalization, and promote drug checking.",
      "\u201cWe already have drug checking happening in cities,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes perfect sense to expand the settings where you would offer that to include music festivals. It's the same rationale. ... The issue is this idea of liability. You\u2019d have to create a law, essentially, that would protect the festival from liability.\u201d",

Five years later, she phoned with the news that \u201cShe's Come Undone\u201d was her latest book club pick. In 1998, Winfrey picked Lamb's \u201cI Know This Much Is True,\u201d his second novel.",
      "\u201cI was as shocked as ever last month when I answered the phone and heard Ms. Winfrey\u2019s voice again, twenty-seven years after the last time we had talked,\u201d he said. \u201cShe told me my latest novel, \u2018The River Is Waiting,\u2019 would be the 115th title in her beloved Book Club.

      "Jurors in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sex crimes retrial appear to be focusing on one of his three accusers as they deliberate for a fourth day",
      "NEW YORK -- Jurors in Harvey Weinsteinn'ssex crimes retrial appeared to be focusing on one of his three accusers as deliberations stretched into a fourth day Tuesday, with no further sign of interpersonal tensions that flared earlier.",
      "The jury had requested to start off Tuesday with electronic copies of emails and other evidence pertaining to Jessica Mann \u2014 the accuser with arguably the most complex history with Weinstein. Jurors deliberated through the morning without sending any further requests.",
      "During days of testimony, Mann said the Oscar-winning movie producer raped her in 2013 amid a consensual relationship that continued for years afterward. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers emphasized that she kept seeing him, accepting invitations and sending warm messages to him. Mann said she \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d the pain he caused her.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges in the case. In addition to the rape charge, he's accused of sexually assaulting two other women, Mimi Haley and Kaja Sokola.",
      "Weinstein didn't testify during the current trial, but maintained through his attorneys that he had completely consensual encounters with his accusers, who wanted his help building show business careers.",
      "Weinstein was one of the movie industry's most powerful figures until a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and eventually leading to criminal charges.",
      "The jury is made up of seven women and five men. Their closed-door discussions began Thursday and apparently have been fractious at times.",
      "One juror asked Friday to be excused because he felt one member of the group was being treated unfairly. Then on Monday, the foreperson complained to the judge, prosecutors and defense lawyers that some jurors were \u201cpushing\" others to change their minds, talking about Weinstein's past and going beyond the charges.",
      "The foreperson didn't specify what was said. Trial evidence has included some testimony about allegations outside the scope of the current charges, such as mentions of the groundswell of claims against the ex-studio boss in 2017.",
      "Yet another juror soon asked to speak to the court, where she opined that things were \u201cgoing well.\u201d By the end of Monday, the jury as a whole said in a note that it was \u201cmaking good progress.\u201d",
      "There was progress Tuesday on at least one front: Jurors ultimately were given coffee, as requested, Judge Curtis Farber said. He hadn't initially thought the state court system could provide it.",
      "Weinstein originally was convicted in New York in 2020 of raping Mann and forcing oral sex on Haley. Sokola's allegation was added last year, after New York state's highest court overturned the 2020 conviction and sent the case back for retrial.",
      "Meanwhile, Weinstein is appealing a 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted. Sokola, Mann and Haley have agreed to be named.",

      "A Connecticut judge has settled a bitter feud over the estate of the late legendary blues guitarist Johnny Winter",
      "A Connecticut judge has settled a bitter feud over the estate of the late legendary blues guitarist Johnny Winter, ordering his managers to pay $226,000 in damages for improper payments they received after his 2014 death and rejecting their claim to the rights to his music.",
      "Relatives of Winter's late wife, Susan, sued Winter's manager, Paul Nelson, and his wife, Marion, in 2020, claiming the Nelsons swindled more than $1 million from Winter's music business. The Nelsons denied the allegations and countersued. They accused the relatives of improperly having Paul Nelson ousted as the beneficiary of Winter's estate, and they claimed ownership of his music rights.",
      "After a seven-day trial before a judge in January 2024, Judge Trial Referee Charles Lee ruled Friday that the Nelsons received improper payments and made improper withdrawals from Winter's accounts, but rejected claims they committed fraud, mismanagement and breach of contract.",
      "\u201cThe court finds that the conduct for which it has awarded the damages set forth above was negligent or at least arguably legitimate,\u201d Lee wrote in a 54-page decision that also rejected the claims in the Nelsons' countersuit.",
      "The judge said the Nelsons' most serious impropriety was withdrawing $112,000 from Winter's business account and depositing it into one of their own accounts in 2019, without listing Susan Winter as a signatory on their account. Susan Winter owned all of her husband's assets \u2014 valued at about $3 million at the time of his death. The judge said punitive damages may be imposed on the Nelsons because of that transfer.",
      "Paul Nelson, who managed Johnny Winter's business from 2005 to 2019 and played guitar in his band, died in March 2024 from a heart attack during a music tour. Marion Nelson, who did bookkeeping for the Winters and the music business, did not immediately return an email message Monday. The Nelsons' lawyers did not immediately return phone and email messages. It wasn't clear if they planned to appeal.",
      "Susan Winter died from lung cancer in October 2019. Months before her death, she removed Paul Nelson as her successor trustee to her family trust, which included all of her late husband's assets. She named her sister and brother, Bonnie and Christopher Warford, from Charlotte, North Carolina, as her new successor trustees, and they sued the Nelsons.",
      "The Warfords' lawyers did not immediately return phone and email messages Monday. Phone numbers for the Warfords listed in public records were no longer in service.",
      "The Nelsons claimed the Warfords took advantage of Susan Winter and had her sign legal documents while she was medicated near the end of her life. They also alleged the Warfords soured their relationship with Susan Winter with false embezzlement claims. The Warfords denied those allegations.",
      "The judge ruled that the Warfords were entitled to damages because of improper payments the Nelsons received, including $68,000 in royalty payments from a 2016 auction of Winter's assets, $69,000 in cash withdrawals, $18,000 in expense reimbursements and $15,000 in other royalty payments.",
      "The Warfords also were awarded $56,000 that remains in one of the Nelsons' accounts, the same account used in the $112,000 transfer criticized by the judge. In 2020, the Nelsons transferred about $151,000 out of that account to the Warfords\u2019 lawyers.",
      "Lee also rejected claims by the Warfords that Paul Nelson should not have received $300,000 in auction proceeds from the sale of three of Johnny Winter's guitars, because Winter promised those guitars to Paul Nelson.",
      "John Dawson Winter III was born and raised in Beaumont, Texas. He burst onto the world blues scene in the 1960s, dazzling crowds with his fast licks while his trademark long, white hair flew about from under his cowboy hat. He and his brother Edgar \u2014 both born with albinism \u2014 were both renowned musicians. Johnny Winter, who played at Woodstock in 1969, was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1988.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine listed him as the No. 63 best guitar player of all time in 2015. He released more than two dozen albums and was nominated for several Grammy Awards, winning his first one posthumously in 2015 for Best Blues Album for \u201cStep Back.\u201d Nelson produced the album and also took home a Grammy for it.",
      "Johnny Winter, who spent two decades living in Easton, Connecticut, before his death, battled heroin addiction for years and credited Nelson, whom he met in 1999, with helping him get off the opioid methadone and revive his career, according to the 2014 documentary, \u201cJohnny Winter: Down & Dirty.\u201d",

      "Trailblazing ballerina Misty Copeland has decided to move on to what she calls \u201cthe next stage\u201d in her career",
      "NEW YORK -- Ten years ago this month, Misty Copeland sat in front of a hastily arranged news conference at American Ballet Theatre, fighting back tears of pride over her new role: principal dancer.",
      "\u201cThis is it,\u201d she said, with emotion. \u201cThis has been my dream since I was 13.\u201d",
      "The occasion was highly unusual \u2014 normally, when a dancer is promoted, a brief press release is issued. But this was Copeland, a crossover star with fame far beyond the insular world of ballet. And now she was becoming the first Black female principal in the company\u2019s 75-year history \u2014 just days after her New York debut as the lead in \u201cSwan Lake\u201d brought a refreshingly diverse, packed audience to the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "Now, a decade and many accomplishments later, Copeland is retiring from the company she joined as a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d Copeland, 42, told the Associated Press last week ahead of Monday\u2019s official announcement of her move. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "The company is planning a splashy farewell on Oct. 22, featuring performances by Copeland \u2014 for the first time in five years \u2014 and other dancers. There will be speeches and film clips. And Copeland, who's been heavily involved in the planning, will get a chance to venture one more time onto that balcony in Verona; she\u2019ll dance again in the beautiful \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d pas de deux. Honorary chairs for the evening will be Caroline Kennedy and Oprah Winfrey.",
      "A lot has happened in a quarter-century. Copeland, whose success brought new energy to an art form that has always been overwhelmingly white, has authored a number of books, including a memoir and and several works for young people. The second installment of \u201cBunheads\u201d arrives in September, and more are already planned in a series she calls \u201ca reflection of my journey, showing the range of cultures and types of people that can be a part of the ballet world.\u201d",
      "Copeland has also made a short film with her production company. And her philanthropic organization, The Misty Copeland Foundation, works on increasing diversity in the dance world and giving more kids who grew up economically disadvantaged, like she did, the chance to dance.",
      "\u201cIt was so important for children growing up and seeing somebody like Misty and saying, \u2018Oh my gosh, she looks like I do,\u2019\u201d says Susan Jaffe, ABT\u2019s artistic director, who is overseeing the farewell performance. \u201cThrough her books, through her lectures, even her endorsements, she has really been a trailblazer.\"",
      "Still, progress moves slowly. When Copeland exits ABT, there will no longer be a Black female principal dancer at the company \u2014 nor at many ballet companies around the globe. Copeland discussed that continued challenge in the dance world, among other topics, in the AP interview last week. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "COPELAND: You know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying thank you to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.",
      "COPELAND: I\u2019ve noticed that the conversation is not something we shy away from anymore in terms of the lack of equity, the lack of diversity in this (dance) world. That\u2019s one of the biggest shifts I\u2019ve seen \u2026 a lot of young people that just can imagine being part of it in some way. They can imagine stepping into Lincoln Center and being at the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "COPELAND: It's definitely concerning, and I think I\u2019ve just gotten to a place in my career where there\u2019s only so much I can do on a stage. There\u2019s only so much that visual representation like that can do. I feel like it\u2019s the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.",
      "COPELAND: I think about my partnership with (former ABT principal) Roberto Bolle and him giving me so many opportunities to travel the world with him \u2026 (Former ABT principal) Marcelo Gomes, he\u2019s been such a such a big part of my journey, and of course Herman Cornejo. We\u2019ve had a beautiful partnership throughout my career and I\u2019m excited to dance with him again (at the October farewell,)",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s made me even more patient. I just have a lighter and brighter outlook on life because it\u2019s just such an incredible thing to experience and witness... I think ballet has prepared me for being a mother in so many ways. I think it\u2019s ... prepared me for life and being resilient and patient and sensitive and empathetic and strong, and all of these things.",
      "COPELAND: He doesn\u2019t understand at all! (laughs) He\u2019s seen very little of me dancing. \u2026 But he\u2019s very drawn to it. He is a mover. He\u2019s very athletic. He is so drawn to music. He started violin on Monday. We live in the museums. He really is drawn to art. I think he\u2019s definitely on the artist\u2019s track.",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s been pretty evenly split between all of then. I think it just depends on what\u2019s at the forefront and what needs my focus. ... But it\u2019s exciting to be able to utilize dance in so many different mediums, and to me, that\u2019s how you get true diversity \u2014 by giving people different entry points into learning about dance and feeling like they can be a part of it, which has been my goal. How do I bring dance to as many people as possible in a way that really works for them?",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s a difficult time. And I think all we can really do is keep our heads down and keep doing the work. \u2026 we\u2019re fortunate in that way that we\u2019ve built great relationships and can continue to do the work right now through my foundation. There\u2019s no way to stop the people that feel passionate about this work. We will continue doing it. It is so necessary for the well-being of our societies and communities. I think there are times to speak out and yell from the rooftops. And for me, I feel like this is a time to keep my head down and really stay focused and do the work.",

      "Cole Escola of \u201cOh, Mary!\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Even the ushers at Radio City Music Hall seemed thrilled to be in the room where it happened.",
      "A few of them could be seen grooving, like everyone else at Sunday\u2019s Tony Awards, to the \u201cHamilton\u201d reunion performance \u2014 a medley of some of that blockbuster musical\u2019s biggest songs, performed by the original cast. The occasion was the 10th Broadway anniversary of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s juggernaut that spawned multiple touring companies, a West End production and a live-capture film \u2014 and is still going strong.",
      "But while the theater was buzzing to songs like \u201cMy Shot,\u201d \u201cThe Schuyler Sisters,\u201d \u201cHistory Has Its Eyes on You\u201d and \u201cThe Room Where It Happens,\u201d some people were unfortunately NOT in the room where, er, it was happening. They were the ones who\u2019d taken a trip to the bar or a stroll around the lobby, and were then held from entering until the next commercial break \u2014 missing perhaps the night\u2019s most anticipated highlight.",
      "They also missed the entire audience singing along with Jonathan Groff, aka King George, \u201cDa-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da, Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da.\u201d Note for next year: Exit at your own peril!",
      "Some other notable moments from Tony night:",
      "Most award winners thank Mom, their agents, their co-stars and their spouses.",
      "Cole Escola, one of the major stars of this Tony night, promised Mom a call, but also decided to thank \u201cTeebo from Grindr\u201d \u2014 the dating app \u2014 when accepting the award for lead actor in a play.",
      "Escola is star and writer of the riotous \u201cOh, Mary!\u201d \u2014 a reimagining of the life of Mary Todd Lincoln (and her beleaguered husband, Abe) that addresses the question: What if the Lincoln assassination wasn\u2019t such a bad thing for Mary? (Mary wants to be a cabaret star, you see.) The show is seeing audiences collapse in laughter for 80 minutes every night on Broadway.",
      "Escola, a downtown cabaret star, beat out high-wattage competitors like George Clooney and Daniel Dae Kim for the acting award. They mentioned their co-nominees in their speech, saying they had enjoyed sharing \u201cwarm salads\u201d at pre-awards lunches.",
      "Escola is the first nonbinary actor to win a Tony in the category.",
      "When \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d writers Hue Park and Will Aronson accepted the award for best book of a musical, the first handed out, Park felt it necessary to point out that they weren\u2019t an actual couple. \u201cI am very much single,\u201d he clarified, for anyone wondering.",
      "Then later, when the duo won for best score, Park deemed a reminder necessary: \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m still single.\u201d",
      "And then at the end of the night, \u201cMaybe Happy Ending,\u201d the charming and quirky romance between decommissioned robots in a futuristic Korea, won the big prize: best musical. Park did not get the mic. But producer Jeffrey Richards did, and he reminded the crowd: \u201cHue is still single.\u201d",
      "Cynthia Erivo, the \u201cWicked\u201d star and powerhouse vocalist hosting the evening, said it first: \u201cAs they apparently say in a very fertile piece of intellectual property,\" she said with a wink, \u201cthere\u2019s no place like home. And Broadway has always been mine.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a familiar theme on Tony night: the theater community as a welcoming haven for those who may feel different or unseen. It was echoed by Harvey Fierstein, winner of a lifetime achievement award, describing how he joined the theater after being welcomed by a company in Brooklyn. And it was expressed very emotionally by Nicole Scherzinger, winning best actress in a musical for \u201cSunset Blvd.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrowing up, I always felt like I didn\u2019t belong,\u201d said Scherzinger, former lead singer of the pop group Pussycat Dolls who plays Norma Desmond in the minimalist version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber show. \u201cBut you all have made me feel like I belong, and I have come home at last.\u201d Those last words echo the lyrics of one of Desmond\u2019s big numbers, \u201cAs If We Never Said Goodbye.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo if there\u2019s anyone out there who feels like they don\u2019t belong, or your time hasn\u2019t come, don\u2019t give up,\u201d Scherzinger continued. \u201cJust keep on giving and giving because the world needs your love and your light now more than ever.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s always lots of chatter going on during an awards show. But the way the crowd quieted down during Audra McDonald\u2019s powerful, agonized performance of \u201cRose\u2019s Turn\u201d from \u201cGypsy\u201d was striking. In the song's quiet moments, you heard utter silence in the vast room.",
      "McDonald, the Tonys' most awarded actor, is clearly revered by the theater community, who cheered her with standing ovations. But the award she was up for went to Scherzinger.",
      "It\u2019s been two years since HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d ended, but its stars keep turning up at awards shows \u2014 and often winning. Jeremy Strong won a Tony last year and was nominated for an Oscar this year. Kieran Culkin won an Oscar this year and is appearing on Broadway this season, though he wasn\u2019t nominated. And now it was the turn of Sarah Snook \u2014 Emmy and Golden Globe winner \u2014 to win a Tony.",
      "Snook, who played mercurial sibling Shiv Roy in the series, took the Tony for best actress in a play for \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray,\u201d in which she plays all 26 roles.",
      "Tony winner and musical theater regular Gavin Creel, who died last year of cancer, was a friend to many in the theater community, and was remembered more than once on Tony evening.",
      "During the early pre-show, actor Celia Keenan-Bolger was honored with the Isabelle Stevenson award, for her advocacy work in the arts. She spoke movingly of her deep friendship with Creel and their advocacy work together.",
      "Later, singer and actor Sara Bareilles performed a soulful duet of \u201cTomorrow\u201d from \u201cAnnie,\u201d harmonizing with Erivo, during the memorial segment. That segment ended with a photo of Creel, also a dear friend to Bareilles, who teared up.",
      "Both Bareilles and Keenan-Bolger are involved with the Gavin Creel Fellowship, an initiative that plans to provide $25,000 grants to five emerging theater actors each year.",
      "The final award had been announced by presenter Miranda \u2014 best musical to \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d \u2014 and the audience started to disperse. But Erivo had another idea.",
      "Riffing on the concept of leaving, she launched into the famous \u201cDreamgirls\u201d ballad \u201cAnd I Am Telling You I\u2019m Not Going\u201d \u2014 with rewritten lyrics.",
      "It was a yet another powerhouse performance from someone who has one of the best voices on the planet. The audience stopped dispersing \u2014 and started cheering.",

      "The night delivered a stirring mix of purpose and entertainment from Doechii 's powerful speech, Jamie Foxx 's emotional reflection and Kevin Hart 's sharp comedic opener.",
      "Doechii made her presence felt early during the five-hour ceremony, using her acceptance speech for best female hip-hop artist to draw attention to the immigration raids and protest crackdowns taking place just miles from the venue. Her message added urgency and depth to a ceremony meant to honor both Black excellence and social impact.",
      "After being named best female hip-hop artist \u2014 her first-ever BET Award \u2014 Doechii acknowledged her fellow nominees, then shifted the spotlight to the issues unfolding outside the venue.",
      "\u201cThere are ruthless attacks that are creating fear and chaos in our communities in the name of law and order,\u201d said Doechii, who won a Grammy for best rap album, only the third woman to win in that category.",
      "\u201cTrump is using military forces to stop a protest,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you all to consider what kind of government it appears to be when every time we exercise our democratic right to protest, the military is deployed against us. What type of government is that?\u201d",
      "Doechii\u2019s words drew applause from the audience at the Peacock Theater, where the awards aired live.",
      "\u201cPeople are being swept up and torn from their families,\u201d she continued. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s my responsibility as an artist to use this moment to speak up for all oppressed people. \u2026 We all deserve to live in hope and not fear. I hope we stand together.\u201d",
      "Foxx, Mariah Carey, Snoop Dogg and Kirk Franklin received the Ultimate Icon Award. They were selected due to their impact on entertainment as well as their community impact and advocacy.",
      "Foxx was the first to receive his award. He was visibly moved during a heartfelt moment at the awards, being brought to tears while accepting his trophy after surviving a life-threatening health scare in recent years.",
      "The Oscar and Grammy winner reflected on watching the in memoriam tribute from his seat.",
      "\u201cWhen I saw the memoriam, I was like, \u2018Man, that could\u2019ve been me,\u2019\u201d said Foxx, who was hospitalized in 2023 after suffering a stroke. In an interview with The Associated Press, he recalled the severity of the moment: \u201cThe thing was almost a wrap. Every prayer counted.\u201d",
      "Foxx was presented the award by music legend Stevie Wonder, adding even more weight to the emotional moment. As he stood on stage, his voice cracked with gratitude.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know why I went through what I went through. But I know my second chance \u2014 I won\u2019t turn it down,\u201d Foxx said, as his two daughters and sister wiped away tears from the audience. \u201cI have so much love to give. Just give me one more crack at this. Whatever reason you put this on me, I promise I\u2019ll do right. \u2026 You can\u2019t go through something like that and not testify.\u201d",
      "Carey said this was her first time collecting a trophy at the BET Awards. The singer said she became emotional after Busta Rhymes introduced her.",
      "\u201cIt took me a while, but I finally realized that life is far too short to live for anyone else's approval, which is something I always did,\u201d said Carey, a five-time Grammy winner. \u201cI decided to own who I am.\u201d",
      "Dr. Dre presented the award to Snoop, who walked onstage with his wife Shante Taylor. In his speech, he paid homage to Carey, Franklin and Foxx before thanking the many others who helped him throughout his life.",
      "\u201cHip-hop gave me a voice. It gave me a purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gave me a way out and a way into homes, hearts, cultures and countries I'd never thought I would even touch. Being an icon isn't about fame. It's about legacy. It's about what you build, what you leave behind and who you lift up along the way.\u201d",
      "Franklin expressed gratitude for the honor, admitting he\u2019s far from the perfect Christian, husband, father or artist. He joked, \u201cI can\u2019t even sing.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhich makes this award so amazing, because what I do really don\u2019t make sense,\" he said. \"If you\u2019re listening to this, that\u2019s when you know it\u2019s God.\u201d",

      "\u201cDon\u2019t come up here poppin\u2019,\u201d Hart added, as cameras caught Franklin bowing his head and chuckling. \u201cDon\u2019t try to blame it on the Lord. The Lord didn\u2019t ask for that. Put it away, Kirk.\u201d",

      "Most big collections have only a fraction of their items on display, with the rest locked away in storage",
      "LONDON -- A museum is like an iceberg. Most of it is out of sight.",
      "Most big collections have only a fraction of their items on display, with the rest locked away in storage. But not at the new V&A East Storehouse, where London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum has opened up its storerooms for visitors to view \u2014 and in many cases touch \u2014 the items within.",
      "The 16,000-square-meter (170,000-square-foot) building, bigger than 30 basketball courts, holds more than 250,000 objects, 350,000 books and 1,000 archives. Wandering its huge, three-story collections hall feels like a trip to IKEA, but with treasures at every turn.",
      "The V&A is Britain\u2019s national museum of design, performance and applied arts, and the storehouse holds aisle after aisle of open shelves lined with everything from ancient Egyptian shoes to Roman pottery, ancient Indian sculptures, Japanese armor, Modernist furniture, a Piaggio scooter and a brightly painted garbage can from the Glastonbury Festival.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 5,000 years of creativity,\u201d said Kate Parsons, the museum\u2019s director of collection care and access. It took more than a year, and 379 truckloads, to move the objects from the museum\u2019s former storage facility in west London to the new site.",
      "In the museum\u2019s biggest innovation, anyone can book a one-on-one appointment with any object, from a Vivienne Westwood mohair sweater to a tiny Japanese netsuke figurine. Most of the items can even be handled, with exceptions for hazardous materials, such as Victorian wallpaper that contains arsenic.",
      "The Order an Object service offers \u201ca behind-the-scenes, very personal, close interaction\u201d with the collection, Parsons said as she showed off one of the most requested items so far: a 1954 pink silk taffeta Balenciaga evening gown. Nearby in one of the study rooms were a Bob Mackie-designed military tunic worn by Elton John on his 1981 world tour and two silk kimonos laid out ready for a visit.",
      "Parsons said there has been \u201ca phenomenal response\u201d from the public since the building opened at the end of May. Visitors have ranged from people seeking inspiration for their weddings to art students and \u201csomeone last week who was using equipment to measure the thread count of an 1850 dress.\u201d She says strangers who have come to view different objects often strike up conversations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just wonderful,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cYou never quite know. \u2026 We have this entirely new concept and of course we hope and we believe and we do audience research and we think that people are going to come. But until they actually did, and came through the doors, we didn\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "The V&A\u2019s flagship museum in London\u2019s affluent South Kensington district, founded in the 1850s, is one of Britain\u2019s biggest tourist attractions. The Storehouse is across town in the Olympic Park, a post-industrial swath of east London that hosted the 2012 summer games.",
      "As part of post-Olympic regeneration, the area is now home to a new cultural quarter that includes arts and fashion colleges, a dance theater and another V&A branch, due to open next year. The Storehouse has hired dozens of young people recruited from the surrounding area, which includes some of London\u2019s most deprived districts.",
      "Designed by Diller, Scofidio and Renfro, the firm behind New York\u2019s High Line park, the building has space to show off objects too big to have been displayed very often before, including a 17th-century Mughal colonnade from India, a 1930s modernist office designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and a Pablo Picasso-designed stage curtain for a 1924 ballet, some 10 meters (more than 30 feet) high.",
      "Also on a monumental scale are large chunks of vanished buildings, including a gilded 15th-century ceiling from the Torrijos Palace in Spain and a slab of the concrete fa\u00e7ade of Robin Hood Gardens, a demolished London housing estate.",
      "Not a hushed temple of art, this is a working facility. Conversation is encouraged and forklifts beep in the background. Workers are finishing the David Bowie Center, a home for the late London-born musician\u2019s archive of costumes, musical instruments, letters, lyrics and photos that is due to open at the Storehouse in September.",
      "One aim of the Storehouse is to expose the museum\u2019s inner workings, through displays delving into all aspects of the conservators\u2019 job \u2013 from the eternal battle against insects to the numbering system for museum contents \u2014 and a viewing gallery to watch staff at work.",
      "The increased openness comes as museums in the U.K. are under increasing scrutiny over the origins of their collections. They face pressure to return objects acquired in sometimes contested circumstances during the days of the British Empire",
      "Senior curator Georgia Haseldine said the V&A is adopting a policy of transparency, \u201cso that we can talk very openly about where things have come from, how they ended up in the V&A\u2019s collection, and also make sure that researchers, as well as local people and people visiting from all around the world, have free and equitable access to these objects.",
      "\u201cOn average, museums have one to five percent of their collections on show,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is saying, \u2018No, this whole collection belongs to all of us. This is a national collection and you should have access to it.\u2019 That is our fundamental principle.\u201d",

      "The panel of seven women and five men on Thursday began weighing two counts of criminal sex act and one count of rape against the former movie mogul. Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "On Friday, one juror asked to be removed from the case, saying he felt other jurors were treating one member of the panel in an \u201cunfair and unjust\u201d way. The judge told him he had to keep deliberating and also denied a defense request for a mistrial over the issue.",
      "Weinstein was originally found guilty in New York in 2020 of rape and sexual assault against two women in a verdict considered a landmark in the #MeToo movement.",
      "But the conviction was subsequently overturned, leading to his retrial \u2014 with an additional accuser added last year \u2014 before a new jury and a different judge.",
      "Weinstein was also convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape.",

      "Filmmaker Dean DeBlois returns to the world of \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d for a new live-action adaptation, in theaters Friday",
      "Ever wanted to soar through the skies on the back of a friendly dragon? The new \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d may be the ticket, from a decidedly safer, though possibly still vertigo-inducing, distance.",
      "This live-action adaption of the underdog adventure story sends the audience cascading through the clouds with the teenage Viking boy Hiccup and his dragon friend Toothless. It\u2019s the kind of immersive sensation and giddy wish fulfillment that might just have you forgetting momentarily to breathe and, maybe more importantly, that you\u2019re still in a movie theater. Credit to veteran cinematographer Bill Pope, no stranger to fantasy worlds, whether it\u2019s \u201cThe Matrix\u201d or \u201cScott Pilgrim vs. The World.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d doesn\u2019t stray far from the original, from shots to story beats. Gerard Butler once again plays Berk\u2019s Chief Stoick the Vast. The new Hiccup, actor Mason Thames, even sounds a bit like Jay Baruchel. But unlike so many live-action remakes of animated films, it also doesn\u2019t feel superfluous, or, worse, like a poor imitation of its predecessor that trades the magic of animation for photorealism.",
      "Perhaps that\u2019s because filmmaker Dean DeBlois, who made the three animated films, stayed in the director\u2019s chair. Who better to kill their darlings than the one who brought them to the screen in the first place? And, crucially, to know where live-action might actually enhance the fabric of the world created by author Cressida Cowell.",
      "It helps that dragon technology has come a long way since, say, \u201cDragonHeart.\u201d These fire-breathing CG creatures feel disarmingly real. And though it might look like \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the tone stays light enough for younger filmgoers. There are a few intense sequences, but none that takes it any further than the animated film did 15 years ago.",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d does start a little slow, however, which is odd because it also begins with a fiery battle between the Vikings and the dragons on the Isle of Berk. There\u2019s a lot of exposition and introduction that needs to happen before you can just give yourself over to the story. In this more multicultural version, the warriors on Berk have been recruited from tribes around the globe to try to defeat the dragons.",
      "Hiccup is a Viking nepo baby. As the chief's son, he sits in a place of privilege, but he\u2019s also a general outcast in this world of ruthless warriors \u2014 skinny and weak, he just longs to be part of the action, not sharpening the weapons. Killing dragons is currency in this society, and his crush Astrid (Nico Parker) happens to be one of the most promising up-and-comers. His sole champion is Gobber (a delightful Nick Frost), the blacksmith and dragon slayer teacher, who convinces the chief to give the clever Hiccup a shot.",
      "The film finds its internal engine when Hiccup finds Toothless, the wide-eyed \u201cNight Fury\u201d dragon whom he can\u2019t bring himself to kill. Instead, he decides to study this discovery, who he finds is not as nearly fearsome as everyone assumes. \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d teaches empathy and ingenuity without a sermon.",
      "Thames, a teenager himself, is the perfect embodiment of adolescent awkwardness and boldness. You can have all the cute dragons you want, but the audience would be lost if the human conduit to the relationship isn\u2019t up to the task. Butler seems to be having a good time, resplendent in fur and chest-thumping ideas about ancient duties. And Parker gives Astrid a relatable depth \u2014 the best in the bunch who is outshone in an unequal fight.",
      "Kids deserve movies that are made on the biggest possible canvas. \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d is one that's worth the trip to the theater. It might just spark some young imaginations, whether it\u2019s to go back and read the books or dream up their own worlds. And, chances are, no one is going to be yelling \u201cchicken jockey.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csequences of intense action and peril.\u201d Running time: 125 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

    "story": [
      "Big changes are being are being proposed to a food aid program as part of President Donald Trump's tax-cut legislation",
      "TPresident Donald Trump's plan to cut taxes by trillions of dollars could also trim billions in spending from social safety net programs, including food aid for lower-income people.",
      "The proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would make states pick up more of the costs, require several million more recipients to work or lose their benefits, and potentially reduce the amount of food aid people receive in the future.",
      "The legislation, which narrowly passed the U.S. House, could undergo further changes in the Senate, where it's currently being debated. Trump wants lawmakers to send the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d to his desk by July 4, when the nation marks the 249th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Here's a look at the food aid program, by the numbers:",
      "The federal aid program formerly known as food stamps was renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, on Oct. 1, 2008. The program provides monthly payments for food purchases to low-income residents generally earning less than $1,632 monthly for individuals, or $3,380 monthly for a household of four.",
      "The nation\u2019s first experiment with food stamps began in 1939. But the modern version of the program dates to 1979, when a change in federal law took effect eliminating a requirement that participants purchase food stamps. There currently is no cost to people participating in the program.",
      "A little over 42 million people nationwide received SNAP benefits in February, the latest month for which figures are available. That's roughly one out of every eight people in the county. Participation is down from a peak average of 47.6 million people during the 2013 federal fiscal year.",
      "Often, more than one person in a household is eligible for food aid. As of February, nearly 22.5 million households were enrolled SNAP, receiving an average monthly household benefit of $353.",
      "Legislation passed by the House is projected to cut about $295 billion of federal spending from SNAP over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "A little more than half of those federal savings would come by shifting costs to states, which administer SNAP. Nearly one-third of those savings would come by expanding a work requirement for some SNAP participants, which the CBO assumes would force some people off the rolls. Additional money would be saved by eliminating SNAP benefits for between 120,000 and 250,000 immigrants legally in the U.S. who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents.",
      "Another provision in the legislation would cap the annual inflationary growth in food benefits. As a result, the CBO estimates that the average monthly food benefit would be about $15 lower than it otherwise would have been by 2034.",
      "To receive SNAP benefits, current law says adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents would need to work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don't do so are limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation that passed the House would expand work requirements to those ages 55 through 64. It also would extend work requirements to some parents without children younger than age 7. And it would limit the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas that lack sufficient jobs.",
      "The combined effect of those changes is projected by the CBO to reduce SNAP participation by a monthly average of 3.2 million people.",
      "The federal government currently splits the administrative costs of SNAP with states but covers the full cost of food benefits. Under the legislation, states would have to cover three-fourths of the administrative costs. States also would have to pay a portion of the food benefits starting with the 2028 fiscal year.",
      "All states would be required to pay at least 5% of the food aid benefits, and could pay more depending on how often they make mistakes with people\u2019s payments.",
      "States that had payment error rates between 6-8% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which data is available would have to cover 15% of the food costs. States with error rates between 8-10% would have to cover 20% of the food benefits, and those with error rates greater than 10% would have to cover 25% of the food costs.",
      "Many states could get hit with higher costs. The national error rate stood at 11.7% in the 2023 fiscal year, and just three states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota and Vermont \u2014 had error rates below 5%. But the 2023 figures are unlikely to serve as the base year, so the exact costs to states remains unclear.",
      "As a result of the cost shift, the CBO assumes that some states would reduce or eliminate benefits for people.",
      "House Resolution 1, containing the SNAP changes and tax cuts, passed the House last month by a margin of just one vote \u2014 215-214.",
      "A vote also could be close in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats. Democrats did not support the bill in the House and are unlikely to do so in the Senate. Some Republican senators have expressed reservations about proposed cuts to food aid and Medicaid and the potential impact of the bill on the federal deficit. GOP Senate leaders may have to make some changes to the bill to ensure enough support to pass it.",

      "A top aide to Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Calley Means has built a following within the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement by railing against the failings of the U.S. health system, often pinning the blame on one issue: corruption.",
      "Means, a top aide to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was hired as a White House adviser in March. He has used that perch to attack the nation\u2019s leading physician groups, federal agencies and government scientists, claiming they only protect their own interests in the nation\u2019s $4.9 trillion-a-year industry.",
      "In recent interviews, speeches and podcasts he has called the American Medical Association \u201ca pharma lobbying group,\u201d labeled the Food and Drug Administration \u201ca sock puppet of industry,\" and said federal health scientists have \u201coverseen a record of utter failure.\u201d",
      "Means, however, has his own financial stake in the sprawling health system. He\u2019s the co-founder of an online platform, Truemed, that offers dietary supplements, herbal remedies and other wellness products. Some of the vendors featured on Truemed\u2019s website are supporters of Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, which downplays the benefits of prescription drugs, vaccines and other rigorously tested medical products.",
      "Kennedy has pledged to run the Department of Health and Human Services with \u201cradical transparency,\u201d but Means has never had to publicly disclose his own financial details or where exactly they intersect with the policies he's advancing.",
      "\u201cIt reeks of hypocrisy,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, a health researcher at Yale University. \u201cIn effect, he is representing another industry that is touting nonregulated products and using his platform within the government to financially benefit himself.\u201d",
      "In a written statement, Means said his government work has not dealt with matters affecting Truemed and has focused on issues like reforming nutrition programs and pressuring companies to phase out food dyes.",
      "\u201cPursuing these large-scale MAHA goals to make America healthy has been the sole focus in my government work,\u201d Means said.",
      "Truemed helps users take tax-free money out of their health savings accounts, or HSAs, to spend on things that wouldn\u2019t normally qualify as medical expenses, such as exercise equipment, meal delivery services and homeopathic remedies \u2014 mixtures of plants and minerals based on a centuries-old theory of medicine that's not supported by modern science.",
      "The business model caught the attention of the IRS last year, which issued an alert: \u201cBeware of companies misrepresenting nutrition, wellness and general health expenses as medical care.\u201d",
      "Truemed co-founder and CEO, Justin Mares, said in a statement the company is \u201cin full alignment\u201d with IRS guidelines.",
      "\u201cTruemed enables patients to work with providers to use medical funds for root cause interventions like exercise and vitamin D to reverse disease under current law,\u201d Mares said.",
      "The full extent of Means\u2019 potential conflicts \u2014 including his personal investments\u2014 are unclear because of his status as a special government employee.",
      "Unlike presidential appointees and other senior officials, special government employees are temporary staffers who do not have to leave companies or sell investments that could be impacted by their work. Also, their financial disclosure forms are shielded from public release.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d says Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush now at the University of Minnesota. Painter and other experts have raised alarms over a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails.",
      "Still, part-time government employees are subject to the same law that bars all federal staffers from working on issues that could directly benefit their finances. When such cases arise, they must recuse themselves or risk criminal penalties.",
      "Means regularly opines on matters before HHS, including rethinking the use of drugs for depression, weight loss, diabetes and other conditions. Recently he's been promoting a new government report that calls for scaling back prescription medications in favor of exercise, dietary changes and other alternatives.",
      "\u201cIf we rely less on our medical system, less on drugs, it necessitates the spiritual, cultural conversation about what we\u2019re doing to our children\u2019s bodies,\u201d Means said in a recent podcast appearance.",
      "Experts note that government ethics rules are intended to both prevent financial conflict violations, but also the appearance of such conflicts that might undermine public trust in government.",
      "\u201cIf I were running the ethics office over at HHS, I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t want anybody going around giving interviews and speeches about government matters that could have an effect on their own financial interests,\u201d Painter said.",
      "Means\u2019 rapid rise reflects the seeming contradictions within the MAHA movement itself, which urges followers to distrust both big corporations and the government agencies which regulate them.",
      "Means rails against big pharma and food conglomerates, two industries that he says he spent years working for as a consultant in Washington.",
      "Means has no medical training. A graduate of Harvard Business School, he previously ran a bridal gown startup with his wife. On Wednesday, he's scheduled to be the keynote speaker at FDA's annual science forum, according to a copy of the program shared with The Associated Press.",
      "He traces his passion for health care reform to the death of his mother from pancreatic cancer in 2021. Shortly thereafter, Means and his sister, Dr. Casey Means, took psychedelics together and had \u201ca mind-blowing, life-changing experience,\u201d which led them to co-author a wellness book, launch separate health startups and begin appearing on podcasts.",
      "Casey Means was recently nominated to be surgeon general and has faced scrutiny over her qualifications, including an unfinished medical residency.",
      "Asked about her nomination, President Donald Trump said: \u201cBobby thought she was fantastic,\u201d adding that he did not know her.",
      "Meanwhile, her brother has stepped up his rhetoric for the MAHA agenda, recently declaring that Kennedy has \u201ca spiritual mandate to reform our broken system.\"",
      "While promoting the administration\u2019s accomplishments, Means does not shy away from plugging his own brand or those of his business partners.",
      "When asked to offer health advice to listeners of a sports podcast, Outkick The Show, in April, Means said: \u201cRead our book, \u2018Good Energy.\u2019\u201d",
      "He also recommended blood tests sold by Function Health, which provides subscription-based testing for $500 annually. The company was cofounded by Dr. Mark Hyman, a friend of Kennedy and an investor in Truemed, which also offers Hyman's supplements through its platform. Casey Means is also an investor in Hyman's company.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re sick, most likely you have some kind of nutrient deficiency, some kind of biomarker that you can actually then target with your diet and your supplements,\u201d Calley Means said.",
      "Like dietary supplements, the marketing claims on laboratory tests sold by Hyman are not approved by the FDA. The agency has warned for years about the accuracy of such tests and tried to start regulating them under President Joe Biden.",
      "Experts say MAHA entrepreneurs like Hyman are following a playbook common to the wellness industry: Identify a health concern, market a test to diagnose it and then sell supplements or other remedies to treat it.",
      "\u201cIt ends up favoring these products and services that rest on flimsy grounds, at the expense of products that have actually survived a rigorous FDA approval process,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Many of the items sold via Truemed, including sweat tents, cold plunge tanks and light therapy lamps, wouldn\u2019t typically qualify as medical expenses under rules for HSAs, tax-free accounts created by Congress to manage medical costs.",
      "The IRS generally states that HSA purchases must help diagnose, cure, treat, mitigate or prevent disease.",
      "Truemed allows users to request a \u201cletter of medical necessity\u201d from a doctor, stating that the product in question could have medical value for them. Like other telehealth services, there\u2019s usually no real-time communication with the patient. The physician reviews a \u201csimple survey solution,\u201d filled out by the Truemed user, according to the company\u2019s website.",
      "Industry representatives say customers should be careful.",
      "\u201cYou need to be prepared to defend your spending habits under audit,\u201d said Kevin McKechnie, head of the American Bankers Association\u2019s HSA council. \u201cCompanies are popping up suggesting they can help you manage that process and maybe they can \u2014 so the debate continues.\u201d",
      "Americans have an estimated $147 billion in HSA accounts, a potential windfall for companies like Truemed that collects fees for transactions made using their platforms.",
      "Means sees an even bigger opportunity \u2014 routing federal funds out of government programs and into more HSAs.",
      "\u201cThe point of our company is to steer medical dollars into flexible spending,\u201d Means told fitness celebrity Jillian Michaels, on her podcast last year. \u201cI want to get that $4.5 trillion of Medicare, Medicaid, everything into a flexible account.\u201d",
      "Means\u2019 pitch for expanding HSAs echoes two decades of Republican talking points on the accounts, which were created in 2003 to encourage Americans in high-deductible plans to be judicious with their health dollars.",
      "But HSAs have not brought down spending, economists say. They are disproportionately used by the wealthiest Americans, who have more income to fund them and a bigger incentive to lower their tax rate.",
      "Americans who earn more than $1 million annually are the group most likely to make regular HSA contributions, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half Americans with HSAs have balances less than $500.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d would further expand HSA purchases, making gym memberships and other fitness expenses eligible for tax-free spending. That provision alone is expected to cost the government $10 billion in revenue.",
      "\u201cThese are really just tax breaks in the guise of health policy that overwhelmingly benefit people with high incomes,\u201d said Gideon Lukens, a former White House budget official during the Obama and Trump administrations, now with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Expanding HSA eligibility was listed as a goal for a coalition of MAHA entrepreneurs and Truemed partners, founded by Means, which lobbied Congress last year, according to the group's website.",
      "Means said in a statement that the group focused only on broad topics like \u201chealth care incentives and patient choice \u2014 but did not lobby for specific bills.\u201d",
      "In total, the HSA expansions in Trump's bill are projected to cost the federal government $180 billion over the next 10 years. As HSAs expand to include more disparate products and services, Lukens says the U.S. government will have fewer dollars to expand medical coverage through programs like Medicaid.",
      "\u201cWe have a limited amount of federal resources and the question is whether we want to spend that on health and wellness products that may or may not be helpful for wealthy people,\u201d Lukens said.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s National Institutes of Health director says some employees\u2019 critical letter to him has \u201cfundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. \u201cDissent,\" he said, \u201dis the very essence of science.\u201d",
      "That commitment is being put to the test.",
      "On Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, challenging \u201cpolicies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.\u201d",
      "It says: \"We dissent.\"",
      "In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter \u2014 and their careers on the line. An additional 250 of their colleagues across the agency endorsed the declaration without using their names.",
      "The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the administration's approach to federal research and said President Donald Trump is focused on restoring a \u201cGold Standard\u201d of science, not \u201cideological activism.\u201d",
      "The signers went public in the face of a \u201cculture of fear and suppression\u201d they say Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. \u201cWe are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Bhattacharya responded to the declaration by saying it \u201chas some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months.\"",
      "\u201cNevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive,\u201d he said in a statement. \"We all want the NIH to succeed.\u201d",
      "Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world\u2019s premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.",
      "It addresses the termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.",
      "In one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.",
      "In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. \u201cEnding a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,\u201d it says, \u201cit wastes $4 million.\u201d",
      "Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.",
      "At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.",
      "\u201cI want people to know how bad things are at NIH,\" Norton told The Associated Press.",
      "The signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya\u2019s Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.",
      "His declaration drew together likeminded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.",
      "\u201cHe is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,\" said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.",
      "As chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. Cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. \"So much of it is gone \u2014 my work,\u201d she said.",
      "The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because she didn't want to be \"a collaborator\u201d in the political manipulation of biomedical science.",
      "Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. \u201cWe have a saying in basic science,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.",
      "\u201cWe are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,\u201d he added. But that won\u2019t happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing grant cuts.",
      "The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes nor the NIH.",
      "Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.",
      "The letter asserts \u201cNIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety\u201d and the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who \u201cbraved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.",
      "At the White House, Desai said Americans \u201chave lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "This has forced \u201cindiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Some NIH employees have previously come forward in televised protests to air grievances, and many walked out of Bhattacharya's town hall with staff. The declaration is the first cohesive effort to register agency-wide dismay with the NIH's direction.",
      "The dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a lynchpin in science.",
      "With that in place, he said in a statement in April, \u201cNIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.\"",
      "Now it will be seen whether that's enough to protect those NIH employees challenging the Trump administration and him.",
      "\u201cThere's a book I read to my kids, and it talks about how you can't be brave if you're not scared,\u201d said Norton, who has three young children. \"I am so scared about doing this, but I am trying to be brave for my kids because it's only going to get harder to speak up.",
      "\u201cMaybe I'm putting my kids at risk by doing this,\" she added. \"And I'm doing it anyway because I couldn't live with myself otherwise.\u201d",
      "e and noy on",
      "\u201cIn recent years, Americans have lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago,\u201d spokesman Kush Desai said. \u201cThe Trump administration is focused on restoring the Gold Standard of Science \u2014 not ideological activism \u2014 as the guiding principle of HHS, the NIH, and the CDC to finally address our chronic disease epidemic.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is taking aim at dozens of rules aimed at protecting the environment, including one that requires big polluters to report greenhouse gas emissions",
      "LEOPOLD, Ind. -- On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman\u2019s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.",
      "Outside, the real sky isn\u2019t always blue. Sometimes it\u2019s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that\u2019s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.",
      "\u201cIndustry and government is very, very, very powerful. It\u2019s more powerful than me. I\u2019m just an English teacher,\u201d Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.",
      "In a way, Brockman\u2019s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.",
      "That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.",
      "And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.",
      "The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.",
      "\"We can\u2019t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that\u2019s changing over time,\" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.",
      "Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.",
      "But the registry \u201cdoes put pressure on companies to ... document what they\u2019ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.",
      "\"It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.\u201d",
      "The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these \u201cmonitoring deserts,\u201d said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.",
      "\"The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can\u2019t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.",
      "The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.",
      "CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It\u2019s human rights,\u201d said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. \u201cWe all deserve a right to clean air.\u201d",
      "Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what\u2019s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.",
      "Indiana says it \u201cmaintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,\u201d but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren't satisfied. She and other members of local advocacy groups Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life and Valley Watch install and maintain their own air and water quality monitors. It\u2019s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.",
      "Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.",

      "Britain left the European Union in 2020 with the relationship between Gibraltar and the bloc unresolved. Talks on a deal to ensure people and goods can keep flowing over the Gibraltar-Spain border previously had made only halting progress.",

      "The deal would involve removing all physical barriers, checks and controls on people and goods circulating between Spain and Gibraltar, the EU said in a statement. At the same time, it would respect Europe\u2019s free travel zone rules and the EU single market.",

      "Two key figures in Russia\u2019s beleaguered political opposition were targeted by Russian courts as Moscow continues its crackdown on dissent",
      "Courts in Russia on Friday convicted one opposition figure in absentia and placed another under house arrest as Moscow continues its crackdown on dissent.",
      "Leonid Volkov, a close associate of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, was sentenced in absentia to 18 years in prison after being found guilty on criminal charges.",
      "Moscow\u2019s Second Western District Military convicted Volkov under 40 counts including justifying terrorism, organizing and financing an extremist group, rehabilitating Nazism, and creating a non-governmental organization that violated citizens\u2019 rights, Russian news agencies reported.",
      "As well as the prison sentence, Volkov was also fined 2 million rubles (approx. $25,000) and banned from using the internet for 10 years.",
      "\u201cOh no! They banned me from the internet for 10 years as prosecutors requested, but I've already been using it\u201d, Volkov wrote in a tongue-in-cheek social media post after the sentence was released. \u201cDamn. Whatever am I going to do?\"",
      "Volkov, who was in charge of Navalny\u2019s regional offices and election campaigns, left Russia several years ago under pressure from the authorities. He led Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation between 2021 and 2023, during which time he was placed on the Russian government\u2019s list of terrorists and extremists. The case against him is widely seen in Russia as political motivated.",
      "Separately, Lev Shlosberg, a senior member of the Yabloko opposition party, was placed under house arrest Wednesday after being detained on charges of discrediting the Russian army.",
      "A court in the city of Pskov, close to Russia\u2019s western border, ordered Shlosberg to be detained at home for two months pending investigation and trial, the court\u2019s press service said. His case has also been widely viewed as politically motivated.",
      "Russian authorities have accused Shlosberg of discrediting the nation\u2019s military by calling for a ceasefire in Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine. Shlosberg has said that he did not share the social media video or administer the page on which it was posted. If found guilty, he faces up to five years imprisonment.",
      "The politician, who has repeatedly criticized Moscow\u2019s war, was previously named as a \u201cforeign agent\u201d by Russian authorities, a loaded term that carries connotations of Soviet-era treachery.",
      "Since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin has clamped down on all forms of dissent, targeting rights groups, independent media and other members of civil-society organizations, LGBTQ+ activists and certain religious affiliations.",

      "Japan this week confirmed that two Chinese aircraft carriers are operating together for the first time in the Pacific",
      "TOKYO -- Japan this week confirmed that two Chinese aircraft carriers are operating together for the first time in the Pacific, fueling Tokyo's concern about Beijing's rapidly expanding military activity far beyond its borders.",
      "Carriers are considered critical to projecting power at a distance. China routinely sends coast guard vessels, warships and warplanes to areas around the disputed East China Sea islands, but now it is going as far as what's called the second-island chain that includes Guam \u2014 a U.S. territory.",
      "Here's what to know about the latest moves by China, which has the world\u2019s largest navy numerically.",
      "Japan's Defense Ministry said the two carriers, the Liaoning and the Shandong, were seen separately but almost simultaneously operating near southern islands in the Pacific for the first time. Both operated in waters off Iwo Jima, about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) south of Tokyo, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said Monday.",
      "The Shandong and accompanying warships on Monday had warplanes take off and land on the carrier off Iwo Jima. The Liaoning had similar exercises Sunday. The previous day, it sailed inside Japan's exclusive economic zone of Minamitorishima, the country's easternmost island.",
      "There was no violation of Japanese territorial waters. Still, Nakatani said Japan has expressed \u201cconcern\u201d to the Chinese embassy.",
      "China's military buildup and expanding area of activity have raised tensions in the region.",
      "The Chinese carriers sailed past the first-island chain, the Pacific archipelago off the Asian mainland that includes Japan, Taiwan and part of the Philippines. The Liaoning reached farther to the second-island chain, a strategic line extending to Guam, showing China also can challenge Japan's ally, the United States.",
      "\u201cChina apparently aims to elevate its capability of the two aircraft carriers, and to advance its operational capability of the distant sea and airspace,\" Nakatani said.",
      "The defense minister vowed to further strengthen Japan's air defense on remote islands.",
      "Japan has been accelerating its military buildup especially since 2022, including counter-strike capability, with long-range cruise missiles as deterrence to China.",
      "China's navy on Tuesday confirmed the deployments, calling it part of routine training in the western Pacific \u201cto test their capabilities in far seas protection and joint operations.\" It said the deployment was in compliance with international laws and not targeted at any country.",
      "China is pursuing a vast military modernization program including ambitions of a true \u201cblue-water\u201d naval force capable of operating at long ranges for extended periods.",
      "Beijing has the world\u2019s largest navy numerically but lags far behind the United States in its number of aircraft carriers. China has three, the U.S. 11.",
      "Washington\u2019s numerical advantage allows it to keep a carrier, currently the USS George Washington, permanently forward-deployed to Japan.",
      "The Pentagon has expressed concern over Beijing\u2019s focus on building new carriers. Its latest report to Congress on Chinese defense developments noted that it \"extends air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China\u2019s shore.\u201d",
      "The two Chinese carriers currently in the western Pacific employ the older \u201cski-jump\u201d launch method for aircraft, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to assist planes taking off. China\u2019s first carrier, the Liaoning, was a repurposed Soviet ship. The second, the Shandong, was built in China along the Soviet design.",
      "Its third carrier, the Fujian, launched in 2022 and is undergoing final sea trials. It is expected to be operational later this year. It is locally designed and built and employs a more modern, electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S.",
      "All three ships are conventionally powered, while all the U.S. carriers are nuclear powered, giving them the ability to operate at much greater range and more power to run advanced systems.",
      "Satellite imagery provided to The Associated Press last year indicated China is working on a nuclear propulsion system for its carriers.",
      "In August, a Chinese reconnaissance aircraft violated Japan's airspace off the southern prefecture of Nagasaki, and a Chinese survey ship violated Japanese territorial waters off another southern prefecture, Kagoshima. In September, the Liaoning and two destroyers sailed between Japan\u2019s westernmost island of Yonaguni \u2014 just east of Taiwan \u2014 and nearby Iriomote, entering an area just outside Japan\u2019s territorial waters where the country has some control over maritime traffic.",
      "China routinely sends coast guard vessels and aircraft into waters and airspace surrounding the Japanese-controlled, disputed East China Sea islands to harass Japanese vessels in the area, forcing Japan to scramble jets.",
      "Tokyo also worries about China's increased joint military activities with Russia, including joint operations of warplanes or warships around northern and southwestern Japan in recent years.",

      "Iran has executed a man convicted of fatally shooting seven people during a 2022 protest over the death of Mahsa Amini, though human rights activists say he was tortured into confessing for killings likely carried out by security services",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran on Wednesday executed a man convicted in the fatal shootings of seven people during a 2022 protest over the death of Mahsa Amini, though human rights activists say he was tortured into confessing to killings likely carried out by security services.",
      "The hanging of Abbas Kourkouri, also known as Mojahed Kourkouri, marks the first execution in nearly a year for someone arrested in the protests surrounding the death of Amini, who had been detained by police allegedly over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to their liking. Her death sparked months of demonstrations. Even today, some women refuse to wear their headscarves in public, openly defying a hijab law instituted by the country\u2019s theocracy.",
      "It's unclear why authorities chose now to execute Kourkouri, 42, though tensions have been rising regionally over Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, and the result of talks with the United States remains uncertain. Iran is one of the world's top executioners and has been cracking down in other ways on society in the time since the Amini demonstrations.",
      "Kourkouri \u201cwas sentenced to death without a fair trial and without access to a lawyer of his choice,\u201d said Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam of the Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights, which tallied an average of one execution in the Islamic Republic every six hours over the last eight months.",
      "Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported at the time that on Nov. 16, 2022 two gunmen on motorcycles shot at protesters and security personnel gathered at the central market in the southwestern city of Izeh in the country's restive, oil-rich Khuzestan province.",
      "The assault killed seven people, including a 9-year-old boy, and wounded three police officers and two members of the Basij, the all-volunteer arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guard. The death of the boy, named Kian Pirfalak, drew anger from Iranians, particularly after his family reportedly said it was security forces \u2014 not other gunmen \u2014 who opened fire.",
      "Kourkouri was accused of being one of the gunmen.",
      "He was charged with a spate of offenses, including \u201cmoharebeh\u201d \u2013 an Islamic term meaning waging a battle against God. Authorities arrested him in December 2022 after reportedly shooting him in the leg. Activists say he was denied medical treatment beyond the bullet's removal.",
      "State media described Kourkouri as a drug dealer and \u201cinstigator\u201d with a history of extremist beliefs. But rights advocates say he isn\u2019t the violent person authorities have made him out to be and was himself an innocent protester.",
      "\u201cHe was arrested during the \u2018Woman, Life, Freedom\u2019 protests, and the Islamic Republic authorities attempted to blame him\" for the attack, Amiry-Moghaddam said. He added that the slain boy\u2019s parents and uncle believed Iranian security forces were responsible.",
      "The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which also monitors Iran, similarly dismissed the Iranian government's claims.",
      "\u201cWhile authorities continue to describe the events of Nov. 16 in Izeh as a \u2018terrorist attack,\u2019 eyewitnesses and the families of victims have presented accounts that contradict the government\u2019s narrative,\u201d it said Wednesday. The group quoted Kian\u2019s mother as saying, \u201cOn our way home, officers opened fire on our car.\u201d",
      "State media earlier broadcast videos of Kourkouri taking blame for the attack. But Amnesty International has said that authorities subjected him to solitary confinement and coerced his confessions, and that he wasn't at the scene at the time of the killings.",
      "One videotaped confession that had been aired on state TV showed Kourkouri in bed with his arm visibly bandaged and bloody, the rights group said. The footage resembled that of many other suspected coerced confessions broadcast in Iran.",
      "Kourkouri's death brings the tally of executions related to violence at the Amini protests up to 11. The last such execution came 10 months ago, after Reza Resaei, 34, was sentenced to death over the killing of a security officer. Rights groups also said his confession was forced.",
      "The United Nations-established Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Islamic Republic of Iran said Wednesday that proceedings against Kourkouri had been \u201cmarred by gross human rights violations.\u201d It called on Iran to halt executions, including those against women's rights activists.",
      "On the streets of Iranian cities, it\u2019s becoming increasingly common to see a woman pass by without a mandatory hijab, as the third anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini and the mass protests it sparked approaches this fall.",
      "The government has targeted private businesses where women are seen without their headscarves. Surveillance cameras search for women uncovered in vehicles to fine and impound their cars, and authorities have gone as far as to use aerial drones to monitor women.",
      "The country\u2019s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian campaigned on a promise to curb the morality police's harassment of women. But the country\u2019s ultimate authority rests with its 86-year-old Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",

      "LONDON -- Police in Northern Ireland say 17 officers were injured during a second night of anti-immigrant violence in the town of Ballymena, where rioters threw bricks, bottles, petrol bombs and fireworks and set several vehicles and houses on fire.",
      "Police used water cannon and fired rubber bullets to disperse a crowd of several hundred people. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said Wednesday that the violence died down by about 1 a.m. (0000GMT). Five people were arrested on suspicion of \u201criotous behavior.\u201d",
      "Violence erupted Monday after a peaceful march to show support for the family of the victim of an alleged sexual assault on the weekend. Two 14-year-old boys have been charged.",
      "The suspects have not been identified because of their age. They were supported in court by a Romanian interpreter.",

      "Pope Leo XIV has made his first appointment of a Chinese bishop",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV made his first appointment of a Chinese bishop under the Vatican\u2019s 2018 agreement with Beijing, signalling he is continuing one of Pope Francis\u2019 most controversial foreign policy decisions.",
      "The Vatican expressed satisfaction that Leo\u2019s June 5 nomination of Bishop Joseph Lin Yuntuan as auxiliary bishop of Fuzhou was recognized Wednesday by Chinese authorities.",
      "The Vatican said in a statement that Lin taking possession of the diocese and the civic recognition of his appointment \u201cconstitutes a further fruit of the dialogue between the Holy See and the Chinese authorities and is a significant step in the diocese\u2019s communal journey.\u201d",
      "Francis had riled conservatives when he approved a deal in 2018 over bishop nominations, which had been the most divisive issue in Vatican-China relations since diplomatic ties were severed when the Communists came to power. China had insisted on an exclusive right to name bishops as a matter of national sovereignty, while the Vatican asserted the pope\u2019s exclusive right to name the successors of the original Apostles.",
      "China's estimated 12 million Catholics have been divided between an official, state-controlled church that didn\u2019t recognize papal authority and an underground church that remained loyal to Rome through decades of persecution. The Vatican tried for decades to unify the flock and the 2018 deal was aimed at healing that division, regularizing the status of seven bishops who weren\u2019t recognized by Rome and thawing decades of estrangement between China and the Vatican.",
      "The details of the 2018 deal were never released, but it affords the state-controlled church a say in its church leaders, though Francis insisted he retained veto power over the ultimate choice.",
      "The deal has been criticized by some, especially on the Catholic right, for having caved to Beijing\u2019s demands and sold out the underground faithful in China. The Vatican has said it was the best deal it could get and has been renewed periodically since then.",
      "One of the big foreign policy questions facing Leo, history's first American pope, was whether he would continue renewing the accord or heed conservative demands and make some changes.",
      "There have been apparent violations on the Beijing side with some unilateral appointments that occurred without papal consent. The issue came to a head just before the conclave that elected Leo pope, when the Chinese church proceeded with the preliminary election of two bishops, a step that comes before official consecration.",

      "Britain\u2019s Labour government will hope to regain the political initiative when Treasury chief Rachel Reeves sets out her spending plans for the coming years",
      "LONDON -- Britain's Labour government hopes to regain the political initiative Wednesday when Treasury chief Rachel Reeves sets out her spending plans for the coming years, with big increases expected for health, defense and housing.",
      "Reeves, who has been blamed by many for Labour's decline in popularity since it returned to power after 14 years in July, will outline the government's spending and investment priorities for lawmakers. There will be no tax announcements.",
      "Reeves is expected to argue the government is on the path to \u201crenewing Britain\u201d but that \u201ctoo many people in too many parts of the country are yet to feel it,\u201d according to remarks issued by the Treasury.",
      "\u201cThis government\u2019s task \u2014 my task \u2014 and the purpose of this spending review is to change that, to ensure that renewal is felt in people\u2019s everyday lives, their jobs, their communities,\" she is expected to tell lawmakers.",
      "Labour won a landslide victory last year on a slogan of \u201cchange\u201d and voter anger at the Conservative administration in power at the time, but its vote share was historically low for a winning party at 35%.",
      "In the months since, Labour has been overtaken in opinion polls by the anti-immigration and recently formed Reform UK. Reeves has been blamed by many for Labour's struggles, not least her decision in July to withdraw a winter fuel subsidy to all but the poorest retirees.",
      "The outcry, which contributed to Labour's poor performance in recent local elections, prompted Reeves to about-turn and raise the threshold at which retirees will get the subsidy.",
      "She and Prime Minister Keir Starmer will hope the change will stem the anger and focus voters on other issues, such as its spending priorities.",
      "Among the main announcements is expected to be a 30 billion-pound ($41 billion) increase in funding for Britain's cherished but struggling National Health Service, as well as a rise in defense spending that will account for 2.5% of national output by 2027. Billions more are expected for social housing as the government aims to meet its target of building 1.5 million new homes by the next election.",
      "However, some departments are set to lose out after accounting for inflation, including local government, the justice system and the Home Office.",
      "Reeves has insisted she won't go on a big splurge, arguing that all her spending plans will meet her self-imposed fiscal rules.",
      "After raising taxes on business in her first budget last October, Reeves will find it difficult to swell the Treasury's coffers further in coming years as Labour won the election on a promise it would not increase income or sales taxes.",
      "And with the British economy still growing at historically low levels, the tax take is not expected to get a big lift.",
      "Reeves will hope her investment plans can help change that.",

      "South Korea\u2019s military has shut down loudspeakers broadcasting anti-North Korean propaganda along the inter-Korean border",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s military shut down loudspeakers broadcasting anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border on Wednesday, marking the new liberal government\u2019s first concrete step toward easing tensions between the war-divided rivals.",
      "The South resumed the daily loudspeaker broadcasts in June last year following a yearslong pause in retaliation for North Korea flying trash-laden balloons toward the South in a psychological warfare campaign.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said the move, ordered by President Lee Jae-myung, was part of efforts \u201cto restore trust in inter-Korean relations and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d",
      "Kang Yu-jung, Lee\u2019s spokesperson, described the decision as a \u201cproactive step\u201d to reduce military tensions and ease the burden for South Koreans residing in border areas, who have also been affected by North Korea\u2019s retaliatory loudspeaker broadcasts.",
      "North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un, didn\u2019t immediately comment on the step by Seoul.",
      "South Korea reactivated its front-line loudspeakers to blast propaganda messages and K-pop songs toward the North last year in response to thousands of trash balloons that Pyongyang flew toward South Korea to drop substances including wastepaper, cloth scraps, cigarette butts and even manure.",
      "From May to November last year, North Korea flew about 7,000 balloons toward South Korea in 32 separate occasions, according to the South's military. The North said that its balloon campaign came after South Korean activists sent over balloons filled with anti-North Korean leaflets, as well as USB sticks filled with popular South Korean songs and dramas.",
      "Trash carried by at least one North Korean balloon fell on the South Korean presidential compound in July, raising concerns about the vulnerability of key South Korean facilities. Officials said that the balloon contained no dangerous material and no one was hurt.",
      "The South's broadcast playlist was clearly designed to strike a nerve in Pyongyang, where Kim\u2019s government has been intensifying a campaign to eliminate the influence of South Korean pop culture and language among the population in a bid to strengthen his family\u2019s dynastic rule.",
      "The Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns added to tensions fueled by North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear ambitions and South Korean efforts to expand joint military exercises with the United States and strengthen three-way security cooperation with Japan.",
      "Lee, an outspoken liberal who took office last week after winning an early election to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has vowed to improve relations with Pyongyang, which reacted furiously to Yoon\u2019s hard-line policies and shunned dialogue.",
      "During his election campaign, Lee promised to halt the loudspeaker broadcasts, arguing that they created unnecessary tensions and discomfort for South Korean residents in border towns. In recent months, those residents had complained about North Korea\u2019s retaliatory broadcasts, which included howling animals, pounding gongs and other irritating sounds.",
      "In a briefing on Monday, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, also called for South Korean civilian activists to stop flying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. Such activities \u201ccould heighten tensions on the Korean Peninsula and threaten the lives and safety of residents in border areas,\u201d said Koo Byoungsam, the ministry\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "In his inaugural address last week, Lee vowed to reopen communication channels with North Korea. But prospects for an early resumption of dialogue between the rival Koreas remain dim. North Korea has consistently rejected offers from South Korea and the United States since 2019, when nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang collapsed over sanctions-related disagreements.",
      "North Korea\u2019s priority in foreign policy is now firmly with Russia, which has received thousands of North Korean troops and large amounts of military equipment in recent months for its war with Ukraine. South Korean and U.S. officials have expressed concern that Kim in return could seek Russian technology transfers that could enhance the threat posed by his nuclear weapons and missile program.",
      "Yoon, who was removed from office in April over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December, had focused on strengthening military partnerships with Washington and Tokyo and on securing stronger U.S. assurances of a swift and decisive nuclear response to defend the South against a North Korean nuclear attack.",
      "In a fierce reaction to Yoon\u2019s policies, Kim declared in January 2024 that he was abandoning the long-standing goals of a peaceful unification with the South and instructed the rewriting of the North\u2019s constitution to cement the South as a permanent \u201cprincipal enemy.\u201d",
      "Following years of heightened testing activity, Kim has acquired a broad range of missiles that could potentially target rivals in Asia and the U.S. mainland. He has also called for increased production of nuclear materials to create more bombs.",
      "Rafael Mariano Grossi, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Monday that the U.N. nuclear watchdog is monitoring signs that North Korea may be building a new uranium-enrichment plant at its main nuclear complex in Yongbyon.",

At 10 a.m. on Wednesday, marking the moment a day earlier when police were alerted to shots at the BORG Dreiersch\u00fctzengasse high school, the country stopped for a minute of silence.",

The first candles were laid on Tuesday evening as a crowd gathered on the square, some people hugging each other as they tried to come to terms with the tragedy. Hundreds of people joined Austrian officials at a service Tuesday evening in the Graz cathedral.",
      "Among those on the square Wednesday was Chiara Komlenic, a 28-year-old art history student who finished her exams at the school there.",

      "Police didn\u2019t elaborate on investigators\u2019 findings in a brief post on social network X. But a senior official who acknowledged that the letter had been found on Tuesday night said it hadn\u2019t allowed them to draw conclusions.",
      "\u201cA farewell letter in analog and digital form was found,\u201d Franz Ruf, the public security director at Austria\u2019s Interior Ministry, told ORF public television. \u201cHe says goodbye to his parents. But no motive can be inferred from the farewell letter, and that is a matter for further investigations.\u201d",
      "Asked whether the assailant had attacked victims randomly or targeted them specifically, Ruf said that is also under investigation and he didn\u2019t want to speculate.",

      "In the heart of Spain\u2019s capital, the famous Sobrino de Bot\u00edn restaurant proudly holds the title of being the world\u2019s oldest restaurant",
      "MADRID -- In the heart of Spain's capital, Sobrino de Bot\u00edn holds a coveted Guinness World Record as the world's oldest restaurant. Exactly three hundred years after it opened its doors, Bot\u00edn welcomes droves of daily visitors hungry for Castilian fare with a side of history.",
      "But on the outskirts of Madrid, far from the souvenir shops and tourist sites, a rustic tavern named Casa Pedro makes a bold claim. Its owners assert the establishment endured not just the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s and the Napoleonic invasion in the early 1800s, but even the War of Spanish Succession at the start of the 18th century \u2014 a lineage that would make Casa Pedro older than Bot\u00edn and a strong contender for the title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve been around since 1702,\u2019 but ... you can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said manager and eighth-generation proprietor Irene Gui\u00f1ales. \u201cIf you look at the restaurant\u2019s logo, it says \u2018Casa Pedro, since 1702,\u2019 so we said, \u2018Damn it, let\u2019s try to prove it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gui\u00f1ales, 51, remembers her grandfather swearing by Casa Pedro\u2019s age, but she was aware that decades-old hearsay from a proud old-timer wouldn't be enough to prove it. Her family hired a historian and has so far turned up documents dating the restaurant's operations to at least 1750.",
      "That puts them within striking distance of Bot\u00edn\u2019s record.",
      "Both taverns are family-owned. Both offer Castilian classics like stewed tripe and roast suckling pig. They are decorated with charming Spanish tiles, feature ceilings with exposed wooden beams and underground wine cellars. And both enjoy a rich, star-studded history.",
      "Bot\u00edn's celebrated past includes a roster of literary patrons like Truman Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Graham Greene. In his book \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Ernest Hemingway described it as \u201cone of the best restaurants in the world.\" While Casa Pedro may not have boasted the same artistic pedigree, it boasts its own VIPs. Its walls are adorned with decades-old photographs of former Spanish King Juan Carlos I dining in one of its many rooms. The current Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI dines there, too, albeit more inconspicuously than his father.",
      "But the similarities between the two hotspots end there.",
      "Casa Pedro was once a stop on the only road heading north from the Spanish capital toward France. Its clientele is largely local regulars, like David Gonz\u00e1lez and Mayte Villena, who for years have spent every Friday lunching at the tavern.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't change a thing for us,\u201d Villena said about the restaurant someday securing the Guinness title.",
      "Bot\u00edn, on the other hand, is a stone\u2019s throw from Madrid\u2019s famed Plaza Mayor, where any day of the week tour guides are herding groups around town \u2014 and often straight through the restaurant's front door.",
      "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a third-generation proprietor of Bot\u00edn, concedes that the Guinness accolade awarded in 1987 has helped business, but said the restaurant had enough history to draw visitors even before.",
      "\u201cIt has a certain magic,\u201d he said.",
      "The question then becomes: How can either restaurant definitively claim the title? Guinness provides its specific guidelines for the superlative only to applicants, according to spokesperson Kylie Galloway, noting that it entails \u201csubstantial evidence and documentation of the restaurant\u2019s operation over the years.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said that Guinness required Bot\u00edn show that it has continuously operated in the same location with the same name.",
      "The only time the restaurant closed was during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Casa Pedro.",
      "That criteria would mean that restaurants that are even older \u2014 Paris' Le Procope, which says it was founded in 1686, or Beijing\u2019s Bianyifang, founded in 1416, or the 1673-established White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island \u2014 aren't eligible for the designation.",
      "La Campana, in Rome\u2019s historic center, claims over 500 years of operation, citing documents on its menu and in a self-published history. Its owners say they have compiled the requisite paperwork and plan to submit it to Guinness.",
      "Gui\u00f1ales and her husband couldn't consult archives from the former town of Fuencarral, now a Madrid neighborhood. Those papers went up in flames during the Spanish Civil War. Instead, they delved into Spanish national archives, where they found land registries of the area from the First Marquess of Ensenada (1743-1754) that showed the existence of a tavern, wine cellar and inn in the small town as of 1750.",
      "In their spare time, the couple continues to hunt for records proving that Casa Pedro indeed dates back to 1702, as is proclaimed on its walls, takeout bags and sugar packets.",
      "But even if they dig up the final documents and wrest the Guinness honor from Bot\u00edn, Gui\u00f1ales concedes that her restaurant's quiet location makes it unlikely to draw Bot\u00edn\u2019s clientele in central Madrid.",
      "\u201cTo think that we could reach that public would be incredible,\u201d Gui\u00f1ales said. \u201cIt's a dream, but it's a dream.\u201d",

      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has defended his centrist, pro-European government before parliament, seeking to reassert control and rally his fractured coalition after suffering a bitter political defeat",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Donald Tusk defended his centrist, pro-European government before parliament on Wednesday, seeking to reassert control and rally his fractured coalition after suffering a bitter political defeat.",
      "Tusk requested a vote of confidence in the wake of the June 1 loss of Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski \u2014 his close ally \u2014 to nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki. Backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, Nawrocki is set to replace outgoing President Andrzej Duda, another conservative who repeatedly blocked Tusk\u2019s reform efforts.",
      "\u201cI am asking for a vote of confidence with full conviction that we have a mandate to govern, to take full responsibility for what is happening in Poland,\u201d Tusk said.",
      "Most of the power in Poland's parliamentary system rests with an elected parliament and a government chosen by the parliament. However, the president can veto legislation and represents the country abroad.",
      "\u201cAnyone who is ready to move forward with me, with the government, and above all with our voters, regardless of these momentary emotions, and build a better Poland, should vote today for a vote of confidence in our government,\" Tusk said.",
      "The vote, scheduled for Wednesday afternoon, is widely expected to go in Tusk\u2019s favor. His four-party coalition holds a narrow but stable majority in the 460-seat Sejm, Poland\u2019s lower house.",
      "A loss would trigger the formation of a caretaker government and may open the door for an early parliamentary election. That could potentially returning power to the conservative Law and Justice party, in coalition with the far-right Confederation party, whose candidate placed third in the presidential race.",
      "Tusk had long counted on a Trzaskowski victory to break the institutional deadlock created by Duda\u2019s vetoes. Instead, he now faces an incoming president aligned with the nationalist opposition and openly hostile to his government\u2019s legislative priorities.",
      "\u201cWe cannot close our eyes to reality,\u201d he said. \u201cA president who was reluctant to accept the changes we proposed for Poland and our voters is being replaced by a president who is at least equally reluctant to those changes and proposals.\u201d",
      "But he also argued that Trzaskowski\u2019s narrow defeat indicates that there is continued strong support for those who share his views.",
      "The election result has rattled the already uneasy governing coalition, which spans from center-left to center-right and has struggled to deliver on key campaign pledges, including liberalizing Poland\u2019s abortion law and legalizing same-sex civil unions. Tusk acknowledged the growing strains in Wednesday\u2019s address.",
      "Many are also blaming Tusk for contributing to Trzaskowski\u2019s loss. Much of the criticism has come from within his coalition, as his partners examine whether they are better off sticking with him or risking a collapse of the coalition. Some are calling for a new prime minister to be selected.",
      "There are questions about what Tusk can realistically achieve before the next parliamentary election, scheduled for late 2027, and whether the coalition will even survive that long amid a surge in popularity for the far right. Polish media and political analysts are debating whether this might be the 68-year-old Tusk's political twilight.",
      "\u201cI know the taste of victory, I know the bitterness of defeat, but I don\u2019t know the word surrender,\u201d Tusk said.",
      "As part of his fresh start, he announced plans for a government reconstruction in July that will include \u201cnew faces.\u201d He said a government spokesman would be appointed in June \u2014 an acknowledgement that the coalition needs a way to present a unified message. So far Tusk has sought to communicate his policies to the public himself on social media and in news conferences.",
      "Tusk served as Polish prime minister from 2007 to 2014 and then as president of the European Council from 2014 to 2019. He became Poland's prime minister again in December 2023 in a country exhausted by the pandemic and inflation, and with political divisions deep and bitter.",
      "In a sign of those divisions, half of the parliament hall was empty on Wednesday, with lawmakers from the right-wing Law and Justice party boycotting his speech. Tusk said their absence showed disrespect to the nation.",

    "story": [
      "Spain\u2019s economy minister Carlos Cuerpo says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year pose a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore",
      "MADRID -- Spain's economy minister says the millions of tourists who visit the country every year present a challenge for Spain's residents that the government can no longer afford to ignore.",
      "Last year, Spain received a record 94 million international visitors, making it one of the most visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to some projections.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that these record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges,\u201d Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said in an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a key sector for the Southern European nation's economy, which grew faster than any major advanced economy last year at 3.2%, and is projected to grow at 2.4% this year, according to the Bank of Spain, well ahead of the expected eurozone average of 0.9%.",
      "But a stubborn housing crisis in which home and rental costs have skyrocketed in cities such as Madrid, Barcelona and elsewhere has led to growing frustration about one aspect tied to tourism in particular: the proliferation of short-term rental apartments in city centers.",
      "The country has seen several large protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people to demand more government action on housing. Signs at demonstrations with slogans such as \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods\u201d point to the growing anger.",
      "In response, the government recently announced it was cracking down on Airbnb listings that it said were operating in the country illegally, a decision that the company is appealing.",
      "\u201cWe are a 49 million-inhabitants country,\" Cuerpo said. The record numbers of tourists illustrate the \u201cattractiveness of our country, but also of the challenge that we have in terms of dealing and providing for a good experience for tourists, but at the same time avoiding overcharging (for) our own services and our own housing,\u201d he said.",
      "The Bank of Spain recently said the country has a deficit of 450,000 homes. Building more public housing is critical to solve the problem, Cuerpo said. Spain has a lower stock of public housing than many other major European Union countries.",
      "\u201cThis is the key challenge for this term,\u201d the minister said of the country's housing woes.",
      "On the possibility of more U.S. tariffs on EU goods, the top economic policymaker for the eurozone's fourth-largest economy said he believed the EU still wanted to reinforce economic ties with the U.S.",
      "\u201cFrom the EU side, we are constructive but we are not naive,\" Cuerpo said, adding that the bloc would pursue \u201cother routes protecting our firms and industries\u201d if no agreement with the Trump administration can be reached.",
      "A 90-day pause on tariffs announced by the EU and the U.S. is slated to end on July 14. About halfway through that grace period, U.S. President Donald Trump announced 50% tariffs on steel imports. The U.S. has also enacted a 25% tariff on vehicles and 10% so-called reciprocal tariffs on most other goods.",
      "On how Spain's current housing woes got here, the minister said a steep drop in construction in Spain following the 2008 financial crisis played a role. So did population growth due to immigration, Cuerpo said, and pressures from an increase in the number of tourists.",
      "While building more housing is key, the minister advocated for an all-of-the-above approach, including regulating Spain's housing market and short-term rental platforms.",
      "\u201cFor us, there\u2019s no silver bullet,\u201d he said.",

      "An international rights group says several global brands are among dozens of companies at risk of using forced labor through their Chinese supply chains",
      "LONDON -- Several global brands are among dozens of companies at risk of using forced labor through their Chinese supply chains because they use critical minerals or buy minerals-based products sourced from China's far-western Xinjiang region, an international rights group said Wednesday.",
      "The report by the Netherlands-based Global Rights Compliance says companies including Avon, Walmart, Nescafe, Coca-Cola and paint supplier Sherwin-Williams may be linked to titanium sourced from Xinjiang, where rights groups allege the Chinese government runs coercive labor practices targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities.",
      "The report comes as China and the United States, the world's two largest economies, continue talks aimed at easing their trade dispute.",
      "The report found 77 Chinese suppliers in the titanium, lithium, beryllium and magnesium industries operating in Xinjiang. It said the suppliers are at risk of participating in the Chinese government's \u201clabor transfer programs,\" in which Uyghurs are forced to work in factories as part of a longstanding campaign of assimilation and mass detention.",
      "Commercial paints, thermos cups and components for the aerospace, auto and defense industries are among products sold internationally that can trace their supply chains to minerals from Xinjiang, the report said. It said companies must review their supply chains.",
      "\u201cMineral mining and processing in (Xinjiang) rely in part on the state\u2019s forced labor programs for Uyghurs and other Turkic people in the region,\u201d the report said.",
      "The named companies did not immediately comment on the report.",
      "A 2022 United Nations report found China may have committed crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, where more than 1 million Uyghurs are estimated to have been arbitrarily detained as part of measures the Chinese government said were intended to target terrorism and separatism.",
      "The Chinese government has rejected the U.N. claims and defended its actions in Xinjiang as fighting terror and ensuring stability.",
      "In 2021, former U.S. President Joe Biden signed a law to block imports from the Xinjiang region unless businesses can prove the items were made without forced labor. The law initially targeted solar products, tomatoes, cotton and apparel, but the U.S. government recently added new sectors for enforcement, including aluminum and seafood.",
      "A recent report by the International Energy Agency said the world\u2019s sources of critical minerals are increasingly concentrated in a few countries, notably China, which is also a leading refining and processing base for lithium, cobalt, graphite and other minerals.",
      "Many of China's major minerals corporations have invested in the exploration and mining of lithium, a key component for electric vehicle batteries, in Xinjiang, Global Rights Compliance said. Xinjiang is also China's top source of beryllium, a mineral used for aerospace, defense and telecommunications, its report said.",

      "Much of the industry, including the major airlines and their trade groups, supports Bryan Bedford\u2019s nomination. But pilots unions and Democrats have raised concerns that he might weaken pilot training standards.",
      "Bedford has been CEO of regional airline Republic Airways since 1999 and has more than three decades of experience in the industry. He has pledged to make safety the FAA\u2019s top priority and work to restore public confidence in flying. Bedford also said he'll work with Congress on Trump\u2019s multi-billion-dollar plan to overhaul the nation\u2019s air traffic control system.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has said the FAA should have acted before the crash in Washington, D.C., because there had been 85 near misses reported around Ronald Reagan National Airport in the years before the disaster. The FAA has since banned some helicopter routes to make sure helicopters and planes no longer share the same airspace, but there have still been additional near misses in recent months.",
      "FAA's acting administrator and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have acknowledged the FAA's shortcomings in not recognizing the risk and pledged to review all the agency's data to identify any similar concerns nationwide about helicopter traffic near airports. That review prompted the agency to put new limits on helicopter flights around Las Vegas' airport.",
      "Even the air traffic controllers union backed Bedford's nomination because of his support for the effort to modernize the outdated system and bolster controller hiring. Two different radar outages this spring in a facility that directs planes in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport highlighted the problems because the FAA had to limit flights at the airport after five controllers took trauma leave after the problems.",

      "Pilots\u2019 unions and Democrats have raised concerns that Bedford may support weakening the 1,500-hour experience standard for airline pilots that was adopted after a 2009 crash or even might consider allowing some airlines to operate with only one pilot. Republic previously asked for permission to hire pilots with less experience because the standard was making it hard to find enough pilots.",

Inside, you\u2019ll find a well-built interior that\u2019s easy to use. The Ioniq 6 touts a long EPA-estimated range of up to 342 miles. It\u2019s also one of the quickest-charging EVs on the market when using a powerful fast-charging machine.",
      "The electric Hyundai\u2019s drawbacks are mostly minor, with one big exception. Its styling isn\u2019t for everyone and attracts attention for good and bad reasons. However, the upcoming 2026 model has updated styling that\u2019s easier on the eyes.",

If you plan on frequently towing heavy loads and tackling serious off-road trails, then other midsize trucks like the Ford Ranger would be a better fit. But if not, you should consider the Ridgeline. It\u2019s more comfortable, has more passenger room and handles better than its rivals.",
      "The Ridgeline\u2019s towing capacity is certainly good enough for most uses, such as pulling a small camper trailer or toy hauler.

If you charge regularly, trips to the gas station will be rare thanks to the Outlander PHEV\u2019s lengthy 38-mile electric range. When the battery runs low, you\u2019ll get a respectable 26 mpg combined.",
      "With the third row folded down, the Outlander PHEV offers lots of cargo space. When it\u2019s up, you\u2019ll have room for seven passengers, but the third row is only large enough for kids. Its starting price isn\u2019t low because it\u2019s a plug-in hybrid, but the Mitsubishi comes well equipped, and the top SEL trim level is quite luxurious.",

Its styling is similar to a sedan\u2019s, but the Crown has a raised ride height that\u2019s more like a crossover SUV\u2019s. Oh, and it\u2019s a hybrid too. The base engine is a fuel sipper that gets an EPA-estimated 41 mpg combined. The optional Hybrid Max engine produces an impressive 340 horsepower for quick acceleration, but fuel economy dips to 30 mpg combined.",
      "Inside, the Crown has a pleasing interior with large display screens, spacious seating and a comfortable ride. But all this comes at a cost. The Crown is pricey for a non-luxury hybrid sedan, especially the top Platinum trim that has the Hybrid Max engine.",
      "2025 Crown starting price: $42,575",
      "The G90 has everything you want in a large, lavish sedan except for brand cachet. Genesis is still relatively new in the luxury world, but its vehicles, especially the flagship G90, shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. This South Korean sedan touts style, power, exceptional comfort, and an opulent cabin with superb fit and finish. Some rivals offer the same but require an arm and a leg for payment. And you\u2019re mistaken if you think the G90 skimps on features.",
      "The top 3.5T E-Supercharger version doesn\u2019t offer any optional features because it comes equipped with many features, including many that usually cost thousands more than they would on a luxury rival. The most notable ones include front and rear massaging seats, a 26-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system, a massive package of advanced driver aids, and an air suspension that scans the road ahead so it can adjust to road imperfections.",

      "But with concern and confusion over how the federal government will respond to disasters this summer, the group is readying to possibly help in ways it hasn\u2019t before.",
      "\u201cThe one thing certain this hurricane season is the uncertainty of what\u2019s going to happen at the federal level,\u201d said Jeff Byard, Team Rubicon senior vice president of operations.",
      "Byard and his team are evaluating how else they can help communities if the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees federal response to disasters, reduces its capacity or is deployed less often. President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his intent to overhaul FEMA, if not totally dismantle it.",
      "Team Rubicon is good at being agile, Byard said, but nonprofits and funders are already under pressure from more frequent and severe climate events. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder in a really hard situation already,\u201d he said.",
      "Experts worry Trump might approve fewer major disaster declarations, which unlock federal funding and resources, and that FEMA\u2019s response could be slowed or diminished. Trainings have been reduced, and around 2,000 employees have left or been fired since January, including high-level staff.",
      "\"Whether it's a hurricane or earthquake, the federal government is not prepared the way it has been in the past,\u201d said Michael Coen, who held posts at FEMA under three presidential administrations.",
      "Nonprofits and funders across the United States say there is too much at stake for communities to just wait and see what happens. \u201cFrom the nonprofit perspective, we have to really lean in,\u201d said Marcus Coleman, vice president of community resilience strategy for United Way Worldwide.",
      "FEMA is \u201cfully activated in preparation for Hurricane Season,\u201d and is \u201cshifting from bloated DC-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens,\" according to a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the agency.",
      "Leaders in disaster relief say FEMA\u2019s absence would make it harder to coordinate resources across federal government, set up effective communications, and deploy emergency supplies. \u201cFEMA is a key partner, we need them,\u201d said David Guadalupe, chair of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster.",
      "They worry the sudden policy changes could leave many states unprepared and under-resourced, intensifying the need for donations and volunteers.",
      "\u201cThe worst case scenario is that that money gets pulled back and we have to fill in those gaps,\u201d said Ann Lee, CEO of the relief organization CORE.",
      "It would be especially difficult, they say, to replace the services under FEMA\u2019s Individual Assistance program, like temporary housing and grants to repair or replace damaged homes and vehicles.",
      "For direct assistance alone, FEMA has approved over $460 million for 160,000 households in North Carolina since Hurricane Helene, and more than $136 million for 34,500 households after the Los Angeles fires.",
      "\u201cIf the funding to the people gets eliminated, that\u2019s all they have,\u201d said Michael Capponi, president of Global Empowerment Mission, adding that while nonprofits are often faster and more efficient at getting people help, they still need the money to make it happen. \u201cThe private sector can never take that on,\u201d he said.",
      "FEMA also funds disaster case managers, who help survivors navigate paperwork, and legal and mental health support. Providing those services \u201cwill require even more robust volunteer organization,\u201d said Byard.",
      "Other needs could include supporting smaller, less experienced emergency management departments, collecting data about survivor needs, or hauling away debris if federal dollars don't pay for the pickup.",
      "Even when FEMA help is available, it could look different than recent years, said Coleman. He points out that the agency already canceled its door-to-door canvassing program that helped survivors enroll with FEMA, and worries the feds could give survivors less time to apply. \u201cThe effort to get the word out about FEMA assistance is critically important,\u201d he said. \u201cNonprofits will have to move quickly.\u201d",
      "Relief organizations like CORE and Good360 are also pre-positioning more supplies in storm-vulnerable areas, in part in case FEMA supplies arrive more slowly. Trump took up to eight weeks to approve some declaration requests this spring, making aid groups even more important as survivors waited for help. \u201cThat preparation is the biggest thing to focus on,\u201d said Lee.",
      "The new responsibilities could come at a time when states, nonprofits and funders are already under strain from worsening disasters and federal funding cuts across government.",
      "A United Way Worldwide survey of the 211 network found that referrals for disaster-related assistance rose over 50% in 2024. Nonprofits have also been weakened by losing federal grants as well as staff from AmeriCorps cuts.",
      "\u201cThe groups in the community 365 days a year are getting beat up significantly,\u201d said Noah Patton, director of disaster recovery at the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, adding community-based organizations are already under pressure from housing shortages and other crises.",
      "\u201cWhen you're working at a homeless shelter that is 100% utilized and then you drop a disaster on it, it\u2019s \u2018How will I continue to do my job,\u2019 not \u2018How can I expand my mission.\u2019\u201d",
      "Funders that fuel recovery work say they can\u2019t replace federal money. \u201cIt\u2019s not just unrealistic, it\u2019s a dangerous abdication of public responsibility,\u201d said Ryan Eller, executive director of the Appalachia Funders Network. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason these agencies were brought about in the first place when local resources just can\u2019t meet the need.\u201d",
      "Philanthropy committed over $300 million to recovery to Hurricane Helene alone, and hundreds of millions more each for the fires in LA and on Maui. Eller said it\u2019s getting harder to fundraise for recovery. \u201cThere is a general fatigue around disaster philanthropy because of the volume and frequency of storms,\u201d he said.",
      "Even if a nonprofit can't take on more, simply building relationships with state and local government, residents, and fellow relief groups ahead of an emergency will make everyone more prepared, said Byard. \u201cTake FEMA out of it, now we\u2019re really looking at communities supporting communities,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can build some really really strong resilience.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Britain's Labour government hopes to regain the political initiative Wednesday when Treasury chief Rachel Reeves sets out her spending plans for the coming years, with big increases expected for health, defense and housing.",
      "Reeves, who has been blamed by many for Labour's decline in popularity since it returned to power after 14 years in July, will outline the government's spending and investment priorities for lawmakers. There will be no tax announcements.",

Billions more are expected for social housing as the government aims to meet its target of building 1.5 million new homes by the next election.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s military has shut down loudspeakers broadcasting anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, marking the new liberal government\u2019s first concrete step toward easing tensions between the war-divided rivals.",
      "The South resumed the loudspeaker broadcasts in June last year following a yearslong pause in retaliation for North Korea flying trash-laden balloons toward the South in a psychological warfare campaign.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said Wednesday that the move was part of efforts to \u201cto restore trust in inter-Korean relations and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d",
      "North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un, didn't immediately comment on the step by Seoul.",
      "From May to November last year, North Korea flew about 7,000 balloons toward South Korea in 32 separate events to drop substances such as wastepaper, cloth scraps, cigarette butts and even manure. The North said that its balloon campaign came after South Korean activists sent over balloons filled with anti-North Korean leaflets, as well as USB sticks filled with popular South Korean songs and dramas.",
      "Trash carried by at least one North Korean balloon fell on the South Korean presidential compound in July, raising concerns about the vulnerability of key South Korean facilities. Officials said that the balloon contained no dangerous material and no one was hurt.",
      "South Korea, in response to the North Korean balloons, reactivated its front-line loudspeakers to blast propaganda messages and K-pop songs toward the North. The playlist was clearly designed to strike the nerve of Pyongyang, as Kim\u2019s government since the COVID-19 pandemic has been intensifying a campaign to eliminate the influence of South Korean pop culture and language among the population in a bid to strengthen his family\u2019s dynastic rule.",
      "The Cold War-style psychological warfare campaigns added to tensions fueled by North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear ambitions and South Korean efforts to expand joint military exercises with the United States and strengthen three-way security cooperation with Japan.",
      "South Korea\u2019s new liberal president, Lee Jae-myung, who took office last week after winning an early election to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has vowed to improve relations with Pyongyang, which reacted furiously to Yoon\u2019s hard-line policies and shunned dialogue.",
      "During the election campaign, Lee promised to halt the loudspeaker broadcasts, arguing that they created unnecessary tensions and discomfort for South Korean residents in border towns. In recent months, those residents had complained about North Korea\u2019s retaliatory broadcasts, which included howling animals, pounding gongs and other irritating sounds.",
      "In a briefing on Monday, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, also called for South Korean civilian activists to stop flying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets across the border. Such activities \u201ccould heighten tensions on the Korean Peninsula and threaten the lives and safety of residents in border areas,\u201d said Koo Byoungsam, the ministry\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "In his inaugural address last week, Lee vowed to reopen communication channels with North Korea to ease tensions. But prospects for an early resumption of dialogue between the rival Koreas remain dim, as North Korea has consistently rejected offers from South Korea and the United States since 2019, when nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang collapsed over sanctions-related disagreements.",

      "But a stubborn housing crisis in which home and rental costs have skyrocketed in cities such as Madrid, Barcelona and elsewhere has led to growing frustration about one aspect tied to tourism in particular: the proliferation of short-term rental apartments in city centers.",
      "The country has seen several large protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people to demand more government action on housing. Signs at demonstrations with slogans such as \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods\u201d point to the growing anger.",
      "In response, the government recently announced it was cracking down on Airbnb listings that it said were operating in the country illegally, a decision that the company is appealing.",
      "\u201cWe are a 49 million-inhabitants country,\" Cuerpo said. The record numbers of tourists illustrate the \u201cattractiveness of our country, but also of the challenge that we have in terms of dealing and providing for a good experience for tourists, but at the same time avoiding overcharging (for) our own services and our own housing,\u201d he said.",
      "The Bank of Spain recently said the country has a deficit of 450,000 homes. Building more public housing is critical to solve the problem, Cuerpo said. Spain has a lower stock of public housing than many other major European Union countries.",
      "\u201cThis is the key challenge for this term,\u201d the minister said of the country's housing woes.",
      "On the possibility of more U.S. tariffs on EU goods, the top economic policymaker for the eurozone's fourth-largest economy said he believed the EU still wanted to reinforce economic ties with the U.S.",
      "\u201cFrom the EU side, we are constructive but we are not naive,\" Cuerpo said, adding that the bloc would pursue \u201cother routes protecting our firms and industries\u201d if no agreement with the Trump administration can be reached.",
      "A 90-day pause on tariffs announced by the EU and the U.S. is slated to end on July 14. About halfway through that grace period, U.S. President Donald Trump announced 50% tariffs on steel imports. The U.S. has also enacted a 25% tariff on vehicles and 10% so-called reciprocal tariffs on most other goods.",
      "On how Spain's current housing woes got here, the minister said a steep drop in construction in Spain following the 2008 financial crisis played a role. So did population growth due to immigration, Cuerpo said, and pressures from an increase in the number of tourists.",
      "While building more housing is key, the minister advocated for an all-of-the-above approach, including regulating Spain's housing market and short-term rental platforms.",
      "\u201cFor us, there\u2019s no silver bullet,\u201d he said.",

      "LONDON -- Several global brands are among dozens of companies at risk of using forced labor through their Chinese supply chains because they use critical minerals or buy minerals-based products sourced from China's far-western Xinjiang region, an international rights group said Wednesday.",
      "The report by the Netherlands-based Global Rights Compliance says companies including Avon, Walmart, Nescafe, Coca-Cola and paint supplier Sherwin-Williams may be linked to titanium sourced from Xinjiang, where rights groups allege the Chinese government runs coercive labor practices targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities.",
      "The report comes as China and the United States, the world's two largest economies, continue talks aimed at easing their trade dispute.",
      "The report found 77 Chinese suppliers in the titanium, lithium, beryllium and magnesium industries operating in Xinjiang. It said the suppliers are at risk of participating in the Chinese government's \u201clabor transfer programs,\" in which Uyghurs are forced to work in factories as part of a longstanding campaign of assimilation and mass detention.",
      "Commercial paints, thermos cups and components for the aerospace, auto and defense industries are among products sold internationally that can trace their supply chains to minerals from Xinjiang, the report said. It said companies must review their supply chains.",

      "The Chinese government has rejected the U.N. claims and defended its actions in Xinjiang as fighting terror and ensuring stability.",
      "In 2021, former U.S. President Joe Biden signed a law to block imports from the Xinjiang region unless businesses can prove the items were made without forced labor. The law initially targeted solar products, tomatoes, cotton and apparel, but the U.S. government recently added new sectors for enforcement, including aluminum and seafood.",
      "A recent report by the International Energy Agency said the world\u2019s sources of critical minerals are increasingly concentrated in a few countries, notably China, which is also a leading refining and processing base for lithium, cobalt, graphite and other minerals.",
      "Many of China's major minerals corporations have invested in the exploration and mining of lithium, a key component for electric vehicle batteries, in Xinjiang, Global Rights Compliance said. Xinjiang is also China's top source of beryllium, a mineral used for aerospace, defense and telecommunications, its report said.",

Noting that the challenges to Trump's tariffs raise \"issues of exceptional importance,'' the appeals court said it would expedite the case and hear arguments July 31.",
      "The case involves 10% tariffs the president imposed on almost every country in April and bigger ones he imposed and then suspended on countries with which the United States runs trade deficits. It also involves tariffs Trump plastered on imports from China, Canada and Mexico to pressure them to do more to stop the illegal flow of immigrants and synthetic opioids across the U.S. border.",

      "A federal judge has tossed out a lawsuit over President Donald Trump's dismantling of a U.S. federal agency that invests in African small businesses.",
      "U.S. District Judge Richard Leon in Washington, D.C., dismissed the case on Tuesday, finding that Trump was acting within his legal authority when he fired the U.S. African Development Foundation's board members in February. In March, the same judge ruled that the administration's removal of most grant money and staff from the congressionally created agency was also legal, as long as the agency was maintained at the minimum level required by law.",
      "USADF was created as an independent agency in 1980, and its board members must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In 2023, Congress allocated $46 million to the agency to invest in small agricultural and energy infrastructure projects and other economic development initiatives in 22 African countries.",
      "On Feb. 19, Trump issued an executive order that said USADF, the U.S. Institute of Peace, the Inter-American Foundation and the Presidio Trust should be scaled back to the minimum presence required by law. At the time, USADF had five of its seven board seats filled. A few days later, an administration official told Ward Brehm that he was fired, and emails were sent to the other board members notifying them that they had also been terminated.",
      "Those emails were never received, however, because they were sent to the wrong email addresses. The four board members, believing they still held their posts because they had not been given notice, met in March and passed a resolution appointing Brehm as the president of the board.",
      "But Trump had already appointed Pete Marocco as the new chairman of what the administration believed to now be a board of one. Since then, both men have claimed to be the president of the agency, and Brehm filed the lawsuit March 6.",
      "Leon said that even though they didn't receive the emails, the four board members were effectively terminated in February, and so they didn't have the authority to appoint Brehm to lead the board.",
      "Brehm\u2019s attorney, Bradley Girard with Democracy Forward, expressed disappointment with the judge's decision.",
      "\u201cBut in our parallel case, Rural Development Innovations v.

      "That lawsuit is still pending before the same judge. In that case, two USADF staffers and a consulting firm based in Zambia that works closely with USADF contend that the Trump administration's efforts to deeply scale back the agency wrongly usurps Congress' powers. They also say Marocco was unlawfully appointed to the board, in part because he was never confirmed by the Senate as required.",

      "U.S. inflation likely picked up a bit last month as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs start to bite, but lower prices for gas and possibly for air fares and used cars may limit the overall increase",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. inflation likely picked up a bit last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs start to bite, but lower prices for gas and possibly for air fares and used cars may limit the overall increase.",
      "The government's inflation report, to be released Wednesday, is forecast to show that consumer prices rose 2.5% in May compared with a year ago, according to economists surveyed by data provider FactSet. That would be the first increase in four months and up from 2.3% in April. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices are projected to have risen 2.9% in May from a year earlier, up from 2.8% in April.",
      "Trump's tariffs are expected to contribute to the uptick by raising the cost of some imports, including clothes, furniture, appliances, and possibly new cars. Many retailers and some consumer products companies have said they have plans to raise prices or have already done so to cover the cost of the import duties.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices are expected to have moved up 0.2% from April to May, while core prices are forecast to have increased 0.3%. At that pace, core prices would rise much faster than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Economists and the inflation-fighters at the Fed focus on core inflation because it often provides a better sense of where inflation is headed.",
      "Inflation has cooled in the past year and, excluding the impact of tariffs, economists say it would be on track to return to the Fed's target, which would allow the central bank to cut its key interest rates. Yet core prices have been more stubborn and were stuck between 3.2% and 3.4% for nearly a year until February, when they started to decline a bit.",
      "Last week, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the inflation data, said it is reducing the amount of data it collects for each inflation report. Economists have expressed concern about the cutback, and while it isn't clear how sharp the reduction is, most analysts say it is likely to have a minor impact. Still, any reduction in data collection could make the figures more volatile.",
      "Nearly all economists expect Trump's duties will make many things more expensive in the second half of this year, including cars and groceries, though by how much is still uncertain. Trump has slapped 30% tariffs on all imports from China, plus a 10% baseline tariff on imported goods from every other country, and 50% import taxes on steel and aluminum.",
      "Given the potential for higher prices in the coming months, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have made clear they will keep their key rate unchanged until they have a better sense of how tariffs will affect the economy.",
      "The full impact of the tariffs likely won't be felt until the second half of the year, analysts say, even though many tariffs have been in place, in one form or another, since March and April. There are several reasons it can take months for the duties to fully pass through into retail prices.",
      "To begin with, many companies tried to beat the clock by bringing in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s tariffs took effect, producing a flood of imports in March. As a result, they have stockpiled goods in warehouses that weren't hit by tariffs and so don't have to raise prices yet.",
      "Many companies also held off on hiking prices during the chaos of April and May, when Trump announced sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly 60 countries, only to put them on hold a week later. He also ramped up duties on China to 145%, essentially cutting off trade with the United States' third-largest trading partner. Imports fell sharply in April as a result. The U.S. and China last month agreed to lower duties, with the U.S. now taxing Chinese imports 30%.",
      "For many firms, it wasn't worth it to raise prices until they had a better sense of where tariffs would settle. It's possible some duties could fall further if the Trump administration is able to reach trade deals in negotiations with China, the European Union, Japan and other countries.",
      "Still, Bryan Eshelman, a partner and managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners, said higher prices \u201care coming.\u201d",
      "Eshelman expects that shoppers will start feeling the impact in July, and predicts prices for back-to-school items like clothing and backpacks could go up anywhere from 5% to 15%. Retailers may add surcharges tied to higher tariffs costs at the cash register starting in September, he said.",
      "\u201cI think that that\u2019s something that retailers are going to be loathe to pull out and do. And so I think they will wait to see how things unfold, \u201d he said.",
      "Most imported goods are actually parts or raw materials for larger products, such as the steel and aluminum goods now facing 50% duties. It will take time for those costs to filter through the supply chain and affect prices.",
      "Some stores, however, have already said they will implement higher prices, including Best Buy, Walmart and Lululemon.",
      "It was only last month when Trump ripped into Walmart after the nation\u2019s largest retailer boldly warned that prices are already starting to go up on items like bananas. Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer John David Rainey told The Associated Press that a car seat that currently sells for $350 at Walmart will likely cost customers another $100.",
      "Rainey also told analysts at an Oppenheimer investor conference on Monday that for some items, Walmart will reduce inventory by as much as 20% because it expects higher prices will reduce demand, and it doesn\u2019t want to be stuck with leftover inventory.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump likes to say he's bringing in trillions of dollars in investments from foreign countries, but a provision in his tax cuts bill could cause international companies to avoid expanding into the United States.",
      "The House-passed version of the legislation would allow the federal government to impose taxes on foreign-parented companies and investors from countries judged as charging \u201cunfair foreign taxes\u201d on U.S. companies.",
      "Known as Section 899, the measure could cause companies to avoid investing in the the U.S. out of concern they could face steep taxes. The fate of the measure rests with the Senate \u2014 setting off a debate about its prospects and impact.",
      "A new analysis by the Global Business Alliance, a trade group representing international companies such as Toyota and Nestl\u00e9, estimates that the provision would cost the U.S. 360,000 jobs and $55 billion annually over 10 years in lost gross domestic product. The analysis estimates that the tax could cut a third off the economic growth anticipated from the overall tax cuts by Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "\"While proponents say this punitive tax hike is intended as a retaliatory measure against foreign governments, this report confirms that the real victims are American workers in states like North Carolina, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee and Texas,\" said Jonathan Samford, president and CEO of the Global Business Alliance.",
      "Republican Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, has defended the provision as protecting U.S. interests by giving the president a tool that can be used against countries with tax codes that, in the federal government's opinion, put American companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cIf these countries withdraw these taxes and decide to behave, we will have achieved our goal,\" Smith said in a statement last week. \"It\u2019s just common sense. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to move quickly to pass this bill and protect Americans from economic bad actors around the world.\u201d",
      "The tax gets at a fundamental tension within Trump's policy agenda: a contradiction in the broad strokes of Trump simultaneously trying to tax imports and foreign profits at higher rates while also seeking investments from companies headquartered abroad.",
      "In late May, Trump defended his approach by saying that his tariffs were causing more countries to invest in the U.S. to avoid imports getting taxed. While some countries and companies have made announcements, there is not evidence of the investments pushing up spending on new factories as measured in the government's monthly report on construction spending.",
      "The Republican president said his tendency to impose steep tariffs, then retreat to lower rates, had succeeded.",
      "\u201cWe have $14 trillion now invested, committed to investing,\u201d Trump said then. \u201cYou know we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. I went to Saudi Arabia, the king told me, he said, you got the hottest -- we have the hottest country in the world right now.\u201d",
      "The Global Business Alliance was among the groups that signed a letter on Monday warning of the consequences of Section 899 to Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho, both Republicans.",
      "The Investment Company Institute, representing financial firms, said the provision \u201ccould limit foreign investment to the U.S. \u2014 a key driver of growth in American capital markets that ultimately benefits American families saving for their futures.\u201d",
      "The analysis performed by EY Quantitative Economics and Statistics notes there is a degree of uncertainty in how the taxes under Section 899 could be implemented. But they could be charged against companies based in countries that tax digital services, as is the case in parts of Europe.",
      "If the U.S. judged the taxes unfair, there would be a 30% tax rate on foreign companies' profits and income. People working in the U.S. for the companies who are not citizens could also be taxed, among other provisions.",
      "The possibility of the taxes and seemingly arbitrary nature by which they could be imposed is also a challenge, said Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of New York University's Tax Law Center.",
      "\u201cSection 899 creates a game of political chicken with trade partners that risks harming businesses, consumers, and workers in the hopes of securing US multinationals the ability to shift more of their profits out of the US to tax havens,\" Huang said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s a high-risk strategy that could expand the damage of the failed tariff war.\u201d",
      "There could also be political repercussions if key states in Trump's political coalition from 2024 suffer layoffs or simply find job growth slowing. The Global Business Alliance finds job losses could amount to 44,200 in Florida, 27,700 in Pennsylvania, 24,500 in North Carolina and 23,500 in Michigan.",

      "The European Union wants to lower a cap on the price of Russian oil to deprive the Kremlin of profits to fund its war in Ukraine",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union wants to lower a cap on the price of Russian oil to deprive the Kremlin of extra profits to fund its war in Ukraine as part of a new raft of sanctions aimed at forcing Moscow to the negotiating table, senior officials said on Tuesday.",
      "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc is \u201cproposing to lower the oil price cap from $60 to $45, which is lower than the market price, and lowering the oil price cap will hit Russia\u2019s revenues hard.\u201d",
      "Kallas said the EU also wants to impose \u201csanctions on the Nord Stream pipelines to prevent Russia generating any revenue in the future. In this way, it sends a clear signal we are not going back to business as usual.\u201d",
      "All 27 EU member countries must all agree for the sanctions to enter force.",
      "In 2023, Ukraine\u2019s Western allies limited sales of Russian oil to $60 per barrel but the price cap was largely symbolic as most of Moscow\u2019s crude \u2014 its main moneymaker \u2014 cost less than that. Still, the cap was there in case oil prices rose.",
      "Oil income is the linchpin of Russia\u2019s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the armed forces while avoiding worsening inflation for everyday people and a currency collapse.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she assumed that the price cap would be discussed and agreed among the leaders of the Group of Seven major world economic powers when they meet in Canada on June 15-17.",
      "She said the United States and its G7 partners realize \u201cthat the oil price has lowered so much that the effectiveness of the cap is to be questioned, and therefore we all want to lower the oil price from $60 per barrel down to $45 per barrel.\u201d",
      "The Nord Stream gas pipelines were built to carry Russian natural gas to Germany but are not in operation. They were sabotaged in 2022, but the source of the underwater explosions has remained a major international mystery.",
      "The Commission has said that it wants to impose sanctions on the operating consortium to discourage investors from trying to use the pipelines in future.",
      "The blasts happened as Europe attempted to wean itself off Russian energy sources following the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and contributed to tensions that followed the start of the war.",
      "Von der Leyen noted on Tuesday that at the beginning of the war in 2022, \u201cRussia had 12 billion euros ($14 billion) of energy revenues from fossil fuels\" from Europe per month. \"And now we\u2019re down to 1.8 billion (euros).\u201d",
      "The new EU sanctions would also target Russia\u2019s banking sector, with the aim of limiting the Kremlin\u2019s ability to raise funds or carry out financial transactions. A further 22 Russian banks will be hit with measures, von der Leyen said.",
      "An export ban worth some 2.5 billion euros would also be imposed, and the assets frozen of more than 20 Russian and foreign companies alleged to be providing support to the Kremlin\u2019s war machine.",
      "Von der Leyen said the sanctions are aimed at forcing Russia into serious talks about peace with Ukraine. \u201cWe need a real ceasefire, and Russia has to come to the negotiating table with a serious proposal,\u201d she told reporters.",
      "The EU has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Around 2,400 officials and \u201centities\u201d \u2013 often government agencies, banks and organizations \u2013 have been hit.",
      "It\u2019s last raft of sanctions, imposed on May 20, targeted almost 200 ships in Russia\u2019s sanction-busting shadow fleet of tankers, and tightened trade restrictions to stop produce that could be used for military purposes from reaching Russia\u2019s armed forces.",

      "LONDON -- Britain will invest 14.2 billion pounds ($19 billion) to build a new nuclear station that will reduce the U.K.'s reliance on volatile international fossil fuel markets, the government said Tuesday.",
      "Officials said the investment will go into building the new Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, on England's eastern coast, saying it will generate enough low-carbon electricity to power 6 million homes when it becomes operational in the 2030s.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said previous governments had dithered and delayed over nuclear power. No new nuclear plant has been opened in the U.K. since Sizewell B in 1995.",
      "\u201cHaving our own energy in this country that we control, gives us security, gives us independence, so (Russian President Vladimir) Putin can\u2019t put his boot on our throat,\" Starmer said. \u201cAnd it means that we can control the prices in a way that we haven\u2019t been able to in recent years, which has meant very high prices for businesses, for households and for families.\"",
      "The government also announced that Rolls-Royce is the preferred bidder to develop a number of small modular reactors, which it said can power around 3 million homes and help fuel power-hungry industries like AI data centers.",
      "The Treasury said building Sizewell C will create 10,000 jobs. The investment announced Tuesday is in addition to 3.7 billion pounds the U.K. government already committed to the project.",
      "Nuclear power is seen as an increasingly important electricity source as the government seeks to decarbonize Britain\u2019s electricity grid by 2030, replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon power.",
      "The U.K. also wants to reduce its dependence on imported oil and gas, especially in light of soaring energy prices following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "But critics have said nuclear plants are far more expensive and slow to build compared with renewable energy options such as solar and wind power. Environmental groups have also argued Sizewell C will damage local nature reserves that host wildlife like otters and marsh birds.",
      "About 300 people joined a protest against the development at the Suffolk site over the weekend.",
      "\u201cNet zero is supposed to happen by 2030 \u2014 there is no way this is going to be completed by then,\" said Jenny Kirtley, a local resident who chairs the campaign group Together Against Sizewell C.",

That marked a downgrade from the 2.3% U.S. growth it had forecast back for 2025 back in January.",

      "The Chinese economy is forecast to see growth slow from 5% in 2024 to 4.5% this year and 4% next. The world\u2019s second-largest economy has been hobbled by the tariffs that Trump has imposed on its exports, by the collapse of its real estate market and by an aging workforce.",

Trump\u2019s tariffs are expected to hurt European exports. And the unpredictable way he rolls them out \u2014 announcing them, suspending them, coming up with new ones \u2014 has created uncertainty that discourages business investment.",

In Japan, economic growth is expected to accelerate this year \u2013 but only from 0.2% in 2024 to a sluggish 0.7% this year, well short of the 1.2% the World Bank had forecast in January.",

      "Apache Stronghold and the tribe sued the U.S. government in 2021 to protect the place tribal members call Chi\u2019chil Bildagoteel, which is dotted with ancient oak groves and traditional plants the Apaches consider essential to their religion. The U.S. Supreme Court recently rejected an appeal by the Apache group, letting lower court rulings stand.",
      "The project has support in nearby Superior and other traditional mining towns in the area. The company \u2014 a subsidiary of international mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP \u2014 estimates the mine will generate $1 billion a year for Arizona\u2019s economy and create thousands of jobs.",

      "The leaders of a sex-focused women\u2019s wellness company that promoted \u201corgasmic meditation\u201d have been convicted of federal forced labor charges",
      "NEW YORK -- The leaders of a sex-focused women\u2019s wellness company that promoted \u201corgasmic meditation\u201d have been convicted of federal forced labor charges.",
      "A Brooklyn jury on Monday found Nicole Daedone, founder of OneTaste Inc., and Rachel Cherwitz, the California-based company\u2019s former sales director, guilty after deliberating for less than two days following a five-week trial. The two each face up to 20 years in prison when sentenced later.",
      "Prosecutors had argued the two women ran a yearslong scheme that groomed adherents \u2014 many of them victims of sexual trauma \u2014 to do their bidding.",
      "They said Daedone, 57, of New York, and Cherwitz, 44, of California, used economic, sexual and psychological abuse, intimidation and indoctrination to force OneTaste members into sexual acts they found uncomfortable or repulsive, such as having sex with prospective investors or clients.",
      "The two told followers the questionable acts were necessary in order to obtain \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cenlightenment\u201d and demonstrate their commitment to the organization\u2019s principles.",
      "Prosecutors said OneTaste leaders also didn\u2019t pay promised earnings to the members-turned-workers and even forced some of them to take out new credit cards to continue taking the company\u2019s courses.",
      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Nina Gupta, in her closing statement last week, said the defendants \u201cbuilt a business on the backs\u201d of victims who \u201cgave everything\u201d to them, including \u201ctheir money, their time, their bodies, their dignity, and ultimately their sanity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe jury\u2019s verdict has unmasked Daedone and Cherwitz for who they truly are: grifters who preyed on vulnerable victims by making empty promises of sexual empowerment and wellness only to manipulate them into performing labor and services for the defendants\u2019 benefit,\u201d said Joseph Nocella, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.",
      "Daedone\u2019s defense team cast her as a \u201cceiling-shattering feminist entrepreneur\u201d who created a unique business around women\u2019s sexuality and empowerment.",
      "Cherwitz\u2019s lawyer, Celia Cohen, argued that the witnesses who testified weren\u2019t forced to do anything. When they didn\u2019t like the organization anymore or wanted to try other things, she said, they simply left.",
      "\u201cNo matter what you think about OneTaste and what they were doing, they chose it. They knew what it was about,\u201d she said in her closing statement last week. \u201cThe fact they are regretting the actions that they took when they were younger is not evidence of a crime.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for the defendants said their clients maintain their innocence and intend to appeal.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply disappointed in today\u2019s verdict,\" the lawyers said in a statement Monday. \"This case raised numerous novel and complex legal issues that will require review by the Second Circuit.\u201d",
      "Daedone co-founded OneTaste in San Francisco in 2004 as a sort of self-help commune that viewed female orgasms as key to sexual and psychological wellness and interpersonal connection.",
      "A centerpiece was \u201corgasmic meditation,\u201d or \u201cOM,\u201d which was carried out by men manually stimulating women in a group setting.",
      "The company enjoyed glowing media coverage in the 2010s and quickly opened outposts from Los Angeles to London. Portrayed as a cutting-edge enterprise that prioritized women\u2019s sexual pleasure, it generated revenue by providing courses, coaching, OM events, and other sexual practices for a fee.",
      "Daedone sold her stake in the company in 2017 for $12 million \u2014 a year before OneTaste\u2019s marketing and labor practices came under scrutiny.",
      "The company\u2019s current owners, who have rebranded it the Institute of OM Foundation, have said its work has been misconstrued and the charges against its former executives were unjustified.",
      "They maintain sexual consent has always been a cornerstone of the organization. The company didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",

      "Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey, who share the American goals record with 57 each, are among those who have been critical of current regulars not in the struggling roster preparing for the CONCACAF Gold Cup.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about that internally as a group,\" Adams said Wednesday during a Zoom interview with The Associated Press. \"The noise on the outside is the noise on the outside. I think we need to focus on what we need to do as a group and continue to build.\u201d",
      "Star Christian Pulisic is skipping the June camp and Gold Cup to rest after playing about 120 games for club and country over two seasons.",
      "\u201cWhether it was Gold Cup, whether it was Copa (Am\u00e9rica), whether it was Confederations Cup, whether it was the World Cup, I wasn\u2019t going to miss competitions,\u201d Dempsey said last week on the \u201cMen in Blazers\u201d podcast. \u201cFor me, I don\u2019t understand it because that wasn\u2019t my mentality. I always wanted to play in those games.\u201d",

      "Pulisic has not spoken publicly of his decision.",
      "The U.S. has lost four straight games, its longest skid since 2007, following a 4-0 rout Tuesday night by Switzerland.",
      "\u201cThis is part of the process,\u201d Adams said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to win games. You\u2019re going to lose games. It\u2019s about continuing to build that. I think we\u2019re on the right path. We have to continue to build and try the things that we\u2019ve been training. It\u2019ll take a little bit of time, but it will come together.\u201d",
      "Adams didn't dress for the Switzerland friendly but is confident he will be ready for the Gold Cup, where the Americans open Sunday against Trinidad and Tobago.",
      "\u201cA little turf toe-type injury. More of an overuse thing probably than anything \u2014 overload. It was something that I picked up when I came into camp,\u201d Adams said. \u201cProgressing well right now, but just trying to be smart and manage it.\u201d",
      "Adams, who captained the U.S. at the 2022 World Cup, funded a pair of mini-pitches at Pulaski Park in Poughkeepsie, New York, near his home in Wappinger. He spoke on the Zoom about his work with Allstate, the U.S. Soccer Foundation and Black Star Soccer to construct fields about the size of basketball courts at the Fisher Magnet Upper Academy in Detroit and The Bell Avenue School in Yeadon, Pennsylvania.",
      "\u201cBefore the World Cup hopefully we plan to do one more with a city unnamed yet,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I think has real impact, continues to grow the sport, serves underserved communities.\u201d",
      "Now 26, Adams is feeling back to his old self. He had back surgery last July with Dr. Robert Watkins and returned to the field with England's Bournemouth on Oct. 26. Adams played in 28 Premier League matches this season after being limited to three in 2023-24 because of leg injuries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely enjoyable when you\u2019re healthy,\u201d he said. \"The 16-to-18 months that it was just on and off inconsistency is something I never had in my career and never had to battle. And then when it hits you and you go through that, you just learn different ways to navigate things, enjoy life, just not take things for granted, all the little things.\"",
      "Since Mauricio Pochettino took over as U.S. coach last fall, players have had more autonomy to break away from rigid positioning employed by his predecessor, Gregg Berhalter.",
      "\u201cFrom a positional standpoint, obviously we had probably a little bit of a different structure under Gregg,\u201d Adams said. \u201cMaurizio gives the players freedom to find spots they\u2019re comfortable in and see how they can affect the game in different ways. I think our attacking players definitely have freedom to try and find the ball and create things in the right areas of the field. So, yeah, I think he gives everyone freedom, but there\u2019s still structure to the way that we want to play.\u201d",
      "Adams will be with the U.S. team in Austin, Texas, next Wednesday, and following intently when the Premier League releases its 2025-26 schedule at 3 a.m. CDT. He feels improved because of his time with Leeds in 2022-23 and Bournemouth the past two seasons.",
      "\u201cAfter you play in the Premier League, every game feels slow,'\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what game I play in now the game feels slow. You look at your schedule when the season comes out and you have to play in a row Arsenal, Tottenham, Man City, Liverpool, Manchester United, all these big games back to back to back you just learn how to make decisions quicker and if you don\u2019t, you get punished.\"",

      "The United States gave up four goals in the first half and looked unprepared for next year\u2019s home World Cup, getting routed by Switzerland 4-0 in a friendly",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The United States gave up four goals in the first half and looked unprepared for next year's World Cup, getting routed by Switzerland 4-0 in a friendly on Tuesday night as the Americans lost their fourth straight game for the first time since 2007.",
      "Dan Ndoye scored in the 13th minute, Michel Aebischer in the 23rd, Breel Embolo in the 33rd and Johan Manzambi in the 36th. The Americans failed to put a shot on target and have lost four consecutive home games for the third time and first since 1988.",
      "Switzerland won its third straight match and extended the U.S. winless streak against European opponents to eight games since 2021. Fans at Geodis Park booed loudly as the U.S. gave up four goals by the 40th minute for the first time since Nov. 9, 1980, at Mexico and the first time ever at home, according to Opta.",
      "The match was played one year and one day before the 2026 World Cup co-hosted by the U.S. starts. Going into their CONCACAF Gold Cup opener against Trinidad and Tobago on Sunday, the Americans are 5-5 under Mauricio Pochettino, who took over after first-round elimination last year\u2019s Copa America led the U.S. Soccer Federation to fire coach Gregg Berhalter.",
      "Ndoye burst behind Nate Harriel to run onto a through pass for the first goal; Manzambi dribbled past Max Arfsten along the endline to leave Aebischer with a tap-in for the second; goalkeeper Matt Turner spilled Ricardo Rodriguez's shot to leave Embolo an open net for the third; and a mix-up when Quinn Sullivan passed to Sebastian Berhalter as the former coach's son slipped created a giveaway that led to Manzambi's first international goal.",
      "The U.S. had not lost four straight games since a five-game skid in 2007. The Americans were missing Christian Pulisic (wanted time off); Yunus Musah (personal reason not disclosed); Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Gio Reyna (headed to the Club World Cup); Antonee Robinson, Tyler Adams and Folarin Balogun (injured); and Sergi\u00f1o Dest (regaining fitness).",
      "Turner played his first game for club or country since March 23. Berhalter started in his debut, and Brenden and Paxten Aaronson became the fourth set of brothers to start for the U.S., and the first since George and Louis Nanchoff in 1979.",
      "Pochettino made nine changes from Saturday's 2-1 loss to Turkey, keeping only Arfsten and midfielder Johnny Cardoso. The U.S. made five changes to start the second half and Damion Downs made his debut in the 75th minute.",

      "Yankees manager Aaron Boone? He made sure to find the best possible vantage point to see it land.",
      "That ended up being 469 feet away from the plate, right on top of the Royals Hall of Fame in left field. It was the third-longest homer in the majors this season, and the two-run shot propelled New York to a 10-2 win over Kansas City on Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cI made sure to jump up and get a good spot where I could really watch it,\u201d Boone said afterward, flashing a smile. \u201cI mean, I was under control. Poised. I was in a good spot to really watch it. That was evaporated.\u201d",
      "The home run off the Royals' Noah Cameron had an exit velocity of 117.9 mph, tying it for the third-hardest hit home run in the majors this season.

The only other players in the modern era to accomplish that feat also were Yankees: Babe Ruth in 1923, \u201824 and \u201927, and Lou Gehrig in 1936.",
      "As for the homers, Judge has hit 24 of them this season. Half of those have given New York the lead in a game.",
      "\u201cI mean, he just keeps impressing. Being able to watch him every day is a treat,\u201d said Max Fried, who allowed two runs on six hits over seven innings Tuesday night. \u201cThen when you see him day in and day out and get to know him, it's not surprising at all.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf he keeps ascending from here, I won't be surprised,\u201d Boone said. \"The most amazing part of it is I feel like he's just playing well. I don't feel like he's been on fire at any point. That's what is amazing about it. He's out there playing well. Getting his hits, doing his thing. But in a lot of ways, I'm honestly waiting for him to catch fire. That's when it gets really scary.",

      "A salvage company plans to lift the luxury yacht Bayesian in late June from the Sicilian seabed where it sank last summer, killing seven people",
      "MILAN -- A salvage company expects to lift the wreck of the luxury Bayesian yacht in late June from the seafloor off Sicily where it sank last summer, killing seven people, according to a recovery plan agreed with Italian maritime and investigating authorities, the TMC salvage company said Wednesday.",
      "Salvage teams in the past week have recovered 17 pieces of suspected Bayesian debris from the sea floor identified using a remote-controlled submersible. They have been transferred to shore in Termini Imerese as part of the investigation.",
      "The British-flagged superyacht sank in August, killing U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter and five others.",
      "Several days before the 56-meter (183-foot) long 473-ton yacht is lifted to the surface, crews will use precision tools to remove the 72-meter mast. After that, the Bayesian will be set upright and then gradually lifted to the surface with eight main steel lifting strops that will be installed under the hull. The whole process is expected to take several days.",
      "Marine salvage experts began the operation in early May to recover the superyacht, which is on the seafloor at a depth of about 49 meters (160 feet.) The operation was temporarily halted after a diver\u2019s death a few days later, and the new recovery plan was approved on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe salvage teams will now hopefully be able to make more systematic progress in preparations for the ultimate safe recovery of Bayesian, whilst ensuring the safety of those working on this very complex lifting and recovery operation,\u2019\u2019 said Marcus Cave, a TMC Marine director.",
      "British investigators in an interim report issued last month said that the yacht was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and couldn\u2019t recover. The report stated that the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.) at the time of the sinking at 4:06 a.m. on Aug. 19 and \u201cviolently\u201d knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",
      "Italian authorities are conducting a full criminal investigation.",
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the Bayesian sank. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch\u2019s acquittal in a fraud case in the U.S. in June. Fifteen people survived the accident.",

      "Satellite photos show emperor penguins in one region of Antarctica declined 22% in the past 15 years",
      "WASHINGTON -- The population of emperor penguins in one part of Antarctica appears to be declining faster than previously thought, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery released Tuesday.",
      "The estimated population of 16 penguin colonies \u2014 visible in satellite photos taken between 2009 and 2024 \u2013 had declined 22% during that period mainly because of climate change that's shrinking the amount of available sea ice. It's unclear whether this drop is seen across the continent, scientists said.",
      "\u201cSea ice is very important for the penguins because they breed on sea ice and forage on sea ice,\u201d said Peter Fretwell with British Antarctic Survey, who helped analyze the data.",
      "Scientists previously estimated that the total emperor penguin population declined about 10% across all of Antarctica over the past decade and a half. The latest survey included a region covering the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and Bellingshausen Sea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely alarming that the numbers are so much worse than predicted,\u201d said Daniel Zitterbart, a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "There are uncertainties in the latest estimate. The analysis relies on a calculation of how densely the penguins are clustered in each area where they're detected in a single satellite photo taken each year.",
      "The colonies studied represent about 30% of the total emperor penguin population, which lives only in Antarctica. The loss of stable sea ice may be affecting the penguins in ways beyond shrinking their breeding grounds.",
      "\u201cMore predators like leopard seals and orcas may be able to come in closer to the colonies if sea ice breaks up earlier in the year,\u201d said Fretwell.",
      "Warming ocean temperatures and changing rainfall patterns may also impact the survival of penguin chicks, he added.",

      "The red fox is such a fixture of life in London that it has its own ambulance service",
      "PADDOCK WOOD, England -- The injured fox is cornered in a cage, teeth bared and snarling at the woman trying to help it.",
      "Nicki Townsend is unfazed. Wearing only rubber gloves and an outfit suitable for a yoga class, she approaches with soothing words. \u201cAll right, baby,\" she coos as she deftly drapes a towel over his head, grabs him by the scruff of his neck, scoops up his wounded legs and moves him to a clean cage.",
      "It\u2019s not the way her day typically begins, but there\u2019s nothing routine about rescuing foxes.",
      "\u201cYou can never predict what you\u2019re going to arrive at,\u201d Townsend said.",
      "While not as visible as phone boxes or double-decker buses, the red fox is a fixture in London, a city not known for its wildlife. But living on the streets, alleys and back gardens of a dense urban environment can be rough and when foxes need help, they have their own ambulance service \u2014 and Townsend may be on her way.",
      "The foxes didn't invade London so much as adapt and expand their range inward as the city spread to their habitat in the 1930s and suburbs grew.",
      "But people and the bushy-tailed member of the canine family have not always lived in harmony, and the species has admirers and adversaries.",
      "For everyone enchanted seeing a fox trotting nonchalantly down their street at dusk or basking in a sunny backyard, there are plenty who see them as pests. They poop where they like, tear into garbage and the vixens in heat let out terrifying shrieks in the dead of winter when attracting a mate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like Marmite with foxes,\u201d Townsend said, referring to the food spread that is an acquired and divisive taste. \u201cYou either love them or hate them.\u201d",
      "The divide between the two camps led Trevor Williams to found what became The Fox Project nearly 35 years ago.",
      "Once a bass player in the rock group Audience that opened for Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, Williams had been active in the campaign to stop fox hunting when he redirected his protection efforts to the city, where foxes were once routinely killed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the myths that have occurred over the years, there\u2019s still a lot of suspicion about what foxes might be,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re going to bite the baby, they\u2019re going to eat the cat, they\u2019re going to run away with your husband.\u201d",
      "The project has since grown from providing information on deterring foxes to rescuing 1,400 a year, including 400 cubs, though only about half survive to be released.",
      "There are estimated to be 15,000 foxes in London. The project covers a swath of south London and its leafy suburbs while other organizations not devoted solely to foxes handle other parts of the city.",
      "While the omnivores survive on small animals, bugs and berries in the wild, they favor easily scavenged leftovers in the city and handouts that make them more dependent on humans.",
      "Their main urban menaces are cars, getting snagged in soccer nets or getting stuck in tight spaces. In their effort to get free, they often get nasty abrasions that can become infected. Many also suffer from mange, a parasitic infestation that leads to all kinds of problems.",
      "Townsend pilots her VW Caddy on city streets, highways and narrow lanes that roll through lush hills, responding to calls about injured or ill foxes or cubs that have lost their mothers.",
      "She's seen a bit of everything since her first humbling call 2 1/2 years ago when the supposedly injured fox bolted.",
      "\u201cIn my inexperience, I chased after him, which is comical because you\u2019re never going to outrun a fox,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember he ran very fast and I looked silly running after him.\u201d",
      "Despite many challenging situations \u2014 she once managed to rescue a fox that lost its footing atop a fence and ended upside down at eye level with its paw lodged between boards \u2014 she's only been bitten once.",
      "Her van carries the distinctly musky scent of foxes. The odor becomes unpleasant when an anxious passenger in a litter of cubs relieves itself enroute to being delivered to a foster care pen where they will stay until being released in the wild.",
      "\u201cFeel free to open the window,\u201d said Townsend, who is accustomed to the stench. \u201cThis is a stinky job.\"",
      "On a recent day, she was dispatched to meet a heartbroken couple who found a cub with a puncture wound collapsed on their back lawn.",
      "\u201cWe thought he was asleep at first, so we went to go and have a close look because we love them,\" Charlotte English said. \u201cThen he just didn\u2019t move, so we knew something was wrong.\u201d",
      "That cub had to be put to sleep, as did the adult Townsend transferred at the start of her shift.",
      "Cubs that recover are socialized in packs of five until they mature and are then released in a rural location while the adults are freed in the neighborhoods where they were found.",
      "Given a second chance, it's not clear how well the foxes fare, because they are rarely tracked. A 2016 study in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science found that rehabilitated foxes were more likely to behave as if they had been displaced when returned to their original territory. They were tracked wandering farther away, potentially exposing them to more traffic and greater stress.",
      "\u201cIt is a gap in the knowledge and there\u2019s an assumption that when you release them, they thrive and I think that that assumption needs to be challenged more,\u201d said Bryony Tolhurst, a University of Brighton honorary research fellow and lead author of the study.",
      "For Townsend, fox deaths are offset by the joy of seeing little ones venture into the unknown or an adult darting into a neighborhood it instantly recognizes.",
      "\u201cSometimes they look back and people like to romanticize that they\u2019re saying \u2018thank you,'\" she said. \"They\u2019re just making sure we\u2019re not chasing after them.\u201d",

      "Financial aid fraud is exploding, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence",
      "It was an unusual question coming from a police officer. Heather Brady was napping at home in San Francisco on a Sunday afternoon when the officer knocked on her door to ask: Had she applied to Arizona Western College?",
      "She had not, and as the officer suspected, somebody else had applied to Arizona community colleges in her name to scam the government into paying out financial aid money.",
      "When she checked her student loan servicer account, Brady saw the scammers hadn't stopped there. A loan for over $9,000 had been paid out in her name \u2014 but to another person \u2014 for coursework at a California college.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine how many people this is happening to that have no idea,\u201d Brady said.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence and the popularity of online classes have led to an explosion of financial aid fraud. Fake college enrollments have been surging as crime rings deploy \u201cghost students\u201d \u2014 chatbots that join online classrooms and stay just long enough to collect a financial aid check.",
      "In some cases, professors discover almost no one in their class is real. Students get locked out of the classes they need to graduate as bots push courses over their enrollment limits. And victims of identity theft who discover loans fraudulently taken out in their names must go through months of calling colleges, the Federal Student Aid office and loan servicers to try to get the debt erased.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Education Department introduced a temporary rule requiring students to show colleges a government-issued ID to prove their identity. It will apply only to first-time applicants for federal student aid for the summer term, affecting some 125,000 borrowers. The agency said it is developing more advanced screening for the fall.",
      "\u201cThe rate of fraud through stolen identities has reached a level that imperils the federal student aid program,\u201d the department said in its guidance to colleges.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of fraud reports obtained through a public records request shows California colleges in 2024 reported 1.2 million fraudulent applications, which resulted in 223,000 suspected fake enrollments. Other states are affected by the same problem, but with 116 community colleges, California is a particularly large target.",
      "Criminals stole at least $11.1 million in federal, state and local financial aid from California community colleges last year that could not be recovered, according to the reports.",
      "Colleges typically receive a portion of the loans intended for tuition, with the balance going directly to students for other expenses. Community colleges are targeted in part because their lower tuition means larger percentages of grants and loans go to borrowers.",
      "Scammers frequently use AI chatbots to carry out the fraud, targeting courses that are online and allow students to watch lectures and complete coursework on their own time.",
      "In January, Wayne Chaw started getting emails about a class he never signed up for at De Anza Community College, where he had taken coding classes a decade earlier. Identity thieves had obtained his Social Security number and collected $1,395 in financial aid in his name.",
      "The energy management class required students to submit a homework assignment to prove they were real. But someone wrote submissions impersonating Chaw, likely using a chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis person is typing as me, saying my first and last name. ... It\u2019s very freaky when I saw that,\u201d said Chaw.",
      "The fraud involved a grant, not loans, so Chaw himself did not lose money. He called the Social Security Administration to report the identity theft, but after five hours on hold, he never got through to a person.",
      "As the Trump administration moves to dismantle the Education Department, federal cuts may make it harder to catch criminals and help victims of identity theft. In March, the Trump administration fired more than 300 people from the Federal Student Aid office, and the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, has lost more than 20% of its staff through attrition and retirements since October.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just nervous that I\u2019m going to be stuck with this,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThe agency is going to be so broken down and disintegrated that I won\u2019t be able to do anything, and I\u2019m just going to be stuck with those $9,000\u201d in loans.",
      "Criminal cases around the country offer a glimpse of the schemes' pervasiveness.",
      "In the past year, investigators indicted a man accused of leading a Texas fraud ring that used stolen identities to pursue $1.5 million in student aid. Another person in Texas pleaded guilty to using the names of prison inmates to apply for over $650,000 in student aid at colleges across the South and Southwest. And a person in New York recently pleaded guilty to a $450,000 student aid scam that lasted a decade.",
      "Brittnee Nelson of Shreveport, Louisiana, was bringing her daughter to day care two years ago when she received a notification that her credit score had dropped 27 points.",
      "Loans had been taken out in her name for colleges in California and Louisiana, she discovered. She canceled one before it was paid out, but it was too late to stop a loan of over $5,000 for Delgado Community College in New Orleans.",
      "Nelson runs her own housecleaning business and didn\u2019t go to college. She already was signed up for identity theft protection and carefully monitored her credit. Still, her debt almost went into collections before the loan was put in forbearance. She recently got the loans taken off her record after two years of effort.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if someone came into your house and robbed you,\u201d she said.",
      "The federal government's efforts to verify borrowers' identity could help, she said.",
      "\u201cIf they can make these hurdles a little bit harder and have these verifications more provable, I think that\u2019s really, really, really going to protect people in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Delgado spokesperson Barbara Waiters said responsibility for approving loans ultimately lies with federal agencies.",
      "\u201cThis is an unfortunate and serious matter, but it is not the direct or indirect result of Delgado\u2019s internal processes,\u201d Waiters said.",
      "In San Francisco, the loans taken out in Brady's name are in a grace period, but still on the books. That has not been her only challenge. A few months ago, she was laid off from her job and decided to sign up for a class at City College San Francisco to help her career. But all the classes were full.",
      "After a few weeks, Brady finally was able to sign up for a class. The professor apologized for the delay in spots opening up: The college has been struggling with fraudulent applications.",

The lawsuit comes as a biotechnology company seeks the court's approval to buy the struggling firm.",

      "Geoff Kendrick, the bank\u2019s head of digital assets research, said in the report that restrictions on investors buying bitcoin directly help explain the popularity of bitcoin treasury companies, as their stocks can serve as bitcoin proxies. But as crypto becomes more mainstream, the case for investing in bitcoin treasury companies becomes weaker, Kendrick said.",
      "He added that bitcoin\u2019s volatility could force some newer bitcoin treasury companies to sell their holdings to satisfy their debts if it falls under the purchase price.",

The 7.9-inch portable display (up from 6.2 inches) boosts the resolution to 1020p (from 720p), and while the LCD screen isn't quite as sharp as an OLED screen might have been, it's much cleaner than the original recipe Switch. It looks even better when connected to an HDTV since it now supports 4K and HDR.",
      "Nintendo has always stood apart from the technological arms race that fans of Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox obsess over, insisting that first-rate games don\u2019t necessarily depend on high-powered computer chips. But you could feel the strain in 2023\u2019s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, with its at-times blurry graphics and sluggish framerate. The Switch 2, with a faster framerate of 120 fps, corrects much of the fuzziness.",
      "That's not to say it comes close to matching the high-definition performance of the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox X/S. If you're expecting the jaw-dropping graphics of, say, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows ... well, no.",
      "There is good news for those of us who have gotten weary of the old Switch's dinky 32 gigabytes of internal storage. The Switch 2 multiplies that by eight, for 256 GB. Of course, flashier games take up more space, so if you want more room you'll have to invest in a microSD Express card \u2014 which is a bit pricier than the standard memory card used in most portable devices.",
      "The Switch 2's Joy-Con controllers have undergone some tinkering. As before, you can attach them to the sides of the screen if you're playing on the go. If you're at home, you can attach them to a doohickey that feels more like a traditional joystick. Either way, they're now more firmly connected with magnets, which provide a satisfying snap.",
      "Both the left and right Joy-Cons now include an optical mouse, which you can use by placing the controller on its edge and rolling it around on a table. (Nintendo says you can also use it on your pants, but I prefer using a clipboard on my lap.) It remains to be seen how many Switch 2 games will call for a mouse, but 2K's port of Sid Meier's Civilization VII seems like a good candidate.",
      "And then there's a new button labeled \u201cC\u201d on the right-hand Joy-Con. That calls up GameChat, which lets you start up a conversation with other players \u2014 provided you've all taken the time to register yourselves as friends. (Eventually, you'll also need to subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online service, but that requirement doesn't kick in until March 31, 2026.) The microphone is built into the Switch 2, though if you want to upgrade to video chat, you'll need to buy a separate Nintendo camera.",
      "Finally, there\u2019s GameShare, which lets you play selected titles with other Switch users even if they don\u2019t own the software.",
      "Nintendo has been emphasizing the new social features in its marketing, though it feels like it's catching up to the competition. The kids I know who play Fortnite or Minecraft on competing consoles seem to have figured out long ago how to chat with their pals. Welcome to the 2010s?",
      "As with any console launch, the driving question is: Does it have the games?",
      "There are just a couple of Switch 2 exclusives out now: Mario Kart World and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a $10 demo package that really should have been free. There are some new-to-Nintendo ports of excellent titles like Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077. You can get upgrades of classics like the last two Legend of Zelda adventures. And the Switch 2 is fully backward-compatible, so you can play everything that came out for the Switch as well as a substantial library of older titles.",
      "There\u2019s no other machine that will let you play future installments of beloved franchises like Zelda, Super Mario Bros., Super Smash Bros. and Animal Crossing. None of those have been announced yet, but some marquee names \u2014 Donkey Kong and Kirby \u2014 will star in Switch 2 exclusives later this year.",
      "There\u2019s plenty of competition out there, though, and not just in the TV-connected console market Switch shares with the PlayStation and the Xbox. Nintendo no longer has the portable market to itself, thanks to Valve\u2019s SteamDeck. Some models of that device cost less than the Switch 2, and it already has a huge library of PC games. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced over the weekend that it's teaming up with Asus on the ROG Xbox Ally, a handheld that will be out before Christmas.",
      "Honestly, we\u2019ll probably have a better idea of the Switch\u2019s quality a few years down the line, after developers get a handle on what the new hardware can do. If you\u2019re dying to get back behind the wheel with Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach right now, though, you know what you need to do.",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "A previous version of this story was corrected to say that the Switch 2 social options can be used without a subscription until March 31, 2026.",

      "Amazon says it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant that has drawn federal scrutiny over its arrangement to essentially plug right into the power plant",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Amazon said Monday that it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant that has drawn federal scrutiny over an arrangement to essentially plug right into the power plant.",
      "Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at Amazon\u2019s cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, told The Associated Press that the company will build another data center complex just north of Philadelphia.",
      "One data center is being built next to northeastern Pennsylvania's Susquehanna nuclear power plant. The other will be in Fairless Hills at a logistics campus, the Keystone Trade Center, on what was once a U.S. Steel mill.",
      "In a statement, Gov. Josh Shapiro called it the largest capital investment in Pennsylvania's history.",
      "The announcements add to the billions of dollars in Big Tech's data center cash already flowing into the state.",
      "Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it ramps up its investment in infrastructure to compete with other tech giants to meet growing demand for artificial intelligence products.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "The majority owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, Talen Energy, announced last year that it had sold its data center to Amazon for $650 million in a deal to eventually provide 960 megawatts. That's 40% of the output of one of the nation's largest nuclear power plants, or enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "However, the arrangement between Talen and Amazon \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 has been held up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the first such case to come before the agency.",
      "It has raised questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it\u2019s fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid.",
      "For Big Tech, plugging energy-hungry data centers directly into a power plant can take years off their development timelines and is a much faster route to procuring power than having to connect to the congested electricity grid.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural grounds, will decide the matter, leaving in limbo regulatory treatment of the deal and others that likely would follow.",
      "Already in Pennsylvania, Microsoft announced a deal with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to restart the reactor under a 20-year agreement to supply its data centers in four states with energy.",
      "Meanwhile, the owners of what was once Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest coal-fired power plant say they will turn it into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus.",

      "LONDON -- Getty Images is facing off against artificial intelligence company Stability AI in a London courtroom for the first major copyright trial of the generative AI industry.",
      "Opening arguments before a judge at the British High Court are scheduled for Monday. The trial could last for three weeks.",
      "Stability, based in London, owns a widely used AI image-making tool that sparked enthusiasm for the instant creation of AI artwork and photorealistic images upon its release in August 2022. OpenAI introduced its surprise hit chatbot ChatGPT three months later.",
      "Seattle-based Getty has argued that the development of the AI image maker, called Stable Diffusion, involved \u201cbrazen infringement\u201d of Getty\u2019s photography collection \u201con a staggering scale.\"",
      "Tech companies have long argued that \u201cfair use\u201d or \u201cfair dealing\u201d legal doctrines in the United States and United Kingdom allow them to train their AI systems on large troves of writings or images. Getty was among the first to challenge those practices when it filed copyright infringement lawsuits in the United States and the United Kingdom in early 2023.",
      "\u201cWhat Stability did was inappropriate,\u201d Getty CEO Craig Peters told The Associated Press in 2023. He said creators of intellectual property should be asked for permission before their works are fed into AI systems rather than having to participate in an \u201copt-out regime.\"",
      "Stability has argued that the case doesn't belong in the United Kingdom because the training of the AI model technically happened elsewhere, on computers run by U.S. tech giant Amazon.",
      "Similar cases in the U.S. have not yet gone to trial.",
      "Stable Diffusion\u2019s roots trace to Germany, where computer scientists at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich worked with the New York-based tech company Runway to develop the original algorithms. The university researchers credited Stability AI for providing the servers that trained the models, which require large amounts of computing power.",

      "After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during a developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in it...",
      "CUPERTINO, Calif. -- After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during an annual developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in its technology.",
      "The presummer rite, which attracted thousands of developers from nearly 60 countries to Apple's Silicon Valley headquarters, subdued compared with the feverish anticipation that surrounded the event in the last two years.",
      "Apple highlighted plans for more AI tools designed to simplify people's lives and make its products even more intuitive. It also provided an early glimpse at the biggest redesign of its iPhone software in a decade. In doing so, Apple executives refrained from issuing bold promises of breakthroughs that punctuated recent conferences, prompting CFRA analyst Angelo Zino to deride the event as a \u201cdud\u201d in a research note.",
      "In 2023, Apple unveiled a mixed-reality headset that has been little more than a niche product, and last year WWDC trumpeted its first major foray into the AI craze with an array of new features highlighted by the promise of a smarter and more versatile version of its virtual assistant, Siri \u2014 a goal that has yet to be realized.",
      "\u201cThis work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar,\u201d Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s top software executive, said Monday at the outset of the conference. The company didn't provide a precise timetable for when Siri's AI upgrade will be finished but indicated it won't happen until next year at the earliest.",
      "\"The silence surrounding Siri was deafening,\" said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said. \u201cNo amount of text corrections or cute emojis can fill the yawning void of an intuitive, interactive AI experience that we know Siri will be capable of when ready. We just don\u2019t know when that will happen. The end of the Siri runway is coming up fast, and Apple needs to lift off.\u201d",
      "The showcase unfolded amid nagging questions about whether Apple has lost some of the mystique and innovative drive that has made it a tech trendsetter during its nearly 50-year history.",
      "Instead of making a big splash as it did with the Vision Pro headset and its AI suite, Apple took a mostly low-key approach that emphasized its effort to spruce up the look of its software with a new design called \u201cLiquid Glass\" while also unveiling a new hub for its video games and new features like a \u201cWorkout Buddy\u201d to help manage physical fitness.",
      "Apple executives promised to make its software more compatible with the increasingly sophisticated computer chips that have been powering its products while also making it easier to toggle between the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.",
      "\u201cOur product experience has become even more seamless and enjoyable,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told the crowd as the 90-minute showcase wrapped up.",
      "IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said Apple seemed to be largely using Monday's conference to demonstrate the company still has a blueprint for success in AI, even if it's going to take longer to realize the vision that was presented a year ago.",
      "\u201cThis year\u2019s event was not about disruptive innovation, but rather careful calibration, platform refinement and developer enablement \u2014positioning itself for future moves rather than unveiling game-changing technologies,\u201d Jeronimo said.",
      "Besides redesigning its software. Apple will switch to a method that automakers have used to telegraph their latest car models by linking them to the year after they first arrive at dealerships. That means the next version of the iPhone operating system due out this autumn will be known as iOS 26 instead of iOS 19 \u2014 as it would be under the previous naming approach that has been used since the device's 2007 debut.",
      "The iOS 26 upgrade is expected to be released in September around the same time Apple traditionally rolls out the next iPhone models.",
      "Apple opened the proceedings with a short video clip featuring Federighi speeding around a track in a Formula 1 race car. Although it was meant to promote the June 27 release of the Apple film, \u201cF1\u201d starring Brad Pitt, the segment could also be viewed as an unintentional analogy to the company's attempt to catch up to the rest of the pack in AI technology.",
      "While some of the new AI tricks compatible with the latest iPhones began rolling out late last year as part of free software updates, the delays in a souped-up Siri became so glaring that the chastened company stopped promoting it in its marketing campaigns earlier this year.",
      "While Apple has been struggling to make AI that meets its standards, the gap separating it from other tech powerhouses is widening. Google keeps packing more AI into its Pixel smartphone lineup while introducing more of the technology into its search engine to dramatically change the way it works. Samsung, Apple's biggest smartphone rival, is also leaning heavily into AI. Meanwhile, ChatGPT recently struck a deal that will bring former Apple design guru Jony Ive into the fold to work on a new device expected to compete against the iPhone.",
      "Besides grappling with innovation challenges, Apple also faces regulatory threats that could siphon away billions of dollars in revenue that help finance its research and development. A federal judge is currently weighing whether proposed countermeasures to Google's illegal monopoly in search should include a ban on long-running deals worth $20 billion annually to Apple while another federal judge recently banned the company from collecting commissions on in-app transactions processed outside its once-exclusive payment system.",
      "On top of all that, Apple has been caught in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's trade war with China, a key manufacturing hub for the Cupertino, California, company. Cook successfully persuaded Trump to exempt the iPhone from tariffs during the president's first administration, but he has had less success during Trump's second term, which seems more determined to prod Apple to make its products in the U.S.",
      "The multidimensional gauntlet facing Apple is spooking investors, causing the company's stock price to plunge by 20% so far this year \u2014 a decline that has erased about $750 billion in shareholder wealth. After beginning the year as the most valuable company in the world, Apple now ranks third behind longtime rival Microsoft, another AI leader, and AI chipmaker Nvidia.",
      "Apple's shares closed down by more than 1% on Monday \u2014 an early indication the company's latest announcements didn't inspire investors.",

      "The crashes, which began late last year and carried into 2025, were the tipoff to a sophisticated cyberattack that may have allowed hackers to infiltrate a phone without a single click from the user.",
      "The attackers left no clues about their identities, but investigators at the cybersecurity firm iVerify noticed that the victims all had something in common: They worked in fields of interest to China's government and had been targeted by Chinese hackers in the past.",
      "Foreign hackers have increasingly identified smartphones, other mobile devices and the apps they use as a weak link in U.S. cyberdefenses. Groups linked to China's military and intelligence service have targeted the smartphones of prominent Americans and burrowed deep into telecommunication networks, according to national security and tech experts.",
      "It shows how vulnerable mobile devices and apps are and the risk that security failures could expose sensitive information or leave American interests open to cyberattack, those experts say.",
      "\u201cThe world is in a mobile security crisis right now,\u201d said Rocky Cole, a former cybersecurity expert at the National Security Agency and Google and now chief operations officer at iVerify. \u201cNo one is watching the phones.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey were able to listen in on phone calls in real time and able to read text messages,\u201d said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. He is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and the senior Democrat on the Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, created to study the geopolitical threat from China.",
      "Chinese hackers also sought access to phones used by Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance during the 2024 campaign.",
      "The Chinese government has denied allegations of cyberespionage, and accused the U.S. of mounting its own cyberoperations. It says America cites national security as an excuse to issue sanctions against Chinese organizations and keep Chinese technology companies from the global market.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. has long been using all kinds of despicable methods to steal other countries\u2019 secrets,\u201d Lin Jian, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, said at a recent press conference in response to questions about a CIA push to recruit Chinese informants.",
      "U.S. intelligence officials have said China poses a significant, persistent threat to U.S. economic and political interests, and it has harnessed the tools of digital conflict: online propaganda and disinformation, artificial intelligence and cyber surveillance and espionage designed to deliver a significant advantage in any military conflict.",
      "Mobile networks are a top concern. The U.S. and many of its closest allies have banned Chinese telecom companies from their networks. Other countries, including Germany, are phasing out Chinese involvement because of security concerns. But Chinese tech firms remain a big part of the systems in many nations, giving state-controlled companies a global footprint they could exploit for cyberattacks, experts say.",
      "Chinese telecom firms still maintain some routing and cloud storage systems in the U.S. \u2014 a growing concern to lawmakers.",
      "\u201cThe American people deserve to know if Beijing is quietly using state-owned firms to infiltrate our critical infrastructure,\u201d U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich. and chairman of the China committee, which in April issued subpoenas to Chinese telecom companies seeking information about their U.S. operations.",
      "Mobile devices can buy stocks, launch drones and run power plants. Their proliferation has often outpaced their security.",
      "The phones of top government officials are especially valuable, containing sensitive government information, passwords and an insider's glimpse into policy discussions and decision-making.",
      "The White House said last week that someone impersonating Susie Wiles, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, reached out to governors, senators and business leaders with texts and phone calls.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the person obtained Wiles\u2019 connections, but they apparently gained access to the contacts in her personal cellphone, The Wall Street Journal reported. The messages and calls were not coming from Wiles\u2019 number, the newspaper reported.",
      "While most smartphones and tablets come with robust security, apps and connected devices often lack these protections or the regular software updates needed to stay ahead of new threats. That makes every fitness tracker, baby monitor or smart appliance another potential foothold for hackers looking to penetrate networks, retrieve information or infect systems with malware.",
      "Federal officials launched a program this year creating a \u201ccyber trust mark\u201d for connected devices that meet federal security standards. But consumers and officials shouldn\u2019t lower their guard, said Snehal Antani, former chief technology officer for the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Special Operations Command.",

      "But some shoppers, consumer advocates and lawmakers remain skeptical about the tiny electronic screens, which let stores change prices instantly from a central computer instead of having workers swap out paper labels by hand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s corporations vs. the humans, and that chasm between us goes further and further,\u201d said Dan Gallant, who works in sports media in Edmonton, Canada. Gallant's local Loblaws supermarket recently switched to digital labels.",
      "Social media is filled with warnings that grocers will use the technology to charge more for ice cream if it\u2019s hot outside, hike the price of umbrellas if it\u2019s raining or to gather information about customers.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania fired off a letter to Kroger last fall demanding to know whether it would use its electronic labels as part of a dynamic pricing strategy.",
      "Lawmakers in Rhode Island and Maine have introduced bills to limit the use of digital labels. In Arizona, Democratic state Rep. Cesar Aguilar recently introduced a bill that would ban them altogether.",
      "The bill hasn\u2019t gotten a hearing, but Aguilar said he\u2019s determined to start a conversation about digital labels and how stores could abuse them.",
      "\u201cGrocery stores study when people go shopping the most. And so you might be able to see a price go down one day and then go up another day,\u201d Aguilar told The Associated Press.",
      "Researchers say those fears are misplaced. A study published in late May found \u201cvirtually no surge pricing\u201d before or after electronic shelf labels were adopted. The study was authored by Ioannis Stamatopoulos of the University of Texas, Austin, Robert Evan Sanders of the University of California, San Diego and Robert Bray of Northwestern University",
      "The researchers looked at prices between 2019 and 2024 at an unnamed grocery chain than began using digital labels in October 2022. They found that temporary price increases affected 0.005% of products on any given day before electronic shelf labels were introduced, a share that increased by only 0.0006 percentage points after digital labels were installed.",
      "The study also determined that discounts were slightly more common after digital labels were introduced.",
      "Economists have long wondered why grocery prices don\u2019t change more often, according to Stamatopoulos. If bananas are about to expire, for example, it makes sense to lower the price on them. He said the cost of having workers change prices by hand could be one issue.",
      "But there\u2019s another reason: Shoppers watch grocery prices closely, and stores don\u2019t want to risk angering them.",
      "\u201cSelling groceries is not selling a couch. It\u2019s not a one-time transaction and you will never see them again,\u201d Stamatopoulos said. \u201cYou want them coming to the store every week.\u201d",
      "Electronic price labels aren\u2019t new. They\u2019ve been in use for more than a decade at groceries in Europe and some U.S. retailers, like Kohl's.",
      "But they\u2019ve been slow to migrate to U.S. grocery stores. Only around 5% to 10% of U.S. supermarkets now have electronic labels, compared to 80% in Europe, said Amanda Oren, vice president of industry strategy for North American grocery at Relex Solutions, a technology company that helps retailers forecast demand.",
      "Oren said cost is one issue that has slowed the U.S. rollout. The tiny screens cost between $5 and $20, Oren said, but every product a store sells needs one, and the average supermarket has 100,000 or more individual products.",
      "Still, the U.S. industry is charging ahead. Walmart, the nation's largest grocer and retailer, hopes to have digital price labels at 2,300 U.S. stores by 2026. Kroger is expanding the use of digital labels this year after testing them at 20 stores. Whole Foods is testing the labels in nearly 50 stores.",
      "Companies say electronic price labels have tremendous advantages. Walmart says it used to take employees two days to change paper price labels on the 120,000 items it has in a typical store. With digital tags, it takes a few minutes.",
      "The labels can also be useful. Some have codes shoppers can scan to see recipes or nutrition information. Instacart has a system in thousands of U.S. stores, including Aldi and Schnucks, that flashes a light on the digital tag when Instacart shoppers are nearby to help them find products.",
      "Ahold Delhaize\u2019s Albert Heijn supermarket chain in the Netherlands and Belgium has been testing an artificial intelligence-enabled tool since 2022 that marks down prices on its digital labels every 15 minutes for products nearing expiration. The system has reduced more than 250 tons of food waste annually, the company said.",
      "But Warren and Casey are skeptical. In their letter to Kroger, the U.S. senators noted a partnership with Microsoft that planned to put cameras in grocery aisles and offer personalized deals to shoppers depending on their gender and age.",
      "In its response, Kroger said the prices shown on its digital labels were not connected to any sort of facial recognition technology. It also denied surging prices during periods of peak demand.",
      "\u201cKroger\u2019s business model is built on a foundation of lowering prices to attract more customers,\u201d the company said.",
      "Aguilar, the Arizona lawmaker, said he also opposes the transition to digital labels because he thinks they will cost jobs. His constituents have pointed out that grocery prices keep rising even though there are fewer workers in checkout lanes, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are supposed to be part of our community, and that means hiring people from our community that fill those jobs,\" Aguilar said.",
      "But Relex Solutions' Oren said she doesn't think cutting labor costs is the main reason stores deploy digital price tags.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about working smarter, not harder, and being able to use that labor in better ways across the store rather than these very mundane, repetitive tasks,\u201d she said.",

      "NEW YORK -- The world\u2019s richest man could lose billions in his fight with world\u2019s most powerful politician.",
      "The feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump could mean Tesla\u2019s plans for self-driving cars hit a roadblock, SpaceX flies fewer missions for NASA, Starlink gets fewer overseas satellite contracts and the social media platform X loses advertisers.",
      "Maybe, that is. It all depends on Trump\u2019s appetite for revenge and how the dispute unfolds.",
      "Joked Telemetry Insight auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid, \u201cSince Trump has no history of retaliating against perceived adversaries, he\u2019ll probably just let this pass.\u201d",
      "Turning serious, he sees trouble ahead for Musk.",
      "\u201cFor someone that rants so much about government pork, all of Elon\u2019s businesses are extremely dependent on government largesse, which makes him vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Trump and the federal government also stand to lose from a long-running dispute, but not as much as Musk.",
      "The dispute comes just a week before a planned test of Tesla\u2019s driverless taxis in Austin, Texas, a major event for the company because sales of its EVs are lagging in many markets, and Musk needs a win.",
      "Trump can mess things up for Tesla by encouraging federal safety regulators to step in at any sign of trouble for the robotaxis.",
      "Even before the war of words broke out on Thursday, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration requested data on how Musk\u2019s driverless, autonomous taxis will perform in low-visibility conditions. That request follows an investigation last year into 2.4 million Teslas equipped with full self-driving software after several accidents, including one that killed a pedestrian.",
      "A spokesman for NHTSA said the probe was ongoing and that the agency \"will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice has also probed the safety of Tesla cars, but the status of that investigation is unclear. The DOJ did not respond immediately to requests for comment.",
      "The promise of a self-driving future led by Tesla inspired shareholders to boost the stock by 50% in the weeks after Musk confirmed the Austin rollout. But on Thursday, the stock plunged more than 14% amid the Trump-Musk standoff. On Friday, it recovered a bit, bouncing back nearly 4%.",
      "\u201cTesla\u2019s recent rise was almost entirely driven by robotaxi enthusiasm,\" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cElon\u2019s feud with Trump could be a negative.\u201d",
      "One often-overlooked but important part of Tesla\u2019s business that could take a hit is its sales of carbon credits.",
      "As Musk and Trump were slugging it out Thursday, Republican senators inserted new language into Trump\u2019s budget bill that would eliminate fines for gas-powered cars that fall short of fuel economy standards. Tesla has a thriving side business selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to other automakers to make up for their shortfalls.",
      "Musk has downplayed the importance of the credits business, but the changes would hurt Tesla as it reels from boycotts of its cars tied to Musk\u2019s time working for Trump.",
      "Credit sales jumped by a third to $595 million in the first three months of the year even as total revenue slumped.",
      "Musk\u2019s foray into right-wing politics cost Tesla sales among the environmentally minded consumers who embraced electric cars and led to boycotts of Tesla showrooms.",
      "If Musk has indeed ended his close association with Trump, those buyers could come back, but that\u2019s far from certain.",
      "Meanwhile, one analyst speculated earlier this year that Trump voters in so-called red counties could buy Teslas \u201cin a meaningful way.\u201d But he\u2019s now less hopeful.",
      "\u201cThere are more questions than answers following Thursday developments,\u201d TD Cowen\u2019s Itay Michaeli wrote in his latest report, \u201cand it\u2019s still too early to determine any lasting impacts.\u201d",
      "Michaeli\u2019s stock target for Tesla earlier this year was $388. He has since lowered it to $330. Tesla was trading Friday at $300.",
      "Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he could cut government contracts to Musk\u2019s rocket company, SpaceX, a massive threat to a company that has received billions of federal dollars.",
      "The privately held company that is reportedly worth $350 billion provides launches, sends astronauts into space for NASA and has a contract to send a team from the space agency to the moon next year.",
      "But if Musk has a lot to lose, so does the U.S.",
      "SpaceX is the only U.S. company capable of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules. The other alternative is politically dicey: depending wholly on Russia's Soyuz capsules.",
      "Musk knew all this when he shot back at Trump that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft. But it is unclear how serious his threat was. Several hours later \u2014 in a reply to another X user \u2014 he said he wouldn\u2019t do it.",
      "A subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk\u2019s once-close relationship with the president.",
      "Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for some services during a trip with Trump in the Middle East last month. The company has also won a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere as Trump has threatened tariffs.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much politics played a role, and how much is pure business.",
      "On Friday, The Associated Press confirmed that India had approved a key license to Starlink. At least 40% of India\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people have no access to the internet.",
      "Big advertisers that fled X after Musk welcomed all manner of conspiracy theories to the social media platform have started to trickle back in recent months, possibly out of fear of a conservative backlash.",

      "Now advertisers may have to worry about a different danger.",
      "If Trump sours on X, \"there\u2019s a risk that it could again become politically radioactive for major brands,\u201d said Sarah Kreps, a political scientist at Cornell University. She added, though, that an \u201cexodus isn\u2019t obvious, and it would depend heavily on how the conflict escalates, how long it lasts and how it ends.\u201d",

      "Artificial Intelligence\u2019s use in filmmaking is growing",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Artificial intelligence 's use in movie making is exploding. And a young film festival, now in its junior year, is showcasing what this technology can do on screen today.",
      "The annual AI Film Festival organized by Runway, a company that specializes in AI-generated video, kicked off in New York Thursday night with ten short films from around the world making their debut on the big screen.",
      "\u201cThree years ago, this was such a crazy idea,\u201d Runway CEO Crist\u00f3bal Valenzuela told the crowd. \u201cToday, millions of people are making billions of videos using tools we only dreamed of.\u201d",
      "The film festival itself has grown significantly since its 2023 debut. About 300 people submitted films when it first began, Valenzuela said, compared to about 6,000 submissions received this year.",
      "The one and half-hour lineup stretched across a range of creative styles and ambitious themes \u2014 with Jacob Alder's \u201c Total Pixel Space \" taking home the festival's top prize. The 9-minute and 28-second film questions how many possible images \u2014 real or not \u2014 exist in the digital space, and uses math to calculate a colossal number. A stunning series of images, ranging from the familiar life moments to those that completely bend reality, gives viewers a glimpse of what's out there.",
      "Meanwhile, Andrew Salter's \u201cJailbird,\" which snagged second place, chronicles a chicken's journey \u2014 from the bird's perspective \u2014 to a human prison in the United Kingdom to take part in a joint-rehabilitation program. And \u201cOne,\u201d a futuristic story by Ricardo Villavicencio and Edward Saatchi about interplanetary travel followed in third place.",
      "The 10 films shown were finalists selected from thousands submitted to Runway's AI Film Festival this year. The shorts will also be shown at screenings held in Los Angeles and Paris next week.",
      "How AI is used and executed is a factor judges evaluate when determining festival winners. But not every film entered was made entirely using AI. While submission criteria requires each movie include the use of AI-generated video, there's no set threshold, meaning some films can take a more \u201cmixed media\u201d approach \u2014 such as combining live shots of actors or real-life images and sounds with AI-generated elements.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to encourage people to explore and experiment with it,\u201d Valenzuela said in an interview prior to Thursday's screening.",
      "Creating a coherent film using generative AI is no easy feat. It can take a long list of directions and numerous, detailed prompts to get even a short scene to make sense and look consistent. Still, the scope of what this kind of technology can do has grown significantly since Runway's first AI Film Festival in 2023 \u2014 and Valenzuela says that's reflected in today's submissions. While there are still limits, AI-generated video is becoming more and more life-like and realistic.",
      "Runway encourages the use of its own AI tools for films entered into its festival, but creators are also allowed to turn to other resources and tools as they put together the films \u2014 and across the industry, tools that use AI to create videos spanning from text, image and/or audio prompts have rapidly improved over recent years, while becoming increasingly available.",
      "\u201cThe way (this technology) has lived within film and media culture, and pop culture, has really accelerated,\u201d said Joshua Glick, an associate professor of film and electronic arts at Bard College.",
      "He adds that Runway's film fest, which is among a handful of showcases aimed at spotlighting AI's creative capabilities, arrives as companies in this space are searching for heightened \u201clegitimacy and recognition\u201d for the tools they are creating \u2014 with aims to cement partnerships in Hollywood as a result.",
      "AI's presence in Hollywood is already far-reaching, and perhaps more expansive than many moviegoers realize. Beyond \u201cheadline-grabbing\u201d (and at times controversial) applications that big-budget films have done to \u201cde-age\u201d actors or create eye-catching stunts, Glick notes, this technology is often incorporated in an array of post-production editing, digital touch-ups and additional behind-the-scenes work like sorting footage.",
      "Industry executives repeatedly point to how AI can improve efficiency in the movie making process \u2014 allowing creatives to perform a task that once took hours, for example, in a matter of minutes \u2014 and foster further innovation.",
      "Still, AI's rapid growth and adoption has also heightened anxieties around the burgeoning technology \u2014 notably its implications for workers.",
      "The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees \u2014 which represents behind-the-scenes entertainment workers in the U.S. and Canada \u2014 has \u201clong embraced new technologies that enhance storytelling,\u201d Vanessa Holtgrewe, IATSE's international vice president, said in an emailed statement. \u201cBut we\u2019ve also been clear: AI must not be used to undermine workers\u2019 rights or livelihoods.\u201d",
      "IATSE and other unions have continued to meet with major studios and establish provisions in efforts to provide guardrails around the use of AI. The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists has also been vocal about AI protections for its members, a key sticking point in recent labor actions.",
      "For Runway's AI Film Festival, Valenzuela hopes screening films that incorporate AI-generated video can showcase what's possible \u2014 and how he says this technology can help, not hurt, creatives in the work they do today.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s natural to fear change ... (But) it's important to understand what you can do with it,\" Valenzuela said. Even filmmaking, he adds, was born \u201cbecause of scientific breakthroughs that at the time were very uncomfortable for many people.\"",

      "\"Testifying in the face of constant disruptions, victim shaming and deliberate attempts to distort the truth was exhausting and at times dehumanizing,\" she said. \"But today's verdict gives me hope -- hope that there is new awareness around sexual violence and that the myth of the perfect victim is fading.\"",
      "\"I hope that this result empowers others to speak out and seek justice,\" she added.",
      "Sokola told reporters she was happy with the verdict and proud of the other women who testified.",
      "\"It was an extremely difficult journey for all of us to relive our traumas and to go through it in open court,\" Sokola said. \"It's a big win for everyone. Harvey Weinstein will be in jail.\"",
      "\"For myself, it's closing of a chapter that caused me a lot of pain throughout my life,\" she added.",
      "Her attorney, Lindsay Goldbrum, said the verdict \"is a step towards justice, even if it's not a complete one.\"",
      "Sexual harassment and assault allegations against Weinstein published in 2017 galvanized the #MeToo movement. Following the verdict, Haley's attorney, Gloria Allred, told reporters Wednesday, \"For those of you in the press who have predicted that the #MeToo movement might be dead, that obituary was obviously premature.\"",
      "As jurors still weigh the rape count, Mann said in a statement Wednesday that she \"laid bare my trauma\" and \"stood up and told the truth. Again and again.\"",
      "\"I would never lie about rape or use something so traumatic to hurt someone,\" she said.",
      "Prosecutors said Weinstein \"preyed on three women\" as \"he held unfettered power for over 30 years\" in Hollywood, while the defense countered the producer did not coerce the women and claimed they were using him for his connections.",
      "\"Harvey Weinstein had enormous control over those working in television and film. He decided who was in and who was out,\" the prosecutor, Shannon Lucey, told the jury of seven women and five men at the start of the trial. \"He held the golden ticket. The chance to make it or not.\"",
      "Lucey claimed that \"no\" was \"not a word the defendant was used to hearing.\"",
      "Weinstein's defense attorney, Arthur Aidala, agreed with prosecutors that Weinstein was a powerful man in the television and film industries, but he told the jury Weinstein did not coerce the women he's accused of assaulting. Instead, Aidala claimed Weinstein engaged in \"mutually beneficial relationships\" that the attorney said have been going on in Hollywood for a hundred years.",
      "\"They're fooling around with him consensually,\" Aidala claimed. \"The casting couch was not a crime scene.\"",
      "In detailing the alleged sexual assaults, Lucey claimed that when Haley went to Weinstein's Crosby Street apartment in July 2006 to discuss a production role on \"Project Runway,\" he \"held her down\" and subjected her to forcible sexual conduct.",
      "Sokola was 16 when she first met Weinstein in 2002 at a restaurant in the West Village shortly after signing a modeling contract to come to New York from Poland. Several years later, in 2006, Weinstein cast Sokola as an extra in \"The Nanny Diaries.\" After a lunch at a Manhattan hotel that year, Weinstein allegedly \"pressed on her shoulders with enough force to get her down on the bed\" and forced oral sex on the 19-year-old as she said, \"Please do not do this,\" Lucey claimed.",
      "Lucey also claimed Weinstein allegedly forced Sokola to touch his genitals in a Manhattan apartment when she was 16. Weinstein is not charged in that alleged 2002 incident in the indictment, as it is outside the statute of limitations. But the judge allowed Sokola to testify about it during the trial, along with a second alleged incident involving Weinstein she says occurred in 2004. Sokola previously filed a lawsuit in New York under the Child Victims Act over the alleged 2002 incident, which prosecutors said has since been settled.",
      "In 2013, Weinstein allegedly subjected Mann to sex without her consent at a hotel, according to Lucey. Mann testified that Weinstein raped her after finding out she had a serious boyfriend who was an actor. Lucey claimed Mann had also engaged in sexual encounters with Weinstein that were not coerced out of fear of his power in the industry.",
      "The new trial comes after the New York Court of Appeals overturned Weinstein's initial 2020 conviction last year, finding the trial judge \"erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes.\"",
      "Weinstein has also appealed his conviction in December 2022 on sex offenses in Los Angeles. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison there.",

    "story": [
      "How Democrats proceed could affect enthusiasm for their candidates in 2026.",
      "The standoff between Democratic leadership in deep-blue California and the Trump administration amid protests of immigration raids in Los Angeles lays bare bitter political divisions and sets the stage for the high-stakes fight at the ballot box as the midterm elections inch closer, with the 2028 presidential contest to follow not long after that.",
      "From the Oval Office, President Donald Trump promised that more cities could see raids from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. With that, the possibility of a sustained protest movement grows, along with the possibility of more federal intervention -- whether Democratic officials want it or not.",
      "The way Democrats proceed in this moment could affect enthusiasm for the party's candidates come midterms time, when the party is trying to reclaim power in a Washington where it has very little.",
      "For Democrats, anti-Trump sentiment is undoubtedly a mobilizing factor, and polling has suggested Democrats want their leaders to fight harder against the Republican Party.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, widely considered to be a possible 2028 presidential candidate, has positioned himself as the most prominent foil to an administration he's accused of encroaching on his state's autonomy by deploying federal troops to Los Angeles without an ask from California authorities. Newsom was also emboldened in his criticism of Trump after the president told reporters Monday it would be a \"great thing\" if Newsom were arrested.",
      "\"The President of the United States just called for the arrest of a sitting Governor,\" Newsom posted on Instagram, along with a video of Trump's comments. \"This is a day I hoped I would never see in America. I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican this is a line we cannot cross as a nation -- this is an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.\"",
      "Still, later Monday, Newsom condemned the violence in his state while appearing to place blame on the president, saying, \"Have no doubt -- Violent criminals who take advantage of Trump's chaos WILL be held accountable. Our number one priority has been and will be keeping LA safe.\"",
      "Democratic governors stood by Newsom in a carefully worded statement that both condemned the violence that took place in Los Angeles and called Trump's actions \"ineffective and dangerous.\"",
      "\"It's important we respect the executive authority of our country's governors to manage their National Guards -- and we stand with Governor Newsom who has made it clear that violence is unacceptable and that local authorities should be able to do their jobs without the chaos of this federal interference and intimidation,\" they said in the statement.",
      "Similarly, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass urged peaceful protest and condemned Trump's actions, telling reporters on Sunday, \"What we're seeing in Los Angeles is chaos that is provoked by the administration.\"",
      "The optics of violence in the streets of a major American city -- though the most destructive protests have been in a relatively small, isolated area -- with Democrats pushing back on militarized force on protesters is a fight the Trump White House, and Republicans more broadly, are willing to wage.",
      "\"I think it's another reason why you're seeing the demise of the Democrat brand around the country,\" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said Tuesday.",
      "\"You got a city on fire,\" he added. \"You got people marching with foreign flags, people marching with a Mexican flag in LA, resisting federal law, interfering with federal law. You have the governor and the mayor, both Democrats, saying they will interfere and will not uphold federal law.\"",
      "And while many elected Democrats will take a head-on Newsom-esque approach to confronting moves by the Trump administration, others will likely try to find less combative ways to do so.",
      "In San Francisco, which saw protests of its own related to ICE raids, Mayor Daniel Lurie centered public safety in his message about protests and has avoided mentioning Trump by name.",
      "\"Everyone in this country has a right to make their voice heard peacefully,\" Lurie said Sunday. \"But we will never tolerate violent and destructive behavior.\"",
      "Lurie has drawn some criticism from some corners of San Francisco for his relative silence on Trump, but others argue it allows him to stay above the fray.",
      "It remains to be seen which strategy -- Newsom's defiance or Lurie's restraint -- will resonate with voters.",
      "As Trump promises continued deportation efforts in cities across the country, Democratic officials may soon be forced to pick a path.",

    "story": [
      "Even Elon Musk and some Republicans are rejecting GOP claims about the impact.",
      "Before devolving into personal attacks, the clash between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk began with a disagreement over the country's ballooning debt.",
      "Musk publicly condemned what Trump hopes will be his signature legislative achievement -- a massive tax and immigration bill dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act -- as an \"abomination\" over its estimated impact on the deficit and debt.",
      "Similar concern among a handful of Republican budget hawks in the Senate is complicating the bill's path to passage by Trump's desired Fourth of July deadline.",
      "Fuel was added to the fire when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its new score estimating the legislation would add $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.",
      "The debt -- the total of annual deficits and interest -- stands at a historic high of $36 trillion. Publicly held debt measures at about 100% the size of the economy.",
      "\"We're at World War II levels right now of government debt, and as far as the eye can see going forward we're just climbing,\" Kent Smetters, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business who formerly worked at the CBO, told ABC News.",
      "What to know about the CBO score of Trump's megabill",
      "The nonpartisan budget office estimated the Trump megabill as passed by the House would add $2.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, plus bring $550 billion in interest costs.",
      "Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, after the CBO release, told ABC News Live: \"I refuse to accept $2 trillion-plus deficits as far as the eye can see as the new normal.\"",
      "\"I'm worried about our kids and grandkids, the fact that we're mortgaging their future. It is wrong. It's immoral,\" Johnson said.",
      "The White House and House leadership claim the CBO estimate is incorrect. Officials have accused the agency of political bias and take issue with the way it calculates the score without factoring in potential economic growth, which it will in a separate analysis later this year.",
      "Experts say the criticism is not valid. They note that the CBO is currently helmed by an official who served in the George W. Bush administration and that its estimates for this bill are not far off from independent models from banks or other outside institutions.",
      "\"I think they know on some level that what they're doing is not fiscally responsible, and so they're trying to blame the messenger for that message,\" said Stan Veuger, a senior fellow in economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank.",
      "Veuger and Brendan Duke, the senior director for federal budget policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, also emphasize the CBO score is based on the bill as written -- when the expectation is that certain spending and tax provisions Republicans say will expire in a few years will likely be extended, bringing the bill's fiscal cost higher.",
      "Meanwhile, the CBO estimates that the megabill could cut taxes by $3.7 trillion and cut spending by $1.2 trillion.",
      "And Trump has touted another analysis out from the budget office that said his tariff policy (which he's suggested could pay for some of his megabill priorities) would reduce the deficit by $2.8 trillion. Though that estimate assumes the tariffs would be in place permanently, while Trump's shifted on his policy multiple times and some of his tariff actions are being challenged in court.",
      "How the debt got so high, and what the consequences could be",
      "The national debt has shot upwards in recent decades under both Democratic and Republican administrations. Large tax cuts under Presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Trump led to deficits; as did stimulus packages passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.",
      "To help pay for Trump's megabill, Republicans are making changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The nonpartisan budget office estimates millions of Americans will lose health insurance due to the cuts.",
      "\"It's one thing if we were asking Americans to kind of give a little to reduce the deficit. But this doesn't reduce the deficit,\" said Duke. \"This increases the deficit while leaving millions of low and moderate income people worse off.\"",
      "Balancing budget sheets completely would require much more drastic changes. All federal spending would need to be reduced 30% and taxes increased by 26% -- or some combination of the two -- immediately and forever, said Penn Wharton's Smetters.",
      "While many economists believe some government debt is a good thing, as it means many view U.S. securities as among the safest assets in the world, too much debt can have negative ramifications.",
      "Experts said potential consequences could be an increase to interest rates and issues with the bond market. It could also lead to less wage growth and economic progress. A worst-case scenario would be defaulting on debt.",
      "\"The United States is definitely not too big to fail,\" Smetters said. \"When failure happens, what you see is significant inflation, you see significant pain and you see social upheaval.\"",

      "\"This is a serious breach of state sovereignty,\" Gov. Gavin Newsom said.",
      "With migrant communities already living in fear amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, raids carried out in downtown Los Angeles last week by federal agents apparently became a flashpoint for days of protests in America's second-largest city.",
      "The spate of protests, which have seen both peaceful marches and violent clashes with law enforcement, prompted the president to call in the military.",

Gavin Newsom. The president has publicly called Bass and Newsom \"incompetent\" in the crisis, and the mayor and governor have countered that Trump is abusing the power of the Oval Office by sending in the military and alleging he is \"escalating\" an already volatile situation.",
      "The L.A. protests, which have been mostly concentrated in the city's downtown area near Edward R. Roybal Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse, have devolved into violent clashes with local law enforcement firing less-lethal projectiles, tear gas and flash bangs to disperse crowds. Demonstrators have responded by blocking a major freeway, setting vehicles ablaze and hurling rocks, Molotov cocktails and other projectiles at the police, authorities said.",

Aerial footage taken by ABC News' Los Angeles station, KABC, shows what appears to be ICE agents loading two white passenger vehicles with people in handcuffs. As the vehicles leave the apparel business, protesters try unsuccessfully to stop them, including one individual who was seen lying down in the path of one of the cars.",
      "Several hours later, a large group of protesters gathered outside the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse downtown, calling for an end to immigration raids in the city. Video footage shows protesters vandalizing the building, heckling police and throwing bottles and other objects at officers who used shields to protect themselves. Police in riot gear are seen confronting protesters with batons and what appeared to be tear gas launchers.",
      "At 10 p.m., the LAPD posts a message on social media, saying \"an UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY has been declared for the area\" around the downtown federal building and advises protesters and others to leave the area.",
      "June 7",
      "The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department receives reports around 10:15 a.m. of a large crowd gathering in Paramount, a small suburb of Los Angeles, amid rumors that ICE is preparing to raid a Home Depot there. Deputies ordered the crowd to disperse and fired tear gas and flash bang when people refused to leave. Around the same time, another protest broke out in neighboring Compton, where reports emerged of vandalism, including protesters setting a car on fire in the street.",
      "Later, Mayor Bass said that there were no ICE raids in Paramount or anywhere else in Los Angeles County on Saturday. She said the building in Paramount that protesters gathered near was being used as a staging area for federal resources.",
      "Around 6 p.m., Trump signed a presidential memorandum authorizing the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles, saying it is necessary to \"address the lawlessness\" in Los Angeles. Bass and Newsom immediately object to the president's decision, saying it would only enflame tensions.",
      "Throughout the night, protesters still assembled at the downtown federal complex were seen throwing fireworks, rocks, glass bottles and other objects at police, who responded by firing less-lethal projectiles and flash-bangs to disperse protesters.",
      "June 8",
      "National Guard Troops began arriving in Los Angeles around 4 a.m., taking up a position outside the Roybal federal building. The deployment marked the first time a president has mobilized a state's National Guard without a governor's consent since President Lyndon B. Johnson did so in 1965, when he sent National Guard troops to Alabama to protect civil rights activists marching from Selma to Montgomery.",
      "Twenty-two Democratic governors released a joint statement calling Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard \"an alarming abuse of power.\"",
      "\"Governors are the Commanders in Chief of their National Guard and the federal government activating them in their own borders without consulting or working with the state's governor is ineffective and dangerous,\" the joint statement reads.",
      "A large group of protesters began marching in downtown Los Angeles, chanting and holding signs reading, \"Fight Trump.\"",
      "The LAPD goes on \"tactical alert,\" meaning all personnel are to remain on duty as the city braces for another evening of protests. Despite officers using less-lethal munitions in an attempt to break up the demonstrations, protesters marched onto the 101 Freeway, halting traffic on a portion of the freeway running through downtown.",
      "Two LAPD officers were injured by motorcyclists attempting to breach a skirmish line police had established, according to officials. Video captured other demonstrators standing on an overpass throwing objects, including at least one scooter and bicycle, at California Highway Patrol officers and their vehicle as the CHP attempted to remove protesters from the freeway.",
      "\"Tonight, we had individuals out there shooting commercial grade fireworks at our officers. That can kill you,\" LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell says at a news conference.",
      "Gov. Newsom formally requested that the Trump administration rescind its \"unlawful deployment\" of National Guard troops.",
      "June 9",
      "At 12:11 a.m. local time, the LAPD declared protests in all of downtown Los Angeles acts of \"unlawful assembly\" and ordered people to leave the area or risk arrest.",
      "U.S. military officials confirmed that 700 members of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines at Twentynine Palms, California, are being deployed to Los Angeles.",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta said he and Newsom are suing the Trump administration, alleging the president and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have \"trampled over\" California's sovereignty by unlawfully invoking \"a law that's intended to prevent an invasion by a foreign nation or [prevent] a rebellion or [in response to] local and state law enforcement [making] it so that the law of the United States cannot be executed.\"",
      "Returning to the White House from a weekend trip to Camp David, Trump told reporters it would be \"great\" if Tom Homan, acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, arrested Newsom, although Homan says he and the president had no discussions about arresting the governor.",
      "In a social media post, Newsom said, \"These are the acts of a dictator, not a President.\"",
      "As protests in Los Angeles entered their fourth night, photos from the scene showed tense moments as demonstrators confronted police. At one point, police said protesters near Temple Street and Los Angeles Street in downtown L.A. were throwing objects at police, and an LAPD incident commander authorized the use of \"less lethal munitions\" in response.",
      "June 10",

      "At the White House, a reporter asks Trump if he would use the Insurrection Act as a response to the protests. The president responds, \"If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We will see.\"",
      "\"These are paid insurrectionists, these are paid troublemakers,\" Trump said of the protesters without citing supporting evidence.",
      "\"If we didn\u2019t get involved\" and send the National Guard, \"right now Los Angeles would be burning, just like it was burning a number of months ago with all the houses that were lost,\" Trump said, referencing the January wildfires that ravaged Los Angeles.",
      "At an evening news conference, Mayor Bass announces she is declaring a local emergency and imposing an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew in the downtown area, saying it has become a necessary step to stop vandalism and the looting of businesses there. She said the curfew is being imposed in a 1-square-mile area of downtown where the protests and violence have occurred.",
      "Bass says 23 downtown businesses were looted on Monday, June 9, alone. LAPD Police Chief Jim McDonnell says 197 people were arrested downtown on Tuesday night alone.",
      "\"So, my message to you is if you do not live or work in downtown L.A., avoid the area. Law enforcement will arrest individuals who break the curfew and you will be prosecuted,\" Bass said.",
      "She says she plans to meet with elected leaders and law enforcement officials on Wednesday, June 11, to discuss the continuation of the curfew, but adds it is expected to last for several days.",
      "In a nighttime video address, Gov. Newsom continues to condemn President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, saying Trump \"chose theatrics over public safety.\"",

      "The Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit heard oral arguments Wednesday.",
      "President Donald Trump's challenge to his \"one of a kind\" felony hush money conviction in New York should be removed from state appellate courts and heard in federal court, an attorney for the president argued Wednesday.",
      "Just over a year after Trump became the first former president to be found guilty of a felony, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit heard arguments Wednesday on Trump's efforts to move his appeal of the verdict from state court to federal court.",
      "\"The federal officer is entitled to a federal forum, not to have those arguments heard in state court,\" attorney Jeffrey Wall told the three-judge panel. \"And if that's true for a normal federal officer in a normal criminal prosecution, it certainly ought to be true for the president of the United States and for what we can all recognize is an anomalous one of its kind prosecution.\"",
      "Trump was convicted last year on 34 felony counts after Manhattan prosecutors alleged that he engaged in a \"scheme\" to boost his chances during the 2016 presidential election through a series of hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, and then falsified New York business records to cover up that alleged criminal conduct.",
      "New York Judge Juan Merchan, on the eve of Trump's inauguration, sentenced him to an unconditional discharge -- the lightest possible punishment allowed under New York state law -- saying it was the \"only lawful sentence\" to prevent \"encroaching upon the highest office in the land.\"",
      "At Wednesday's hearing, an attorney for the Manhattan district attorney's office, Steven Wu, argued that it's now too late to move the case.",
      "\"After sentencing, removal is no longer available,\" Wu said during oral arguments.",
      "Wu also argued the purpose of removal is to decide where to hold the trial.",
      "\"It is not to divert a state criminal proceeding into a federal court for direct appellate review,\" Wu said.",
      "Wall, who served as an acting solicitor general in Trump's first administration, argued that the time limit to ask for removal to federal court does not apply if Trump can show good cause.",
      "\"Why shouldn't we be looking for some more specific signs that Congress actually intended this?\" Judge Susan Carney asked.",
      "\"It's the first-ever prosecution by a district attorney of a president,\" Wall responded. \"As long as you have colorable federal defenses, and it has something to do with your job, you get to come into federal court notwithstanding the state's interest.\"",
      "Trump's lawyers have argued that the conduct at issue during his criminal trial included \"official acts\" undertaken while he was president, and that the Supreme Court's landmark ruling last year granting the president immunity for official acts -- which was decided after Trump was convicted in May -- would have prevented prosecutors from securing their conviction.",
      "\"There was evidence that came in at trial that triggered federal immunity,\" Wall told the appellate panel.",
      "Wu countered that the evidence offered involved discussion about a crime that related to Trump's actions before he became president.",
      "\"It's a highly unusual case, would you agree with that?\" Judge Raymond Lohier asked.",
      "\"This defendant is a very unusual defendant,\" Wu conceded -- but he argued that should not automatically usurp the state's interest in enforcing its laws.",
      "The judges did not immediately rule, but said they would take the arguments under advisement.",
      "If the appeals court grants Trump's request, his conviction would still remain. The only change is that his appeal will play out in a federal, rather than state, courtroom. In either scenario, Trump could ultimately ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene.",
      "Although Trump has in the past asserted that, as president, he would have the right to pardon himself for federal offenses, Pace University Law School professor Bennett Gershman told ABC News that would not apply in this case.",
      "\"It's still a state crime -- you're now just talking about where the case is litigated,\" Gershman said. \"I'm not even sure that pardoning yourself is even allowed, but that's an open question that's never been addressed.\"",

      "Texas Republican lawmakers, who met on the topic at the U.S. Capitol Monday night, described the conversations on the topic as preliminary, and most declined to discuss the initial conversations, which were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "\"I'm not going to comment on it,\" said Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas.",
      "\"We're still kind of cogitating,\" said Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas.",

      "If Republicans in Austin decided to move forward with redistricting, it's not clear how they would reconfigure the map. One Republican source familiar with the discussions said that as many as five seats currently held by Democrats could be targeted.",
      "But the source pointed out that any effort to draw Republican voters into Democratic seats could backfire -- leaving more seats vulnerable to legal challenges, or for Democratic pickups in a wave election.",
      "\"There's an old Southern saying: Pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered,\" the source said to ABC News about the potential risks of redrawing the map.",
      "A second Republican source familiar with the discussions told ABC News that Texas GOP figures have discussed the potential for redistricting with the White House.",
      "Republicans currently have a 220-212 majority in the U.S. House, with three vacancies. They began the session with a narrow five-seat majority and could face a potential redrawing of the Wisconsin congressional map depending on the outcome of several lawsuits filed with the state supreme court.",
      "Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, said the conversations show that Republicans are \"definitely\" worried about losing seats in November, given that the current map, approved in 2021, was drawn by Republicans for the coming decade.",
      "There is one active federal lawsuit over the current map, brought by advocates who have argued it discriminates against voters of color.",
      "\"I don't think there's any question about that. I mean, why else would you want to do that knowing how unsettled that could make the electorate feel?\" Veasey said.",
      "Asked about GOP worries about losing control of the House, Babin said, \"We're always concerned about the midterms. Who wants to go into the minority? I don't.\"",
      "Redistricting before the next census would be unusual, but not unprecedented in Texas.",
      "In 2003, Republicans led by former Rep. Tom DeLay pushed through an early redrawing of the maps to wrestle control of the majority of the state's seats from Democrats, sparking a political fight that made its way to the Supreme Court.",
      "The White House and Gov. Greg Abbott's office did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "\"I can't control it, so I don't care,\" said Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, who suggested that his district could be one of those redrawn.",
      "\"If we were to really go through with it, districts like mine would obviously be the ones that are targeted because I live in the suburbs. I'm the one you have to take from the rural areas and put in the suburbs, so I'd be basically going back to my old district I guess.\"",
      "Republicans' conversations come as some Democrats have, once again, set their sights on making gains in Texas.",

      "And although Trump claimed that Los Angeles was \"under siege,\" the incidents had been confined on Sunday and Monday to a relatively small area of downtown Los Angeles -- about a 10-block area.",

      "After a bruising war between Israel and Hezbollah, Lebanon\u2019s new leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the country\u2019s devastated economy with help from its wealthy Gulf neighbors",
      "BEIRUT -- Fireworks lit up the night sky over Beirut\u2019s famous St. Georges Hotel as hit songs from the 1960s and 70s filled the air in a courtyard overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "The retro-themed event was hosted last month by Lebanon\u2019s Tourism Ministry to promote the upcoming summer season and perhaps recapture some of the good vibes from an era viewed as a golden one for the country. In the years before a civil war began in 1975, Lebanon was the go-to destination for wealthy tourists from neighboring Gulf countries seeking beaches in summer, snow-capped mountains in winter and urban nightlife year-round.",
      "In the decade after the war, tourists from Gulf countries \u2013 and crucially, Saudi Arabia \u2013 came back, and so did Lebanon\u2019s economy. But by the early 2000s, as the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah gained power, Lebanon's relations with Gulf countries began to sour. Tourism gradually dried up, starving its economy of billions of dollars in annual spending.",

      "There are signs of thawing relations with some Gulf neighbors. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have lifted yearslong travel bans.",
      "All eyes are now on Saudi Arabia, a regional political and economic powerhouse, to see if it will follow suit, according to Lahoud and other Lebanese officials. A key sticking point is security, these officials say. Although a ceasefire with Israel has been in place since November, near-daily airstrikes have continued in southern and eastern Lebanon, where Hezbollah over the years had built its political base and powerful military arsenal.",
      "As vital as tourism is \u2014 it accounted for almost 20% of Lebanon's economy before it tanked in 2019 \u2014 the country's leaders say it is just one piece of a larger puzzle they are trying to put back together.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s agricultural and industrial sectors are in shambles, suffering a major blow in 2021, when Saudi Arabia banned their exports after accusing Hezbollah of smuggling drugs into Riyadh. Years of economic dysfunction have left the country's once-thriving middle class in a state of desperation.",
      "The World Bank says poverty nearly tripled in Lebanon over the past decade, affecting close to half its population of nearly 6 million. To make matters worse, inflation is soaring, with the Lebanese pound losing 90% of its value, and many families lost their savings when banks collapsed.",
      "Tourism is seen by Lebanon's leaders as the best way to kickstart the reconciliation needed with Gulf countries -- and only then can they move on to exports and other economic growth opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that makes most sense, because that\u2019s all Lebanon can sell now,\u201d said Sami Zoughaib, research manager at The Policy Initiative, a Beirut-based think tank.",
      "With summer still weeks away, flights to Lebanon are already packed with expats and locals from countries that overturned their travel bans, and hotels say bookings have been brisk.",
      "At the event hosted last month by the tourism ministry, the owner of the St. Georges Hotel, Fady El-Khoury, beamed. The hotel, owned by his father in its heyday, has acutely felt Lebanon's ups and downs over the decades, closing and reopening multiple times because of wars. \u201cI have a feeling that the country is coming back after 50 years,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent weekend, as people crammed the beaches of the northern city of Batroun, and jet skis whizzed along the Mediterranean, local business people sounded optimistic that the country was on the right path.",
      "\u201cWe are happy, and everyone here is happy,\u201d said Jad Nasr, co-owner of a private beach club. \u201cAfter years of being boycotted by the Arabs and our brothers in the Gulf, we expect this year for us to always be full.\u201d",
      "Still, tourism is not a panacea for Lebanon's economy, which for decades has suffered from rampant corruption and waste.",
      "Lebanon has been in talks with the International Monetary Fund for years over a recovery plan that would include billions in loans and require the country to combat corruption, restructure its banks, and bring improvements to a range of public services, including electricity and water.",
      "Without those and other reforms, Lebanon's wealthy neighbors will lack confidence to invest there, experts said. A tourism boom alone would serve as a \u201cmorphine shot that would only temporarily ease the pain\" rather than stop the deepening poverty in Lebanon, Zoughaib said.",
      "The tourism minister, Lahoud, agreed, saying a long-term process has only just begun.",
      "\"But we\u2019re talking about subjects we never talked about before,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the whole country has realized that war doesn\u2019t serve anyone, and that we really need our economy to be back and flourish again.\u201d",

      "All 12 members of the board overseeing the prestigious Fulbright scholarships on Wednesday resigned in protest of what they call the Trump administration\u2019s meddling with the selection of award recipients, according to a statement they issued",
      "All 12 members of the board overseeing the prestigious Fulbright scholarships on Wednesday resigned in protest of what they call the Trump administration\u2019s meddling with the selection of award recipients, according to a statement.",
      "A statement published online by the board members said the administration usurped the board\u2019s authority by denying awards to \u201ca substantial number of people\u201d who already had been chosen. Another 1,200 award recipients who were already approved to come to the U.S. are undergoing an unauthorized review process that could lead to their rejection, the board members said.",
      "\u201cTo continue to serve after the Administration has consistently ignored the Board\u2019s request that they follow the law would risk legitimizing actions we believe are unlawful and damage the integrity of this storied program and America\u2019s credibility abroad,\u201d the statement reads.",
      "Congress established the Fulbright program nearly 80 years ago to promote international exchange and American diplomacy. The highly selective program awards about 9,000 scholarships annually in the U.S. and in more than 160 other countries to students, scholars, and professionals in a range of fields.",
      "A message seeking comment was left with the State Department, which runs the scholarship program.",
      "The resignations were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "The intervention from the Trump administration undermined the program's merit-based selection process and its insulation from political influence, the board members wrote.",
      "\u201cWe believe these actions not only contradict the statute but are antithetical to the Fulbright mission and the values, including free speech and academic freedom, that Congress specified in the statute,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is our sincere hope that Congress, the courts, and future Fulbright Boards will prevent the administration\u2019s efforts to degrade, dismantle, or even eliminate one of our nation\u2019s most respected and valuable programs.\u201d",
      "Award recipients are selected in a yearlong process by nonpartisan staff at the State Department. The recipients who had their awards canceled are in fields including biology, engineering, medical sciences, and history, the board members said.",
      "The announcement comes as the Trump administration ratchets up scrutiny of international students on several fronts. The administration has expanded the grounds for revoking foreign students' legal status, and recently paused scheduling of new interviews for student visas as it increases vetting of their social media activity. The government also has moved to block foreign students from attending Harvard as it pressures the Ivy League school to adopt a series of reforms.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is defending his decision to order National Guard troops to provide security during immigrations raids in Los Angeles",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended his decision to order troops to provide security during federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, telling senators on Wednesday it's about \u201cmaintaining law and order.\u201d",
      "Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., condemned the move as illegal, saying it erodes military readiness and questioning how it is being funded. It was the second day of harsh congressional questioning for Hegseth on the deployment of troops over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, continued military aid to Ukraine, a deal on a gifted Qatari jet and more.",
      "\u201cThe mission in Los Angeles, as you know well, sir, is not about lethality,\u201d Hegseth said in response to questions. \u201cIt\u2019s about maintaining law and order on behalf of law enforcement agents who deserve to do their job without being attacked by mobs of people.\u201d",
      "The exchange underscored confusion about the deployment of more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to provide security at the immigration protests and operations in Los Angeles. Photos have shown Guard troops setting a security perimeter around agents as they make arrests in the city, moving them closer to law enforcement functions, which by law they are not allowed to do.",
      "About 2,000 of the Guard soldiers are in place in Los Angeles, initially sent to provide security. The Marines are at a nearby base and have not yet been used.",
      "Speaking at a Senate defense appropriations subcommittee hearing, Reed said law and order is a civil function, not a job for the U.S. military. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., added that the California deployment, along with President Donald Trump's threat to use force against protesters at the Army's 250th anniversary parade on Saturday, \u201cshould stop every one of us cold.\u201d",
      "She added that \u201cthreatening to use our own troops on our own citizens at such scale is unprecedented. It is unconstitutional. And it is downright un-American.\u201d",
      "Asked later what constitutional authority the department is using to deploy active duty Marines to the protests, Hegseth said he didn't know the specific provision but would provide it.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was testifying alongside Hegseth, was asked whether he sees evidence of \u201crebellion\u201d in the U.S. That could be used to invoke the Insurrection Act to use the military for law enforcement functions.",
      "\u201cThere are definitely some frustrated folks out there,\u201d Caine said in response.",
      "Answering the same question, Hegseth repeated Trump\u2019s argument that \u201cthere has been an invasion\u201d of migrants entering the country without legal permission, and he said the protests in Los Angeles could spread to other areas.",
      "Caine, asked if he believes the U.S. is being invaded by a foreign power, said, \u201cI don\u2019t see any foreign, state-sponsored folks invading, but I\u2019ll be mindful of the fact that there have been some border issues.\u201d",
      "Hegseth also faced bipartisan criticism for failing to provide details about the administration\u2019s first proposed defense budget and over an array of other decisions he's made during his tenure.",
      "The panel's chairman, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other senators expressed frustration that Congress has not yet gotten a full defense budget from the Trump administration and that the current level does not have the U.S. spending enough on defense.",
      "McConnell also noted that the limited budget request that lawmakers have received has no funding for Ukraine security assistance, questioning whether that makes \u201clasting peace\u201d more or less likely.",
      "Hegseth, in his opening remarks, said the department needed more time to pull a spending plan together but that he has moved quickly to kill wasteful programs and redirect funding to Trump\u2019s priorities.",
      "Hegseth said a negotiated peace in Ukraine makes America look strong, even though Russia is the aggressor. He said the budget includes hard choices and \u201creflects the reality that Europe needs to step up more for the defense of its own continent. And President Trump deserves the credit for that.\"",
      "Hegseth said some U.S. security spending for Ukraine is still in the pipeline, but he provided no details.",
      "Hegseth repeatedly refused to provide details on plans for the Defense Department to accept a 747 jet offered by Qatar for use as Air Force One. He said budgeting and schedules for security upgrades to turn the plane into the president's aircraft are classified.",
      "Hegseth confirmed reports that the Qataris have not come to an agreement with the Trump administration over a memo that would allow the military to take possession of the aircraft.",
      "That also means no contracts have been signed to move forward on overhauling the Qatari jet.",
      "He refused to answer questions on the cost or potential timeframe of that upgrade \u2014 even though data on two other 747s being reconditioned by Boeing to serve as Air Force One is public.",
      "\u201cA memorandum of understanding remains to be signed,\u201d Hegseth said.",

      "The package of 21 budget rescissions will have to be approved by both chambers of Congress for the cuts to take place, beginning with a House vote expected Thursday. Otherwise, the spending remains in place.",

Congress has traditionally provided public media with advanced funds to reduce political pressures.",

      "The administration says the $500 million rescission for infectious diseases would not reduce treatment but would \u201celiminate programs that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like \u2018family planning\u2019 and \u2018reproductive health,\u2019 LGBTQI+ activities, and equity programs.\u201d It makes a similar assurance on the HIV funding, saying it would eliminate \u201conly those programs that neither provide life-saving treatment nor support American interests.\u201d",

      "The upcoming parade in Washington to celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary has divided veterans",
      "NORFOLK, Va. -- James McDonough served in the U.S. Army for 27 years, fighting in Vietnam and delivering humanitarian aid to Rwanda. For him, Saturday\u2019s military parade in Washington for the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary \u2014 coinciding with President Donald Trump's birthday \u2014 is about the resilience of a vital institution and the nation it serves.",
      "\u201cThe soldiers marching that day represent all of that history,\u201d said McDonough, 78, of Crofton, Maryland. \u201cThey don\u2019t represent a single day. They don\u2019t represent a single person. It\u2019s the American Army still standing straight, walking tall, ready to defend our country.\u201d",
      "Christopher Purdy, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, called the parade a facade that paints over some of the Republican president\u2019s policies that have targeted military veterans and current service members, including cuts at the Department of Veterans Affairs and a ban on transgender troops.",
      "Purdy said the parade, long sought by Trump, will needlessly display U.S. military might on the president\u2019s 79th birthday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d said Purdy, 40, of Atlanta. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive. And whatever his reasons are for doing it, I think it\u2019s entirely unnecessary.\u201d",
      "Until recently, the Army\u2019s long-planned birthday celebration did not include a big parade. Added under the Trump administration, the event, featuring hundreds of military vehicles and aircraft and thousands of soldiers, has divided veterans.",
      "Some liken it to the military chest-pounding commonly seen in North Korea, a step toward authoritarianism or a perverse birthday party for Trump.",
      "Others see it as a once-in-a-lifetime accounting of the Army's achievements and the military service of millions of soldiers over centuries. The parade is not about Trump, they say, but the public seeing the faces of soldiers when so few Americans serve.",
      "The Army expects up to 200,000 people could attend and says the parade will cost an estimated $25 million to $45 million.",
      "Trump, speaking at Fort Bragg this week, said Saturday would be \u201ca big day\" and noted \"we want to show off a little bit.\"",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to celebrate our greatness and our achievements,\" he said. \"This week, we honor 250 years of valor and glory and triumph by the greatest fighting force ever to walk the face of the Earth: the United States Army.\u201d",
      "For Edmundo Eugenio Martinez Jr., an Army veteran who fought in Iraq, the parade is a missed opportunity to honor generations of veterans, many of whom paid a steep price and came home to little fanfare.",
      "\u201cSadly, the timing and the optics and divisive politics have ruined it,\u201d said Martinez, 48, of Katy, Texas. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not picking one side or the other. Both sides are guilty.\u201d",
      "Joe Plenzler, a retired Marine who fought in Iraq, said Trump wants to see troops saluting him on his birthday as tanks roll past.",
      "\u201cIt's just suspicious,\" the 53-year-old from Middletown, Virginia, said of the timing.",
      "\u201cI absolutely love the Army from the bottom of my cold black Marine heart,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the Army\u2019s birthday was a day later, we probably wouldn't be doing it. I\u2019d rather see that $50 million take care of the men and women who went off to war and came back with missing arms, legs and eyeballs, and with damaged brains.\u201d",
      "Joe Kmiech, who served in the Army and Minnesota National Guard from 1989 to 1998, supports the parade because the Army is \"part of American culture and our fabric.\u201d",
      "He notes the Army's pioneering contributions to engineering and medicine, from dams to new surgical techniques. Like many veterans, he has a strong familial connection: His father served in the Army, and so did his maternal grandfather, who fought in World War II.",
      "\u201cI didn't vote for President Trump, but the commander in chief is going to be part of that celebration,\u201d said Kmiech, 54, of Roberts, Wisconsin. \u201cThe distinction needs to be made that the parade is a celebration of our Army, not of a person.\u201d",
      "For Gulf War Army veteran Paul Sullivan, Trump and the parade are inextricably linked.",
      "\u201cThis Trump tank travesty is all about stroking Trump\u2019s ego,\u201d said Sullivan, 62, who lives outside Charlottesville, Virginia. \u201cIf Trump truly cared about our service members, he would sit down with them quietly and say, \u2018What can we do with $50 million or $100 million to make your lives better?\u2019 He\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "McDonough, the veteran from Crofton, Maryland, disagrees that the parade is about Trump or too costly. He said the U.S. held a grand celebration in New York after World War II when the nation was deeply in debt.",
      "\u201cWe certainly need to bring our debt down, and we certainly need to take care of our veterans,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a false dichotomy. It\u2019s like saying if we bought two less aircraft carriers, we could do so much better to take care of our poor.\u201d",
      "And McDonough said soldiers' oath is to the Constitution, not to Trump.",
      "The president \u201cunderstands the importance of doing this, not only for the Army, but for the nation,\u201d McDonough said.",
      "Purdy, the veteran from Atlanta, said the parade's brazen flex of military strength is not an American tradition, particularly absent a recent victory.",
      "\u201cI'm not saying we shouldn't celebrate the country,\" he said. \u201cBut for us to be projecting this type of hard power, in such a real in-your-face way, that\u2019s just not who we are.\u201d",
      "Trump is brushing aside old alliances and foreign aid that have helped maintain peace for decades, Purdy asserted.",
      "\u201cIt signals a real dark turn if we\u2019re just going to roll out the tanks,\" Purdy said.",
      "Michael Nardotti, an Army veteran who served in Vietnam, said military hardware has long been in American parades, which can help recruitment.",
      "More important, he said, is the tremendous value in the public seeing soldiers' faces in a parade when active-duty troops make up less than 1% of the population.",
      "\u201c'People are the Army,'\u201d said Nardotti, 78, of Aldie, Virginia, quoting a former Army chief of staff.",
      "Nardotti said he'll listen carefully to Trump's speech.",
      "\u201cI hope it sends the right message,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is set to take a seat at Wednesday's opening night of the award-winning musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\" at the Kennedy Center, where he replaced the previous leadership with loyalists, had himself installed as chairman and pledged to rid the performing arts venue of programming he has complained is \u201cwoke\u201d and too focused on leftist ideology and political correctness.",
      "The Republican president's attendance at the sold-out showing of the Tony Award-winning tale of redemption in 19th century France comes as he has focused more than any recent predecessor on the arts center along the Potomac River that is a memorial to a slain Democratic president.",
      "Presidents' involvement in the Kennedy Center's affairs had been limited to naming members to the board of trustees and attending the taping of its annual honors program in the fall.",
      "But after returning to office in January, Trump stunned the arts world by firing the Kennedy Center's longtime director and board and replacing them with loyalists, who then named him as chairman, and promising to overhaul its programming, management and even appearance as part of an effort to put his stamp on the national arts scene.",
      "Trump's appearance in the Opera House on Wednesday, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, will also mark his first time at a Kennedy Center performance as president. He avoided the venue after entertainment industry pushback to his policies in his first term in office, breaking with presidential tradition by never attending the annual Kennedy Center Honors taping.",
      "His moves have upset some of the center's patrons and performers.",
      "In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters.",
      "Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump's takeover, and several touring productions, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d have canceled planned runs at the center.

      "Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d cast members.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has adopted a more aggressive posture toward the arts. The White House has taken steps to cancel millions of dollars in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups, and Trump\u2019s budget blueprint proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "Trump has also targeted Smithsonian museums by signing executive orders to restrict their funding and by attempting to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery.",
      "Trump hosted the board at the White House for dinner in May and said congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250 million for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center. He claimed that \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d had been spent at the center but \u201cthey certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\u201d",
      "He characterized previous programming as \u201cout of control with rampant political propaganda\u201d and said it featured \u201csome very inappropriate shows,\u201d including a \u201cMarxist anti-police performance\u201d and \u201cLesbian-only Shakespeare.\u201d",
      "Trump cited some drag show performances as a reason to take control of the center, though next season's theater lineup includes \u201dMrs. Doubtfire,\" which tells the story of a divorced man who disguises himself as a female nanny so he can spend time with his children.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for a South Carolina death row inmate are heading to federal court to argue that the state is not properly carrying out executions",
      "Lawyers for a South Carolina death row inmate will be in federal court Wednesday trying to convince a judge that the state is not properly carrying out lethal injections or firing squad executions, an argument meant to spare the prisoner just two days before he's scheduled to die.",
      "Stephen Stanko's attorneys said the two doses of lethal injection drugs used in the past three executions by that method show those subjected to the procedure have died a lingering death, still conscious as they felt like they were drowning when fluid rushed into their lungs.",
      "Stanko changed his mind and decided to die by lethal injection because of accounts about the last firing squad death.",
      "In that April execution, the volunteer shooters nearly missed Mikal Mahdi's heart, meaning the man convicted of killing an off-duty police officer took three to four times as long to die as he was supposed to, Stanko's lawyers said in court papers.",
      "One expert hired by Stanko's attorneys said the evidence suggests the firing squad may have aimed slightly below the target or the target was not placed on Mahdi's heart to \u201ccause great pain before his death,\u201d according to court papers filed last week.",
      "Lawyers for the state vigorously denied the claims. They point out that the South Carolina Supreme Court rejected a similar last-ditch appeal on May 28. They said every execution is different and that lawyers representing incarcerated people have not proven any condemned prisoner suffered gratuitous pain.",
      "\u201cSo (perhaps) it\u2019s not the method that\u2019s the issue \u2014 instead, these inmates just don\u2019t want to have their sentences carried out and are willing to make any argument that they can,\u201d wrote Grayson Lambert, a lawyer for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster.",
      "Lawyers for the state will ask federal Judge Richard Gergel on Wednesday to dismiss the claims.",
      "Stanko would be the sixth inmate executed in South Carolina in nine months. There were originally four executions scheduled around the country this week, one in South Carolina and one each in Florida and Alabama. On Monday, an Oklahoma judge granted a temporary stay to a man scheduled to be put to death Thursday.",
      "Stanko, 57, is slated to die at 6 p.m. Friday at a Columbia prison for killing his 74-year-old friend, Henry Turner. Stanko went to Turner\u2019s Horry County home in April 2006 after lying about his father dying.",
      "Hours before killing Turner, Stanko beat and strangled his girlfriend in her Georgetown County home and raped her daughter before slashing the teen\u2019s throat. The daughter survived and testified against him at one of his trials. Stanko was also sentenced to death in that case.",
      "Stanko's lawyers, in their 49-page brief, include a number of ways their experts think South Carolina is improperly carrying out executions.",
      "They include using bullets in the firing squad that aren't powerful enough to guarantee the heart will be destroyed, failing to properly oversee how an IV line is placed for lethal injections and improper storage of the powerful sedative pentobarbital, which is used to kill inmates.",
      "The lawyers said the state is using two doses of pentobarbital in executions because \u2014 while inmates might be paralyzed by the drug \u2014 they remain conscious enough to feel like they are drowning and take longer than 10 minutes to die.",
      "Attorneys for the state said witnesses to the executions have not reported any signs of distress and said the inmates appeared to stop breathing within a minute or two.",
      "The most serious accusations in Stanko's lawsuit come from Dr. Jonathan Groner, an expert in lethal injection and other capital punishments and a surgeon who teaches at Ohio State University.",
      "\u201cI am concerned that some element of those responsible for carrying out Mr. Mahdi\u2019s execution intended not to hit his target and to cause great pain before his death,\u201d Groner wrote.",
      "State Correction Department officials deny anything went wrong in Mahdi's execution. Agency leaders have signed sworn statements saying that all three guns fired and no bullets or fragments were found in the death chamber after Mahdi's lawyers suggested one shot missed entirely.",
      "\u201cHow bullets react once they strike the body is something that neither SCDC nor the members of the firing squad can control. That one condemned inmate dies more quickly than another does not necessarily mean that something went awry in one execution,\u201d the state said.",
      "Complicating any investigation into Madhi's death is an inadequate autopsy. It did not include X-rays to allow the results to be independently verified. Only one photo was taken of Mahdi\u2019s body and there were no close-ups of the wounds. The inmate's clothing was not examined to determine where the target was placed or how it aligned with the damage the bullets caused, according to forensic pathologist Terri Haddix of California, one of the defense experts.",
      "Stanko's lawyers want to pause his execution to take a closer look at Mahdi's death and require the three firing squad members to take a sworn oath they will \u201cshoot at the target in good faith.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles police swiftly enforced a downtown curfew Tuesday night, making arrests moments after it took effect, while deploying officers on horseback and using crowd control projectiles to break up a group of hundreds demonstrating against President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "Members of the National Guard stood watch behind plastic shields, but did not appear to participate in the arrests.",
      "Hours later, many of the protesters had dispersed, although sporadic confrontations continued that were much smaller than in previous nights. Officials said the curfew was necessary to stop vandalism and theft by agitators looking to cause trouble.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier accused Trump of drawing a \u201cmilitary dragnet\u201d across the nation\u2019s second-largest city with his escalating use of the National Guard. He also deployed Marines, though none were seen on the streets Tuesday.",
      "Newsom asked a court to put an emergency stop to the military helping federal immigration agents, with some guardsmen now standing in protection around agents as they carried out arrests. He said it would only heighten tensions and promote civil unrest. The judge set a hearing for Thursday, giving the administration several days to continue those activities.",
      "The change moves troops closer to engaging in law enforcement actions like deportations as Trump has promised as part of his administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. The Guard has the authority to temporarily detain people who attack officers but any arrests ultimately would be made by law enforcement.",
      "Trump has activated more than 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines over the objections of city and state leaders. They were originally deployed to protect federal buildings.",
      "Demonstrations have spread to other cities nationwide, including Dallas and Austin, Texas, Chicago and New York, where a thousand people rallied and multiple arrests were made.",
      "In Texas, where police in Austin used chemical irritants to disperse several hundred demonstrators Monday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office said Texas National Guard troops were \u201con standby\" in areas where demonstrations are planned, Abbott spokesperson Andrew Mahaleris said Tuesday evening.",
      "Guard members were deployed to San Antonio, according to assistant police chief Jesse Salame. He said he did not know how many were sent or details on the deployment.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass declared a local emergency on the fifth day of protests and said the curfew will run from 8 p.m. Tuesday until 6 a.m. Wednesday. She said it was expected to last for several days.",
      "\u201cWe reached a tipping point\u201d after 23 businesses were looted, Bass said during a news conference Tuesday.",
      "The curfew covers a 1 square mile (2.5 square kilometer) section of downtown that includes the area where protests have occurred since Friday. The city of Los Angeles encompasses roughly 500 square miles (nearly 2,300 square kilometers).",
      "The curfew doesn\u2019t apply to residents who live in the designated area, people who are homeless, credentialed media or public safety and emergency officials, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell.",
      "McDonnell said \u201cunlawful and dangerous behavior\u201d had been escalating since Saturday.",
      "\u201cThe curfew is a necessary measure to protect lives and safeguard property following several consecutive days of growing unrest throughout the city,\u201d McDonnell said.",
      "Trump left open the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, which authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the U.S. to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations. It's one of the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We\u2019ll see,\u201d he said from the Oval Office.",
      "Later the president called protesters \u201canimals\u201d and \u201ca foreign enemy\u201d in a speech at Fort Bragg ostensibly to recognize the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army.",
      "Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth.",
      "In a public address Tuesday evening, Newsom called Trump\u2019s actions the start of an \u201cassault\u201d on democracy.",
      "\u201cCalifornia may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next,\u201d he said.",
      "Newsom warned people against inciting violence, but urged them to stand up to the president's actions.",
      "\u201cWhat Donald Trump wants most is your fealty, your silence. To be complicit in this moment,\" he said. \u201cDo not give it to him.\u201d",
      "The protests began Friday after federal immigration raids arrested dozens of workers in Los Angeles. Protesters blocked a major freeway and set cars on fire over the weekend, and police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.",
      "The demonstrations have been mostly concentrated downtown in the city of 4 million. Thousands of people have peacefully rallied outside City Hall and hundreds more protested outside a federal complex that includes a detention center where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids.",
      "Despite the protests, immigration enforcement activity has continued throughout the county, with city leaders and community groups reporting ICE present at libraries, car washes and Home Depots. School graduations in Los Angeles have increased security over fears of ICE action and some have offered parents the option to watch on Zoom.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s quest to erase his criminal conviction is heading to a federal appeals court",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump\u2019s quest to erase his criminal conviction heads to a federal appeals court Wednesday. It\u2019s one way he\u2019s trying to get last year\u2019s hush money verdict overturned.",
      "A three-judge panel is set to hear arguments in Trump's long-running fight to get the New York case moved from state court to federal court, where he could then try to have the verdict thrown out on presidential immunity grounds.",
      "The Republican is asking the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to intervene after a lower-court judge twice rejected the move. As part of the request, Trump wants the federal appeals court to seize control of the criminal case and then ultimately decide his appeal of the verdict, which is now pending in a state appellate court.",
      "The 2nd Circuit should \u201cdetermine once and for all that this unprecedented criminal prosecution of a former and current President of the United States belongs in federal court,\" Trump's lawyers wrote in a court filing.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, which prosecuted Trump\u2019s case, wants it to stay in state court. Trump\u2019s Justice Department \u2014 now partly run by his former criminal defense lawyers \u2014 backs his bid to move the case to federal court.",
      "If Trump loses, he could go to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Trump was convicted in May 2024 of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels, whose affair allegations threatened to upend his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump denies her claim and said he did nothing wrong. It was the only one of his four criminal cases to go to trial.",
      "Trump's lawyers first sought to move the case to federal court following his March 2023 indictment, arguing that federal officers including former presidents have the right to be tried in federal court for charges arising from \u201cconduct performed while in office.\u201d Part of the criminal case involved checks he wrote while he was president.",
      "They tried again after his conviction, arguing that Trump\u2019s historic prosecution violated his constitutional rights and ran afoul of the Supreme Court\u2019s presidential immunity ruling, which was decided about a month after the hush money trial ended.",
      "The ruling reins in prosecutions of ex-presidents for official acts and restricts prosecutors in pointing to official acts as evidence that a president\u2019s unofficial actions were illegal.",
      "U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein denied both requests, ruling in part that Trump\u2019s conviction involved his personal life, not his work as president.",
      "In a four-page ruling, Hellerstein wrote that nothing about the high court\u2019s ruling affected his prior conclusion that hush money payments at issue in Trump\u2019s case \u201cwere private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s lawyers argue that prosecutors rushed to trial instead of waiting for the Supreme Court\u2019s presidential immunity decision, and that prosecutors erred by showing jurors evidence that should not have been allowed under the ruling, such as former White House staffers describing how Trump reacted to news coverage of the hush money deal and tweets he sent while president in 2018.",
      "Trump\u2019s former criminal defense lawyer Todd Blanche is now the deputy U.S. attorney general, the Justice Department\u2019s second-in-command. Another of his lawyers, Emil Bove, has a high-ranking Justice Department position.",
      "The trial judge, Juan M. Merchan, rejected Trump\u2019s requests to throw out the conviction on presidential immunity grounds and sentenced him on Jan. 10 to an unconditional discharge, leaving his conviction intact but sparing him any punishment.",
      "Appearing by video at his sentencing, Trump called the case a \u201cpolitical witch hunt,\u201d \u201ca weaponization of government\u201d and \u201can embarrassment to New York.\u201d",

      "Survivors and family members of the Pulse nightclub massacre nine years ago are getting a chance to walk through the long-shuttered, gay-friendly venue this week",
      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Survivors and family members of the 49 victims killed in the Pulse nightclub massacre nine years ago are getting their first chance Wednesday to walk through the long-shuttered, LGBTQ+-friendly Florida venue before it's razed and replaced with a permanent memorial to what was once the worst U.S. mass shooting in modern times.",
      "In small groups over four days, survivors and family members of those killed planned to spend a half hour inside the space where Omar Mateen opened fire during a Latin night celebration on June 12, 2016, leaving 49 dead and 53 wounded. Mateen, who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, was killed after a three-hour standoff with police.",
      "At the time, it was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The Pulse shooting\u2019s death toll was surpassed the following year when 58 people were killed and more than 850 injured among a crowd of 22,000 at a country music festival in Las Vegas.",
      "The city of Orlando purchased the Pulse property in 2023 for $2 million and plans to build a $12 million permanent memorial which will open in 2027. Those efforts follow a multiyear, botched attempt by a private foundation run by the club's former owner. The existing structure will be razed later this year.",
      "\u201cNone of us thought that it would take nine years to get to this point and we can\u2019t go back and relitigate all of the failures along the way that have happened, but what we can do is control how we move forward together,\" Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings said two weeks ago when county commissioners pledged $5 million to support the city of Orlando\u2019s plan.",
      "The opportunity to go inside the nightclub comes on the ninth anniversary of the mass shooting. Outside, over-sized photos of the victims, rainbow-colored flags and flowers have hung on fences in a makeshift memorial, and the site has attracted visitors from around the globe. But very few people other than investigators have been inside the structure.",
      "Around 250 survivors and family members of those killed have responded to the city's invitation to walk through the nightclub this week. Families of the 49 people who were killed can visit the site with up to six people in their group, and survivors can bring one person with them.",
      "The people invited to visit are being given the chance to ask FBI agents who investigated the massacre about what happened. They won't be allowed to take photos or video inside.",
      "Brandon Wolf, who hid in a bathroom as the gunman opened fire, said he wasn't going to visit, primarily because he now lives in Washington. He said he wanted to remember Pulse as it was before.",
      "\u201cI will say that the site of the tragedy is where I feel closest to the people who were stolen from me,\u201d said Wolf, who now is national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, a LGBTQ+ advocacy group. \u201cFor survivors, the last time they were in that space was the worst night possible. It will be really hard to be in that space again.\u201d",
      "Mental health counselors planned to be on hand to talk to those who walk through the building.",
      "Survivors and family members had hoped to have a permanent memorial in place by now. But an earlier effort by a private foundation to build one floundered, and the organization disbanded in 2023.",
      "Barbara and Rosario Poma and businessman Michael Panaggio previously owned the property, and Barbara Poma was the executive director of the onePulse Foundation \u2014 the nonprofit that had been leading efforts to build a memorial and museum. She stepped down as executive director in 2022 and then left the organization entirely in 2023 amid criticism that she wanted to sell instead of donate the property. There were also complaints about the lack of progress despite millions of dollars being raised.",
      "The original project, unveiled in 2019 by the onePulse Foundation, called for a museum and permanent memorial costing $45 million. That estimate eventually soared to $100 million. The city of Orlando has since outlined a more modest proposal and scrapped plans for a museum.",
      "\u201cThe building may come down, and we may finally get, a permanent memorial, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that this community has been scarred for life,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThere are people inside the community who still need and will continue to need support and resources.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Jurors in Harvey Weinstein'ssex crimes retrial are drilling down on one of the three charges against him: a rape accusation from a woman who also said she had a consensual relationship with him.",
      "The seven female and five male jurors started their fifth day of deliberations Wednesday by re-hearing Jessica Mann's testimony that he raped her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Mann's accusation was an apparent focus of Tuesday\u2019s deliberations, and the jury ended the day by asking to be re-read her testimony about what happened between her and Weinstein at the hotel. The group also indicated it wanted to continue privately reviewing her emails with Weinstein and some 2017 medical records concerning her reaction to news accounts of other women\u2019s allegations against him.",
      "Some jurors appeared to take fresh notes Wednesday, while others sat impassively as court stenographers read aloud the requested parts of Mann's days-long testimony. The jury had already reheard some of the passages last week.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to raping Mann and to forcing oral sex on two other women, Mimi Haley and Kaja Sokola. The Oscar-winning producer and former Hollywood powerbroker maintains that he never sexually assaulted or raped anyone, and his lawyers portrayed his accusers as opportunists who accepted his advances because they wanted a leg up in the entertainment world.",
      "While all three women stayed in contact with Weinstein despite what they say were assaults, Mann had a particularly complex history with him. She testified that they had a consensual relationship that exploded into rape, yet continued afterward.",
      "Weinstein was one of the movie industry\u2019s most powerful figures until a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and eventually leading to criminal charges.",
      "He originally was convicted in 2020 of raping Mann and forcing oral sex on Haley. Sokola\u2019s allegation was added last year, after New York state\u2019s highest court overturned the 2020 conviction and sent the case back for retrial. Meanwhile, Weinstein is appealing a 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.",
      "After a couple of days of apparent interpersonal friction, the retrial jury worked through Tuesday with no further complaints.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted. Sokola, Mann and Haley have agreed to be named.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Jacob Vasquez began working at a clothing warehouse in Los Angeles soon after arriving from Mexico less than three years ago.",
      "He is among dozens of workers detained by federal immigration authorities in a series of raids in LA\u2019s fashion district and at Home Depot parking lots in Southern California. More than 100 people have been detained.",
      "The raids have triggered days of turbulent protests across the city and beyond and led President Donald Trump to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to the LA area, the latest development in the administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. Protests in the city\u2019s downtown have ranged from peaceful to raucous, with demonstrators blocking a major freeway and setting cars on fire over the weekend.",
      "Immigrant advocates say the workers who were detained do not have criminal histories and are being denied their due process rights.",
      "Vasquez has a three-month-old baby, according to his family who spoke to reporters outside the Ambiance Apparel warehouse, a clothing company founded in 1999, and where the young father worked.",
      "\u201cJacob is a family man and the sole breadwinner of his household,\u201d said his brother Gabriel, speaking in Spanish during a news conference Monday. He doesn't know if he\u2019s OK, he later said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass denounced the raids and the deployment of troops, saying Tuesday that the actions were aimed at intimidating the area's vast immigrant population, one of the country's largest. She said she has heard even immigrants with legal status are being swept up and that the raids may continue for months.",
      "An estimated 950,000 people in Los Angeles County do not have legal immigration status, according to the Migration Policy Institute. That is about a tenth of the county's population, and they include cooks, nannies, hotel employees, street vendors, gardeners, construction workers and garment workers.",
      "\u201cFamilies across the city are terrified,\" Bass said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know if they should go to work, they don\u2019t know if they should go to school.\u201d",
      "She said many of those detained have had no contact with their loved ones or lawyers. The raids have only fueled unrest in the city, Bass said.",
      "\u201cThey were going to go after violent felons, drug dealers, and I don\u2019t know how that matches with the scenes that we saw of people outside Home Depot running through the parking lot, because they were afraid that they were going to get arrested,\" she said.",
      "Sara\u00ed Ortiz said her father, Jose, worked for Ambiance for 18 years. \u201cIt was really painful to see him arrested on Friday with his co-workers,\u201d she told the crowd in Spanish.",
      "A judge signed a search warrant that there was probable cause to conclude that Ambiance was using fake documents for some workers, said Ciaran McEvoy, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Los Angeles. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not shared details about the arrests.",
      "\u201cAmbience Apparel has never created any fictitious documents for its workers,\" Benjamin N. Gluck, an attorney representing the company, said in a statement. \"The company obeys, and continues to obey, all applicable laws. We support our workforce, many of whom have worked faithfully for the company for decades.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration did not respond to emails from The Associated Press asking about whether any of the immigrants detained in the raids had criminal records.",
      "Los Angeles is one of the nation\u2019s largest garment-production hubs with more than 45,000 workers, mostly Latino and Asian immigrants, who cut, sew and finish the clothing, according to the Garment Worker Center.",
      "The raids are deepening fears far beyond LA and even among those who are in the country legally, immigrants said. Jot Condie, president and chief executive of the California Restaurant Association, said the fear is keeping away workers and hurting businesses. In LA County last year, food and drink services were a $30 billion industry.",
      "Outside a Home Depot in Santa Ana, California, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles, a handful of day laborers leaned against their cars waiting to be hired Tuesday, a day after armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers drove up and sent many of the workers running.",

      "\u201cThey came out with guns, (saying) \u2018don\u2019t move,' \u2019\u2019 Ortega said in Spanish. By then, the Honduran citizen who has lived nearly three decades in the U.S. said he had already taken out his green card to avoid making any sudden moves should agents approach him.",

    "story": [
      "Big changes are being are being proposed to a food aid program as part of President Donald Trump's tax-cut legislation",
      "President Donald Trump's plan to cut taxes by trillions of dollars could also trim billions in spending from social safety net programs, including food aid for lower-income people.",
      "The proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would make states pick up more of the costs, require several million more recipients to work or lose their benefits, and potentially reduce the amount of food aid people receive in the future.",
      "The legislation, which narrowly passed the U.S. House, could undergo further changes in the Senate, where it's currently being debated. Trump wants lawmakers to send the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d to his desk by July 4, when the nation marks the 249th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Here's a look at the food aid program, by the numbers:",
      "The federal aid program formerly known as food stamps was renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, on Oct. 1, 2008. The program provides monthly payments for food purchases to low-income residents generally earning less than $1,632 monthly for individuals, or $3,380 monthly for a household of four.",
      "The nation\u2019s first experiment with food stamps began in 1939. But the modern version of the program dates to 1979, when a change in federal law took effect eliminating a requirement that participants purchase food stamps. There currently is no cost to people participating in the program.",
      "A little over 42 million people nationwide received SNAP benefits in February, the latest month for which figures are available. That's roughly one out of every eight people in the county. Participation is down from a peak average of 47.6 million people during the 2013 federal fiscal year.",
      "Often, more than one person in a household is eligible for food aid. As of February, nearly 22.5 million households were enrolled in SNAP, receiving an average monthly household benefit of $353. The money can be spent on most groceries, but Trump's administration recently approved requests by six states \u2014 Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Utah \u2014 to exclude certain items, such as soda or candy.",
      "Legislation passed by the House is projected to cut about $295 billion of federal spending from SNAP over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "A little more than half of those federal savings would come by shifting costs to states, which administer SNAP. Nearly one-third of those savings would come by expanding a work requirement for some SNAP participants, which the CBO assumes would force some people off the rolls. Additional money would be saved by eliminating SNAP benefits for between 120,000 and 250,000 immigrants legally in the U.S. who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents.",
      "Another provision in the legislation would cap the annual inflationary growth in food benefits. As a result, the CBO estimates that the average monthly food benefit would be about $15 lower than it otherwise would have been by 2034.",
      "To receive SNAP benefits, current law says adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents need to work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don't do so are limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation that passed the House would expand work requirements to those ages 55 through 64. It also would extend work requirements to some parents without children younger than age 7. And it would limit the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas that lack sufficient jobs.",
      "The combined effect of those changes is projected by the CBO to reduce SNAP participation by a monthly average of 3.2 million people.",
      "The federal government currently splits the administrative costs of SNAP with states but covers the full cost of food benefits. Under the legislation, states would have to cover three-fourths of the administrative costs. States also would have to pay a portion of the food benefits starting with the 2028 fiscal year.",
      "All states would be required to pay at least 5% of the food aid benefits, and could pay more depending on how often they make mistakes with people\u2019s payments.",
      "States that had payment error rates between 6-8% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which data is available would have to cover 15% of the food costs. States with error rates between 8-10% would have to cover 20% of the food benefits, and those with error rates greater than 10% would have to cover 25% of the food costs.",
      "Many states could get hit with higher costs. The national error rate stood at 11.7% in the 2023 fiscal year, and just three states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota and Vermont \u2014 had error rates below 5%. But the 2023 figures are unlikely to serve as the base year, so the exact costs to states remains unclear.",
      "As a result of the cost shift, the CBO assumes that some states would reduce or eliminate benefits for people.",
      "House Resolution 1, containing the SNAP changes and tax cuts, passed the House last month by a margin of just one vote \u2014 215-214.",
      "A vote also could be close in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats. Democrats did not support the bill in the House and are unlikely to do so in the Senate. Some Republican senators have expressed reservations about proposed cuts to food aid and Medicaid and the potential impact of the bill on the federal deficit. GOP Senate leaders may have to make some changes to the bill to ensure enough support to pass it.",

      "Details of the accident, which the newspaper said occurred in Lewis County in north-central West Virginia, weren\u2019t immediately released. An operator who answered the telephone for the Lewis County state police office said she had no further information.",
      "Skaff served in the supermajority-Republican state House of Delegates for nearly 11 nonconsecutive years representing Kanawha County. He resigned his seat in 2023 and switched to the GOP before a failed campaign for secretary of state in 2024.",

      "\u201cI am heartbroken to hear about the passing of our friend Doug Skaff,\u201d Gov.

He will be greatly missed by many.\u201d",
      "Skaff is survived by his wife and three sons.",
      "\u201cDoug Skaff was more than just a colleague; he was a friend to many of us, even after he left the legislature,\" West Virginia Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin said in a statement. \u201cHis humor was infectious, and his dedication to his family, particularly his love for his children, was evident in everything he did.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Seven Army bases whose names were changed in 2023 because they honored Confederate leaders are all reverting back to their original names, the Army said Tuesday.",
      "The announcement came just hours after President Donald Trump previewed the decision, telling troops at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, that he was changing the names back. Fort Bragg, which was changed to Fort Liberty by the Biden administration, was the first to have its original name restored after the Army found another person with the same last name. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was with Trump at Fort Bragg, signed an order restoring the name in February.",
      "\u201cCan you believe they changed that name in the last administration for a little bit?\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll forget all about that.\u201d",
      "In March, Hegseth reversed the decision changing Fort Benning in Georgia to Fort Moore.",
      "To restore the original names of the additional seven bases, the Army once again found service members with the same last names to honor. Those bases are Fort A.P. Hill, Fort Pickett and Fort Robert E. Lee in Virginia, Fort Gordon in Georgia, Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Polk in Louisiana and Fort Rucker in Alabama.",
      "The decision strips names chosen in 2023 to honor top leaders, such as President Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as Black soldiers and women. No women are included in the new Army list.",
      "There was no immediate cost estimate for changing all the signs at the bases, just two years after they were revamped.",
      "Originally it was named after Confederate Gen. Ambrose P. Hill, before being renamed Fort Walker after Mary Edwards Walker, a doctor who treated soldiers in the Civil War and later received a Medal of Honor.",
      "Now it will be named to commemorate three different people: Medal of Honor recipients Lt. Col. Edward Hill, 1st Sgt. Robert A. Pinn and Pvt. Bruce Anderson for heroism during the Civil War.",
      "Fort Pickett was changed to Fort Barfoot in honor of Tech Sgt. Van Barfoot, a Medal of Honor recipient who served in World War II.",
      "It will now honor 1st Lt. Vernon W. Pickett. He received the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism during World War II when he fired grenades while pinned down by enemy machine gun fire and destroyed enemy positions. He was captured, then escaped and rejoined his unit, but was killed in action.",
      "Fort Lee was changed to a hyphenated name, Fort Gregg-Adams, and was the only one to commemorate someone who remained alive at the time \u2014 Lt. Gen. Arthur J. Gregg. He was known as a logistics leader and died last year. Lt. Col. Charity Adams \u2014 the other half of the name \u2014 led the first female Black unit of the Army deployed in World War II.",
      "Fort Lee will now be named for Pvt. Fitz Lee, who received the Medal of Honor for heroism during the Spanish-American War, when he moved under fire to rescue wounded comrades.",
      "Fort Gordon was changed to Fort Eisenhower to commemorate the former president's time leading Allied forces in Europe in World War II.",
      "It will now be named for Medal of Honor recipient Master Sgt. Gary I. Gordon. He was honored for his valor during the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia, where he defended wounded crew members at a helicopter crash site and held off an advancing enemy force.",
      "Fort Hood was changed to Fort Cavazos in honor of Gen. Richard Cavazos, the Army\u2019s first Hispanic four-star, who served in the Korean War and got the Distinguished Service Cross.",
      "It will now honor Col. Robert B. Hood. He received the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism during World War I, when he directed artillery fire in France.",
      "Fort Polk was changed to Fort Johnson after Black Medal of Honor recipient Sgt. William Henry Johnson, who served in World War I.",
      "It will now honor Silver Star recipient Gen. James H. Polk. Then-Col. Polk was honored for gallantry during World War II, when he led reconnaissance and combat missions under fire. He later served as head of U.S. Army Europe.",
      "Fort Rucker was named Fort Novosel after Medal of Honor recipient Chief Warrant Officer Michael Novosel, who served in World War II and Vietnam.",
      "It will now honor Capt. Edward W. Rucker. He received the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism in World War I when he flew deep behind enemy lines in a daring air battle over France.",

      "Lawyers for President Donald Trump\u2019s administration say he has the authority to abolish national monuments meant to protect historical and archaeological sites",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- Lawyers for President Donald Trump's administration say he has the authority to abolish national monuments meant to protect historical and archaeological sites across broad landscapes, including two in California created by his predecessor at the request of Native American tribes.",
      "A Justice Department legal opinion released Tuesday disavowed a 1938 determination that monuments created by previous presidents under the Antiquities Act can't be revoked. The department said presidents can cancel monument designations if protections aren't warranted.",
      "The finding comes as the Interior Department under Trump weighs changes to monuments across the nation as part of the administration's push to expand U.S. energy production.",
      "Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Natural Resources Committee, said that at Trump's order, \u201chis Justice Department is attempting to clear a path to erase national monuments.\"",
      "Trump in his first term reduced the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante National Monuments in Utah, calling them a \u201cmassive land grab.\" He also lifted fishing restrictions within a sprawling marine monument off the New England Coast.",
      "Former President Joe Biden reversed the moves and restored the monuments.",
      "The two monuments singled out in the newly released Justice Department opinion were designated by Biden in his final days in office: Chuckwalla National Monument, in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park, and S\u00e1tt\u00edtla Highlands National Monument, in Northern California.",
      "The Democrat's declarations for the monuments barred oil and natural gas drilling and mining on the 624,000-acre (2,400-square-kilometer) Chuckwalla site, and the roughly 225,000 acres (800 square kilometers) S\u00e1tt\u00edtla Highlands site near the California-Oregon border.",
      "Chuckwalla has natural wonders including the Painted Canyon of Mecca Hills and Alligator Rock, and is home to rare species of plants and animals like the desert bighorn sheep and the Chuckwalla lizard. The S\u00e1tt\u00edtla Highlands include the ancestral homelands of the Pit River Tribe and Modoc Peoples.",
      "All but three presidents have used the 1906 Antiquities Act to protect unique landscapes and cultural resources. About half the national parks in the U.S. were first designated as monuments.",
      "But critics of monument designations under Biden and Obama say the protective boundaries were stretched too far, hindering mining for critical minerals.",
      "Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lanora Pettit wrote in the Trump administration opinion that Biden's protections of Chuckwalla and the Satt\u00edtla Highlands were part of the Democrat's attempts to create for himself an environmental legacy that includes more places to hike, bike, camp or hunt.",
      "\"Such activities are entirely expected in a park, but they are wholly unrelated to (if not outright incompatible with) the protection of scientific or historical monuments,\" Pettit wrote.",
      "Trump in April lifted commercial fishing prohibitions within an expansive marine monument in the Pacific Ocean created under former President Barack Obama.",
      "Environmental groups said Tuesday's Justice Department opinion doesn't give him the authority to shrink monuments at will.",
      "\u201cAmericans overwhelmingly support our public lands and oppose seeing them dismantled or destroyed,\u201d said Axie Navas with The Wilderness Society.",
      "Biden established 10 new monuments, among them the site of a 1908 race riot in Springfield, Illinois, and another on a sacred Native American site near the Grand Canyon.",
      "Since 1912, presidents have issued more than a dozen proclamations that diminished monuments, according to a National Park Service database.",
      "Dwight Eisenhower was most active in undoing the proclamations of his predecessors as he diminished six monuments, including Arches in Utah, Great Sand Dunes in Colorado and Glacier Bay in Alaska, which have all since become national parks.",
      "Trump's moves to shrink the Utah monuments in his first term were challenged by environmental groups that said protections for the sites safeguard water supplies and wildlife while preserving cultural sites.",
      "The reductions were reversed by Biden before the case was resolved, and it remains pending.",
      "President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act after lobbying by educators and scientists who wanted to protect sites from artifact looting and haphazard collecting by individuals. It was the first law in the U.S. to establish legal protections for cultural and natural resources of historic or scientific interest on federal lands.",

      "The Chelan County Sheriff's office said in a Facebook post Tuesday that tracking teams responded immediately, and a helicopter crew spotted a hiker near Colchuk Lake, in a popular Cascade Range backpacking area called The Enchantments.",
      "The off-trail hiker ran from sight as the helicopter passed, the sheriff's office said. Teams later found a trail, and K-9 teams tracked the person to the area of the Ingalls Creek Trailhead, south of Leavenworth.",
      "Authorities did not say when they spotted the subject, but late Monday night they issued an alert for residents in the Ingalls Creek and the Valleyhi community to lock homes and vehicles and to be on the lookout for Decker.",
      "Decker, 32, has been the target of a large manhunt ever since June 2, when a sheriff's deputy found his truck and the bodies of his three daughters \u2014 9-year-old Paityn Decker, 8-year-old Evelyn Decker and 5-year-old Olivia Decker \u2014 at a campground outside Leavenworth.",
      "He had failed to return the girls to their mother's home in Wenatchee, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Seattle, following a scheduled visit three days earlier.",
      "Decker was an infantryman in the U.S. Army from March 2013 to July 2021 and deployed to Afghanistan for four months in 2014. He has training in navigation, survival and other skills, authorities said. He once spent more than two months living in the backwoods off the grid.",
      "Officials with an array of state and federal agencies have searched hundreds of square miles, much of it mountainous and remote, by land, water and air. The U.S. Marshals Service was offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to his capture.",
      "Last September, his ex-wife, Whitney Decker, wrote in a petition to modify their parenting plan that his mental health issues had worsened and that he had become increasingly unstable, often living out of his truck. She sought to restrict him from having overnight visits with their daughters until he found housing.",
      "An autopsy on Friday determined the cause of death to be suffocation, the sheriff\u2019s office said. The girls had been bound with zip ties and had plastic bags placed over their heads.",

LaMonica McIver was indicted Tuesday on federal charges alleging she assaulted and interfered with immigration officers outside a New Jersey detention center while Newark\u2019s mayor was being arrested after he tried to join a congressional oversight visit at the facility.",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba announced the grand jury indictment in a post on X.",
      "\u201cWhile people are free to express their views for or against particular policies, they must not do so in a manner that endangers law enforcement and the communities those officers serve,\u201d Habba said.",
      "In a statement, McIver said the charges amounted to the Trump administration trying to scare her.",
      "\u201cThe facts of this case will prove I was simply doing my job and will expose these proceedings for what they are: a brazen attempt at political intimidation,\u201d she said.",
      "McIver, a Democrat, was charged in a complaint by Habba last month with two assault charges stemming from the May 9 visit to Newark\u2019s Delaney Hall \u2014 a 1,000-bed, privately owned facility that Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses as a detention center.",
      "The indictment includes three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Habba said two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. A third has a maximum sentence of one year.",
      "McIver's lawyer, former U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Paul Fishman, said in a statement that they would challenge the allegations \u201chead-on\u201d in court.",
      "\u201cThe legal process will expose this prosecution for what it truly is -- political retaliation against a dedicated public servant who refuses to shy away from her oversight responsibilities,\u201d Fishman said.",
      "The indictment is the latest development in a legal-political drama that has seen President Donald Trump\u2019s administration take Democratic officials from New Jersey\u2019s largest city to court, tapping into the president\u2019s immigration crackdown and Democrats\u2019 efforts to respond. The prosecution of McIver is a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress for allegations other than fraud or corruption.",
      "At the same visit that resulted in McIver\u2019s charges, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested on a trespassing charge, which was later dropped. Baraka is suing Habba over what he said was a malicious prosecution.",
      "A nearly two-minute clip released by the Homeland Security Department shows McIver on the facility side of a chain-link fence just before the arrest of the mayor on the street side of the fence, where other people had been protesting. She and uniformed officials go through the gate, and she joins others shouting that they should circle the mayor. The video shows McIver in a tightly packed group of people and officers. At one point, her left elbow and then her right elbow push into an officer wearing a dark face covering and an olive green uniform emblazoned with the word \u201cPolice\u201d on it.",
      "It isn\u2019t clear from police bodycam video whether that contact was intentional, incidental or a result of jostling in the chaotic scene.",
      "The complaint says she \u201cslammed\u201d her forearm into an agent then tried to restrain the agent by grabbing him.",
      "The indictment says she placed her arms around the mayor to block his arrest and repeats the charges that she slammed her forearm into an agent and grabbed the agent.",
      "New Jersey Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez had joined McIver at the detention center that day. They and other Democrats have criticized the arrest and disputed the charges as well.",
      "By law, members of Congress are authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a 2019 appropriations bill that spelled out the authority.",
      "McIver, 38, first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. left a vacancy in the 10th District.",
      "She was then elected to a full term in November. A Newark native, she served as the president of the Newark City Council from 2022 to 2024 and worked in the city\u2019s public schools before that.",

    "summary": "Brian Wilson was one of the world's most influential recording artists.",
    "story": [
      "Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys' visionary and fragile leader whose genius for melody, arrangements and wide-eyed self-expression inspired \"Good Vibrations,\" \"California Girls\" and other summertime anthems and made him one of the world's most influential recording artists, has died, his family said in a statement posted to his website and social media. He was 82.",
      "\"We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved father Brian Wilson has passed away,\" the family said in Wednesday's statement. \"We are at a loss for words right now. Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world.\"",
      "Further details weren't immediately available. Since May 2024, Wilson had been under a court conservatorship to oversee his personal and medical affairs, with Wilson's longtime representatives, publicist Jean Sievers and manager LeeAnn Hard, in charge.",
      "The eldest and last surviving of three musical brothers \u2014 Brian played bass, Carl lead guitar and Dennis drums \u2014 he and his fellow Beach Boys rose in the 1960s from local California band to national hitmakers to international ambassadors of surf and sun. Wilson himself was celebrated for his gifts and pitied for his demons. He was one of rock's great Romantics, a tormented man who in his peak years embarked on an ever-steeper path to aural perfection, the one true sound.",
      "\"It is indeed hard to talk about the influence of Brian Wilson just on music because he is a shaper of American myth and American culture,\" Joe Levy, a contributor to Rolling Stone and Billboard, told CBS News following the news of Wilson's death. \"Our popular ideas about California \u2014 a land of surf and sun \u2014 many of them come from Beach Boys songs.\"",
      "The Beach Boys rank among the most popular groups of the rock era, with more than 30 singles in the Top 40 and worldwide sales of more than 100 million. The 1966 album \"Pet Sounds\" was voted No. 2 in a 2003 Rolling Stone list of the best 500 albums, losing out, as Wilson had done before, to the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\" The Beach Boys, who also featured Wilson cousin Mike Love and childhood friend Al Jardine, were voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.",
      "Wilson feuded with Love over songwriting credits, but peers otherwise adored him beyond envy, from Elton John and Bruce Springsteen to Smokey Robinson and Carole King. The Who's drummer, Keith Moon, fantasized about joining the Beach Boys. Paul McCartney cited \"Pet Sounds\" as a direct inspiration on the Beatles and the ballad \"God Only Knows\" as among his favorite songs, often bringing him to tears.",
      "Wilson moved and fascinated fans and musicians long after he stopped having hits. In his later years, Wilson and a devoted entourage of younger musicians performed \"Pet Sounds\" and his restored opus, \"Smile,\" before worshipful crowds in concert halls. Meanwhile, The Go-Go's, Lindsey Buckingham, Animal Collective and Janelle Mon\u00e1e were among a wide range of artists who emulated him, whether as a master of crafting pop music or as a pioneer of pulling it apart.",
      "An endless summer",
      "The Beach Boys' music was like an ongoing party, with Wilson as host and wallflower. He was a tall, shy man, partially deaf (allegedly because of beatings by his father, Murry Wilson), with a sweet, crooked grin, and he rarely touched a surfboard unless a photographer was around. But out of the lifestyle that he observed and such musical influences as Chuck Berry and the Four Freshmen, he conjured a golden soundscape \u2014 sweet melodies, shining harmonies, vignettes of beaches, cars and girls \u2014 that resonated across time and climates.",
      "Decades after its first release, a Beach Boys song can still conjure instant summer \u2014 the wake-up guitar riff that opens \"Surfin' USA\"; the melting vocals of \"Don't Worry Baby\"; the chants of \"fun, fun, fun\" or \"good, good, GOOD, good vibrations\"; the behind-the-wheel chorus \"'Round, 'round, get around, I get around.\" Beach Boys songs have endured from turntables and transistor radios to boom boxes and iPhones, or any device that could lay on a beach towel or be placed upright in the sand.",
      "The band's innocent appeal survived the group's increasingly troubled backstory, whether Brian's many personal trials, the feuds and lawsuits among band members or the alcoholism of Dennis Wilson, who drowned in 1983. Brian Wilson's ambition raised the Beach Boys beyond the pleasures of their early hits and into a world transcendent, eccentric and destructive. They seemed to live out every fantasy, and many nightmares, of the California myth they helped create.",
      "From the suburbs to the national stage",
      "Brian Wilson was born June 20, 1942, two days after McCartney. His musical gifts were soon obvious, and as a boy he was playing piano and teaching his brothers to sing harmony. The Beach Boys started as a neighborhood act, rehearsing in Brian's bedroom and in the garage of their house in suburban Hawthorne, California. Surf music, mostly instrumental in its early years, was catching on locally: Dennis Wilson, the group's only real surfer, suggested they cash in. Brian and Love hastily wrote up their first single, \"Surfin,'\" a minor hit released in 1961.",
      "They wanted to call themselves the Pendletones, in honor of a popular flannel shirt they wore in early publicity photos. But when they first saw the pressings for \"Surfin,'\" they discovered the record label had tagged them \"The Beach Boys.\" Other decisions were handled by their father, a musician of some frustration who hired himself as manager and holy terror. By mid-decade, Murry Wilson had been displaced and Brian, who had been running the band's recording sessions almost from the start, was in charge, making the Beach Boys the rare group of the time to work without an outside producer.",
      "Their breakthrough came in early 1963 with \"Surfin' USA,\" so closely modeled on Berry's \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" that Berry successfully sued to get a songwriting credit. It was their first Top 10 hit and a boast to the nation: \"If everybody had an ocean / across the USA / then everybody'd be surfin,' / like Cali-for-nye-ay.\" From 1963-66, they were rarely off the charts, hitting No. 1 with \"I Get Around\" and \"Help Me, Rhonda\" and narrowly missing with \"California Girls\" and \"Fun, Fun, Fun.\" For television appearances, they wore candy-striped shirts and grinned as they mimed their latest hit, with a hot rod or surfboard nearby.",
      "Their music echoed private differences. Wilson often contrasted his own bright falsetto with Love's nasal, deadpan tenor. The extroverted Love was out front on the fast songs, but when it was time for a slow one, Brian took over. \"The Warmth of the Sun\" was a song of despair and consolation that Wilson alleged \u2014 to some skepticism \u2014   he wrote the morning after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. \"Don't Worry Baby,\" a ballad equally intoxicating and heartbreaking, was a leading man's confession of doubt and dependence, an early sign of Brian's crippling anxieties.",
      "Stress and exhaustion led to a breakdown in 1964 and his retirement from touring, his place soon filled by Bruce Johnston, who remained with the group for decades. Wilson was an admirer of Phil Spector's \"Wall of Sound\" productions and emulated him on Beach Boys tracks, adding sleigh bells to \"Dance, Dance, Dance\" or arranging a mini-theme park of guitar, horns, percussion and organ as the overture to \"California Girls.\"",
      "By the mid-1960s, the Beach Boys were being held up as the country's answer to the Beatles, a friendly game embraced by each group, transporting pop music to the level of \"art\" and leaving Wilson a broken man.",
      "The Beach Boys vs. the Beatles",
      "The Beatles opened with \"Rubber Soul,\" released in late 1965 and their first studio album made without the distractions of movies or touring. It was immediately praised as a major advance, the lyrics far more personal and the music far more subtle and sophisticated than such earlier hits as \"She Loves You\" and \"A Hard Day's Night.\" Wilson would recall getting high and listening to the record for the first time, promising himself he would not only keep up with the British band, but top them.",
      "Wilson worked for months on what became \"Pet Sounds,\" and months on the single \"Good Vibrations.\" He hired an outside lyricist, Tony Asher, and used various studios, with dozens of musicians and instruments ranging from violins to bongos to the harpsichord. The air seemed to cool on some tracks and the mood turn reflective, autumnal. From \"I Know There's an Answer\" to \"You Still Believe in Me,\" many of the songs were ballads, reveries, brushstrokes of melody, culminating in the sonic wonders of \"Good Vibrations,\" a psychedelic montage that at times sounded as if recorded in outer space.",
      "The results were momentous, yet disappointing. \"Good Vibrations\" was the group's first million-seller and \"Pet Sounds,\" which included the hits \"Sloop John B\" and \"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\" awed McCartney, John Lennon and Eric Clapton among others. Widely regarded as a new kind of rock LP, it was more suited to headphones than to the radio, a \"concept\" album in which individual songs built to a unified experience, so elaborately crafted in the studio that \"Pet Sounds\" couldn't be replicated live with the technology of the time. Wilson was likened not just to the Beatles, but to Mozart and George Gershwin, whose \"Rhapsody in Blue\" had inspired him since childhood.",
      "But the album didn't chart as highly as previous Beach Boys releases and was treated indifferently by the U.S. record label, Capitol. The Beatles, meanwhile, were absorbing lessons from the Beach Boys and teaching some in return. \"Revolver\" and \"Sgt. Pepper,\" the Beatles' next two albums, drew upon the Beach Boys' vocal tapestries and melodic bass lines and even upon the animal sounds from the title track of \"Pet Sounds.\" The Beatles' epic \"A Day in the Life\" reconfirmed the British band as kings of the pop world and \"Sgt. Pepper\" as the album to beat.",
      "All eyes turned to Wilson and his intended masterpiece \u2014 a \"teenage symphony to God\" he called \"Smile.\" It was a whimsical cycle of songs on nature and American folklore written with lyricist Van Dyke Parks. The production bordered on method acting; for a song about fire, Wilson wore a fire helmet in the studio. The other Beach Boys were confused, and strained to work with him. A shaken Wilson delayed \"Smile,\" then canceled it.",
      "Remnants, including the songs \"Heroes and Villains\" and \"Wind Chimes\" were re-recorded and issued in September 1967 on \"Smiley Smile,\" dismissed by Carl Wilson as a \"bunt instead of a grand slam.\" The stripped down \"Wild Honey,\" released three months later, became a critical favorite but didn't restore the band's reputation. The Beach Boys soon descended into an oldies act, out of touch with the radical '60s, and Wilson withdrew into seclusion.",
      "Years of struggle, and late life validation",
      "Addicted to drugs and psychologically helpless, sometimes idling in a sandbox he had built in his living room, Wilson didn't fully produce another Beach Boys record for years. Their biggest hit of the 1970s was a greatest hits album, \"Endless Summer,\" that also helped reestablish them as popular concert performers.",
      "Although well enough in the 21st century to miraculously finish \"Smile\" and tour and record again, Wilson had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and baffled interviewers with brief and disjointed answers. Among the stranger episodes of Wilson's life was his relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy, a psychotherapist accused of holding a Svengali-like power over him. A 1991 lawsuit from Wilson's family blocked Landy from Wilson's personal and business affairs.",
      "His first marriage, to singer Marilyn Rovell, ended in divorce and he became estranged from daughters Carnie and Wendy, who would help form the pop trio Wilson Phillips. His life stabilized in 1995 with his marriage to Melinda Ledbetter, who gave birth to two more daughters, Daria and Delanie. He also reconciled with Carnie and Wendy and they sang together on the 1997 album \"The Wilsons.\" (Melinda Ledbetter died in 2024.)",
      "In 1992, Brian Wilson eventually won a $10 million out-of-court settlement for lost songwriting royalties. But that victory and his 1991 autobiography, \"Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story,\" set off other lawsuits that tore apart the musical family.",
      "Carl Wilson and other relatives believed the book was essentially Landy's version of Brian's life and questioned whether Brian had even read it. Their mother, Audree Wilson, unsuccessfully sued publisher HarperCollins because the book said she passively watched as her husband beat Brian as a child. Love successfully sued Brian Wilson, saying he was unfairly deprived of royalties after contributing lyrics to dozens of songs. He would eventually gain ownership of the band's name.",
      "The Beach Boys still released an occasional hit single: \"Kokomo,\" made without Wilson, hit No. 1 in 1988. Wilson, meanwhile, released such solo albums as \"Brian Wilson\" and \"Gettin' In Over My Head,\" with cameos by McCartney and Clapton among others. He also completed a pair of albums for the Walt Disney label \u2014 a collection of Gershwin songs and music from Disney movies. In 2012, surviving members of the Beach Boys reunited for a 50th anniversary album, which quickly hit the Top 10 before the group again bickered and separated.",
      "Wilson won two competitive Grammys, for the solo instrumental \"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow\" and for \"The Smile Sessions\" box set. Otherwise, his honors ranged from a Grammy lifetime achievement prize to a tribute at the Kennedy Center to induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2018, he returned to his old high school in Hawthorne and witnessed the literal rewriting of his past: The principal erased an \"F\" he had been given in music and awarded him an \"A.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:25:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Vintage machines are gaining popularity, driven by a wave of support from celebrities like Taylor Swift and Tom Hanks.",
    "story": [
      "When writing instructor Fred Durbin assigned his students to type letters to Tom Hanks on vintage typewriters, he hoped to teach them about deliberate writing. What he didn't expect was for the Hollywood star to personally respond to every single letter.",
      "\"Everyone who wrote him a letter, he responded personally and carefully to the actual content of their letters,\" said Durbin, who teaches at Lincoln Park Performing Arts Charter School near Pittsburgh.",
      "Student Makela Ciminella received a typed note that read: \"I have horrible penmanship which is why I type. Thanks for the letter. Tom Hanks.\" Another student, Sarah Cowan, got a response saying: \"Glad you took the time to type me a note. Took only a minute or so, right? But it might last for 500 years.\"",
      "Elena Cable admitted she was \"pretty ashamed\" after receiving a reply to her letter about Hugh Jackman. \"I kind of wrote to him about Hugh Jackman,\" she laughed, explaining her embarrassment at writing to one actor about another.",
      "Durbin's typewriter assignment reflects a broader renaissance of the vintage writing machines, which are experiencing unexpected popularity across the country. At his school, typewriters have become the centerpiece of an entirely analog classroom designed to change how students approach writing.",
      "\"Today, we think with our fingers, we try something, we put it on the screen and if we don't like it, we make a change,\" Durbin explained. \"With a typewriter, you're thinking more in your head, you have to form that sentence and then you can commit it to paper.\"",
      "The author and typewriter collector, who owns a 1918 Oliver model among others, convinced department head Dan LeRoy to support the initiative as a way to draw students away from their digital lives.",
      "\"Virtual reality doesn't just mean wearing a set of funny glasses, it means that you spend all day in a reality that you curate, that you cultivate, and you spend less and less time in the physical world,\" LeRoy said. \"A typewriter forces you to be present in the physical world.\"",
      "The analog approach eliminates digital distractions entirely. \"You can't check your social media. You can't scroll. You're just writing. Typewriter just has one purpose,\" Durbin said.",
      "The typewriter revival extends beyond classrooms. At Gramercy Typewriter in New York, technicians have been busy repairing vintage machines that never truly disappeared but were simply stored in attics and basements. Recent celebrity endorsements have fueled increased interest, particularly after Taylor Swift posted herself writing lyrics on a typewriter and featured one prominently in her \"Fortnight\" music video alongside Post Malone.",
      "Hanks, who spoke to correspondent Lee Cowan in 2017, is a well-known typewriter enthusiast with an extensive personal collection. Hanks has long championed the machines' appeal.",
      "\"The sound of a typewriter is the sound of productivity,\" Hanks has said, calling one machine \"a fine, manly typewriter\" and noting that typewriters \"got man to the moon.\"",
      "For Durbin, Hanks' personal responses to his students proved the power of thoughtful communication. \"We try to teach kids that writing is like a superpower,\" he said. \"If you can reach for the stars and a really big star reaches back, what can't you do as a writer? Where else might your words end up?\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday said he is removing every member of a government panel that makes vaccine recommendations.",
      "Kennedy said he is \"retiring\" all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, asserting that it \"has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.\"",
      "\"A clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science,\" Kennedy wrote in an opinion piece published by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "On Tuesday night, Kennedy posted on X discussing the move and said he \"will use this platform to announce new members to populate ACIP.\"",
      "\"None of these individuals will be ideological anti-vaxxers. They will be highly credentialed physicians and scientists who will make extremely consequential public health determinations by applying evidence-based decision-making with objectivity and common sense,\" he wrote, in part. \"I will also be tweeting examples of the historical corruption at ACIP to help the public understand why this clean sweep was necessary.\"",
      "Kennedy's move was quickly rebuked by a number of doctors groups. A statement released by the American Medical Association said it \"upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives.\" The American Academy of Pediatrics called it\u00a0part of an \"escalating effort by the Administration to silence independent medical expertise and stoke distrust in lifesaving vaccines.\"",
      "It comes after months of criticism over how Kennedy has wielded his authority and platform as the head of the nation's public health agencies, including\u00a0ordering changes to COVID-19 vaccine guidance, terminating bird flu vaccine\u00a0research funding, forcing out federal vaccines officials and spreading myths about\u00a0measles shots.",
      "The members of the committee are independent medical and public health experts who advise and vote on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations. The CDC sets immunization schedules for both adults and children based on recommendations from ACIP.",
      "Experts and health authorities closely watch the committee's decisions, since their recommendations are tied to a number of federal policies, including requirements for insurance coverage and liability protections.",
      "\"Per the June 9, 2025 directive from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, this email serves as formal notice of your immediate termination as a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). We appreciate your prior service and commitment,\" read an email to one committee member from the CDC.",
      "\"This is horrifying,\" a CDC official said of Kennedy's move.",
      "The American Public Health Association\u00a0denounced\u00a0it as an undemocratic \"coup\" of the process. The Infectious Disease Society of America called it \"reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful.\" The American College of Physicians accused Kennedy of having \"circumvented the standard, transparent vaccine review processes\" at the CDC.",
      "\"Today's announcement will seriously erode public confidence in our government's ability to ensure the health of the American public and it will endanger the safety, welfare and lives of our patients,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, the group's president and a liaison to the committee, said in\u00a0a statement.",
      "Kennedy raised concern about conflicts of interest among ACIP members, but Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the committee members cannot own stock in or be on any kind of advisory board for pharmaceutical companies.",
      "\"Kennedy, on the other hand, is conflicted,\" Gounder said on \"CBS Mornings.\" \"He has sued multiple vaccine manufacturers. He has stood to gain or lose from the outcome of these decisions. That is by definition conflicted.\"",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and the top Republican in the Senate's health committee, also expressed concern, saying \"now the fear is that the ACIP will be filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.\"",
      "\"I've just spoken with Secretary Kennedy, and I'll continue to talk with him to ensure this is not the case,\" Cassidy\u00a0posted on X.",
      "Cassidy had been a key vote in Kennedy's confirmation process, coming out in favor of Kennedy's nomination only after Kennedy offered a number of reassurances, including to \"maintain\" the committee \"without changes.\"",
      "Career CDC officials usually select experts to sit on the committee out of the applications it receives, forwarding picks to the secretary to be signed off on.",
      "Kennedy said the Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028 because some of the current members were last-minute appointees of the Biden administration.",
      "\"The prior administration made a concerted effort to lock in public health ideology and limit the incoming administration's ability to take the proper actions to restore public trust in vaccines,\" Kennedy said.",
      "It is unclear who is being considered to replace the committee's members or how they are being selected. A spokesperson for the department did not comment when asked.",
      "The move comes a week after a committee leader, Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, resigned from her role following an order from Kennedy to change the CDC's guidance on COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.",
      "Outside groups criticized\u00a0the edits forced by Kennedy, which bypassed the longstanding advisory committee process and usurped an already-ongoing work group within the panel that had been weighing how to narrow COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.",
      "Kennedy's ouster of the committee's members comes ahead of a meeting of the panel scheduled to start on June 25. The panel was expected to vote on new recommendations for COVID-19 and other vaccines.",
      "Updates voted on from the last committee meeting in April to RSV and meningococcal vaccine recommendations were never adopted by Kennedy.",

    "summary": "Passing nurses Sabrina Castle and Gianna Formisano saved the life of Merryl Hoffman when she experienced a sudden cardiac arrest.",
    "story": [
      "Merryl Hoffman knew she was taking good care of her heart. The 63-year-old attorney didn't smoke or drink, and she was an avid hiker who used to run marathons and other distance races. In her 40s, she had been diagnosed with a leaky mitral valve and underwent surgery to repair it. Every year since, she has seen a cardiologist to check her heart and its function. The reports always came back clear.",
      "When Hoffman left her apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side on Oct. 23, 2024, her heart was the last thing on her mind. She was saddled with her work bag and purse, hightailing it to the subway station so she could make it to work on time. That's when her memory of the day ends.",
      "Shortly into her walk, Hoffman experienced a sudden cardiac arrest. Her heart stopped beating. She collapsed to the ground. Doctors later told her it was a severe arrhythmia that could have been fatal \u2014 if not for where Hoffman fell.",
      "Hoffman had collapsed outside Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's Breast and Imaging Center, about two and a half blocks from her subway station. A patient care technician and a passing runner immediately rushed to her aid. Then, Memorial Sloan Kettering nurses Sabrina Castle and Gianna Formisano stumbled upon the scene while walking to work.",
      "\"We were so shocked. When we were walking up, people were like 'Nurses, nurses!' We didn't know what we were walking into,\" Formisano said. \"People were grabbing our coffee, taking our bags. It was out of a movie, the way that they were like 'Oh, thank God you're here.'\"",
      "\"They absolutely saved my life\"",
      "Formisano and Castle took over performing CPR, keeping Hoffman's heart manually beating. She didn't have a pulse, and she had hit her head when she collapsed. The nurses also instructed one of the other bystanders to call an ambulance.",
      "Early CPR increases survival for patients in cardiac arrest by \"at least two or three fold,\" said Dr. Jessica Hennessey, a cardiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Early CPR means that blood flow to the brain and heart continues, preserving the health of those organs. Bystanders in a medical emergency should call 911 and immediately start CPR, Hennessey advised. CPR can be done with mouth-to-mouth or with just chest compressions, Hennessey said.",
      "After five minutes that \"felt like forever,\" the ambulance arrived, Formisano said. Castle and Formisano helped the EMTs load Hoffman into the ambulance. Then, she was taken to NewYork-Presbyterian's cardiac care unit for further treatment.",
      "For the small crowd, the day carried on. Castle and Formisano headed to work. After a few hours, they called NewYork-Presbyterian to see if they could find out more about Hoffman's status. They went to the hospital and spoke to a nurse there.",
      "\"She was like, 'You got her back. She's intubated, she's alive, you saved her life,'\" Castle recalled.",
      "Hoffman was still unconscious. She told CBS News that she didn't wake up until five days after the collapse. Her family told her that she had been rushed into surgery. Doctors told her that her heart had stopped for several minutes \u2014\u00a0and the actions of Castle, Formisano and other bystanders had saved her.",
      "\"Without them, I was told, there was no doubt I would have died or been brain dead,\" Hoffman said. \"They absolutely saved my life.\"",
      "Hoffman had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placed in her chest to prevent further cardiac arrests. The device shocks the heart if it detects an irregular heartbeat. She also began cardiac rehabilitation. Shortly after, she returned to work. Life began to get back to normal but one question was constantly at the back of her mind: Who had helped save her?",
      "A chance reunion",
      "While in cardiac rehabilitation, Hoffman found herself telling the story of the strangers who had helped her. A physiologist there overheard her talking about it and thought the story sounded familiar. His girlfriend was friends with two nurses who had helped a woman matching Hoffman's description. After some back and forth, the physiologist connected Hoffman with Castle and Formisano.",
      "The trio immediately made plans to get dinner. Hoffman's husband joined them for the meal. There, the nurses were able to fill in the gaps of the October morning when Hoffman collapsed.",
      "\"It was very jarring, when they gave my husband and I the blow-by-blow of that morning. There were things we did not know,\" Hoffman said. \"It was pretty incredible.\"",
      "Since that dinner, the women have stayed in touch. Recently, Castle and Formisano even passed Hoffman on the same block where she had collapsed. The three took a photo at the site.",
      "\"We were like, 'Wow, this is really crazy,'\" Formisano said. \"'We're running into you on the same spot, on your way to work, on our way to work, but now you're alive and well and in a much different state than when we met you the first time.'\"",

      "Scheffler, 28, who is competing in the U.S. Open this week, said Tuesday that he deleted the app after receiving a string of unwanted financial requests and payments from strangers betting on his performance.",
      "\"That's why I had to get rid of my Venmo because I was either getting paid by people or people requesting me a bunch of money when I didn't win. It wasn't a good feeling,\" the 16-time PGA Tour winner recently told reporters, according to CBS Sports.",
      "While he occasionally received small payments after winning a game, Scheffler said he more typically got requests from gamblers looking to cash in if he had lost.",
      "\"I don't remember the most that somebody would send me,\" he said. \"Maybe a couple bucks here or there. That didn't happen nearly as much as the requests did.\"",
      "Ordinary Venmo users may not attract the same attention on the app as Scheffler, but they can still benefit from knowing how to protect their privacy on the payment platform.",
      "Read on for tips on how to navigate Venmo safely.",
      "What should I do if I get an unexpected payment or request on Venmo?",
      "With the proliferation on online scams, Venmo encourages its users to play it safe. If you get a payment from a stranger, Venmo says you should not accept the transfer, but instead contact the app's\u00a0support team.",
      "Likewise, payment requests from suspicious accounts, or people you don't know, should also be declined, the company says.",
      "\"In some cases, you may receive a payment request from someone who appears to be a friend or relative,\" Venmo warns on its website. \"This can be a common scam tactic, so we recommend contacting your friend or family member outside of Venmo to confirm the legitimacy of the request before taking any action.\"",
      "For more information on how to safely use Venmo, the company's\u00a0website\u00a0outlines common mobile payment scams and how to avoid them.",
      "Can everyone see my Venmo payment history?",
      "Paying your roommate for the electricity bill? Others might be able to see that transaction on Venmo, depending on your account settings.",
      "If your profile is public, which is the default setting on the app, then each of your payment transactions will appear on Venmo's main feed, making them visible to anyone online. That includes information on who you're paying, when you paid them and what you're paying them for \u2014 cue the pizza emoji.",
      "To limit the number of people who can see your transactions, you can switch your privacy settings to \"Friends only\" or \"Private.\" The \"Friends only\" setting makes your payment transactions visible to Venmo friends only. The \"Private\" setting, the most restrictive of the three options, limits payment visibility to the two parties engaged in the transaction.",
      "If you're paying or requesting money from someone who has different privacy setting than you, Venmo will default to whoever's setting is more restrictive.",
      "For example, if your account is private and you're making a payment to someone with a public account, the payment will automatically be private, and only visible to you and the recipient.",

    "story": [
      "The Republicans' \"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0is uniting everyone from Elon Musk to Wall Street over an issue that experts say could pose a threat to the nation's long-term fiscal stability: The rising cost of servicing the U.S. government's growing mountain of debt.",
      "The U.S. spent $1.1 trillion in interest on its debt in 2024 \u2014 almost double the amount it was paying five years ago, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. The nation now spends more on interest payments than it does on defense,\u00a0data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.",
      "Those costs could rise even more under the Republican tax and spending bill now being considered in the Senate, according to a June 5 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. The version of the tax bill\u00a0passed by the House last month is projected to increase the federal deficit \u2014 the gap between what the federal government spends each year and what it collects in revenue \u2014 by $2.4 trillion over the next decade, the nonpartisan agency found.",
      "That would require the government to raise additional debt, resulting in additional interest payments of about $550 billion over the next decade, the CBO forecasts. By 2035, interest on the nation's debt could reach $1.8 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank focused on fiscal issues.",
      "\"The interest costs now are bigger than defense spending, which is an extraordinary,\" Chris Edwards, an expert on federal tax issues at the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The budget threat here is that all of these increasing federal interest costs will crowd out all the other priorities in the federal budget that the policymakers want to spend on.\"",
      "In other words, the federal government could struggle to support vital programs like Social Security as a larger share of its budget is eaten up by interest payments on the nation's swelling debt.",
      "Federal interest payments as a share of the nation's gross domestic product stood at 3% last year,\u00a0according\u00a0to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. If current trends holds, that could rise to 4.1% of GDP by 2035, the nonpartisan Peter G. Peterson Foundation estimates.",
      "Democrats have pointed to analyses showing the bill's tax cuts will benefit wealthier Americans far more than low- and middle-income workers while also adding to the national debt.",
      "\"No single piece of legislation in my time here in Congress will do more to add to the national debt than this one,\" Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania who voted against the legislation,\u00a0said\u00a0last month on the House floor.",
      "Many Republicans, however, point to the bill's proposed tax cuts as providing an avenue for economic growth. \"We are going to celebrate a new golden age in America,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said last month after the bill passed in the House.",
      "Concerns from Elon Musk, Wall Street",
      "The cost of paying for the nation's debt has drawn concern from many corners, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who earlier this month posted about it on social media as he voiced his objections to the GOP bill.",
      "\"Congress is spending America into bankruptcy!\" Musk posted on June 5, pointing to data showing that interest payments have risen from $416 billion in 2014 to more than $1 trillion in 2024.",
      "Moody's Ratings downgraded U.S. credit\u00a0last month, citing among its reasons the mounting concerns about the nation's increasing debt load and interest payments.",
      "\"Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\" the credit rating agency said. \"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat.\"",
      "Moody's added, \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "On June 7, the White House said in a memo that the GOP tax bill \"significantly improves our nation's fiscal trajectory by including $1.7 trillion in mandatory savings,\" while President Trump's tax cuts will spur economic growth.",
      "Some economic forecasters project that Mr. Trump's tariffs will drag down U.S. growth. The nation's growth could slide to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% next year partly because of those import levies, a sharp reduction from the 2.8% growth recorded last year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said last week.",
      "How did interest payments get so big?",
      "In recent years, interest payments on the federal debt have ballooned for two main reasons. First, a series of COVID-related spending bills provided $4.6 trillion to individuals and businesses to help them keep afloat during the pandemic, with much of that financed through new debt.",
      "Second, the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in March of 2022 to tame high inflation. But that also meant the Treasury Department needed to pay higher rates to bondholders, adding to the cost of servicing the nation's burgeoning debt.",
      "In 2020, the U.S. had about $27 trillion in outstanding debt, according to Treasury data. By 2024, that had jumped 32% to $35.5 trillion. Over that time, the Fed's benchmark interest rate rose from close to zero percent to a high of more than 5% in 2024.",
      "One reason the Republican budget bill is forecast to increase the deficit \u2014 and add to the nation's interest costs \u2014 is that it would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add other breaks, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay.",
      "Altogether, those tax cuts will cost $3.75 trillion, the CBO estimates. The revenue loss would be partially offset by nearly $1.3 trillion in reduced federal spending elsewhere, namely through Medicaid and food assistance. But that still leaves a significant funding gap.",
      "In the meantime, the U.S. could face a financial strain in servicing its debt, especially in the face of an economic slowdown, experts have warned.",
      "\"The most dangerous scenario is that the giant size of our debt precipitates a U.S., and even global, economic recession and financial crisis,\" Cato's Edwards told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We saw this 15 or so years ago in Greece and some other European countries. That sort of crisis could be coming to the United States at some point, but no financial expert knows exactly when that's going to be.\"",

    "summary": "The inflation rate is inching higher, with Wall Street expecting tariffs to increase prices throughout the remainder of 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in May rose 2.4% on an annual basis, reflecting a cooler-than-expected increase last month and signaling that the impact of\u00a0President Trump's tariffs\u00a0hasn't yet trickled through to prices on everyday items bought by Americans.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.5% last month on an annual basis, an increase from April's 2.3% rate, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "So-called core inflation, or CPI data that excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.8% over the past 12 months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 2.9% increase for that measure.",
      "The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "What's driving the numbers",
      "The inflation rate likely rose less than expected due to a sharp dip in gasoline prices. Lower energy prices were a \"major source of disinflationary/deflationary pressure,\" noted Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge.",
      "Gasoline prices dropped 12% in May from a year earlier, the CPI data shows.",
      "Other items that declined in price included clothing, which slipped by 0.9% from a year earlier, and airline fares, with a 7.3% decline. Offsetting that were price hikes on items including some grocery items, including beef and coffee, as well as housing costs.",
      "While inflation remains far lower than during its post-pandemic spike \u2014 when it reached a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 \u2014 it's still higher than the Federal Reserve's goal of driving it down to a 2% annual rate.",
      "Because of that, Wall Street expects the Fed to hold off on cutting rates until later this year, with economists polled by FactSet giving a 100% probability that the central bank will keep rates steady at its June 18 meeting.",
      "Economists are also keeping a watchful eye on when Mr. Trump's tariffs, which he has imposed on almost every nation on the globe, will show up in the inflation data. Tariffs are paid by U.S. companies when they import foreign goods, and Walmart and other importers have said they expect to hike prices for consumers to pass along those costs.",
      "So far, the impact of those tariffs appear to be limited, although economists are forecasting that the inflation rate could edge above 3% by year end. The tariff impacts could start to show up in the CPI data later this summer, said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in an email after the CPI data was released.",
      "\"Today's below forecast inflation print is reassuring \u2014 but only to an extent,\" Shah added. \"Tariff-driven price increases may not feed through to the CPI data for a few more months yet, so it is far too premature to assume that the price shock will not materialise.\"",

      "The U.S. and Chinese trade teams wrapped up two days of marathon negotiations in London close to midnight on Tuesday, with the sides saying they had agreed on a new \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war between the world's two largest economies.",
      "The tension had only increased in recent weeks, despite an agreement reached in Geneva during a first round of talks in May to put the steepest retaliatory tariffs on hold. Those record-high tariffs are due to kick back in on July 9, unless the agreement struck in London is in fact formalized by Trump and Xi.",
      "In month since the Geneva talks, Beijing had cut its exports of critical rare earth elements to the U.S. by half compared to the previous year, and the Trump administration said it would \"aggressively revoke\" the visas of Chinese students in the U.S. who were found to be linked to the Chinese Communist party.",
      "While the announcement by Mr. Trump's top negotiators on Tuesday evening of an agreed framework was thin on details, the president\u00a0said in a post on his own Truth Social media platform Wednesday morning that it was \"done, subject to final approval with president Xi and me.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal would see China maintain its current 10% tariffs on goods imported from the U.S., while the U.S. would keep 55% tariffs on Chinese imports.",
      "\"President XI and I are going to work closely together to open up China to American Trade,\" Mr. Trump added in a subsequent post. \"This would be a great WIN for both countries!!!\"",
      "There was no immediate confirmation from China's government of any terms agreed to in the framework, or whether President Xi intended to sign off on the deal.",
      "In Geneva, Beijing and Washington agreed in May to put their unprecedented tariffs of more than 100% on each other's imports on hold for 90 days. That brought U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports down to their current level of 30% after they briefly soared to around 145%.",
      "Chinese tariffs currently stand at 10%, after hitting 125% before the Geneva round of talks.",
      "Speaking Tuesday, Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang, who took part in the talks in London, confirmed the agreement on a framework, \"in principle.\"",
      "On Wednesday, China's state-run media said the delegations had \"made new progress,\" but offered no details.",
      "\"The framework deal puts meat on the bones of an agreement reached last month in Geneva to ease bilateral retaliatory tariffs,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters after the talks in London, which spanned six hours on Monday and then more than 12 hours into the evening on Tuesday.",
      "Lutnick said part of the objective of this week's second round of meetings was just to get \"the negativity out\" of the bilateral relationship, which had festered since the Geneva talks.",
      "\"Now we can go forward to try to do positive trade, growing trade,\" he said.",
      "The U.S. wants China to resume and increase shipments of rare earths. The materials are vital to industries ranging from weapons and aerospace to electric vehicles and small consumer goods.",
      "On Wednesday, in his all-capital-letter social media post, Mr. Trump said under the agreement reached in London, \"full magnets, and any necessary rare earths, will be supplied, up front, by China. Likewise, we will provide to China what was agreed to, including Chinese students using our colleges and universities.\"",
      "\"Relationship is excellent!\" added Mr. Trump.",
      "\"At stake is the release of rare earths exports to U.S. manufacturers \u2014 stockpiles are dwindling fast \u2014 in exchange for aerospace parts and semiconductor programming technology to China,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told investors in a report. \"A 'fail' would raise the risk of auto and aircraft production grinding to a halt as soon as next month.

      "The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Trump administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that blocked the tariffs pending appeal. The appellate judges scheduled oral arguments in the case on July 31, meaning the tariffs are set to stay in effect until then unless there's further court action in the case.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled last month that many of Mr. Trump's signature tariffs are illegal, including the 10% tariffs on virtually every U.S. trading partner and a set of tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. The appellate court quickly paused that ruling from taking effect until further notice \u2014 ahead of Tuesday's longer-lasting pause.",
      "Tuesday's ruling was unsigned and did not include the court's reasoning.",
      "In\u00a0a post on his Truth Social platform Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump said, \"A Federal Appeals Court has just ruled that the United States can use TARIFFS to protect itself against other countries. A great and important win for the U.S.\"",
      "The appellate ruling extends a legal battle over the fate of the tariffs. The president put levies in place on imports from Canada, China and Mexico early in his term, citing the flow of drugs and unauthorized immigration. Then, on a day in early April he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" Mr. Trump imposed across-the-board 10% tariffs on most countries \u2014 along with much higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners that he accused of unfair trade practices.",
      "Mr. Trump has justified many of those tariffs using a 1977 law that lets the president regulate imports during emergency situations. But a group of businesses and state governments sued, arguing he doesn't have the legal authority. The U.S. Court of International Trade sided with the plaintiffs, concluding that the 1977 law doesn't allow the tariffs \u2014 and even if it did, it would be unconstitutional for a law passed by Congress to give the president blanket power to levy tariffs.",
      "The trade war has rocked markets and drawn criticism from members of both parties, but Mr. Trump has stood by his tariffs, arguing they're necessary to fix trade imbalances and restore U.S. manufacturing.",
      "The 10% tariffs have stayed in place, though the \"reciprocal\" tariffs are largely on hold as the Trump administration seeks to strike trade deals with other countries, and many Canadian and Mexican goods are exempted from the levies on those countries. Chinese goods\u00a0face 30% tariffs \u2014 down from 145% following an agreement between the U.S. and China.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Jun 2025 17:31:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's why McDonald's is more exposed than other fast-food brands to shifts in eating habits as a result of weight-loss drugs.",
    "story": [
      "McDonald's shares dropped Tuesday as weight-loss drugs threaten to take a big bite out of the fast food chain's earnings.",
      "Shares were down by as much as 1.7% Tuesday, after equity analysis firm Redburn Atlantic downgraded the burger giant's stock rating two notches, from buy to sell.",
      "Changes in Americans' eating habits spurred by the use of the class of drugs known as GLP-1s, which are designed to help regulate users' blood sugar and appetite, pose an underappreciated threat to some food businesses, according to Redburn Atlantic analysts Chris Luyckx and Edward Lewis.",
      "As a result, McDonald's could lose up to 28 million customer visits, resulting in a revenue loss of $482 million per year \u2014 about 0.9% of the company's sales, according to the analysis.",
      "The appetite-suppressing drugs are expected to have a transformative effect on how Americans consume food. At particular risk are brands that cater to lower-income consumers \u2014 a category to which McDonald's belongs.",
      "That's because spending on food away from home among lower-income households who start using GLP-1 drugs declines and tends to remain depressed, according to the report, creating \"material implications for chains with broad mass-market exposure.\"",
      "Higher-income users of the drugs, by contrast, decrease their spending before reverting to old spending patterns within one year, the analysis found.",
      "\"Behaviour changes extend beyond the individual user \u2014 reshaping group dining, influencing household routines and softening habitual demand. A 1% drag today could easily build to 10% or more over time, particularly for brands skewed toward lower income consumers or group occasions,\" the analysts said in a research note.",
      "Pricing fatigue",
      "Inflationary pressures and consumers' strained budgets only compound problems for McDonald's, according to the report.",
      "\"Consumers are showing clear signs of pricing fatigue after years of aggressive menu inflation,\" the analysts wrote. \"Although the gap between eating out and at home has narrowed, it remains historically wide, reinforcing value concerns.\"",
      "The Redburn analysis refers to GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy as \"demand disruptors\" for restaurants like McDonald's, because they reduce users' appetites and limit the number of calories they consume each day. These features of the drugs \"could have serious implications for the restaurant industry,\" Redburn analysts wrote.",
      "To be sure, adoption of the drugs is not yet widespread, with just 12% of U.S. adults ever having tried the meds. Currently, only 6% of the adult population uses the drugs.",
      "Wider adoption of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss could ultimately lead to a broad-based reduction in Americans' caloric intake at restaurants, including fast food joints, reversing a decades-long trend. From 1977 to 2018, the total share of calories consumed at restaurants nearly tripled, according to Redburn Atlantic's analysis of U.S. Department of Agriculture data.",
      "Compared with other fast food brands, McDonald's is the most exposed to taking a hit from the increased usage of GLP-1 drugs, according to the research.",
      "More pressing challenges",
      "However, Peter Saleh, managing director and restaurant and food distributors analyst at BTIG global financial services, said McDonald's is facing other headwinds, and he wouldn't expect GLP-1s to meaningfully eat into its earnings, at least not in the near-term.",
      "For one, McDonald's core customer base consists of low- and middle-income consumers who are unlikely to be able to afford GLP-1 drugs, said Saleh, who doesn't foresee there being much overlap between the fast food giant's patrons and adopters of the drugs.",
      "\"I don't think there would be a meaningful GLP-1 impact on McDonald's right now, but that's not to say that in three or four years that won't be the case,\" he said. \"I just don't think we are there yet.\"",

      "On June 4, Lindell wrote on social media that \"My employee-owned company and I are in jury trial NOW and need your support!\" He included a link to a landing page on his company's website that includes the line, \"Use promo code JURY\" to receive a \"free Multi-Use MyPillow 2.0\" with any purchase.",
      "The website also includes a link to \"Mike Lindell Legal Defense Fund,\" which asks for donations of between $10 to $1,000. The fundraising effort notes that Lindell has spent \"nearly all his resources ... to exposing corruption in our election systems.\"",
      "MyPillow didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The sales and fundraising efforts come after Lindell told CBS MoneyWatch in 2023 that he had $10,000 to his name after spending millions of his own funds on proving his election theories. The businessman also said he had lost about $7 million after Walmart and other big-box stores dropped his line of bedding.",
      "\"I urgently need your financial support to cover the massive expenses\" of the trial, Lindell said in a video posted to the legal defense site.",
      "On Monday, Lindell took the stand in the defamation trial, which is being held at a federal courthouse in Denver and expected to continue this week. He denied making any statements he knew to be false about Eric Coomer, the former Dominion executive who sued Lindell in 2022 over his statements.",
      "In his Monday testimony, Lindell also reiterated his previous claims that Coomer was \"part of the biggest crime this world has ever seen,\" while he painted himself as the victim of \"lawfare,\" or when people are sued to scare them into silence.",

      "Several conservative news organizations, including Fox News, Newsmax and One America News, have settled defamation lawsuits from voting machine companies over allegations that they promoted falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election. Fox News agreed to pay almost $800 million in its settlement with Dominion.",
      "In April, a judge ruled that Newsmax made defamatory statements about Dominion Voting related to the news channel's claims the voting machine company had rigged votes in the 2020 presidential election, and said the case could proceed to trial, according to the New York Times.\u00a0In 2021, Newsmax also apologized to Coomer for airing false allegations against him.",
      "MyPillow's business",
      "In 2023, MyPillow auctioned off more than 700 pieces of company equipment, ranging from forklifts to office desks and cubicles, after it lost millions in revenue when big retailers halted sales of its products. Lindell told CBS at the time that he blamed \"cancel culture\" for the revenue slump.",
      "During his testimony, Lindell noted that he once had a net worth of $60 million, but is now millions of dollars in debt, prompting him to turn to crowdfunding to raise money for his legal costs. He also noted that MyPillow had liquidated inventory \"because we had no money left.\"",
      "Lindell added that his fundraising efforts have generated about $362,000 so far.",
      "Lindell's debunked election theories have caused him additional financial problems. In 2021, he had offered to pay $5 million to anyone who could prove computer data he had acquired wasn't, in fact, 2020 election data.",
      "But after a computer expert proved the data was bogus, Lindell refused to honor the challenge, leading to an arbitration panel\u00a0ordering him to pay up the $5 million.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 16:04:48 -0400",
    "summary": "The proposed rollback of emissions regulations is part of the Trump administration's efforts to repeal rules that aim to address climate change.",
    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it will seek to revoke a key rule put in place by the Biden administration that set limits on the amount of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, emitted from fossil fuel-fired power plants.",
      "The rule was finalized in April 2024 and is projected to reduce 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere by 2047, as well as eliminate tens of thousands of tons of other harmful air pollutants that are dangerous to public health. Eliminating 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon emissions is equivalent to driving more than 320 million gas-powered cars for a year, according to an EPA estimate.",
      "At a news conference Wednesday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the Trump administration is demonstrating that it \"can both protect the environment and grow the economy.\"",
      "\"Today is a historic day at the EPA,\" he said. \"For the last few months, since President Trump was sworn in for this term, we here at the EPA have been taking actions to end the agency's war on so much of our U.S. domestic energy supply.\"",
      "Zeldin argued that the Biden-era rules were attempting to \"suffocate our economy in order to protect the environment.\"",
      "EPA data shows that in 2023, the power sector produced 31% of carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels, the second-highest of all industries.",
      "Former Obama EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, disagreed with Zeldin, saying in a statement, \"The key rationale Zeldin is using to justify the dismantling of our nation's protections from power plant pollution is absolutely illogical and indefensible. It's purely a political play that goes against decades of science and policy review.\"",
      "Zeldin also announced that the agency will move to repeal updated limits to the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule, which restricts the amount of pollutants that can be emitted by coal and natural gas-fired power plants. The rule was first introduced in 2011, but the Biden administration tightened the regulations in 2024 to ensure that fossil fuel plants reduce emissions from toxic metals by 67% and from mercury by 70%.",
      "Now, the EPA plans to loosen those more stringent standards, which Zeldin said are \"gratuitous.\" Zeldin said that if the rule is finalized, power plants will not be allowed to emit more than they do today or as much as they did during the Biden administration.",
      "Although mercury is naturally occurring in nature, exposure to high levels of it in the air, water and food supply is toxic to human health and especially dangerous to the development of young children and fetuses, according to the World Health Organization. When mercury is released into the air, it can travel great distances and land in lakes and rivers, where it is exposed to fish that can be eaten by humans.",
      "The rule has been highly effective, reducing mercury air emissions from power plants by 85% from 2013-2022. It's worth noting that a big part of that shift was driven by a decline in coal plants and by installing pollution controls on fossil fuel-based power generation.",
      "Zeldin was joined by several Republican members of the House and Senate, including Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who applauded the announcement as a \"common-sense\" change.",
      "\"What's been done up to this point is literally a unilateral disarmament of the American economy,\" he said.",

      "The Environmental Protection Network, a group of hundreds of former EPA employees, did an analysis of EPA data to estimate the health and economic impact of both rules. It found that the Biden-era power plant pollution and mercury rules, combined, could avoid the premature mortality of more than 15,000 people and prevent more than 5.1 million symptomatic asthma incidents, cumulatively through 2050. The two rules are estimated to provide more than $22.4 billion in annual net benefits for public health and the economy by reducing hospital and health care costs.",

      "A New Jersey grand jury on Tuesday indicted Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey on three charges of assaulting federal law enforcement officers during a clash last month outside of a Newark ICE detention center, interim New Jersey U.S. Attorney Alina Habba announced on X.",
      "In May, Habba announced her office was charging\u00a0McIver with two counts of \"assaulting, impeding and interfering with law enforcement,\" after a clash between law enforcement, lawmakers and protesters who claimed conditions at the Delaney Hall detention center were unsafe and illegal.",
      "On May 9, McIver and two other members of Congress went to Delaney Hall and attempted to conduct federal oversight of the 10,000 bed detention center. During their visit, protesters \u2014 including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka \u2014 scuffled with law enforcement, resulting in Baraka's arrest for charges of misdemeanor trespassing. Charges against him have since been dropped.",
      "A special agent with the Newark division of the Department of Homeland Security investigation team alleged in a sworn affidavit for the initial charges that after McIver and others attempted to block Baraka's arrest by creating a human shield, she \"slammed her forearm into the body\" of a uniformed Homeland Security Investigations agent and \"reached out and tried to restrain\" that agent from grabbing the mayor.",
      "He also stated that after Baraka was in custody, she \"pushed an ICE officer\" and \"used each of her forearms to forcibly strike\" them.",
      "In footage posted online by DHS, McIver, wearing a red jacket, can be seen along the Delaney Hall fence as Baraka is being arrested. As the group of protesters and law enforcement start to brush up against each other, McIver is spotted using her elbows to move herself past an officer.",
      "Despite the announcement, the indictment was not immediately available on the federal docket in New Jersey.",
      "In a statement, McIver said that she would enter a not guilty plea and called the new indictment \"a brazen attempt at political intimidation.\"",

    "summary": "The White House has framed the changes as ensuring government efficiency and an effort to \"restore truth and sanity to depictions of American history.\"",
    "story": [
      "As federal policies and staffing levels rapidly change in the name of government efficiency and energy independence, historical sites across the United States \u2014 sites that help the public understand the cultures that came before them and built their communities of today \u2014 are in jeopardy of losing out on important federal protections.",
      "In southern Louisiana, a project aimed at preserving the story of slavery in the Deep South and the unique path of formerly enslaved people transitioning to landowners after the Civil War has been halted amid the federal changes and staffing cuts impacting historic preservation offices in several agencies.",
      "The project \u2014  called Great River Road \u2014   is an 11-mile stretch of land following the winding path of the Mississippi River, spanning a few small towns that so far remain untouched by encroaching industrial development. The descendants of slaves and environmental activists in this community have been fighting industry proposals for decades.",
      "The Whitney Plantation in Wallace, Louisiana, is one of more than 600 sites in the region found to be historically significant in a comprehensive study completed in 2024.",
      "Once a slave plantation, today Whitney serves as an educational museum.",
      "\"I think so many people feel a sense of reverence in the fact that they're walking on the exact ground that these people walked on,\" said Ashley Rogers, Executive Director of Whitney Plantation. \"It means everything to me to try to preserve this place for future generations\u2026 I want this place to still be here in 100 years.\"",
      "The study was a major win for the hope of securing federal protection for the region, finding that formerly enslaved farmers once cultivated the land \u2014 descendants of those people still use historical farming techniques to this day. As a result, the region was listed as eligible to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places, which listed 99,800 historically significant properties as of last March, according to a CBS News analysis of data provided by the National Park Service.",
      "Great River Road was expected to go even higher. It was anticipated to soon receive the coveted National Historic Landmark title \u2014  a special designation given to only about 2,600 sites across the country. But the project was halted after President Trump returned to the White House for a second term.",
      "\"We found out on the news. This was not information that was shared with any members. We found out the same way everyone else found out,\" Rogers said.",
      "The request for the Great River Road to be removed from the National Register came from the State Historic Preservation Office, with documentation provided by local preservationists sent to the National Park Service, according to officials familiar with the project.",
      "The Louisiana Office of Historic Preservation declined to comment.",
      "While Rogers says local environmental and industrial struggles were a factor, historic preservation sources close to the project say the changing political landscape at a federal level paved the way for the project to lose steam for the foreseeable future.",
      "In fact, the National Park System Advisory Board, which designates historic landmarks, was quietly dissolved in May, CBS News learned, halting all applications for sites like Great River Road across the country.",
      "Across the entire National Park Service, sources close to the agency tell CBS News 13% of employees have been pushed out since January, a loss of up to 3,000 workers, adding the New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park has lost half its staff already.",
      "Sources close to NPS said some PhD researchers and park rangers are now cleaning bathrooms at many protected park service sites and monuments across America because they are the last employees left at those sites.",
      "Historians say they're deeply concerned about the more than 3 million artifacts preserved at these sites, which are also at risk due to the staffing cuts.",
      "Other historians tell CBS News several other agencies have also faced significant cuts. In the Government Services Administration, preservationist positions in charge of managing historic properties have been reduced by 80%, down from 40 employees to only eight. A few other staffing positions with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation \u2014 a small, independent federal agency tasked with advising the president and Congress on preservation policy \u2014 have also been chopped.",
      "At the Department of the Interior, historians fighting the federal policy changes say an order was recently issued proposing to reduce payroll expenses by another 30%, but that may not necessarily constitute a 30% reduction in staff. And while earlier termination notices that were part of the Trump administration's sweeping cuts to the federal workforce are still pending judicial review, they leave activists concerned that historic properties considered irreplaceable could suffer as a result.",
      "With nearly $1 billion in budget cuts to the National Park Service proposed for next year, national parks advocates estimate 350 additional historical, cultural or natural sites nationwide are at risk of closing.",
      "Carol Quillen, president and CEO of the National Trust For Historic Preservation \u2014 one of many groups fighting against drastic budget cuts and low staffing at National Parks and historic sites \u2014 told CBS News, \"We are concerned when the infrastructure that supports preservation activities is dismantled in such a way so that we can't quite figure out how these activities are going to happen now.\"",
      "Her organization is even suing the federal government over the impact the cuts and policy changes are having on important places in American history.",
      "The White House says the changes are important for ensuring government efficiency, and are an effort to \"restore truth and sanity to depictions of American history.\"",
      "\"President Trump is ensuring agencies across the country run more efficiently while preserving great services for the American people, like access to our beautiful national parks,\" said Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, in a written statement to CBS News. \"Secretary Burgum is doing an incredible job keeping our parks ready for peak season, ensuring they are in pristine condition for visitors, and restoring truth and sanity to depictions of American history in line with the President's Executive Order.\"",
      "But Rogers says, \"It's a cynical view to think that we can't spend any government money on things that bring us joy and learning. There are very few places in this country where you can even hear this story, let alone in the place where it happened.\"",
      "She remains hopeful the Great River Road project will regain traction again down the line.",
      "Another advocate involved in the project says Great River Road's demise was \"crazy.\"",
      "But despite state requests for the site to be removed from eligibility, technically, the Great River Road still stands a chance for federal protections in the future.",
      "According to a CBS News analysis of U.S. Park Service data on the National Register of Historic Places and updated data for 2025 provided by NPS, Great River Road was among about 28 properties that were submitted to the Register and considered eligible for listing as of last year.",
      "Getting added to the Register requires passing several procedural steps, with some 428 properties having been added to the National Register so far this year, compared to 1,178 total last year, according to 2025 data provided by the Park Service.",
      "So far in 2025, 32 properties have been removed from the Register, including 16 properties that were demolished in Kansas City, Missouri. There were 57 removals in all of 2024, and another 57 removals in 2023.",
      "Thirty-four properties were determined to be ineligible for listing last year.",
      "Asked about Great River Road, as well as the spending and staffing cuts, the National Park Service says employees may need to take on additional responsibilities amid the cuts, offering the following written statement:",
      "\"National Park Service employees are deeply committed to preserving our public lands and serving visitors. At times, team members may step into a range of responsibilities outside their usual scope to help ensure continued access, safety, and stewardship across the park system. This flexibility reflects the dedication and collaborative spirit of our workforce.",
      "\"Our parks have long stood as symbols of our shared heritage, resilience, and natural beauty, and continue to offer inspiring experiences to millions of visitors each year. The National Park Service is focused on once again ensuring that every visitor has the chance to explore and connect with the incredible, iconic spaces of our national parks.",
      "\"We encourage travelers to do a bit of advance planning to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience. Our parks offer incredible natural beauty and recreational opportunities, and thoughtful preparation helps make the most of every visit. Checking Park alerts, reviewing maps, understanding site-specific guidelines, and planning for varying conditions are all great ways to support a positive and memorable trip. We appreciate everyone's cooperation in preserving these treasured places for all to enjoy.",

    "story": [
      "The Army is commemorating its 250th anniversary with a festival and parade in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, June 14, which is also President Trump's 79th birthday. The event, according to Army officials, is expected to include about 6,600 soldiers, as well as about 150 vehicles and over 50 aircraft in the celebration.",
      "Hundreds of thousands are expected to attend the festivities, D.C. officials told reporters in a briefing Monday.",
      "Here's what else to know:",
      "Why is the festival and parade being held on June 14?",
      "The Second Continental Congress, on June 14, 1775, voted to establish official companies following the fighting at Lexington and Concord against British troops. Congress voted to create the Continental Army and then on June 15 put George Washington as commander in chief.",
      "Planning has been in the works for almost two years to commemorate the anniversary with a festival, according to Army officials, but a parade was only added earlier this year. Army officials said the Army is not expected to officially recognize Mr. Trump's birthday.",
      "How much will the event cost?",
      "Army officials estimate the entire festival and parade could cost between $25 million and $45 million but did not disclose the cost before the parade was added to the schedule.",
      "When asked by members of Congress about the justification for the cost as the Trump administration has sought cuts across the federal government, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said the United States has an \"an amazing opportunity\" to tell a story about the Army.",
      "\"I believe very specifically that telling that story will directly lead to a recruiting boom that will fill up our pipeline for the coming years,\" Driscoll told the House Armed Services Committee.",
      "What is the parade route?",
      "On June 14, the festival will take place on the National Mall in D.C. from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. The parade will start at 6:30 p.m., running from 23rd Street NW along Constitution Avenue to 15th Street NW and wrap up around 7:30 p.m. A fireworks show will follow the parade at 9:45 p.m.",
      "When was the last time D.C. hosted a military parade?",
      "The most recent time D.C. hosted a military parade was in 1991, to mark the end of the Gulf War. The National Victory parade featured around 8,000 service members, and about 200,000 people watched the parade. According to The Washington Post, the event cost $8 million.",
      "How has the military prepared for the event?",
      "The Army has been laying down metal plates to prevent damage to D.C. roads by some of the heavier equipment like M1A1 Abrams tanks, which can weigh over 60 tons. If there is any damage to the roads, the Army has committed to pay for the repair.",
      "An Army spokesperson said the military will strategically place 1-inch steel plates \u2014 in sizes ranging from 4 feet by 8 feet to 8 feet by 20 feet \u2014 at points where the equipment will turn.",
      "U.S. Army Col. Jesse Curry, director of the Office of the Chief of Engineers, said during a security briefing on Monday that in addition to the plates, \"the tanks all have brand new rubber track pads placed on them, which increase the padding that they have underneath each track to minimize that potential damage, and it's a parade, so they're going to be moving slowly.\"",
      "What soldiers and equipment will participate?",
      "About 6,600 soldiers representing every era of the Army's 250 years of history are expected to participate in the parade, according to Army officials. In addition, the Army anticipates about 150 vehicles, and more than 50 aircraft will participate in the celebration.",
      "The parade will feature different eras of the Army's history, from the Revolutionary War to the modern era and into the future with corresponding uniforms and equipment.",
      "Army officials say among the equipment included will be 26 M1A1 Abrams tanks, 27 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, two World War II Sherman tanks, a World War I-era Renault tank, eight CH-47 helicopters, 16 UH-60 Black Hawks and four WWII-era P-51 aircraft.",

    "story": [
      "More than 85 million years ago, a smaller-bodied ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the plains of Mongolia. The dinosaur's identity was unknown \u2014 until now.",
      "In a study\u00a0published Wednesday in Nature, scientists describe the identification of a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",
      "\"This species, Khankhuuluu, is the missing link between smaller and earlier forms and the larger apex predatory tyrannosaurs,\" paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary and study co-author, told CBS News.",
      "The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

      "The Joro spider, Asian long-horned beetle and spotted lanternfly have company this summer.",
      "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting continues to spread across the U.S. and can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
      "Asian needle ants were first detected in the U.S. almost a century ago, but the species has continued to expand its reach, primarily throughout the Southeast, and this pest could potentially be deadly to humans, according to Dan Suiter, a professor of urban entomology at the University of Georgia.",
      "\"It injects venom that can harm you. Its sting can be life threatening,\" Suiter recently told the university.",
      "Suiter added that people who have adverse reactions to bee and ant stings are especially vulnerable and could go into anaphylactic shock from the needle ant's sting. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds of being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as a sting, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"If you suffer from anaphylaxis, you should really know what this ant looks like,\" Suiter says. \"And it might be smart to carry an EpiPen.\"",
      "Suiter urged people to be vigilant for these invasive species, especially with ant populations peaking later this summer.",
      "What are Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are technically known as Brachyponera chinensis\u00a0\u2014 roughly translated as \"short, wicked ant from China\" \u2014 but their native range also includes Japan and the Koreas, according to the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "The insect was first discovered in the U.S. in 1932 in Georgia, but has only recently started to \"cause problems in North America after being relatively unnoticed for many years,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "The pest has now been detected all the way from Washington state to Florida, according to the site\u00a0antmaps.org as well as Mississippi State University, and the ant is recently getting more attention in Texas.",
      "Suiter says Asian needle ants are \"sneaky\" because they are less than a quarter of an inch long and are adept at hiding.",
      "\"Unlike many invasive species that tend to colonize areas in the wake of natural or human disturbance, Asian needle ants are capable of invading undisturbed forest areas where they nest under and within logs and other debris, under stones, and in leaf litter,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "Environmental impacts",
      "According to Suiter, Asian needle ants wreak havoc in native environments.",
      "\"They outcompete other ant species that are important to the ecology of that area,\" he says.",
      "Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present.",
      "\"Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,\" the service says.",
      "What should people do if they see Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, \"so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,\" the service says.",
      "Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs, rotting wood or rocks where the ants can nest.",

    "summary": "A private lunar lander from Tokyo-based company ispace was aiming for a touchdown in the unexplored far north with a mini rover.",
    "story": [
      "Four-and-a-half months after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket, a privately-built Japanese lander attempted to touch down on the moon Thursday, but telemetry indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity moments before communications were lost. The data suggested a mission-ending crash landing.",
      "\"Based on the currently available data, the Mission Control Center has been able to confirm the following: The laser rangefinder used to measure the distance to the lunar surface experienced delays in obtaining valid measurement values,\" ispace, builder of the Resilience lander, said in a statement.",
      "\"As a result, the lander was unable to decelerate sufficiently to reach the required speed for the planned lunar landing. Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface.\"",
      "After unsuccessful attempts to re-establish communications, flight controllers in Tokyo uplinked commands to reboot the Resilience lander's flight computer. But there was no response.",
      "\"Given that there is currently no prospect of a successful lunar landing, our top priority is to swiftly analyze the telemetry data we have obtained thus far and work diligently to identify the cause,\" said ispace founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada.",
      "\"We will strive to restore trust by providing a report of the findings to our shareholders, payload customers, (mission) partners, government officials and all supporters of ispace.\"",
      "The landing attempt came two years after ispace's first lander malfunctioned during the final stages of its descent to the moon, making a similar hard landing. But Hakamada said it was too early to establish any common cause and that engineers needed more time to analyze the telemetry that made it back to Earth.",
      "Carrying cameras, a few science payloads, a tiny rover and even an art project, Resilience   fired its thrusters just after 2:10 p.m. EDT to begin the 66-minute descent from a 62-mile-high circular orbit to touchdown near the center of Mare Frigoris \u2014 the Sea of Cold \u2014 in the moon's northern hemisphere at 60 degrees north latitude.",
      "All appeared to be going smoothly when, around 3:17 p.m. \u2014 the projected landing time \u2014 telemetry suddenly ceased. The last data received indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity and an altitude of 630 feet above the surface.",
      "\"At this moment, we have not yet been able to establish communication with Resilience, but ispace engineers in our Mission Control Center are continuing to work to contact the lander,\" the company posted on X just after 5 p.m.",
      "\"We will share an update with the latest information in a media announcement in the next few hours. Thank you for your patience -- please check back with us soon.\" Three hours later, officials announced the landing failure during a news briefing.",
      "The primary goals of the mission were to land on the moon and deploy the small micro rover Tenacious. The rover, in turn, carried the art project, a tiny model of a Swedish house, designed by artist Mikael Genberg. The traditionally styled red-and-white house measures just 4.7 inches long, 4 inches high and weighs just 3.5 ounces.",
      "Asked why he took on the project, which required years of planning, fundraising and engineering, Genberg said \"we have done as human beings things from time to time that (do not) seemingly have a purpose beyond just being creative.\"",
      "\"The Eiffel Tower, for instance, I mean it's a stupid thing to build,\" he said. \"Today, it has a purpose as maybe the most important thing to make Paris the most visited city in the world.\"",
      "While the \"moonhouse\" could survive for thousands if not millions of years in the airless environment of the moon, its custom paint was expected to fade in the sun's harsh radiation, and lunar dust will slowly coat its surface. Genberg joked that he would happily await an invitation to repaint it.",
      "Ispace is one of a handful of companies attempting to provide non-government transportation services to the moon for a variety of payloads ranging from science instruments to technology demonstrations.",
      "But as it turns out, getting low-cost spacecraft to the moon's surface is extremely difficult.",
      "Ispace tried and\u00a0failed in 2023\u00a0when its first lander ran out of propellant nearing the surface, dropping to a \"hard\" crash landing. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology launched its\u00a0Peregrine lander in January 2024, but the spacecraft suffered a propulsion system leak and never made it to the moon.",
      "Houston-based Intuitive Machines successfully put two landers down on the lunar surface\u00a0in 2024, and again\u00a0earlier this year, but both spacecraft tipped over on touchdown. While each one survived its landing, neither was able to accomplish all of its pre-flight objectives.",
      "Before Thursday, only Firefly Aerospace had successfully touched down and carried out its mission, landing the\u00a0Blue Ghost spacecraft on March 2, 53 years after the final Apollo mission.",
      "Resilience and Blue Ghost\u00a0were launched atop a single SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 15. The Blue Ghost lander took a direct route to the moon and carried out a successful touchdown, operating for a full two-week lunar \"day.\"",

      "For more than a decade, Tribeca has been expanding its focus beyond cinema and television to include new avenues of storytelling through the use of virtual reality, augmented reality, and other nascent technologies, producing some vivid immersive displays. Even if the storytelling aspect of the programs were limited, the artistic expressions could be powerful. This was especially true with past exhibits that enveloped the viewer in massive spaces, in which computer-generated imagery or time-lapse photography placed the viewer in new worlds, from exploding galaxies to swirling blood vessels.",
      "Hosted under the umbrella title \"In Search of Us,\"\u00a0this year's installation in Lower Manhattan ties 11 projects together under the rubric of impacts on humanity \u2014 exploring topics from artificial intelligence to climate change, war, school shootings and transphobia. The exhibits with the most profound effects are those with the strongest and most emotional stories embedded inside them.",
      "Within a simple, delineated space furnished with minimal furniture, \"Fragile Home,\" by Ond\u0159ej Moravec and Victoria Lopukhina, uses mixed reality to recreate a home in Ukraine that comes under bombardment. Wearing goggles, the viewer walks through a comfortable, well-appointed living room, past a dinner table and a purring cat, and looks outside the window to a peaceful vista \u2014 all of which, in a flash, is replaced by the home's bombed-out remains, vandalized with Russian forces' \"Z\" graffiti.",
      "The sense of violation is made so powerful in so simple a setting \u2014 and the recognition that such destruction is multiplied millions of times over is heart-wrenching. But the objects that survived \u2014 those with personal meaning to just a handful of people \u2013 become representations of resilience to many.",

In between avoiding bombs and gunfire, the dog helps guide the souls of those killed to become reincarnated. It's a meditative view of cruel violations impacting humanity and nature.",
      "Armed with a tablet, viewers of the augmented reality \"There Goes Nikki\" can wander a garden populated by virtual flowers, and a visualization of the late poet Nikki Giovanni reciting her poem, \"Quilting the Black-eyed Pea (We're going to Mars).\" By Idris Brewster, Michele Stephenson and Joe Brewster.",
      "How dangerous is artificial intelligence? How dumb is it? How snarky?\u00a0 \"AI & Me: The Confessional and AI Ego,\" directed by Daniela Nedovescu and Octavian Mot, provides viewers with an opportunity to become test subjects, as it were, to AI's judgmental streak. Upon sitting in a chair, the participant is captured on camera and analyzed by AI, which conjures up your name, personality traits, and goals. How close are they to reality? Prepare to get snarked. But if the AI program \"likes\" you? Your AI-altered image will turn up in its pantheon of favored carbon-based units (pictured above, right).",

      "One of the strongest impacts of any installation was made by \"In the Current of Being,\" by Cameron Kostopoulos. Using haptic VR, the viewer is literally strapped into a chair; electrodes are attached to your fingertips, arms, and torso, along with VR goggles. Interesting, you think. Then, the presentation begins, recounting the true story of a survivor of electroshock conversion therapy. (As a teenager, Carolyn Mercer had been \"treated\" with electrical shocks in an attempt to \"cure\" her from becoming trans.) As images of female beauty are flashed before you, electrical impulses throb across your body. This is not virtual reality; the extreme discomfort is very real, forcing me out of the presentation less than halfway through. The upshot: aversion therapy works, because I will never allow VR electrodes to be attached to my body ever again.",
      "Beyond the confines of\u00a0 the exhibition space at 161 Water Street, the two-part \"The Power Loom and The Founders Pillars\" (by Lesiba Mabitsela, Meghna Singh and Simon Wood) includes a site-specific AR experience, visible on a mobile app six blocks away, at the New York Stock Exchange, creating a memorial to enslaved people once sold at the Wall Street Slave Market, established in the 18th century.",

    "story": [
      "Apple kicked off its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday with an array of announcements on new features coming this fall via iOS 26, its latest operating system upgrade. Leading the pack is a new user interface enhancement called Liquid Glass.",
      "CEO Tim Cook and other Apple executives used words like \"beautiful,\" \"gorgeous\" and \"delightful\" to describe changes on the horizon for its devices. And while they emphasized a fresh user interface and elevated app features, they also reassured users that the tools would remain familiar and accessible.",
      "Read on for details on the latest bells and whistles coming to Apple's user interface.",
      "iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26",
      "Apple is adopting a new nomenclature for identifying its operating systems, one that is more straightforward than its previous numbering system. Rather than iOS 19, Apple's next iPhone iOS will be called iOS 26 to align with the upcoming year. iOS 26, along with iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 261 are slated to be released as free updates in September 2025.",
      "In addition to new design elements detailed below, iOS 26 will elevate the capabilities of existing apps including Facetime, Photos, Safari and Carplay.",
      "There's also a splashy update to iPhone photo display: With iOS 26, users will\u00a0 be able to view pictures in 3D across the Photos app, lock screen and home screen.",
      "Apple is also making changes to its messages app. Texters with iOS 26 will be able to change the background, or wallpaper, of a chat conversation. The feature is similar to the \"chat theme\" setting on WhatsApp but with more options. In group chats, dots will appear to indicate who is typing \u2014 something previously reserved for one-on-one chats. Texters will also be able create and share polls directly in group messages.",
      "Filtering texts and calls will also become a lot easier with a new screening feature.",
      "\"Unknown senders appear in a dedicated area where you can decide if you want to mark the number as known, ask for more information or delete until you accept messages from unknown senders will remain silenced and won't appear as notifications,\" said Darin Adler, a vice president at Apple.",
      "When you receive a call from an unknown number, Apple will answer the phone silently, record the caller's name and the reason for their call, and then put their response into a written message for the owner of the phone so they can decide whether they want to actually pick up.",
      "There is a slight catch to keep in mind: These new iOS26 features will be reserved for iPhone 11 and later models.",
      "Design upgrades, including Liquid Glass",
      "Alan Dye, Apple's vice president of human interface design, calls the new OS, the company's \u00a0\"broadest design update ever.\"",
      "A hallmark feature of the new OS is\u00a0Liquid Glass, described by the company as an \"expressive material\" meant to mimic the qualities of glass. The dynamic new interface make apps, widgets and docs appear translucent, allowing users to see multiple layers of their screen at once.",
      "Liquid Glass also creates more movement on your interface by morphing into your display. For example, as messages pop up on your home screen, the time display starts to shrink to accommodate them. The color of Liquid Glass also shifts depending on the content on your screen and adapts between light and dark environments.",
      "\"From navigating apps to system experiences like the lock screen notifications and control center app icons have been crafted with multiple layers of Liquid Glass and come to life in light mode, dark mode, colorful, new tints, or an all new clear look,\" said Dye during the company's keynote Monday.",
      "Apple Intelligence",
      "Apple also delivered long-awaited updates to Apple Intelligence, the company's artificial intelligence system that's now integrated with ChatGPT. AI-powered features arriving this fall include Live Translation, which automatically translates messages as they're being received.",
      "\"So if you're making plans with some new friends while studying abroad, your message can be translated as you type and delivered in their preferred language, and when they respond, each text can be instantly translated for you,\" said Leslie Ikemoto, an engineering director at Apple said at the conference Monday.",
      "Visual Intelligence, another AI tool, allows users to take a screenshot of an image they see online \u2014 say, a cute sweater they come across on one of their apps \u2014 and then look up where to find a similar design online. They can also ask ChatGPT specific questions about the image, such as, keeping with the example of the sweater, \"What material is this made of?\"",
      "Another feature builds on Apple broad selection of emojis by giving users the power to combine and personalize existing emojis to create their own unique expressions. In their presentation, Apple showed how someone could merge the lightbulb emoji with the sloth emoji to indicate they were the last one to get a joke, for example.",
      "Still lingering on Apple's to do list is new AI integrations for Siri. Apple introduced updates to the voice assistant at last year's conference, but the full suite of upgrades for the voice assistant have yet to take effect. \"We're continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,\" said senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi on Monday. \"This work needed more time to reach our high quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.\"",

    "summary": "We asked three experts what fresh college graduates can do to prepare as artificial intelligence changes how Americans work. Here's what they said.",
    "story": [
      "New college graduates this year face an especially daunting task \u2014 putting their degrees to work just as \"generative\" artificial intelligence technology like ChatGPT is beginning to change the American workplace.",
      "\"We are entering an entirely new economy, so the knowledge economy that we have been in for the last 50 years or so is on the way out, and a new economy is on the way in,\" Aneesh Raman, Chief Economic Opportunity Officer at LinkedIn, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The impact of AI on Americans recently out of college is already visible across a range of industries and jobs, from technology and finance to media, legal fields and market research. As a result, for the first time\u00a0unemployment among fresh grads recently surpassed the nation's overall jobless rate \u2014 a shift some experts attribute in part to the creeping influence of AI.",
      "\"There are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates than the roles above them,\" said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "With the adoption of AI at work only expected to accelerate, we asked three experts across academia, recruitment and consulting for advice on how new college grads should navigate this new normal. Here's what they said.",
      "Become fluent in AI",
      "Perhaps most important, young job-seekers start using gen-AI tools \u2014 today.",
      "\"Almost anybody in that audience, irrespective of the job that they're pursuing, will be expected to use AI with some facility right away,\" said Joseph Fuller, a professor at Harvard Business School and founder of the Managing the Future of Work\u00a0project, comparing the task to learning how to use Microsoft Office for a previous generation of grads.",
      "To get the ball rolling, experts encourage those who are starting to hunt for work to familiarize themselves with the array of tools at their disposal, such as Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's ChatGPT. That means learning how to engage with such tools beyond simply using them as a search engine.",
      "\"You want to get in a dialogue with it,\" Fuller said. \"You want to ask it to take different perspectives.\"",
      "Emily Rose McRae, an analyst at research and advisory firm Gartner, said learning how to use AI apps can also be a good way to develop transferable skills. For example, asking AI to summarize documents and then validating its findings to ensure accuracy.",
      "Meanwhile, although AI can be helpful when it comes time to filling out job applications, users should proceed with caution given that recruiters can often spot AI-generated language, experts note. Nearly two-thirds of job candidates today use AI at some point in the application process, according to a\u00a0report from recruitment firm Career Group Companies.",
      "\"If you're using it to write your cover letter and your resume and you did not review it, everyone can tell,\" McRae said.",
      "Another way to gain potentially valuable experience with AI, while also seeking work, is for interview practice. For example, users can ask the chatbot both to provide sample questions they might face in an interview and then rate the quality of their responses.",
      "\"If you are using it as a tool to get your own understanding of self in interviews, you're going to start being leaps ahead of everyone else,\" Raman said.",
      "Hone your soft skills",
      "Experts say that as AI surpasses humans in executing certain tasks \u2014 think actuarial math or corporate compliance, for example \u2014more attention will shift to job candidates' so-called soft skills, such as problem solving and communication.",
      "\"You cannot outsource your thinking to AI,\" LinkedIn's Raman said. \"You have to continue to hone critical thinking and complex strategy thinking.\"",
      "The focus will be less on your pedigree \u2014 where you went to school or even whether you have a college degree \u2014 he added, and more on what he calls the \"5 Cs\": curiosity, compassion, creativity, courage and communication.",
      "To improve their soft skills, Fuller encourages entry-level job candidates to work on turning what they regard as their biggest weakness into a strength. For instance, if you typically shy away from public speaking or talking in groups, push yourself to get comfortable in those situations.",
      "\"The inability to do that is going to be penalized more severely in the work of the future than it has been in the past,\" he said.",
      "The Harvard professor also suggested highlighting examples of advanced social skills directly on your resume to help paint a picture for recruiters of how you can contribute to the workplace.",
      "Choose your employer wisely",
      "Beyond skills development, experts say college grads should be thoughtful about the type of company they choose to work at, knowing that AI could drastically alter the business in the coming years.",
      "\"The most important thing, if you're a new grad, is where you work \u2014 not what you do at the place you're going to work,\" Raman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He encouraged college graduates to seek out employers that are integrating AI responsibly and with respect for their workforce \u2014 as opposed to embracing it chiefly to replace people. Companies that are adapting to what is a major technological shift in real time will typically offer the best opportunities for learning and growth, Fuller said.",
      "In evaluating a prospective employer, young job candidates should try to gain an understanding of how they fit into the company's future. For example, McRae recommends asking hiring managers up front what types of investments the organization is making in its employees and what the room for growth looks like.",
      "\"What are they telling me they care about? What do career paths look like for this role like now? How do you help people develop the skills they need to become experts?\" she said.",
      "In researching companies, McRae also encouraged recent college grads to look for places that offer apprenticeship or rotational programs, which can offer ways to quickly ramp up their knowledge base, especially if traditional entry-level roles are in short supply.",

    "summary": "Meta platforms such as Instagram have marketed AI tools that let users create sexually explicit images of real people.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has removed a number of ads promoting \"nudify\" apps \u2014 AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfakes using images of real people \u2014 after a CBS News investigation found hundreds of such advertisements on its platforms.",
      "\"We have strict rules against non-consensual intimate imagery; we removed these ads, deleted the Pages responsible for running them and permanently blocked the URLs associated with these apps,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "CBS News uncovered dozens of those ads on Meta's Instagram platform, in its \"Stories\" feature, promoting AI tools that, in many cases, advertised the ability to \"upload a photo\" and \"see anyone naked.\" Other ads in Instagram's Stories promoted the ability to upload and manipulate videos of real people. One promotional ad even read \"how is this filter even allowed?\" as text underneath an example of a nude deepfake.",
      "One ad promoted its AI product by using highly sexualized, underwear-clad deepfake images of actors Scarlett Johansson and Anne Hathaway. Some of the ads' URL links redirect to websites that promote the ability to animate real people's images and get them to perform sex acts. And some of the applications charged users between $20 and $80 to access these \"exclusive\" and \"advance\" features. In other cases, an ad's URL redirected users to Apple's app store, where \"nudify\" apps were available to download.",
      "An analysis of the advertisements in Meta's ad library found that there were, at a minimum, hundreds of these ads available across the company's social media platforms, including on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, the Facebook Messenger application and Meta Audience Network \u2014 a platform that allows Meta advertisers to reach users on mobile apps and websites that partner with the company.",
      "According to Meta's own Ad Library data, many of these ads were specifically targeted at men between the ages of 18 and 65, and were active in the United States, European Union and United Kingdom.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told CBS News the spread of this sort of AI-generated content is an ongoing problem and they are facing increasingly sophisticated challenges in trying to combat it.",
      "\"The people behind these exploitative apps constantly evolve their tactics to evade detection, so we're continuously working to strengthen our enforcement,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "CBS News found that ads for \"nudify\" deepfake tools were still available on the company's Instagram platform even after Meta had removed those initially flagged.",
      "Deepfakes are manipulated images, audio recordings, or videos of real people that have been altered with artificial intelligence to misrepresent someone as saying or doing something that the person did not actually say or do.",
      "Last month, President Trump signed into law the bipartisan \"Take It Down Act,\" which, among other things, requires websites and social media companies to remove deepfake content within 48 hours of notice from a victim.",
      "Although the law makes it illegal to \"knowingly publish\" or threaten to publish intimate images without a person's consent, including AI-created deepfakes, it does not target the tools used to create such AI-generated content.",
      "Those tools do violate platform safety and moderation rules implemented by both Apple and Meta on their respective platforms.",
      "Meta's advertising standards policy says, \"ads must not contain adult nudity and sexual activity. This includes nudity, depictions of people in explicit or sexually suggestive positions, or activities that are sexually suggestive.\"",
      "Under Meta's \"bullying and harassment\" policy, the company also prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company says its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share nonconsensual intimate imagery.",
      "Apple's guidelines for its app store explicitly state that \"content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy\" is banned.",
      "Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell University's tech research center, has been studying the surge in AI deepfake networks marketing on social platforms for more than a year. He told CBS News in a phone interview on Tuesday that he'd seen thousands more of these ads across Meta platforms, as well as on platforms such as X and Telegram, during that period.",
      "Although Telegram and X have what he described as a structural \"lawlessness\" that allows for this sort of content, he believes Meta's leadership lacks the will to address the issue, despite having content moderators in place.",
      "\"I do think that trust and safety teams at these companies care. I don't think, frankly, that they care at the very top of the company in Meta's case,\" he said. \"They're clearly under-resourcing the teams that have to fight this stuff, because as sophisticated as these [deepfake] networks are \u2026 they don't have Meta money to throw at it.\"",
      "Mantzarlis also said that he found in his research that \"nudify\" deepfake generators are available to download on both Apple's app store and Google's Play store, expressing frustration with these massive platforms' inability to enforce such content.",
      "\"The problem with apps is that they have this dual-use front where they present on the app store as a fun way to face swap, but then they are marketing on Meta as their primary purpose being nudification. So when these apps come up for review on the Apple or Google store, they don't necessarily have the wherewithal to ban them,\" he said.",
      "\"There needs to be cross-industry cooperation where if the app or the website markets itself as a tool for nudification on any place on the web, then everyone else can be like, 'All right, I don't care what you present yourself as on my platform, you're gone,'\" Mantzarlis added.",
      "CBS News has reached out to both Apple and Google for comment as to how they moderate their respective platforms. Neither company had responded by the time of writing.",
      "Major tech companies' promotion of such apps raises serious questions about both user consent and about online safety for minors. A CBS News analysis of one \"nudify\" website promoted on Instagram showed that the site did not prompt any form of age verification prior to a user uploading a photo to generate a deepfake image.",
      "Such issues are widespread. In December, CBS News' 60 Minutes reported on the lack of age verification on one of the most popular sites using artificial intelligence to generate fake nude photos of real people.",
      "Despite visitors being told that they must be 18 or older to use the site, and that \"processing of minors is impossible,\" 60 Minutes was able to immediately gain access to uploading photos once the user clicked \"accept\" on the age warning prompt, with no other age verification necessary.",
      "Data also shows that a high percentage of underage teenagers have interacted with deepfake content. A March 2025 study conducted by the children's protection nonprofit Thorn showed that among teens, 41% said they had heard of the term \"deepfake nudes,\" while 10% reported personally knowing someone who had had deepfake nude imagery created of them.",

      "What should I do if I get an unexpected payment or request on Venmo?",
      "With the proliferation on online scams, Venmo encourages its users to play it safe. If you get a payment from a stranger, Venmo says you should not accept the transfer, but instead contact the app's\u00a0support team.",
      "Likewise, payment requests from suspicious accounts, or people you don't know, should also be declined, the company says.",
      "\"In some cases, you may receive a payment request from someone who appears to be a friend or relative,\" Venmo warns on its website. \"This can be a common scam tactic, so we recommend contacting your friend or family member outside of Venmo to confirm the legitimacy of the request before taking any action.\"",

      "To limit the number of people who can see your transactions, you can switch your privacy settings to \"Friends only\" or \"Private.\" The \"Friends only\" setting makes your payment transactions visible to Venmo friends only.

      "If you're paying or requesting money from someone who has different privacy setting than you, Venmo will default to whoever's setting is more restrictive.",

      "More than three centuries after a legendary Spanish galleon loaded with treasure sank off the coast of Colombia, researches have uncovered new details about gold coins found scattered around the shipwreck.",
      "Dubbed the\u00a0\"holy grail\" of shipwrecks, the San Jose galleon was sunk by the British navy near Cartagena in 1708, killing most of the roughly 600 crewmembers on board. The ship was believed to be holding gold, silver, gemstones and other treasure worth billions of dollars.",

The coins feature depictions of castles, lions and crosses on the front and the \"Crowned Pillars of Hercules\" above ocean waves on the back, according to a new study published Tuesday in the journal\u00a0Antiquity.",
      "Researchers, including experts from Colombia's navy, studied images taken by remotely operated vehicles of dozens of coins that are scattered around the shipwreck nearly 2,000 feet below the ocean's surface. The study's authors said the exact number of coins on the seabed is difficult to determine \"due to the dynamic nature of the site.\" But an analysis of high-resolution images from the remotely operated vehicles shows each coin's average diameter is 32.5 millimeters and weighs roughly 27 grams.",

This case is about false accusations of sexual harassment and retaliation and a nonexistent smear campaign, which Ms. Lively\u2019s own team conveniently describes as \u2018untraceable\u2019 because they cannot prove what never happened.\"",

      "His ex, who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" told prosecutors that there were times she felt coerced into hotel nights with Diddy and that the Bad Boy Records founder still pays for both her legal fees and rent.",

      "\"Jane Doe commented on the consistency between her experience and that of Cassie Ventura after she read Ventura\u2019s civil lawsuit,\" Beidel said. \"If the jury also finds the two women\u2019s experiences similar, Jane Doe\u2019s testimony becomes powerful corroboration of Ventura\u2019s testimony. Adding in the voice memos could lend even more credence to the two women\u2019s accounts, as those voice memos are evidence of Mr. Combs\u2019 views at the time in his own words.\"",
      "Jane told the court that Diddy asked her about coercion after he allegedly forced her to take drugs before having sex with a male escort. She testified about Diddy's alleged violent behavior and said he once put her in a chokehold after kicking and punching her. The jury was shown video evidence of Jane's injuries, which included a bruised eye and welts on her forehead.",
      "Texts shown in federal court on Monday between Diddy and Jane revealed that she felt manipulated and wanted monetary income.",
      "The rapper allegedly texted Jane back, \"F--- you.\" Jane allegedly told Diddy, \"You're the only opportunist ... you had three years of fun with my body ... you were a full time job and consumed my life.\" The \"Last Night\" rapper allegedly texted back that he was blocking Jane's number and also calling the police.",

      "Diddy listened to testimony from an ex-girlfriend, who testified under the nickname \"Jane.\" (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"Early in the trial, the prosecutors introduced extensive evidence to support their theory that Combs used violence and threats of violence to coerce Ventura into engaging in sexual activity,\" former federal prosecutor Mark Chutkow told Fox News Digital. \"However, the prosecution\u2019s evidence of Jane Doe\u2019s alleged coercion centers more on emotional manipulation than violence.\u00a0That could prove to be a weakness for the prosecution case because Jane\u2019s evidence was introduced later in the trial, closer to when the jurors will deliberate.\"",
      "Mark Chuktow, who now practices at Dykema, added, \"As a result, it might dilute the impact of Ventura\u2019s earlier testimony because Jane\u2019s evidence is less clear-cut regarding whether Combs coerced her to engage in sexual activity.\u00a0To counter this, the prosecutors might put more weight in closing arguments on the evidence that Combs blackmailed both women into complying with his sexual demands through threats of destroying their reputations and careers by publicly exposing the video recordings of their participation in the freak-offs.",

      "Diddy then allegedly grabbed Jane by the hair and her arm and dragged her back into the house, saying she was \"f---ing crazy.\" She claimed to keep asking him to leave.",
      "\"Jane\u2019s testimony is more of the same in regards to the defendant\u2019s conduct, and it certainly does not paint a good picture of Mr. Combs,\" Los Angeles litigator John J.

However, they are unlikely to be shocked by Jane\u2019s testimony given what everyone else has said thus far.",

      "The bill would also eliminate federal Grad PLUS loans, a program used by graduate-level and professional students to pay for their studies, which can be used for graduate students\u2019 entire cost of attendance.",
      "It would instead keep in place a $20,500 annual limit for Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans on graduate degrees, capped at $100,000 total, excluding undergraduate loans. For professional degrees, it keeps a $50,000 annual unsubsidized loan limit and a $200,000 total cap.",

Instead of traditional version numbers, Apple is now using the year after release as the version name. So the new names are iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26 and visionOS 26.

      "Atom Bodies' flagship product, Atom Touch, is setting a new standard in prosthetic arms. Unlike traditional prosthetics, which often offer only basic movement and can be uncomfortable to wear, Atom Touch uses EMG (electromyography) sensors placed on the user's skin to detect muscle activity. These signals are then interpreted by machine-learning algorithms, allowing users to control individual fingers, the wrist and the elbow with remarkable precision just by thinking about the movement they want to make.",

It is the first prosthetic arm to offer true individual finger movement, which means users can perform tasks like typing, gripping and delicate manipulation with much greater ease. The device uses the Atom A1 AI neural interface, which learns from the user's muscle signals to provide seamless, natural movement. Dozens of sensors in the hand generate haptic feedback, so users can better gauge grip strength and control. With more than 10 motors in the hand alone, Atom Touch offers a near-human range of motion and dexterity. The load-balanced harness system also makes the arm lighter than a human arm and comfortable enough for extended wear, addressing a challenge that many current prosthetics have yet to solve.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Apple\u2019s iPad has a strong reputation for security. Thanks to the system architecture of iOS, a non-jailbroken iPad isn\u2019t susceptible to typical viruses or malware infections. However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s completely safe from every threat. As with any computer, there are still vulnerabilities that determined hackers can exploit.",
      "iPads are generally secure devices, but it\u2019s still possible for hackers to gain access, so knowing the warning signs of a hacked iPad can help you act quickly to protect your data. Moreover, an iPad often contains a lot of personal information about you and your family, so if it\u2019s ever hacked, it can be quite alarming.",

      "How to tell if your iPad has been hacked",
      "Be on the lookout for these signs that could indicate your iPad\u2019s security has been compromised:",
      "If your iPad suddenly feels more like a sluggish turtle than the speedy device it used to be, that\u2019s a warning sign. When a device is hacked, malicious software might be running in the background, using up memory and processing power. This can make apps slow to open, cause lagging or freezing and even lead to more frequent crashes. You might also notice the battery draining much faster than usual along with the slowdown, since unwanted software can chew through battery life while it secretly runs in the background.",
      "A sudden flood of pop-up ads or strange messages on your iPad screen is a big red flag. Under normal circumstances, iPads should not bombard you with random pop-ups, especially outside of safe apps or websites. If you start seeing lots of unsolicited ads or \"Your iPad is hacked!\" alerts popping up, it could mean an adware program or scam has found its way onto the device. These pop-ups might try to trick you or your kids into clicking links or downloading something harmful, so they\u2019re not just annoying, they\u2019re dangerous signs that something is wrong.",
      "An Apple iPad (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO PROTECT AN IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE 2025",
      "Keep an eye on how the iPad is using the internet. An unusual spike in data usage or constant network activity (even when no one is actively using the iPad) might indicate the device is secretly sending or receiving information without your permission. For example, if your data plan suddenly maxes out or you notice the Wi-Fi icon flickering with activity when the iPad is idle, it could be a sign that a hacker\u2019s software is communicating in the background. Such suspicious network activity is concerning because it suggests someone else might be remotely accessing the iPad or siphoning off personal data.",
      "HOW TO TRANSFER INFO FROM AN OLD IPAD TO A NEW IPAD",
      "One clear warning sign is finding changes to your Apple account that you didn\u2019t make. If your Apple ID password was changed without your knowledge or you receive security alerts about logins you never did, be wary; a hacker may have gained access to your account.",
      "You might also discover that account details or settings (like your recovery email or trusted phone number) have been altered.

      "If you suspect your iPad has been hacked, taking immediate action can secure your device and give you peace of mind. Here are a few basic steps to help you respond:",
      "1) Reset your passwords: Change your Apple ID password right away (and any other important account passwords used on the iPad) to lock out any intruders. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Remove unfamiliar apps: Check the iPad for any apps you or your child didn\u2019t install. If you find an unknown app or a suspicious profile, delete it immediately. This helps eliminate any malicious programs the hacker may have added. To do this, open\u00a0Settings, tap\u00a0General\u00a0>\u00a0iPad Storage, scroll to find the unfamiliar app, tap\u00a0it, then tap\u00a0Delete App and confirm.",
      "3) Update iOS: Make sure the iPad is running the latest version of iPadOS. Apple frequently releases security updates to fix vulnerabilities, so\u00a0updating the software can shut down any loopholes the hacker might have used. Turning on automatic updates is a good idea to stay protected going forward.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication: If you haven\u2019t already,\u00a0turn on two-factor authentication for your Apple ID account. This feature adds an extra verification step (like a code sent to your phone) whenever someone tries to sign in, which can stop hackers in their tracks even if they somehow know your password. It\u2019s an excellent safeguard to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus protection on all devices: Malware, spyware and viruses can run quietly in the background or compromise enough data before it is discovered. While not being hacked in the first place is the best position to be in, it is worse to give access to your iPad\u2019s data to a hacker for a prolonged period of time. That\u2019s why having strong antivirus software running consistently in the background of your device is a great way to prevent compromises from happening in the first place.\u00a0Best antivirus security software and apps to protect you.",

      "It\u2019s important to remember that many of these symptoms can have innocent explanations, so don\u2019t panic at the first sign of trouble. For example, a new iOS update or a heavy app can temporarily slow down your iPad\u2019s performance, so one isolated issue doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019ve been hacked. However, if you notice multiple warning signs at the same time or anything that just doesn\u2019t feel right, it\u2019s best to act quickly and err on the side of caution.",

      "If you've ever dreamed of gliding underwater with the freedom of a dolphin, the CudaJet might be the gadget for you. Unlike most underwater propulsion systems that strap onto your arms or legs, the CudaJet is worn like a backpack, giving you a hands-free way to cruise beneath the surface. It's a fresh approach that feels a lot more natural and comfortable, especially for longer swims.",
      "The CudaJet's story started almost seven years ago. Back then, it was just a prototype called the Cuda, a passion project by British designer Archie O'Brien during his final year at Loughborough College of Art and Design, now known as Loughborough Design School. Archie wanted something lighter and faster than anything else out there, and in 2023 his vision became reality with the first commercial CudaJet.",

      "So, what's it like to use? The main unit is a dual-jet-drive pack that attaches to a padded neoprene harness, which you wear on your torso. You control everything with a hardwired, trigger-style remote that lets you adjust your speed and keep an eye on the battery level. One of the biggest improvements for 2025 is the battery. While the original model provided approximately 40 minutes of underwater fun for every 75-minute charge, the latest version extends that time to a full 90 minutes per charge. That's more than double the original runtime, so you can explore even more on a single outing.",
      "CudaJet can take you down to a maximum depth of 131 feet, and it delivers about 88 pounds of thrust. That translates to a top speed of roughly 10 feet per second, or about 6.7 mph. Now, that might not sound fast on land, but underwater it's a whole different story. The company likes to point out that at 10 feet per second, the drag force on your body is about the same as flying through air at nearly 200 mph. It's an exhilarating experience that feels powerful and smooth.",
      "The 2025 redesign also trimmed some weight from the original, reducing it from approximately 33 pounds to just over 30 pounds, including the harness. The harness itself comes in four sizes, so you can get a fit that feels just right. Safety is clearly a priority as well. Each CudaJet ships with a factory-set safety depth of about 10 feet, which you can adjust up to the full 131 feet if you're feeling adventurous. If you ever go past your set limit, the motor cuts out and floats you right back to the surface. The controller's full-color display keeps you updated on your speed, battery and depth at all times.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Online scams thrive on the urgency and fear of their victims. If you've ever been a victim of a scam, you\u2019d know that bad actors often try to rush you into taking action by creating a sense of fear. A scammer may call you impersonating a government agency and claim your Social Security number has been linked to drug trafficking.",
      "A phishing email might ask you to update your tax details or claim you\u2019ve won a lottery or a free product, all to get you to click a malicious link.",
      "A more effective tactic scammers use is sending fake login alerts. These are warnings that someone has logged into your account, prompting you to take immediate action. This method works well because legitimate services like Google, Apple, Netflix and Facebook also send these types of notifications when someone, including you, logs in from a new device. It can be tricky to tell the difference.",
      "As Robert from Danville asks, \"I constantly get in my spam junk folder emails saying 'someone has logged into your account.' Is this spam? legitimate? concerning? How do I know? How to avoid wasting time checking? How do I check?\"",
      "Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals \u2014 plus instant access to my\u00a0free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up!",
      "Thanks for writing to us, Robert. I completely understand how tricky it can be to figure out whether these messages are legitimate or just another scam attempt. Let's break down what these urgent warnings usually look like and go over a few ways you can stay safe.",
      "A person logging into a Gmail account on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How login alert scams work and why they\u2019re so effective",
      "Scammers often pose as login alerts from Google, Apple, Meta or even your bank, complete with official-looking logos, because fear is effective. But not every alert is a scam. In many cases, these notifications are legitimate and can help you detect unauthorized access to your accounts. Let\u2019s focus on the scam side first.",
      "Login alert scams have been around for a while. Early reports date back to 2021, and the trend has persisted since then. In 2022, reports surfaced that scammers were impersonating Meta and sending phishing emails to users.",
      "FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE",
      "One such email used a clean layout with minimal text. It avoided the usual scare tactics and stuck to a simple message. But that is not always the case. A common red flag in phishing attempts is the tendency to overload the email with unnecessary details. These messages often include cluttered formatting, excessive explanations and an increasing number of typos or design errors. One phishing email simply gets to the point:",
      "Someone tried to Iog into Your Account, User lD",
      "A user just logged into your Facebook account from a new device Samsung S21. We are sending you this email to verify it\u2019s really you.",
      "Thanks,",
      "The Facebook Team",
      "What\u2019s concerning now is that poor grammar is no longer a reliable sign of a scam. Thanks to AI, even those with limited English skills can write emails that sound polished and professional. As a result, many phishing messages today read just like legitimate emails from trusted companies.",
      "Receiving a phishing email is not the real issue. The real problem starts when you click on it. Most of these emails contain links that lead to fake login pages, designed to look exactly like platforms such as Facebook, Google or your bank.",
      "If you enter your credentials there, they go directly to the scammer. In some cases, simply clicking the link can trigger a malware download, especially if your browser is outdated or your device lacks proper security. Once inside, attackers can steal personal information, monitor your activity or take control of your accounts.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DON'T CLICK THAT LINK! HOW TO SPOT AND PREVENT PHISHING ATTACKS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "How to tell if a login alert is real or fake",
      "Real login notifications\u00a0do exist; they\u2019re just much less scary. A genuine alert from Google, Apple or Microsoft will come from an official address (for example, no-reply@accounts.google.com or security@apple.com) and use consistent branding. The tone is factual and helpful.",
      "For instance, a legit Google security alert might say, \"We detected a login from a new sign-in to your Google Account on a Pixel 6 Pro device. If this was you, you don't need to do anything. If not, we'll help you secure your account.\"\u00a0\u00a0It may include a \"Check activity\" button, but that link always redirects to a google.com address, and it won\u2019t prompt you to reenter your password via the email link. Similarly, Apple notes it will never ask for passwords or verification codes via email.",
      "Legitimate Google notification\u00a0 (Google)",
      "FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE",
      "What to do if you get a suspicious login alert email",
      "1. Don\u2019t click any links or attachments and use strong antivirus software: Instead, manually log in to the real site (or open the official app) by typing the URL or using a bookmarked link. This guarantees you\u2019re not walking into a scammer\u2019s trap. The FTC recommends this: if you have an account with that company, contact them via the website or phone number you know is real,\u00a0not the info in the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Remove your data from the internet: Scammers are able to send you targeted messages because your data, like your email address or phone number, is already out there. This often happens due to past data breaches and shady data brokers. A data removal service can help clean up your digital trail by removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. It\u2019s not a quick fix, but over time, it reduces how easily scammers can find and target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "3. Check your account activity:\u00a0Go to your account\u2019s security or sign-in page. Services like Gmail, iCloud or your bank let you review recent logins and devices. If you see nothing unusual, you\u2019re safe. If you do find a strange login, follow the site\u2019s process (usually changing your password and logging out all devices). Even if you don\u2019t find anything odd, change your password as a precaution. Do it through the official site or app, not the email. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): This is your best backup. With\u00a02FA enabled, even if someone has your password, they can\u2019t gain access without your phone and an additional second factor. Both Google and Apple make 2FA easy and say it \"makes it harder for scammers\" to hijack your account.",
      "5. Report suspicious emails: If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from a specific organization, report it to that organization\u2019s official support or security team so they can take appropriate action.",
      "THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING WRONG WHEN SCAMMERS CALL",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You shouldn\u2019t have to vet every sketchy email. In fact, your email\u2019s spam filters catch most phishing attempts for you. Keep them enabled, and make sure your software is up to date so that malicious sites and attachments are blocked. Still, the most powerful filter is your own awareness. You're definitely not alone in this. People receive these spammy login scares every day. By keeping a cool head and following the steps above, you're already ahead of the game.",

    "summary": "E-BAR, MIT&apos;s mobile robot, provides physical support for seniors with handlebars that follow from behind, helping prevent falls while maintaining dignity for aging adults.",
    "story": [
      "E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users.",
      "The demographic landscape in the U.S. is shifting rapidly, with the median age now at 38.9, almost a decade older than it was in 1980.",
      "By 2050, the population of adults over 65 is projected to surge from 58 million to 82 million, intensifying the already urgent challenge of eldercare. With falls remaining the top cause of injury among older adults, the need for innovative, tech-driven solutions has never been clearer.",
      "MIT engineers are stepping up to this challenge with E-BAR, a mobile robot designed to physically support seniors and prevent falls as they move around their homes.",
      "Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts, and exclusive deals \u2014 plus instant access to my\u00a0free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up!",
      "An individual demonstrating the E-BAR. (MIT)",
      "How MIT\u2019s E-BAR robot helps prevent falls and support senior mobility",
      "E-BAR, short for\u00a0Elderly Bodily Assistance Robot, is not your typical assistive device. Rather than relying on harnesses or wearables, which many seniors find cumbersome or stigmatizing, E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users from behind. This allows individuals to walk freely, lean on the robot's arms for support or receive full-body assistance when transitioning between sitting and standing. The robot's articulated body, constructed from 18 interconnected bars, mimics the natural movement of the human body, delivering a seamless and intuitive experience.",
      "AI ROBOTS HELP NURSES BEAT BURNOUT AND TRANSFORM HOSPITAL CARE",
      "The engineering behind E-BAR's mobility is equally impressive. The robot's 220-pound base is meticulously designed to support the weight of an average adult without tipping or slipping, and its omnidirectional wheels enable smooth navigation through tight spaces and around household obstacles. This means E-BAR can move effortlessly alongside users, providing support in real time, whether they are reaching for a high shelf or stepping out of a bathtub.",

      "BEST CREDIT CARDS FOR SENIORS AND RETIREES 2025",
      "Inside MIT\u2019s E-BAR: A fall-prevention robot designed for aging in place",
      "What sets E-BAR apart from previous eldercare robots is its integrated fall-prevention system. Each arm is embedded with airbags made from soft, grippable materials that can inflate instantly if a fall is detected. This rapid response cushions the user without causing bruising, and, crucially, it does so without requiring the user to wear any special gear. In lab tests, E-BAR successfully supported elderly volunteers as they performed everyday tasks that often pose a risk for falls, such as bending down, stretching up or navigating the tricky edge of a bathtub.",
      "Currently, E-BAR is operated via remote control, but the MIT team is already working on automating its navigation and assistance features. The vision is for future versions to autonomously follow users, assess their real-time fall risk using machine learning algorithms and provide adaptive support as their mobility needs evolve.",

      "Why E-BAR prioritizes dignity, usability and independence for older adults",
      "The E-BAR project is rooted in extensive interviews with seniors and caregivers, which revealed a strong preference for unobtrusive, non-restrictive support systems. E-BAR's U-shaped handlebars leave the front of the user completely open, allowing for a natural stride and easy exit at any time. The robot is slim enough to fit through standard doorways and is designed to blend into the home environment, making it a practical addition rather than an intrusive medical device.",
      "MIT researchers see E-BAR as part of a broader ecosystem of assistive technologies, each tailored to different stages of aging and mobility. While some devices may offer predictive fall detection or harness-based support, E-BAR's unique combination of full-body assistance, fall prevention and user autonomy addresses a critical gap for those who want to maintain independence but need occasional support.",

The research team is continuing to refine the design and aims to bring it to market in the coming years, but it could take 5\u201310 years before the device receives full regulatory approval and becomes commercially accessible.",
      "Looking forward, the research team is also focused on refining E-BAR's design to make it slimmer, more maneuverable and even more intuitive to use. They are also exploring ways to integrate advanced AI for real-time fall prediction and adaptive assistance, ensuring that the robot can meet users' changing needs as they age. The ultimate goal is to provide seamless, continuous support, empowering seniors to live safely and confidently in their own homes.",

It's easy to see how something like this could make a big difference for seniors wanting to stay independent without feeling tied down by bulky or uncomfortable devices.

      "LexisNexis filed a\u00a0notice with the Maine attorney general revealing that a hacker accessed consumer data through a third-party software development platform. The breach happened on Dec. 25, 2024, but the company only discovered it months later. LexisNexis was alerted on April 1, 2025, by an unnamed individual who claimed to have found sensitive files. It remains unclear whether this person was responsible for the breach or merely came across the exposed data.",
      "MASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS",
      "A spokesperson for LexisNexis confirmed that the hacker gained access to the company\u2019s GitHub account. This is a platform commonly used by developers to store and collaborate on code. Security guidelines repeatedly warn against storing sensitive information in such repositories; however, mistakes such as exposed access tokens and personal data files continue to occur.",
      "The stolen data varies from person to person but includes full names, birthdates, phone numbers, mailing and email addresses, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. LexisNexis has not confirmed whether it received any ransom demand or had further contact with the attacker.",

      "LexisNexis isn\u2019t a household name for most people, but it plays a major role in how personal data is harvested and used behind the scenes. The company pulls information from a wide range of sources, compiling detailed profiles that help other businesses assess risk and detect fraud. Its clients include banks, insurance companies and government agencies.",
      "In 2023, the New York Times reported that several car manufacturers had been sharing driving data with LexisNexis without notifying vehicle owners. That information was then sold to insurance companies, which used it to adjust premiums based on individual driving behavior. The story made one thing clear. LexisNexis has access to a staggering amount of personal detail, even from people who have never willingly engaged with the company.",
      "Law enforcement also uses LexisNexis tools to dig up information on suspects. These systems offer access to phone records, home addresses and other historical data. While such tools might assist in investigations, they also highlight a serious issue. When this much sensitive information is concentrated in one place, it becomes a single point of failure. And as the recent breach shows, that failure is no longer hypothetical.",

      "Keeping your personal data safe online can feel overwhelming, but a few practical steps can make a big difference in protecting your privacy and reducing your digital footprint. Here are 7 effective ways to take control of your information and keep it out of the wrong hands:",
      "1. Remove your data from the internet:\u00a0The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "2. Review privacy settings: Take a few minutes to explore the privacy and security settings on the services you use. For example, limit who can see your social media posts, disable unnecessary location-sharing on your phone and consider turning off ad personalization on accounts like Google and Facebook. Most browsers let you block third-party cookies or clear tracking data. The FTC suggests comparing the privacy notices of different sites and apps and choosing ones that let you opt out of sharing when possible.",

      "With the unveiling of Otto Aviation\u2019s Phantom 3500, humans are heading toward a future of windowless jets.",
      "The aircraft is redefining air travel by eliminating traditional windows in favor of a sleek, aerodynamic design, something many engineers are surely happy about.",
      "It\u2019s a radical approach, but it\u2019s one that, on top of improving fuel efficiency and reducing drag, will still offer some of the best views using digital technology.",

      "Phantom 3500 (Otto Aviation)",
      "Why is windowless design such a big deal for aircraft?",
      "Most travelers don't realize that windows are structural weak points in an aircraft. They require extra reinforcement, add weight and disrupt the smooth flow of air over the fuselage (the main body of the plane). This increases drag, a resistance force that makes flight less efficient. By removing windows, the Phantom 3500's surface allows air to flow with minimal turbulence, helping the aircraft achieve what Otto Aviation describes as \"full laminar flow characteristics.\"",
      "HYPERSONIC JET PROMISES NYC TO LONDON IN UNDER AN HOUR",
      "This is a major contributor to its impressive aerodynamic performance. The windowless design is not just for aesthetics. Otto Aviation specifically engineered the fuselage to optimize laminar flow, using lightweight materials and smooth surfaces to further reduce drag and fuel consumption.",

      "How Phantom 3500 gives windowless passengers stunning digital views",
      "A common concern with windowless aircraft is claustrophobia. To address this, the Phantom 3500 features high-definition digital screens along the cabin walls and ceiling. These displays stream real-time video from cameras mounted on the aircraft's exterior, offering passengers a panoramic, immersive view of the skies. Otto Aviation refers to this system as Super Natural Vision, a proprietary technology that replaces traditional windows with state-of-the-art digital displays, seamlessly integrating real-time external views for a unique in-flight experience.",
      "The spacious, luminous cabin measures 800 cubic feet with a 6-foot-5-inch ceiling, comfortably accommodating four or more passengers in a luxurious, flexible layout. The cabin can seat up to nine passengers, depending on configuration, and is designed to maximize comfort and functionality. Freed from the constraints of window placement, the interior can be customized for relaxation, productivity or entertainment, ensuring passengers enjoy the journey as much as the destination.",

      "The Phantom 3500 builds on flight tests from Otto\u2019s Celera 500L prototype and Dassault Syst\u00e8mes\u2019 3DEXPERIENCE platform. By sustaining laminar flow, the aircraft aims to improve fuel efficiency by 35%. This allows it to maintain high-speed performance while consuming less fuel, making it one of the most aerodynamically efficient aircraft ever developed. It operates in the transonic range (Mach 0.8\u20131.2), balancing speed and efficiency. It can also reach a cruising altitude of 51,000 feet, significantly higher than most commercial airliners, which typically fly between 30,000 and 40,000 feet.",
      "Thanks to its streamlined fuselage and optimized aerodynamics, the Phantom 3500 burns 50% less fuel than conventional business jets. This reduction in fuel consumption translates to lower operating costs and a significant decrease in carbon emissions. The Phantom 3500\u2019s wings achieve complete laminar flow, allowing for smoother airflow and reduced drag, enabling the aircraft to take off from runways as short as 3,500 feet, nearly doubling the number of accessible airports in the U.S. alone compared to similar-sized jets.",

      "In 2020, the IAEA found man-made particles of enriched uranium at three sites, including Varamin, Marivan and Turquzabad. The locations were previously utilized in Iran\u2019s nuclear program and gave the agency credence to believe Tehran had once again turned to deadly nuclear ambitions.",

    "summary": "A memo to immigration judges provides new insight into a tactic the Trump administration is using in a bid to increase the number of immigrants it's detaining.",
    "story": [
      "A recent memo to immigration judges obtained by NBC News provides fresh insight into how the Trump administration is pulling off a new tactic \u2014 dismissing pending immigration cases, then immediately moving to arrest the immigrants \u2014 that is part of its bid to quickly increase the number of immigrants it is detaining.",
      "In the memo, the Justice Department instructs immigration judges, who report to the executive branch and are not part of the independent judiciary, to allow Department of Homeland Security lawyers to make motions to dismiss orally and then move quickly to grant those dismissals, rather than allow immigrants the 10-day response time that had been typical.",
      "\u201cOral Decisions must be completed within the same hearing slot on the day testimony and arguments are concluded,\u201d says the memo, which is dated May 30. It also tells the judges that \u201c[n]o additional documentation or briefing is required\u201d to grant the dismissals.",
      "Once their cases are dismissed, the immigrants in question may be put in expedited removal proceedings, which means they can be deported without a chance to make their cases for asylum before immigration judges. The memo notes that people in expedited removal proceedings \u201care subject to mandatory detention\u201d and can be taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which falls under DHS.",
      "The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "A source close to the immigration judges\u2019 union said that the move is legal but that it is still upsetting to many immigration judges.",
      "\u201cThey think it makes a mockery of the whole process and that it flies in the face of what Trump ran on. Immigration enforcement means it\u2019s done in a fair manner ... and this isn\u2019t fair,\u201d the source close to the union said. Immigration judges are not authorized to speak to the media except through their union.",
      "The memo cites a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that sets out the conditions under which the government can move to dismiss an immigrant\u2019s case. But it misstates the statute. The memo says, without quotation marks, that judges may grant motions to dismiss when \u201ccircumstances have changed to such an extent that continuation is no longer in the best interest of the government.\u201d But the Immigration and Nationality Act\u2019s wording is more specific; it states that cases can be dismissed when \u201ccircumstances of the case have changed to such an extent that continuation is no longer in the best interest of the government.\u201d",
      "Greg Chen, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said he believes the new guidance violates that provision of the Immigration Nationality Act and is not legal.",
      "\u201cThe omission of the words \u2018of the case\u2019 is deliberate because DHS is trying to avoid having to speak to the individual case. The law requires them to provide particular reasons for their motion, and they are not doing that. The email is the written policy that contradicts the law,\u201d Chen said.",
      "Jason Houser, who was chief of staff at ICE during the Biden administration, said dismissing cases that way will allow ICE to arrest more people but will not really help it speed up deportations because it lacks enough space to detain those arrested before deportation.",
      "The tactic of dismissing cases and then arresting people whose cases were dismissed \u201ctargets vetted migrants who were working and had legal status,\u201d he said. \u201cFlooding the system with thousands of noncriminals wastes time and resources when federal law enforcement should be focused on national security threats.\u201d",
      "As the agency steps up arrests, it faces an overcrowding issue. More than 51,000 immigrants were in ICE custody as of May 23, according to ICE data, though it is funded to hold only 41,500. Former ICE officials have said the agency can run over that allotment by only so much, and then only for a short amount of time, before it risks budget shortfalls and possible penalties from courts for living conditions that fall below court-mandated standards."

      "MIAMI \u2014\u00a0After four months with President Donald Trump at the helm, Reinerio de la Torre says he's waiting to see if the president fulfills his promises.",
      "The 56-year-old electrician, who came from Cuba 18 years ago,  voted for Trump in November. But he says the president has gone too far with immigration, and he doesn\u2019t like to see hardworking people being deported. De la Torre also disagrees with the partial travel ban on Cuba, saying \u201cvisas should be decided case by case.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s still early in the presidency and we have to give him time to see what he does,\u201d de la Torre said outside Hialeah\u2019s City Hall, where roosters were heard crowing in the background. The street that runs across from it was recently named after the president.",
      "Patricia, 52, who declined to give her last name, echoed de la Torre\u2019s sentiment. \u201cHe is deporting innocent people, and I don\u2019t like the tariffs, but maybe at the end it will be for the better,\u201d she said.",
      "About 70% of Cuban Americans living in Florida voted for Trump in the 2024 election, and his support in Hialeah, a working-class city in Miami-Dade County with a robust Cuban American population, was one of the strongest. Trump held a rally here one year before the election and the rise in support he got helped him become the first Republican president to win Miami-Dade County since George H.W. Bush in 1988.",
      "While Trump's support among Cuban Americans remains strong and few seem to regret their vote, worries over immigration policies have begun to creep up among the multiple voters NBC News spoke to, especially among more recent arrivals.",
      "Cuban Americans began flocking toward Trump in big numbers during his first presidency, as he tightened U.S. sanctions against Cuba, banning flights to most of the island and restricting remittances. A hard-line policy is welcomed by many Cuban Americans who fled the communist-run island.",
      "A historic wave has brought well over half a million of Cuban migrants to the U.S. since 2022. Cubans had long been allowed to become U.S. residents fairly easily through the Cuban Adjustment Act, but now Trump\u2019s immigration policies have left some Cuban immigrants in legal limbo.",
      "Trump also revoked the legal status of migrants who entered the U.S. through the Biden-era CBP One app, which temporarily allowed migrants to live in the U.S., and ended the parole program that gave temporary legal status to 532,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.",
      "While the U.S. has been deporting Cubans regularly since 2017, some recent deportations have surprised some. News of families being separated or a former political prisoner's parole being revoked have alarmed some in the community.",
      "Trump administration\u2019s partial travel ban on Cuba now makes it impossible for Cubans to gain a visa to visit family, something that was already cumbersome since the U.S. stopped processing visas at the Havana embassy in 2017. For most visas, Cubans had to travel to a third country, often Guyana, which is out of reach for most Cubans.",
      "But Cuban Americans voted for Trump for more than hard-line policies against Cuba, and most seemed content with his presidency thus far.",
      "Mirta Marino, 78, a retired bank worker, said, \u201cTrump is making tough policy decisions, but they are necessary to fix the country.\u201d",
      "She said many Cubans come to this country claiming political persecution but frequently visit the island after they become U.S. residents. Marino, who came in 1980 during the Mariel boatlift, said she never returned. She also believes some people come to this country and take advantage of benefits without working.",
      "A few miles away in the city of Doral, known for its concentration of Venezuelans, many patrons at the popular El Arepazo restaurant are still firmly supporting Trump as well.",
      "Rodrigo Torres, 22, a business owner, said he feels bad for all the Venezuelans affected by Trump\u2019s immigration policies, but he said it helps to get the criminals out of the country.",
      "About half of the people deported in February did not have criminal records and more than half of those in ICE detention have no criminal charges or convictions, according to ICE data.",
      "\u201cThere are people getting deported for no reason,\u201d Torres said. \u201cBut I would still vote for Trump over Harris.\u201d",
      "Like in Hialeah, a solid majority in Doral voted for Trump in 2024. The city is home to one of the president\u2019s resorts, where he held events and rallies before the election.",
      "Venezuelans may be the group most impacted by Trump\u2019s immigration policies. Since he was campaigning, Trump regularly talked about Venezuelan gangs in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re sending us our criminals from Caracas, Venezuela,\u201d Trump said at a July 2024 rally in Doral, claiming Venezuela had sent \u201call of their drug dealers, their criminals, and most of their prisoners into our country.\u201d",
      "Once in office, Trump used an 18th-century wartime law to send hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to a maximum security prison in El Salvador, alleging they had ties to the gang Tren de Aragua \u2014 something many of the migrants\u2019 families and attorneys have disputed. The men have not been allowed to disprove any gang affiliation or contact attorneys or families. Trump also revoked special legal protections known as Temporary Protected Status for about 350,000 Venezuelans who had been living and working legally in the U.S.",
      "Outside El Arepazo, Carolina Villalobo said she did not vote in the presidential election because she is not yet a citizen, but said she never liked Trump.",
      "\u201cHe is very aggressive,\u201d she said. \u201cI agree the country has to be cleaned out and the criminals should be deported, but it should be done with more tact.\u201d",
      "But among her extended family, including siblings and nephews, she\u2019s alone.",
      "\u201cMy entire family continues supporting Trump,\u201d Villalobo said.",
      "'They certainly are feeling the pressure'",
      "The firm support for Trump in South Florida is not surprising to Fernand Amandi, a Democratic consultant and pollster in Miami.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen a single person who voted for Trump in November of 2024 come out and say: I made a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I have seen is a tremendous amount of rationalization, justification and unwillingness to admit that their votes have contributed to this situation that is now impacting a lot of families and a lot of people directly.\u201d",
      "In order to have a substantial number of voters change their minds, Amandi said, there would have to be a situation in which the economy hits rock bottom and it\u2019s personally affecting them.",
      "Regardless, Democrats are already taking jabs at Republican lawmakers in South Florida that are up for re-election in November 2026.

    "summary": "While Trump's support among Cuban Americans remains strong, worries over immigration policies have begun to creep up among the multiple voters NBC News spoke to.",
    "story": [
      "MIAMI \u2014\u00a0After four months with President Donald Trump at the helm, Reinerio de la Torre says he's waiting to see if the president fulfills his promises.",
      "The 56-year-old electrician, who came from Cuba 18 years ago,  voted for Trump in November. But he says the president has gone too far with immigration, and he doesn\u2019t like to see hardworking people being deported. De la Torre also disagrees with the partial travel ban on Cuba, saying \u201cvisas should be decided case by case.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s still early in the presidency and we have to give him time to see what he does,\u201d de la Torre said outside Hialeah\u2019s City Hall, where roosters were heard crowing in the background. The street that runs across from it was recently named after the president.",
      "Patricia, 52, who declined to give her last name, echoed de la Torre\u2019s sentiment. \u201cHe is deporting innocent people, and I don\u2019t like the tariffs, but maybe at the end it will be for the better,\u201d she said.",
      "About 70% of Cuban Americans living in Florida voted for Trump in the 2024 election, and his support in Hialeah, a working-class city in Miami-Dade County with a robust Cuban American population, was one of the strongest. Trump held a rally here one year before the election and the rise in support he got helped him become the first Republican president to win Miami-Dade County since George H.W. Bush in 1988.",
      "While Trump's support among Cuban Americans remains strong and few seem to regret their vote, worries over immigration policies have begun to creep up among the multiple voters NBC News spoke to, especially among more recent arrivals.",
      "Cuban Americans began flocking toward Trump in big numbers during his first presidency, as he tightened U.S. sanctions against Cuba, banning flights to most of the island and restricting remittances. A hard-line policy is welcomed by many Cuban Americans who fled the communist-run island.",
      "A historic wave has brought well over half a million of Cuban migrants to the U.S. since 2022. Cubans had long been allowed to become U.S. residents fairly easily through the Cuban Adjustment Act, but now Trump\u2019s immigration policies have left some Cuban immigrants in legal limbo.",
      "Trump also revoked the legal status of migrants who entered the U.S. through the Biden-era CBP One app, which temporarily allowed migrants to live in the U.S., and ended the parole program that gave temporary legal status to 532,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.",
      "While the U.S. has been deporting Cubans regularly since 2017, some recent deportations have surprised some. News of families being separated or a former political prisoner's parole being revoked have alarmed some in the community.",
      "Trump administration\u2019s partial travel ban on Cuba now makes it impossible for Cubans to gain a visa to visit family, something that was already cumbersome since the U.S. stopped processing visas at the Havana embassy in 2017. For most visas, Cubans had to travel to a third country, often Guyana, which is out of reach for most Cubans.",
      "But Cuban Americans voted for Trump for more than hard-line policies against Cuba, and most seemed content with his presidency thus far.",
      "Mirta Marino, 78, a retired bank worker, said, \u201cTrump is making tough policy decisions, but they are necessary to fix the country.\u201d",
      "She said many Cubans come to this country claiming political persecution but frequently visit the island after they become U.S. residents. Marino, who came in 1980 during the Mariel boatlift, said she never returned. She also believes some people come to this country and take advantage of benefits without working.",
      "A few miles away in the city of Doral, known for its concentration of Venezuelans, many patrons at the popular El Arepazo restaurant are still firmly supporting Trump as well.",
      "Rodrigo Torres, 22, a business owner, said he feels bad for all the Venezuelans affected by Trump\u2019s immigration policies, but he said it helps to get the criminals out of the country.",
      "About half of the people deported in February did not have criminal records and more than half of those in ICE detention have no criminal charges or convictions, according to ICE data.",
      "\u201cThere are people getting deported for no reason,\u201d Torres said. \u201cBut I would still vote for Trump over Harris.\u201d",
      "Like in Hialeah, a solid majority in Doral voted for Trump in 2024. The city is home to one of the president\u2019s resorts, where he held events and rallies before the election.",
      "Venezuelans may be the group most impacted by Trump\u2019s immigration policies. Since he was campaigning, Trump regularly talked about Venezuelan gangs in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re sending us our criminals from Caracas, Venezuela,\u201d Trump said at a July 2024 rally in Doral, claiming Venezuela had sent \u201call of their drug dealers, their criminals, and most of their prisoners into our country.\u201d",
      "Once in office, Trump used an 18th-century wartime law to send hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to a maximum security prison in El Salvador, alleging they had ties to the gang Tren de Aragua \u2014 something many of the migrants\u2019 families and attorneys have disputed. The men have not been allowed to disprove any gang affiliation or contact attorneys or families. Trump also revoked special legal protections known as Temporary Protected Status for about 350,000 Venezuelans who had been living and working legally in the U.S.",
      "Outside El Arepazo, Carolina Villalobo said she did not vote in the presidential election because she is not yet a citizen, but said she never liked Trump.",
      "\u201cHe is very aggressive,\u201d she said. \u201cI agree the country has to be cleaned out and the criminals should be deported, but it should be done with more tact.\u201d",
      "But among her extended family, including siblings and nephews, she\u2019s alone.",
      "\u201cMy entire family continues supporting Trump,\u201d Villalobo said.",
      "'They certainly are feeling the pressure'",
      "The firm support for Trump in South Florida is not surprising to Fernand Amandi, a Democratic consultant and pollster in Miami.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen a single person who voted for Trump in November of 2024 come out and say: I made a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I have seen is a tremendous amount of rationalization, justification and unwillingness to admit that their votes have contributed to this situation that is now impacting a lot of families and a lot of people directly.\u201d",
      "In order to have a substantial number of voters change their minds, Amandi said, there would have to be a situation in which the economy hits rock bottom and it\u2019s personally affecting them.",
      "Regardless, Democrats are already taking jabs at Republican lawmakers in South Florida that are up for re-election in November 2026. Recently, a group called Keep Them Honest launched an ad campaign on Miami highways and radio criticizing Republican Reps. Mario D\u00edaz-Balart, Carlos Gim\u00e9nez and Maria Elvira Salazar over their support for Trump.",
      "Salazar has been publicly critical about some of Trump\u2019s immigration policies and all three lawmakers have a meeting scheduled with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem this week.",

    "story": [
      "Jurors weighing the fate of disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein said Wednesday that they had unanimously found him guilty of sexually assaulting one woman and not guilty of assaulting another more than a decade ago.",
      "But the jurors at Weinstein's retrial told the judge they were unable to reach a verdict on allegations he assaulted a third woman, and Judge Curtis Farber sent them home for the day and asked them to resume deliberating on Thursday.",
      "Weinstein, 73, had denied all the charges and his lawyers insisted the sexual encounters with his three accusers were \u201ctransactional\u201d and \u201cconsensual.\u201d",
      "But the jury came to a different conclusion after five days of deliberations, during which the jury foreman told the judge several times they were having a hard time reaching a verdict and that several members of the panel had been clashing.",
      "Before the partial verdict was announced, the jury foreman told the court he\u2019d been threatened by another member of the panel who told him, \u201cYou know me, you going to see me outside.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel afraid inside there,\u201d the juror told the judge, according to a transcript of the conversation supplied by the New York State Court. \u201cI can\u2019t be inside there.\u201d",
      "Aidala immediately objected.",
      "\u201cYou have a grown man who has now said that people have told him in the jury room they\u2019ll meet him outside,\u201d Aidala said. \u201cHe said it twice.\u201d",
      "Farber dismissed that as \u201cschoolyard nonsense.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe is a big guy,\u201d the judge said. \u201cHe\u2019s not particularly scared. He\u2019s basically saying, \u2018I am not changing my mind.\u2019 He is not being intimidated to change his mind. He is standing his ground, which could be in your favor of the prosecution\u2019s favor.\u201d",
      "Weinstein then asked to address the judge and made a last-minute plea, \"this is not right for me, the person who is on trial here.\"",
      "\"Lawyers can fight all they want,\" Weinstein said, seated in his wheelchair. \"This is my life on the line. It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s that simple. It\u2019s just not fair.\"",
      "Farber agreed this \"was not a typical deliberation but it does happen\" and the result of the deliberations in the third case could wind up being in favor of Weinstein.",
      "\"It could be in my favor, but it\u2019s not fair,\" Weinstein replied. \"That\u2019s the problem with this. ... This is over. \"",
      "Minutes later, the jurors returned to the courtroom and rendered a partial verdict.",
      "Weinstein put his hands to his head after he was found guilty of criminal sexual act for the 2006 attack on former \u201cProject Runway\u201d production assistant Miriam Haley.",
      "But Weinstein was found not guilty of a second charge of criminal sexual act stemming from allegations brought by former Polish runway model Kaja Sokola, who told the court she too was assaulted by the producer in 2006.",
      "The jury deadlocked on a rape in the third-degree charge that Weinstein was hit with for allegedly sexually assaulting former actress Jessica Mann.",
      "Haley\u2019s lawyer Gloria Allred spoke outside of the Manhattan courthouse following the partial verdict saying that the MeToo movement is not dead.",
      "\u201cThe real hero of this case is Mimi Haley, because he was convicted not once, but twice, based on her testimony,\u201d Allred said.",
      "Haley said the verdict left her feeling hopeful and said she hopes others will continue to speak out against against their abusers.",
      "\u201cTo those predators who still believe they can exploit abuse and walk away unscathed. Your time is running out. The world is changing, and you will not outrun the consequences of your actions forever,\u201d Haley said.",
      "Sokola said she was happy with the verdict, even though the jury did not convict Weinstein of assaulting her.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big win for everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cFor myself, it\u2019s closing of a chapter that caused me a lot of pain throughout my life.\u201d",
      "Both Haley and Mann testified at Weinstein\u2019s first trial in 2020. Sokola's charge was new to the retrial.",
      "Weinstein found himself on trial again after the New York state Court of Appeals last year overturned his landmark 2020 conviction for sexually abusing young women, a trial that defined the #MeToo movement and helped turn the Oscar-winning producer into a pariah. The appeals court found that the judge in that trial had improperly allowed testimony against the former Miramax chief based on allegations that were not part of the case.",
      "\u201cIf this person wasn\u2019t Harvey Weinstein, would we even be here?\u201d Weinstein defense attorney Arthur Aidala asked during his closing argument in accusing the women of being grifters.",
      "Prosecutors, however, said Weinstein preyed on young women trying to make it in Hollywood, sometimes repeatedly, and threatened to wreck their careers if they talked.",
      "\u201cHe never had any interest in their careers,\u201d Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg told the jury. \u201cHe had an interest in their bodies. And he was going to have their bodies and touch their bodies whether they had wanted him to or not.\"",
      "Just as in 2020, Weinstein did not testify at his retrial. But he gave an interview to a FOX5 New York reporter after the jury began deliberations, saying that he acted \"immorally\" and regretted hurting his wife and family, but never did anything \"illegal.\"",
      "\"I put so many friends through this and hurt people \u2026 that were close to me, by the way, by actions that were stupid,\" he said. \"But never illegal, never criminal, never anything.\"",
      "Much of the evidence that resulted in Weinstein being convicted five years ago of the third-degree rape of one woman and a first-degree criminal sex act against another woman was reintroduced at his retrial.",
      "Just as before, Weinstein pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape based on complaints by Haley and Mann. But this time, Weinstein also pleaded not guilty to an additional charge of first-degree criminal sexual act in the alleged sexual assault of Sokola.",
      "Sokola told the court that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 at a Manhattan hotel when she was 19 years old. But the alleged abuse began in 2002, when she was 16 and Weinstein forced her to masturbate him, she said.",
      "\u201cHer first sexual experience was the defendant forcing himself on her,\u201d Blumberg said.",
      "During his three-hour closing, Aidala tried to poke holes in the testimony of the three accusers. He suggested they were coached by prosecutors to describe the sexual encounters, which he likened at one point to \u201cnaked twister,\u201d in a sinister light.",
      "\u201cThey did it all to get the original sinner, the poster boy of the MeToo movement,\u201d Aidala said.",
      "The #MeToo hashtag took off in 2017 following reports in The New York Times and The New Yorker that detailed allegations of sexual misconduct against Weinstein that went back decades. It helped inspire a reckoning in Hollywood and beyond around sexual harassment.",
      "Weinstein, Aidala added, made for an easy target. \u201cHe\u2019s a fat dude \u2014 sorry, Harvey,\u201d he said while the former producer looked on.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really a casting couch I thought it was,\u201d Aidala added. \u201cIt\u2019s different now. I know it sounds crazy, but he\u2019s the one being used.\u201d",
      "Blumberg painted a far different picture during the prosecution's closing remarks.",
      "\u201cI want to remind you why we are here,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause he raped three people.\u201d",
      "Sokola and Haley both claimed that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on them in separate incidents in 2006. Mann told the court the producer raped her in 2013.",
      "Weinstein, Blumberg said, \u201chad tremendous control over Hollywood. He spoke, people listened. He decided who was in and who was out.\u201d",
      "\u201cRemember, it\u2019s not the person sitting here today in a wheelchair but this man, in Hollywood, who had the power and was in control,\u201d Blumberg said.",
      "Regardless of the verdict, Weinstein will most likely be returned to California where he has to serve a 16-year sentence for a 2022 rape conviction. His lawyers filed an appeal for that conviction in 2024 that is still in process.",
      "During his latest trial, Weinstein has been allowed to stay at Bellevue Hospital where he was being treated for a host of serious health issues.",
      "Back in October, two sources told NBC News that Weinstein had been diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia, an uncommon form of bone marrow cancer.",
      "Weinstein was a Hollywood titan in the 1990s and 2000s when he and his brother Bob ran Miramax, the distributor of critically acclaimed independent movies like \u201cSex, Lies, and Videotape,\u201d \u201cThe Crying Game,\u201d \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cClerks,\u201d and box office successes like \u201cChicago\u201d and \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Diary.\u201d",
      "In 1999, Weinstein won a best picture Oscar as one of the producers of \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d And in the early 2010s, his second distribution label, The Weinstein Company, won back-to-back best picture Oscars for \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cThe Artist.\u201d",
      "But as Weinstein collected accolades, he was dogged by rumors that he preyed on his leading ladies and other women in the industry. By the time he was arrested, more than 80 women had accused him of sexual assault or harassment going back decades.",
      "Just as he did at his trials, Weinstein doggedly denied the claims and insisted the encounters were consensual."

      "The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it will aim to eliminate existing limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants, a move that would curb the agency\u2019s ability to combat climate change under the Clean Air Act.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a news conference that Biden-era carbon pollution standards for power plants \u201csuffocate\u201d the economy in order to protect the environment. Zeldin, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in January, stated that the agency\u2019s announcement was a huge step forward in energy dominance for the U.S., while promising that no power plants would emit more than they already do. Currently, the power sector accounts for a quarter of all U.S. emissions, according to the latest EPA emissions data.",
      "Zeldin also said the EPA plans to weaken Biden-era regulations on mercury emissions from power plants.",
      "Environmental advocates say the EPA\u2019s proposal is an escalation in the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing push against climate action across federal agencies, including at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Energy and the National Weather Service. In 2024, the Biden administration finalized the most stringent carbon pollution standards for power plants to date in an effort to tackle the climate crisis \u2014 but now, those rules face an uncertain future.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA Administrator under President Joe Biden, called Zeldin\u2019s announcement a \u201cpolitical play\u201d that defies \u201cdecades of science and policy review\u201d in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cBy giving a green light to more pollution, his legacy will forever be someone who does the bidding of the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our health,\u201d McCarthy said.",
      "Jill Tauber, the vice president of litigation for climate and energy at Earthjustice, a nonprofit currently suing the Trump administration over several environmental rollbacks said: \u201cEliminating pollution standards from the largest industrial source of greenhouse gas pollution in the United States flies in the face of what the law requires, what the science tells us, and what we\u2019re seeing every day.\u201d",
      "Power plants in the U.S. are a huge contributor to global carbon emissions. A report published by the Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University School of Law found that if the U.S. power sector were its own country, it would be the sixth-largest emitter in the world.",
      "Under the first Trump administration, the EPA rolled back several Obama-era greenhouse gas standards on power plants, but this recent announcement marks the first time the agency has suggested outright repeals. Zeldin\u2019s move on power plants follows his promise in March to tackle the \u201cclimate change religion\u201d by reconsidering or repealing 31 regulations surrounding tailpipe emissions, coal ash regulations and oil and gas wastewater management.",
      "The proposed rule, which will now move into its comment period, will face scrutiny from legal advocates and environmental nonprofits like Earthjustice and the Natural Resources Defense Council, which say the EPA is obligated to regulate greenhouse gas emissions by law \u2014 citing seminal cases like the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA lawsuit, which determined that greenhouse gases must be regulated by the EPA under the Clean Air Act.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be watching closely to see if the EPA proceeds with repealing these life-saving standards based on a legal theory that doesn\u2019t pass the laugh test,\u201d said Meredith Hawkins, the federal climate legal director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cThe NRDC stands ready to defend the public\u2019s right to breathe in court if needed.\u201d",
      "Cutting historic limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants would impact global climate change, but it could also cause ripple effects on human health and the economy.",
      "Harvey Reiter, an energy and utilities lawyer and a law professor at George Washington University, says that if the EPA moves forward with its planned repeals, he expects some energy companies and utilities that have retooled operations and made long-term investments in renewable energy to sue the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cThe biggest impacts of the proposed rules are uncertainty and instability,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody knows what to do next. It makes investment decisions harder. It makes decisions about hiring, staff and employees harder. It creates a lot of uncertainty in the market.\u201d",
      "Greenhouse gas emissions from power plants are not just a climate issue. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide as well as other air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and fine particulate matter, which are linked to increased risk of respiratory issues and cardiovascular disease. Regulating carbon emissions from power plants broadly reduces other air pollution for communities living near power plants, said Laura Kate Bender, the vice president of nationwide advocacy and public policy at the American Lung Association.",
      "\u201cIt works both ways. On the one hand, power plants burning fossil fuels contribute to climate change and cause health problems at the same time,\u201d said Bender. \u201cAnd then climate change, in many cases, contributes to extreme heat, or more wildfire smoke, or more ozone smogs. Climate change is a health emergency, and cutting carbon in the power sector is a critical tool in the toolbox for fighting climate change.\u201d"

      "Congressional Republicans are eyeing increasing the debt limit by $4 trillion to $5 trillion so the government can keep borrowing to meet the country\u2019s obligations. It's part of their broader domestic policy package, which the Senate needs to pass before it can go back through the House and ultimately to Trump's desk for his signature. And the GOP only has three votes to spare in both chambers.",
      "\u201cThere is no Plan B,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Tuesday when asked by NBC News if he has a backup plan for the debt limit. \u201cIt\u2019s Plan A. We have to get it done. Failure is not an option.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a risky gamble by GOP leaders, who are putting all their chips on passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by the debt ceiling deadline.",

(Reconciliation refers to the budget process Republicans are using to pass their bill, which allows them to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate and cut Democrats out of the process.)",
      "The Treasury Department has urged Congress to raise the debt ceiling \"by mid-July\" to safely avoid default. The Congressional Budget Office projected this week that the deadline may be later, \u201cbetween mid-August and the end of September,\u201d although that won\u2019t be official unless the Treasury Department agrees.",
      "If Republicans fail to pass their sprawling bill in time, they would need to negotiate with Democrats to pass a standalone debt limit extension through the 60-vote process in the Senate.",
      "But there have been no negotiations between party leaders on that front, according to Republican and Democratic aides with knowledge of the dynamics. One GOP aide said the party is \u201cfull steam ahead on Plan A\u201d and suggested there may still be time to consider a fallback if they absolutely need to.",
      "Some Republicans say it\u2019s a deliberate tactic to drive up the urgency of passing their filibuster-proof bill.",
      "\u201cWe should be set an expectation that we\u2019re getting this done in July, and it includes the debt ceiling,\u201d said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. \u201cI think the minute you start talking about a backup plan, you\u2019re going to have a backup plan.\u201d",
      "If Republican leaders eventually decide they want to cut a bipartisan deal on the debt ceiling, it\u2019s unclear what \u2014 if anything \u2014 Democrats would demand.",
      "Some, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, and Rep. Brendan Boyle, of Pennsylvania., have insisted on abolishing the debt limit entirely in order to prevent the full faith and credit of the United States from being used as leverage in policy negotiations. That's an idea Trump recently endorsed.",
      "\u201cI am very pleased to announce that, after all of these years, I agree with Senator Elizabeth Warren on SOMETHING,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social last week. \u201cThe Debt Limit should be entirely scrapped to prevent an Economic catastrophe.\u201d",
      "But there's scant support within the GOP for it, as Republicans have found success using it to extract concessions from Democratic presidents in the past.",

    "summary": "For the first time in two decades, older Asian Americans are no longer the healthiest U.S.-born aging racial group with the lowest rates of disability, according to a study published last month in the Journals of Gerontology.",
    "story": [
      "For the first time in two decades, older Asian Americans are no longer the healthiest U.S.-born aging racial group with the lowest rates of disability, according to a study published last month in the Journals of Gerontology.",
      "The report focused on adults aged 50 and older, and used disability prevalence as an indicator for overall health.",
      "The paper shows that while disability rates have decreased among aging adults in every racial group, it\u2019s remained unchanged among U.S.-born Asian Americans. The findings suggest that one contributor to the stagnating disability rate is income inequality, which has impacted Asian Americans more than any other group in recent years.",
      "Previous research had shown that both foreign-born and U.S.-born Asian older adults had lower mortality and disability rates than their counterparts in other racial groups. According to the new report, non-Hispanic white Americans have overtaken Asians Americans as the healthiest U.S.-born population, with the lowest disability prevalence.",
      "\u201cThis study shows that the \u2018model minority\u2019 stereotype is wrong about the overall experience of U.S.-born older Asians in terms of health,\u201d said lead author Leafia Ye, an assistant sociology professor at the University of Toronto.",
      "The report is the first to focus solely on the health of U.S.-born Asians, a group that experts say has been understudied due to its limited population size. The study drew on data from the American Community Survey, which has a sample size of more than 18 million U.S.-born adults aged 50 and older. The sample size for U.S.-born Asians is roughly 116,000, Ye said.",
      "The study authors defined disability as any chronic physical or mental health condition that limits an older adult\u2019s self-care or independent living capacity, which includes carrying out tasks like eating, bathing and grocery-shopping without assistance.",
      "Two decades ago, just 5.5% of U.S.-born Asian elders had trouble living independently \u2014 compared with 7% of white and 14% of Black elders.",
      "From 2005 to 2022, the report found, disability rates fell by at least 2% among U.S.-born non-Hispanic white, Black, Hispanic and Indigenous populations, as well as all foreign-born groups. (Black older adults experienced the largest drop from 14% to 10%.) Among native-born older Asian Americans, however, the rate has stayed at 5.5%.",
      "Ye said the trends preceded the Covid-19 pandemic, so it\u2019s unlikely that rising anti-Asian racism was a key risk factor.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s striking about this study is that U.S.-born Asians are the only group that hasn\u2019t experienced improved outcomes,\u201d said Mansha Mirza, principal investigator at the Aging Services Inclusive of Asian American Networks, a national technical assistance and resource development center focused on Asian Americans older adults. Mirza was not involved with the new study.",
      "The trend could be attributed to the fact that U.S.-born Asians \u201care more assimilated into the American way of life,\u201d Mirza said, while foreign-born Asians were more likely to \u201cretain practices from their home countries related to nutrition and diet.\u201d",
      "Disability prevalence varies across the racial group. Cognitive disability is more prevalent in Vietnamese, Filipino and Japanese older adults, according to a 2024 paper in Innovation in Aging. For self-care disability, on the other hand, Vietnamese, Chinese, Filipino and Indian older adults have a higher prevalence.",
      "In the past, older Asian Americans have had better health outcomes than other groups because the large majority were foreign-born, Ye said. People with poorer health and lower socioeconomic status were less likely to resettle in another country, she said, so Asian immigrants became a \u201cvery positively selected\u201d group that\u2019s \u201chealthier and more successful economically compared with both the source and the destination populations.\u201d",
      "By contrast, Ye said, U.S.-born Asians were immediately exposed to the country\u2019s cultural and political realities. Socioeconomic status has a particularly strong influence on health outcomes, as college-educated older Asian Americans saw a slight decline in disability, while those without a degree saw an increase.",
      "While the data didn\u2019t contain mental health measures, like loneliness and anxiety, Ye said it\u2019s possible that these conditions could have also contributed to stagnating health outcomes.",
      "\u201cIn a way,\u201d Ye said, \u201cU.S.-born Asians are both less selected and more exposed throughout their lifetime.\u201d",
      "Mirza said a point of further study could be desegregated research on the impact of migration history on health outcomes. First-generation Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees, for example, survived war, famine and genocide. Research has shown that exposure to these adverse conditions could contribute to \u201caltered diets and physiological capacity\u201d in their U.S.-born children, who are now advancing in age, Mirza said.",
      "Mirza also emphasized a need to study the impact of social isolation on Asian seniors, which she said is gradually emerging as a social determinant of health as much as smoking and alcohol use.",
      "\u201cWe need to see what social isolation looks like for foreign-born Asians Americans and U.S.-born Asians Americans,\u201d she said, \u201cand the extent to which social ties are preserved within these groups.\u201d"

      "\u201cThis race is all about New Jersey,\u201d Ciattarelli said. \u201cMy opponent is going to want to talk about Donald Trump every day of the week, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security \u2014 by the way, the way to save those programs is by getting rid of the fraud. I\u2019ve got to hit the reset button here in New Jersey come January. We\u2019re going to keep the focus on New Jersey.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat people want to hear about [is] what are we doing about property taxes? What are we doing about public education? What are we doing about our infrastructure? What are we doing about the lawlessness? What are we doing about the over development? What are we doing about the cost of electricity? Those are all the failures of the Murphy administration. Mikie Sherrill has supported every one of his policies,\u201d Ciattarelli added.",
      "Ciattarelli\u2019s focus on Murphy comes as he is trying to win over independent voters and disaffected Democrats in the traditionally blue state. Trump significantly improved on his margin last year compared to 2020, but he still lost New Jersey by 6 points. Ciattarelli called out those voters in his victory speech Tuesday night, and on Wednesday he laid out how he plans to win them over.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve had it, as have I,\u201d Ciattarelli said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had it with sanctuary cities. They\u2019ve had it with us being a sanctuary state. They\u2019ve had it with our property taxes. We saw what went on on our Jersey Shore over the Memorial Day weekend, flash mobs, because we don\u2019t support our local police. It\u2019s across the board. Look what\u2019s happened in education. We just slipped from two to 12 on the national report card because of the performance or lack thereof of our students.\u201d",
      "Ciattarelli is, of course, still linked to Trump, who endorsed him and helped consolidate Republican primary voters behind him, helping fuel his resounding re-nomination. On Tuesday night at a victory party in Holmdel, New Jersey, voters who spoke to NBC News emphasized Trump\u2019s endorsement as having \u201csealed the deal\u201d for them.",
      "\u201cIf he continues with Trump and doesn\u2019t become like one of them RINOs [Republican In Name Only], if he continues going the right path, I think he\u2019s going to do great,\u201d one supporter said.",
      "On Wednesday, Ciattarelli said Trump is \u201creally excited about the possibilities here in New Jersey. There\u2019s an opportunity for us to win this year, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d",
      "Sherrill suggested in her primary victory speech Tuesday night that she plans to tie Ciattarelli to the president, referring to her opponent as a \u201cTrump lackey.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis country is too beautiful to be beholden to the cruelty and self interest that Jack and Trump are trying to hoist on her,\u201d Sherrill said.",
      "For his part, Ciattarelli has been hesitant to publicly break with the president. The Republican told NBC News that he supports Trump\u2019s decision to federalize California\u2019s National Guard troops to respond to protests in Los Angeles against immigration raids, despite objections from Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "\u201cThe first job of any elected official is public health and safety. If they feel the National Guard is needed, why not? I think our local police and our state police would welcome the National Guard here to help them,\u201d Ciattarelli said.",
      "Sherrill wrote in an X post on Sunday that the Trump administration\u2019s move was \u201ca dangerous stunt designed to inflame divisions and further a political agenda\u201d and that it was \u201cdisturbing\u201d to see Ciattarelli applauding the decision.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a dangerous situation to put military on the streets of this country, trained in combat, as opposed to the police officers who know how to handle this,\u201d Sherrill told reporters after casting her primary ballot on Tuesday, noting a governor can ask the federal government for support.",
      "\u201cThat is not the case here,\u201d Sherrill said. \u201cGovernor Newsom surged law enforcement in and what Trump seems to be doing is trying to add fuel to the fire and really make a situation violent and bad. And I just think that\u2019s completely unacceptable.\u201d",
      "Immigration is expected to be a top issue in the governor\u2019s race, with around 1 in 4 New Jersey residents born in another country, according to census data. The first of several Ciattarelli campaign events on Wednesday took place in a predominantly Latino area in Sherrill\u2019s congressional district.",
      "\u201cImmigrants that are here legally want to achieve the American dream, and too many people right now don\u2019t feel like they can do that here in New Jersey,\u201d Ciattarelli said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s get the job of their dreams, get the education they want, raise a family, start a business, retire here, those are all the things that people are terribly insecure about.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose are all the failures of the Murphy administration,\u201d Ciattarelli added.",
      "Ciattarelli, who lost a close race against Murphy in 2021, said that this year is going to be different, in part because the state is not in the throes of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cI thought we were going to win in \u201821, but I know we\u2019re going to win this race. The political landscape is very different,\u201d Ciatterelli said. \u201cI\u2019m not competing with a pandemic or a shelter-in-place order. I\u2019m not going up against an incumbent. I\u2019m going up against somebody who\u2019s totally out of touch with what it is that really matters and bothers New Jersey.\u201d"

      "LAS VEGAS, NEV. \u2014 Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said Wednesday that he \u201cdid a cartwheel\u201d in his living room when current chief executive Brian Niccol first coined his \u201cback to Starbucks\u201d strategy.",
      "The enthusiasm from the 71-year-old Starbucks chairman emeritus is a key stamp of approval for Niccol as he tries to lift the company\u2019s slumping sales and restore the chain\u2019s culture.",
      "Schultz, who grew Starbucks from a small chain into a global coffee giant, made a surprise appearance at the company\u2019s Leadership Experience in Las Vegas and cosigned Niccol\u2019s plans. The three-day event has gathered more than 14,000 North American store leaders to hear from Starbucks management as the company embarks on a turnaround.",
      "Niccol took the reins in September, joining the company after the board ousted Laxman Narasimhan, Schultz\u2019s handpicked successor.",
      "Schultz had returned in 2022 for his third stint as chief executive, but it was only an interim role. He previously told CNBC that he has no plans to come back again. Schultz no longer holds a formal role within the company, although CNBC has previously reported that he\u2019s forever entitled to attend board meetings unless barred by the company\u2019s directors.",
      "During Niccol\u2019s first week on the job, he outlined plans for the comeback in an open letter, making the commitment to get \u201cback to Starbucks.\u201d More details on how the chain planned to return to its roots followed in the ensuing months, from bringing back seating inside cafes to writing personalized messages on cups. Under Niccol\u2019s leadership, the company\u2019s marketing has shifted to focus on its coffee, rather than discounts and promotions.",
      "When Starbucks announced Narasimhan\u2019s firing and Niccol\u2019s hiring, Schultz issued a statement of support, saying that the then-Chipotle CEO was the leader that the company needs. However, the Leadership Experience marks the first time that Niccol and Schultz have appeared publicly together.",
      "During Narasimhan\u2019s short tenure as CEO, Schultz did not mince words when the company\u2019s performance fell short of his expectations. After a dismal quarterly earnings report, he weighed in publicly on LinkedIn, saying the company needs to improve its mobile order and pay experience and overhaul how it creates new drinks to focus on premium items that set it apart.",
      "But Schultz said Starbucks\u2019 problems went further than just operational issues and lackluster beverages and food.",
      "\u201cThe culture was not understood. The culture wasn\u2019t valued. The culture wasn\u2019t being upheld,\u201d he said on Wednesday.",

      "Rep. Mikie Sherrill\u2019s Democratic primary win Tuesday concluded one of the more crowded competitive primary fields in recent memory.",
      "The six-candidate field for governor included two sitting Congress members (Sherrill and Rep. Josh Gottheimer), two current mayors (Newark\u2019s Ras Baraka and Jersey City\u2019s Steven Fulop), one former mayor (Montclair\u2019s Sean Spiller) and one former state senator (Steve Sweeney).",
      "Nearly all touted their home advantages as their key to the statewide nomination. With the results near complete, here\u2019s a look at how the candidates fared on their home turf.",
      "Newark",
      "Baraka has represented New Jersey\u2019s largest city for more than a decade as its mayor. Prior to his time as mayor, the Newark native served on the Newark municipal council and as a school principal in the city. Baraka had a dominant showing in his hometown \u2014 but the turnout rate in Newark was short of nearby towns. Overall, Baraka outpaced Sherrill in Newark 73%-12%.",
      "But in the remainder of Essex County outside of Newark, Sherrill beat Baraka 39%-33%.",
      "Jersey City",
      "Fulop, like Baraka, has spent over a decade representing his highly populous city. He spent time as a member of the Jersey City Council for eight years before that. Fulop spent the campaign fighting Baraka for the progressive label in the primary and outpaced him by just 5 points in his home city.",
      "Bergen County",
      "Gottheimer represents New Jersey\u2019s 5th Congressional District covering parts of Bergen, Sussex and Passaic counties. Bergen County is the most populous part and heart of his district. Gottheimer posted competitive numbers in Bergen and Sussex but was unable to earn substantial support outside his home zone.",
      "Montclair",
      "While Spiller is currently the head of the New Jersey Education Association, the state\u2019s biggest teachers union, he spent a decade in Montclair as a councilman and mayor. Spiller\u2019s time in office apparently hasn\u2019t resonated positively with current residents. Spiller was trounced in Montclair, far outpaced by Sherrill \u2014 who lives here as well.",
      "Morris County",
      "Sherrill hails from Montclair in Essex County and represents the area in New Jersey\u2019s 11th Congressional District. But it\u2019s Morris County that makes up more than half her district. And the heart of Sherrill\u2019s congressional constituency is where she posted her best county performance of the night.",
      "Gloucester County",
      "The only candidate hailing from South Jersey, Sweeney is a longtime politician serving as a Gloucester County commissioner and state senator representing the county and its neighbors. His theory of the primary led with a strong show of force in South Jersey.",
      "While he did better in his home county, across the eight counties that comprise South Jersey, Sweeney placed second to Sherrill 28%-21%. In North Jersey, however, Sweeney was last among the six candidates, earning 2% of the vote."

      "\"We don't talk about that internally as a group,\" Adams said Wednesday during a Zoom interview with The Associated Press. \"The noise on the outside is the noise on the outside. I think we need to focus on what we need to do as a group and continue to build.\"",

      "\"Whether it was Gold Cup, whether it was Copa (Am\u00e9rica), whether it was Confederations Cup, whether it was the World Cup, I wasn't going to miss competitions,\" Dempsey said last week on the \"Men in Blazers\" podcast. \"For me, I don't understand it because that wasn't my mentality. I always wanted to play in those games.\"",
      "Watching Portugal celebrate its win over Spain in Sunday's European Nations League final, Donovan said on the Fox postgame show: \"I can't help but think about our guys on vacation not wanting to play in Gold Cup.\"",
      "Pulisic has not spoken publicly of his decision.",
      "The U.S. has lost four straight games, its longest skid since 2007, following a 4-0 rout Tuesday night by Switzerland.",
      "\"This is part of the process,\" Adams said. \"You're going to win games. You're going to lose games. It's about continuing to build that. I think we're on the right path. We have to continue to build and try the things that we've been training. It'll take a little bit of time, but it will come together.\"",
      "Adams didn't dress for the Switzerland friendly but is confident he will be ready for the Gold Cup, where the Americans open Sunday against Trinidad and Tobago.",
      "\"A little turf toe-type injury. More of an overuse thing probably than anything \u2014 overload. It was something that I picked up when I came into camp,\" Adams said. \"Progressing well right now, but just trying to be smart and manage it.\"",
      "Adams, who captained the U.S. at the 2022 World Cup, funded a pair of mini-pitches at Pulaski Park in Poughkeepsie, New York, near his home in Wappinger. He spoke on the Zoom about his work with Allstate, the U.S. Soccer Foundation and Black Star Soccer to construct fields about the size of basketball courts at the Fisher Magnet Upper Academy in Detroit and The Bell Avenue School in Yeadon, Pennsylvania.",
      "\"Before the World Cup hopefully we plan to do one more with a city unnamed yet,\" Adams said. \"It's something that I think has real impact, continues to grow the sport, serves underserved communities.\"",
      "Now 26, Adams is feeling back to his old self. He had back surgery last July with Dr. Robert Watkins and returned to the field with England's Bournemouth on Oct. 26. Adams played in 28 Premier League matches this season after being limited to three in 2023-24 because of leg injuries.",

And then when it hits you and you go through that, you just learn different ways to navigate things, enjoy life, just not take things for granted, all the little things.\"",
      "Since Mauricio Pochettino took over as U.S. coach last fall, players have had more autonomy to break away from rigid positioning employed by his predecessor, Gregg Berhalter.",
      "\"From a positional standpoint, obviously we had probably a little bit of a different structure under Gregg,\" Adams said. \"Maurizio gives the players freedom to find spots they're comfortable in and see how they can affect the game in different ways. I think our attacking players definitely have freedom to try and find the ball and create things in the right areas of the field. So, yeah, I think he gives everyone freedom, but there's still structure to the way that we want to play.\"",

You look at your schedule when the season comes out and you have to play in a row Arsenal, Tottenham, Man City, Liverpool, Manchester United, all these big games back to back to back you just learn how to make decisions quicker and if you don't, you get punished.\""

      "Jurors weighing the fate of disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein said Wednesday that they had unanimously found him guilty of sexually assaulting one woman and not guilty of assaulting another more than a decade ago.",
      "But the jurors at Weinstein's retrial told the judge they were unable to reach a verdict on allegations he assaulted a third woman, and Judge Curtis Farber sent them home for the day and asked them to resume deliberating on Thursday.",
      "Weinstein, 73, had denied all the charges and his lawyers insisted the sexual encounters with his three accusers were \u201ctransactional\u201d and \u201cconsensual.\u201d",
      "But the jury came to a different conclusion after five days of deliberations, during which the jury foreman told the judge several times they were having a hard time reaching a verdict and that several members of the panel had been clashing.",
      "Before the partial verdict was announced, the jury foreman told the court he\u2019d been threatened by another member of the panel who told him, \u201cYou know me, you going to see me outside.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel afraid inside there,\u201d the juror told the judge, according to a transcript of the conversation supplied by the New York State Court. \u201cI can\u2019t be inside there.\u201d",
      "Aidala immediately objected.",
      "\u201cYou have a grown man who has now said that people have told him in the jury room they\u2019ll meet him outside,\u201d Aidala said. \u201cHe said it twice.\u201d",
      "Farber dismissed that as \u201cschoolyard nonsense.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe is a big guy,\u201d the judge said. \u201cHe\u2019s not particularly scared. He\u2019s basically saying, \u2018I am not changing my mind.\u2019 He is not being intimidated to change his mind. He is standing his ground, which could be in your favor of the prosecution\u2019s favor.\u201d",
      "Weinstein then asked to address the judge and made a last-minute plea, \"this is not right for me, the person who is on trial here.\"",
      "\"Lawyers can fight all they want,\" Weinstein said, seated in his wheelchair. \"This is my life on the line. It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s that simple. It\u2019s just not fair.\"",
      "Farber agreed this \"was not a typical deliberation but it does happen\" and the result of the deliberations in the third case could wind up being in favor of Weinstein.",
      "\"It could be in my favor, but it\u2019s not fair,\" Weinstein replied. \"That\u2019s the problem with this. ... This is over. \"",
      "Minutes later, the jurors returned to the courtroom and rendered a partial verdict.",
      "Weinstein put his hands to his head after he was found guilty of criminal sexual act for the 2006 attack on former \u201cProject Runway\u201d production assistant Miriam Haley.",
      "But Weinstein was found not guilty of a second charge of criminal sexual act stemming from allegations brought by former Polish runway model Kaja Sokola, who told the court she too was assaulted by the producer in 2006.",
      "The jury deadlocked on a rape in the third-degree charge that Weinstein was hit with for allegedly sexually assaulting former actress Jessica Mann.",
      "Haley\u2019s lawyer Gloria Allred spoke outside of the Manhattan courthouse following the partial verdict saying that the MeToo movement is not dead.",
      "\u201cThe real hero of this case is Mimi Haley, because he was convicted not once, but twice, based on her testimony,\u201d Allred said.",
      "Haley said the verdict left her feeling hopeful and said she hopes others will continue to speak out against against their abusers.",
      "\u201cTo those predators who still believe they can exploit abuse and walk away unscathed. Your time is running out. The world is changing, and you will not outrun the consequences of your actions forever,\u201d Haley said.",
      "Sokola said she was happy with the verdict, even though the jury did not convict Weinstein of assaulting her.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big win for everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cFor myself, it\u2019s closing of a chapter that caused me a lot of pain throughout my life.\u201d",
      "Both Haley and Mann testified at Weinstein\u2019s first trial in 2020. Sokola's charge was new to the retrial.",
      "Weinstein found himself on trial again after the New York state Court of Appeals last year overturned his landmark 2020 conviction for sexually abusing young women, a trial that defined the #MeToo movement and helped turn the Oscar-winning producer into a pariah. The appeals court found that the judge in that trial had improperly allowed testimony against the former Miramax chief based on allegations that were not part of the case.",
      "\u201cIf this person wasn\u2019t Harvey Weinstein, would we even be here?\u201d Weinstein defense attorney Arthur Aidala asked during his closing argument in accusing the women of being grifters.",
      "Prosecutors, however, said Weinstein preyed on young women trying to make it in Hollywood, sometimes repeatedly, and threatened to wreck their careers if they talked.",
      "\u201cHe never had any interest in their careers,\u201d Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg told the jury. \u201cHe had an interest in their bodies. And he was going to have their bodies and touch their bodies whether they had wanted him to or not.\"",
      "Just as in 2020, Weinstein did not testify at his retrial. But he gave an interview to a FOX5 New York reporter after the jury began deliberations, saying that he acted \"immorally\" and regretted hurting his wife and family, but never did anything \"illegal.\"",
      "\"I put so many friends through this and hurt people \u2026 that were close to me, by the way, by actions that were stupid,\" he said. \"But never illegal, never criminal, never anything.\"",
      "Much of the evidence that resulted in Weinstein being convicted five years ago of the third-degree rape of one woman and a first-degree criminal sex act against another woman was reintroduced at his retrial.",
      "Just as before, Weinstein pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree criminal sexual act and third-degree rape based on complaints by Haley and Mann. But this time, Weinstein also pleaded not guilty to an additional charge of first-degree criminal sexual act in the alleged sexual assault of Sokola.",
      "Sokola told the court that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 at a Manhattan hotel when she was 19 years old. But the alleged abuse began in 2002, when she was 16 and Weinstein forced her to masturbate him, she said.",
      "\u201cHer first sexual experience was the defendant forcing himself on her,\u201d Blumberg said.",
      "During his three-hour closing, Aidala tried to poke holes in the testimony of the three accusers. He suggested they were coached by prosecutors to describe the sexual encounters, which he likened at one point to \u201cnaked twister,\u201d in a sinister light.",
      "\u201cThey did it all to get the original sinner, the poster boy of the MeToo movement,\u201d Aidala said.",
      "The #MeToo hashtag took off in 2017 following reports in The New York Times and The New Yorker that detailed allegations of sexual misconduct against Weinstein that went back decades. It helped inspire a reckoning in Hollywood and beyond around sexual harassment.",
      "Weinstein, Aidala added, made for an easy target. \u201cHe\u2019s a fat dude \u2014 sorry, Harvey,\u201d he said while the former producer looked on.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really a casting couch I thought it was,\u201d Aidala added. \u201cIt\u2019s different now. I know it sounds crazy, but he\u2019s the one being used.\u201d",
      "Blumberg painted a far different picture during the prosecution's closing remarks.",
      "\u201cI want to remind you why we are here,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause he raped three people.\u201d",
      "Sokola and Haley both claimed that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on them in separate incidents in 2006. Mann told the court the producer raped her in 2013.",
      "Weinstein, Blumberg said, \u201chad tremendous control over Hollywood. He spoke, people listened. He decided who was in and who was out.\u201d",
      "\u201cRemember, it\u2019s not the person sitting here today in a wheelchair but this man, in Hollywood, who had the power and was in control,\u201d Blumberg said.",
      "Regardless of the verdict, Weinstein will most likely be returned to California where he has to serve a 16-year sentence for a 2022 rape conviction. His lawyers filed an appeal for that conviction in 2024 that is still in process.",
      "During his latest trial, Weinstein has been allowed to stay at Bellevue Hospital where he was being treated for a host of serious health issues.",
      "Back in October, two sources told NBC News that Weinstein had been diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia, an uncommon form of bone marrow cancer.",
      "Weinstein was a Hollywood titan in the 1990s and 2000s when he and his brother Bob ran Miramax, the distributor of critically acclaimed independent movies like \u201cSex, Lies, and Videotape,\u201d \u201cThe Crying Game,\u201d \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cClerks,\u201d and box office successes like \u201cChicago\u201d and \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Diary.\u201d",
      "In 1999, Weinstein won a best picture Oscar as one of the producers of \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d And in the early 2010s, his second distribution label, The Weinstein Company, won back-to-back best picture Oscars for \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cThe Artist.\u201d",
      "But as Weinstein collected accolades, he was dogged by rumors that he preyed on his leading ladies and other women in the industry. By the time he was arrested, more than 80 women had accused him of sexual assault or harassment going back decades.",
      "Just as he did at his trials, Weinstein doggedly denied the claims and insisted the encounters were consensual."

      "It's been three years since the actor made a brief appearance on the CBS daytime drama to mark the show's 35th anniversary. Before that, Wagner played Nick from 2003-2012.",
      "So, what brings the character back this time around? Love, naturally.",
      "\"Nick is coming back because he heard that Brooke\u2019s (Katherine Kelly Lang) heart is broken and what\u2019s happened in this triangle with Ridge (Thorsten Kaye) and Taylor (Rebecca Budig),\" he tells TODAY.com during a video interview.",

      "Brooke and Nick also have a complicated history. Over the years, Nick has been romantically linked to Brooke's two sisters and one of her daughters, in addition to Taylor. But Wagner says his character keeps coming back to Brooke since she was \"his initial love.\"",
      "In the years since viewers have last seen Nick, he\u2019s had a lot going on, and fans will get to learn a bit more about his backstory.",
      "\u201cI really felt he needed to upgrade from living on the Shady Marlin (his boat). Like he wasn\u2019t this scruffy, bearded, smoking sea captain anymore. This guy is now a shipping titan. He runs Marone Industries, an international shipping company,\" Wagner says.",
      "While preparing for his return to the show, Wagner advocated for an upgraded wardrobe that was fit for his character's advanced professional status. He also had a say in how his character would present himself when he reunited with Brooke.",
      "\u201cI told Brad (Bell, executive producer and head writer of the show), 'I think the key here is masculine. This has to be real masculine, confident energy from Nick,'\u201d he says.",

      "\"We tried to re-create that as best we could with Kelly trying on some lingerie, and all of a sudden I'm kind of like, 'Who\u2019s there?'\" he recalls.",
      "Talking some sense into Brooke is Nick's main goal, but he will briefly interact with a few other characters, including Taylor and Ridge, his rival and half brother.",

      "Returning to the show after all these years felt like \"jumping on a moving train\" for Wagner in the best possible way.",
      "\"Kelly and I love to work together, and we collaborate very nicely,\" he says of his co-star. \"And Brad (Bell) collaborates with the dialogue and things I want to do for the character.\"",

      "Viewers will have to tune in to see exactly what happens, but Wagner is happy to give a little teaser, saying, \"It's really a big deal how he leaves it and Brooke's reaction to what Nick presents for her.\"",
      "Looking ahead, the actor says it \"might be possible\" to pull double duty on \u201cB&B\u201d and \u201cWhen Calls the Heart.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll dust off my charming guy and my romantic guy on both shows. Who knows?\u201d he says.",

When it comes to blending eyeshadow or blending spices, I want everything to be just right. But what really ties drag and food together is the way they both unite people.\u201d",

      "She describes the \u201cculture shock\u201d of the cafeteria at school \u2014 leaving behind the fresh variety of a Korean midday meal to eat a typical American lunch. This led her to the kitchen, fostering a lifelong interest in foods that don\u2019t come with a mini-carton of milk.",
      "\u201cAfter growing up in Korea and then moving to the States, being able to recreate the Korean dishes that my grandmother or my mom used to make in Korea was a good way to connect to my culture, especially where I grew up in small-town Michigan,\u201d Kim Chi says. \u201cThere really wasn\u2019t that much diversity.\u201d",

      "A childhood staple in the book that was also born out of the need to be creative is budae jjigae, aka \u201cArmy Base Stew,\u201d a hearty noodle stew that originated after the Korean War, as South Korean soldiers used U.S. military rations.

      "\u201cAt the beginning of wedding planning, I really rejected the concept of being walked down by a man to be handed to another man,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom also walked herself down the aisle, so in a sense, I guess we are creating our own tradition for the women in our family.\u201d",

      "Matt\u2019s vows focused on their smaller, intimate moments: \u201cIt\u2019s the conversations at 3 a.m. when we both can\u2019t sleep, shrouded in darkness of night, and thus able to speak more openly to one another. The whiskey in our yard on Friday nights after a long week. You mean the world to me. Thank you for coming into my life. I love you.\u201d",

    "summary": "Mark Hamill talks about his role in \"The Life of Chuck\" and why the Stephen King movie might make you cry \"tears of joy.\"",
    "story": [
      "Mark Hamill's new film is probably going to make you cry, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't see it.",
      "\"It's tears of joy because it reaffirms your belief in mankind,\" Hamill explains in a sit-down interview with TODAY.com.",
      "The movie? \"The Life of Chuck.\" It's the latest project for the \"Star Wars\" actor, who plays Albie Krantz, the wise grandfather of Charles \"Chuck\" Krantz. Chuck is a man whose life is chronicled in reverse by four different actors: Cody Flanagan, Benjamin Pajak, Jacob Tremblay and Tom Hiddleston, who portrays Chuck as an adult.",
      "Based on Stephen King's 2020 novella of the same name, it's a serious departure from the writer's typical horror genre, although  Hamill says it's still got a few of King's signature trademarks, including supernatural and apocalyptic elements.",
      "\"It's certainly nothing like Stephen King has ever written before,\" says Hamill. \"He's done 'Green Mile' and 'The Body,' which became 'Stand By Me,' but even by those standards, this is unlike anything he's done.\"",
      "Also starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mia Sara and Karen Gillan, Hamill says \"The Life of Chuck\" is \"indescribable\" but so profound \u2013 and good \u2013 that he asked if he could \"go out on the talk shows\" to encourage viewers to \"please see it. Trust me, you'll thank me later.\"",
      "If audiences at the Toronto International Film Festival are any indication, he doesn't have to worry. After premiering at the festival, the film took home the People's Choice Award and has since garnered rave reviews by many critics, some of whom called the film one of the year's best.",
      "\"It's so positive. It's so optimistic about life,\" Hamill tells TODAY.com. \"It also teaches you there are moments that, in life, you think are trivial that collectively become very important.\"",
      "And if \"The Life of Chuck\" leaves people in tears, Hamill says it's because a movie \"this original\" only \"comes along once in a lifetime.\"",
      "\"I just loved it,\" he says. \"It's wonderful.\"",
      "'The Long Walk'",
      "\"The Life of Chuck\" isn't Hamill's only collaboration with King. The actor also appears in the upcoming film \"The Long Walk,\" a horror movie based on King's 1979 novel of the same name (published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman), starring Ben Wang, Cooper Hoffman, David Jonsson and Judy Greer, among others.",
      "\"The premise is just ghastly,\" he says of the film. \"It is more in the mold of what you associate Stephen King with.\"",
      "Less of a supernatural movie and more straight-up horror, \"The Long Walk\" takes place in a dystopian future and revolves around a group of young men who are chosen, a la \"The Hunger Games,\" to participate in a walk that only ends when everyone dies, except for a single, indomitable winner.",
      "\"The rules are simple: You walk until only one is alive,\" explains Hamill, saying that if walkers lag behind, fall to their knees or deviate from the walk in any way, it's \"a bullet to the head.\"",
      "Based on its grim premise, Hamill says his initial reaction to the role was, \"Not only can I not be in this, I don't think I can see it.\"",
      "But given that Francis Lawrence, the iconic director of \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" and \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay\" Parts 1 and 2, along with other notable films including the sci-fi classic \"I Am Legend,\" was at the helm of \"The Long Walk,\" Hamill says he reconsidered.",
      "\"I really admire him as a director,\" he explains, saying that after a call with Lawrence he changed his mind. \"By the end of the Zoom call, I said, 'Well, I've got to do it.' And my boys, of course, read it and said, 'Dad, this is great. You've got to do it.'\"",
      "Hamill plays a military major, or as he puts it, \"a badass guy,\" but says the true stars of the movie are the young actors he worked with, calling them the \"heart and soul\" of the movie.",
      "\"I was so impressed. These are all the young actors you're going to see in the future.\"",
      "'I Owe the World to Mike Flanagan'",
      "As for his own future, Hamill says he's loving \"every minute\" of his career right now and hopes to work on more projects with Mike Flanagan, the director and screenwriter of \"The Life of Chuck.\" Flanagan also created such notable series as \"The Haunting of Hill House,\" \"Midnight Mass\" and \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" in which Hamill played Arthur Pym, a shadowy figure known as the \"Pym Reaper.\"",
      "\"It's the first time I've ever been asked to play something so far from myself on camera,\" he says of the role. \"Because I was playing a sociopathic, soulless, evil lawyer.\"",
      "Having done voice work for decades, Hamill says it's a role that would have been routine if he had done it as a voice-over, but he is grateful to Flanagan for giving him the opportunity to do such a \"juicy\" role in front of the camera.",
      "\"I owe the world to Mike Flanagan. That's why I'm so loyal to him. That's why I jumped at 'The Life of Chuck,'\" he says, continuing, \"He's just wonderful.\"",
      "As for what's next, Hamill says he's got yet another, undisclosed project in the works with Flanagan, but for the moment remains firmly focused on ensuring that audiences come out to see \"The Life of Chuck.\"",
      "\"You realize that human beings are inherently good,\" he says of the film's takeaway. \"And in this atmosphere of division and anger and uncertainty, it's exactly the right movie at exactly the right time.\""

      "Seattle police were dispatched to the home at 12:48 a.m. Saturday after a call from a woman who identified herself as a nanny and said two men had broken in. She told police she was able to get out of the home but that three children were still inside.",
      "A police report redacted the name of the owner of the home, but said it belonged to a \u201chigh-profile individual.\u201d The address listed in the report appeared to match that on Macklemore\u2019s voting record, the Seattle Times reported. A part of the report also left the surname \u201cDavis\u201d \u2014 the same last name as Macklemore\u2019s wife.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if the artist, whose real name is Ben Haggerty, was home at the time. He had performances in Ireland on June 4 and 5.",
      "The nanny told police the break-in happened after she had put the kids to bed on the second floor. She said was on the main floor when she saw \u201ctwo men entering a patio door.\u201d",
      "The men were wearing masks, black clothing, vests that appeared to be tactical and gloves and were carrying cans of bear mace, she told police.",
      "A taller man ordered a shorter one to \u201cspray her\u201d and he did so, according to a police report. Then he tried to help clean it off her face, the nanny told police, adding, \u201cshe believed she saw his eyes and thought he was fearful.\u201d",
      "The nanny said the taller man yelled,\u201cWhere are the jewels?\u201d according to the police report.",
      "The woman directed them to the home\u2019s primary bedroom, where they raked through drawers, cabinets and the closet, police said. The nanny told police \u201cthey took numerous watches, jewelry items, and shoes that they put into bags,\u201d according to the police report.",
      "She was ordered to keep her hands up and face toward a mirror, police said. At one point the shorter man threw her to the ground and put a boot on her ankle, then on the back of her neck and took her phone, she told police.",
      "The nanny started to scream and was pinned against a wall, with the shorter one holding her mouth shut, the police report said. She tried to kick the shorter one in the groin but was unable to see so she bit onto his hand hard, causing him to let go. The nanny then ran out of the home and knocked on numerous neighbors\u2019 doors before someone opened the door and let her call police, the report said.",
      "The men were gone by the time police searched the home and removed the children, officials said. Family arrived and took the children to a nearby residence.",
      "A passerby told a responding officer that they had seen a man wearing all black running westbound through the yards north of the home.",
      "NBC News has reached out to Macklemore\u2019s reps for comment.",
      "Macklemore is married to Tricia Davis and they share three young children."

      "She said she knew it was over between them once he started feeding into romance rumors with a co-star.",

      "\u201cIt was just, this is what I have to do for my job. I had two options. I could either pretend like I was going along with everything and have everyone wonder, like, \u2018Are they hooking up? Are they not hooking up? Is she OK with this?

    "story": [
      "For years, V. E. Schwab hasn\u2019t felt \"gay enough.\"",
      "\"With quotation marks \u2014 obviously it's an absurd concept,\" she tells TODAY.com. \"There is no such thing, and I know that.\"",
      "Schwab's journey coming out as queer started about 10 years ago, she says. But the hit fantasy author \u2014\u00a0known for 2013's \"Vicious,\" 2015's \"A Darker Shade of Magic,\" the 2020 BookTok darling \"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue\" and more \u2014 has long strived to \"assimilate\" into the genre.",
      "When she started publishing, she downplayed the fact that she's a woman. And though her stories always featured LGBTQ+ characters, (in a 2018 tweet, Schwab notably said all characters in her \"Shades of Magic\" series \"should be presumed queer unless stated otherwise\"),\u00a0she didn't lead with her own \"queerness,\" she says.",
      "\"I didn't want to do anything that would limit the growth of readership,\" Schwab says.",
      "The result was that \"no one ever thinks I'm gay,\" she reflects now. She thought she didn't mind. If blending behind the pseudonym of her initials meant someone may read her books, not knowing the breadth of identities ahead, and learn something? Better than someone not picking up the book at all, she says.",
      "In 2020, Schwab told her coming out story publicly in an essay for Oprah Daily. But it wasn't until her latest novel, \"Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil,\" out June 10, that she felt comfortable living, being, existing in that story.",
      "\"What I didn't predict and what turned out to be true is the catharsis of writing this book as a gay person,\" Schwab says. \"I did not realize how badly I needed to write this in order to take up the space of this story.\"",
      "\u2018I Can't Think of Any Greater Gift\u2019",
      "\"Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil\" follows three women across a 500-year period, with alternating perspectives. The book opens with 10-year-old Maria in 1500s Spain. We next meet Alice, a college first-year in 2019 trying to face her anxiety at a party. Within pages, both Maria (who later renames herself Sabine) and Alice describe themselves \u2014 or who they want to be \u2014 as \"feral.\"",
      "Then there's Charlotte, or Lottie, born in 1800s England, who knots their stories all together.",
      "All three start as young women chafing against their circumstances, until another woman arrives. (Sabine encounters a widow passing through her home of Santo Domingo, Charlotte encounters Sabine, and Alice encounters Charlotte.) Their stories are different, but end the same: Each woman leaves dead \u2014 specifically, as a vampire.",
      "Schwab was inspired by the \"classic\" vampiric lore \u2014 \"everything from 'Carmilla' essentially up through Anne Rice,\" she says.",
      "\"If you go back and you look at these classic vampires, they're inherently queer, they're inherently liminal, they represent knowledge and the danger of being exposed to an alternate potential future,\" she says. \"And the idea is that once you're exposed, you can never go back to ignorance.\"",
      "A longtime love of vampires was just one of the \"ingredients\" that went into \"Bury Our Bones.\" (\"I see my stories as a meal,\" Schwab explains.) Other themes include queer love throughout history and collateral damage, first explored through what Schwab had long been taught about one-night stands.",
      "\"I'm an only child, and for some reason, my parents thought the way to keep me safe growing up \u2014 I remember this coming in at like, 13, it was a lesson for my future \u2014\u00a0was to never have a one-night stand,\" Schwab says, explaining she was taught that by definition, the act involves being in close quarters with a complete stranger and \"putting yourself in inherent danger.\"",
      "\"I always thought this was a hysterical take,\" she adds.",
      "For Alice's storyline, Schwab followed this lesson to its most extreme conclusion. In the spirit of taking on the mantle of a \"New Alice\" at university, Alice invites a woman (Charlotte) home to have sex ... and wakes up dead, paying the price of Charlotte's desire.",
      "She's robbed of a choice, but she's granted the metaphorical and literal teeth that ensure ultimate survival.",
      "\"I think we spend so much time with male vampires as the lead, and I'm like, 'They don't need it,'\" she says. \"You know who actually needs teeth, is the person who is made to feel small, told to limit their desire, told never to be insatiable, told never to want, told exactly how little they are supposed to take up in the world.\"",
      "To Schwab, the most important moment in the book occurs when Alice in the present day realizes the she has nothing to be afraid of. No, everyone else fears her.",
      "\"The thing about an immortal is that they endure. That is, by definition, what they do. They endure when you shouldn't be able to, and I can't think of any greater gift to give my lesbian women than the sense that they would get to know they would endure,\" she says.",
      "Writing Herself Into the Story",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com less than two weeks before publication date, Schwab says she's feeling \"deep, deep, crashing out in real time-level neuroses.\" Normally she'd be on deadline for her next project, but she purposefully finished a first draft of her next work (\"Victorious,\" the third and final book in the \"Villains\" series) early to be present for the release of \"Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil.\"",
      "\"In many ways, this story is about the three eras of my own queer coming out journey, and going from not knowing who you are, to just wanting to be loved, to being unapologetic,\" Schwab says. \"There's just a lot more nonfiction underpinning the fiction than I'm used to.\"",
      "Sabine represents the version of Schwab that was able to write a book like this, she says. Sabine is unapologetic about her beliefs, actions and behaviors, even as the novel's \"villain.\" She's fully realized and uninterested in \"conforming to anyone else's idea of what a life is,\" Schwab says.",
      "\"I think I had to get to her in my own journey before I could look back at my Alice and Lottie years,\" she says.",
      "Alice, the youngest of the pack, starts the novel open about her sexuality but struggling to define herself out of the shadow of her sister. She stands in for a version of Schwab who was trying to find her identity while dealing with the \"whiplash\" of a major event shaking one's foundation. For Schwab, it was realizing she was gay. For Alice, it was waking up a vampire.",
      "Then there's the \"Lottie years,\" or as Schwab calls them, \"the toxic years.\" Charlotte is defined by \"desperately wanting to be loved,\" even at the expense of others.",
      "When asked for one true \"villain\" of her vampire novel, Schwab gives the potentially hot take of Lottie. (\"We do not stan someone who perceives themselves as a victim when they are an abuser,\" Schwab says.) But all three women make terrible decisions and do awful things. That's, too, a reflection of Schwab's experience coming out and her relationship with publishing.",
      "\"For many, many years, even after I had come out, there was a sense that you could not write a queer villain, lest the readership conflate queerness and villainy,\" she says. \"It's such a harmfully reductive take because it suggests that queer characters, and by extension, queer humans, are not afforded the same level of complexity and nuance as their straight counterparts.\"",
      "By embracing a trio of \"messy b----es\" to lead the novel, every page, sentence and word, Schwab says, hones in on one purpose: hunger.",
      "\"I wanted to write a book about hunger in all of the forms that it takes, specifically for women and femme-presenting people and queer people \u2014 the hunger to be loved, to be seen, to be understood, and the hunger to take up space in a world that tries to make you small,\" she says. \"I think that's what I achieved.\"",
      "Returning to 'the Garden' \u2014 and the Easter Egg You Might Have Missed",
      "Before \"Bury Our Bones,\" Schwab didn't think she'd ever put herself \"so clearly\" into a project again. \"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue\" featured a character named Henry, whom Schwab describes as a character she \"wrote myself into.\"",
      "In the 2020 novel, the titular character trades being forgotten by everyone she meets for immortality. Henry is the first person who remembers her after her deal with the devil.",
      "If Addie and her sense of hope are an inspiration, the story of Sabine, Charlotte and Alice is more about the messes immortal beings leave behind.",
      "\u201cI wanted something a little bit angrier,\u201d Schwab says. \u201cI think that\u2019s just an indicator of my own growth as a person. I think that\u2019s an indicator of the landscape of the world. I just spend a lot of my time feeling stifled or angry or what have you.\u201d",
      "It's fitting then that \"Bury Our Bones\" is set in the same universe as \"Addie LaRue.\" Both are Schwab's take on \"urban fantasy, but in a literary way,\" she says, a world facsimiled of our own that she refers to as \"the Garden.\"",
      "\"I wouldn't be surprised if I revisit this space, because it's a place that I really enjoy creatively and aesthetically,\" Schwab says. \"I can see the Garden growing together and apart and in multiple directions.\"",
      "There's even a cameo from a character in \"Addie LaRue\" in a blink-and-you-miss-it moment more than halfway through the book, told in Charlotte's perspective. The goal is to establish that in this Garden, \"there are multiple kinds of magic and wonder and monstrosity just intertwined with our time and place and our history.\"",
      "Schwab says only eagle-eyed readers may spot the reference. And though she calls it the \"loosest thread\" she'd likely ever tie between her Garden books, it has consequences for the wider story.",
      "\"It has a repercussion if readers stop and think about it, which is that these characters are occupying the same terrain,\" Schwab says. \"They are coexisting in the same landscape. Addie's history has at some point tangled with one of our vampires.'\""

      "\"The Studio\" star was a proud dad on TODAY on June 10 when asked about his daughter and fellow actor Taylor Dearden. She received a host of accolades earlier this year for her performance as Dr. Melissa King on the inaugural season of Max's acclaimed hospital drama \"The Pitt.\"",
      "\u201cWell, Taylor is a wonderful, hard-working actor,\" Cranston said. \"She grew up in this business with my wife and I being actors. And so, we\u2019re so proud of her.\"",
      "Dearden is the only child of Cranston, 69, and his wife of over 35 years, actor Robin Dearden. The younger Dearden's first television appearance came in a role in a 2010 episode of the legendary show \"Breaking Bad\" starring Cranston.",
      "She also appeared in Netflix's \"American Vandal\" in 2018 and three episodes of the Apple TV+ drama \"For All Mankind\" in 2022.",
      "\"When I hear praise for Taylor\u2019s work on \u2018The Pitt,\u2019 it means more to me than anything anyone could ever say to me about my work,\" Cranston told Craig Melvin, who is a father of two. \"You know, you\u2019re a proud dad. And I\u2019m OK. I could retire after you hear that.\u201d",
      "Dearden plays a young resident with a sister who has autism on \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d which details a chaotic and traumatic day in an emergency room at a Pittsburgh trauma center. It\u2019s the first day on the job for Dearden\u2019s character, who is neurodivergent.",
      "In real life, Dearden is neurodivergent, which she spoke about with NPR in April in connection to her role.",
      "\u201cI told them that I relate to this character because I see a lot of the neurodivergent parts of Mel as something I experience all the time,\u201d she said about the show's creator, R. Scott Gemmill, and executive producer John Wells.",
      "She said Wells asked if she was comfortable sharing that part of herself in the role.",
      "\u201cAnd I realized it\u2019s, like, you know, I can mask only so much, and I\u2019m really ready for people to know,\u201d she told NPR. \u201cI tell everyone I meet because there are certain social behaviors that might seem odd. And so I usually have to tell everyone I meet, like, in case I do this, just so you know, it\u2019s not on purpose. So it was great for them to let it be my decision completely. I feel like it\u2019s the right move.\u201d",
      "Watching his daughter's career blossom and spending time with family is what led Cranston to declare in January 2024 that he\u2019s planning to \u201chit the pause button\u201c on his own career. He clarified previous rumors that he had been planning to retire by saying on TODAY that he more just wants to take a break to spend time with his wife and pursue other interests.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been married to the best person in the world for 35 years,\u201d Cranston said at the time. \u201cBut she has been the \u2018plus one\u2019 in this industry, right, and I want to change that. I want to move that out of that kind of imbalance and go away with her and just kind of \u2026 she\u2019s looking forward to having me back, and not having to follow me around.\u201d"

      "\u201cI loved it,\u201d she said. \u201cI came onboard to play Christy, and I had about three and a half months of training. I started eating. I weight-trained in the morning for an hour, kickboxed midday for about two hours, and then weight-trained again at night for an hour.\u201d",

And then my parents got me into grappling, which is like wrestling, and kickboxing,\u201d she said. \u201cI was the only girl at the dojo. I trained there from 13 until about 19. I fought all guys. I liked to think that if s--- went down, I might be able to step up.\u201d"

      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 Palestinians desperately trying to access aid in Gaza came under fire again Tuesday, killing 36 people and wounding 207, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.",
      "Experts and humanitarian aid workers say Israel\u2019s blockade and 20-month military campaign have pushed Gaza to the brink of famine.",
      "At least 163 people have been killed and 1,495 wounded in a number of shootings near aid sites run by the Israeli and U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which are in military zones that are off-limits to independent media. The Israeli military has acknowledged firing warning shots on previous occasions at people who it says approached its forces in a suspicious manner.",
      "The foundation says there has been no violence in or around the distribution points themselves. But it has warned people to stay on designated access routes and it paused delivery last week while it held talks with the military on improving safety.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that there is \u201cmeaningful progress\u201d on a possible ceasefire deal that would also return some of the 55 hostages still being held in Gaza, but said it was \u201ctoo early to hope.\u201d Foreign Minister Gideon Saar also mentioned Tuesday that there was progress in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "Netanyahu was meeting with the Israeli negotiating team and the defense minister Tuesday evening to discuss next steps.",
      "In southern Gaza, at least eight people were killed while trying to obtain aid around Rafah, according to Nasser Hospital.",
      "In northern Gaza, two men and a child were killed and at least 130 were wounded on Tuesday, according to Nader Garghoun, a spokesperson for al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. He said most were being treated for gunshot wounds.",
      "Witnesses told The Associated Press that Israeli forces opened fire around 2 a.m. (7 p.m. Monday ET), several hundred yards from the aid site in central Gaza. Crowds of Palestinians seeking desperately needed food often head to the sites hours before dawn, hoping to beat the crowds.",
      "The Israeli military said it fired warning shots at people it referred to as suspects. It said they had advanced toward its troops hundreds of yards from the aid site prior to its opening hours.",
      "Mohammed Abu Hussein, a resident of the nearby built-up Bureij refugee camp, said Israeli drones and tanks opened fire, and that he saw five people wounded by gunshots.",
      "Abed Haniyah, another witness, said Israeli forces opened fire \u201cindiscriminately\u201d as thousands of people were attempting to reach the food site.",
      "\u201cWhat happens every day is humiliation,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day, people are killed just trying to get food for their children.\u201d",
      "Additionally, three Palestinian medics were killed in an Israeli strike Tuesday in Gaza City, according to the health ministry.",
      "The medics from the health ministry\u2019s emergency service were responding to an Israeli attack on a house in Jaffa street in Gaza City when a second strike hit the building, the ministry said. The Israeli military did not comment on the strike, but said over the past day the air force has hit dozens of targets belonging to Hamas\u2019 military infrastructure, including rocket launchers.",
      "Israel and the United States say they set up the new food distribution system to prevent Hamas from stealing humanitarian aid and using it to finance militant activities.",
      "The United Nations, which runs a long-standing system capable of delivering aid to all parts of Gaza, says there is no evidence of any systematic diversion.",
      "U.N. agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the new system, saying it violates humanitarian principles by allowing Israel to decide who receives aid and by forcing Palestinians to relocate to just three currently operational sites.",
      "The other two distribution sites are in the now mostly uninhabited southern city of Rafah, which Israel has transformed into a military zone. Israeli forces maintain an outer perimeter around all three hubs, and Palestinians must pass close to them to reach the distribution points.",
      "Hamas started the war with its terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 others hostage. They still hold 55 hostages, fewer than half of them alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed nearly 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. It says women and children make up most of the dead, but doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population, often multiple times."

      "The decision by Western governments friendly to Israel was a sharp rebuke of Israel\u2019s settlement policies in the West Bank and of settler violence, which has spiked since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack ignited the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, key partners in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, are champions of Israeli settlement who support continuing the war in Gaza, facilitating what they call the voluntary emigration of its Palestinian population and the rebuilding of Jewish settlements there.",
      "They could now face asset freezes and travel bans.",
      "In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the five countries said Ben-Gvir and Smotrich \u201chave incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights. Extremist rhetoric advocating the forced displacement of Palestinians and the creation of new Israeli settlements is appalling and dangerous.\u201d",
      "U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the two men \u201chave been inciting violence against Palestinian people for months and months and months\u201d and \u201cencouraging egregious abuses of human rights.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese measures are directed at individuals who directly contribute to extremist settler violence,\u201d said Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand. \u201cThe measures are not directed against the state of Israel itself.\u201d",
      "New Zealand\u2019s Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Wednesday that Smotrich and Ben-Gvir \u201chave severely and deliberately undermined\u201d prospects for peace and security while \u201cinciting violence and forced displacement.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur action today is not against the Israeli people, who suffered immeasurably on October 7 and who have continued to suffer through Hamas\u2019 ongoing refusal to release all hostages,\u201d Peters said in a statement. \u201cNor is it designed to sanction the wider Israeli government.\u201d",
      "Smotrich wrote on social media that he learned of the sanctions while he was inaugurating a new West Bank settlement. \u201cWe are determined to continue building,\u201d he said.",
      "Ben-Gvir, also writing on social media, said \u201cwe overcame Pharoah, we\u2019ll overcome Starmer\u2019s Wall,\u201d referring to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. condemned the sanctions and urged their reversal.",
      "\u201cWe reject any notion of equivalence: Hamas is a terrorist organization that committed unspeakable atrocities, continues to hold innocent civilians hostage, and prevents the people of Gaza from living in peace,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cWe remind our partners not to forget who the real enemy is.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s government also condemned the announcement, which came as traditional allies of Israel escalate denouncements of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, from the high civilian death toll to a monthslong blockade that led to famine warnings.",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar called the sanctions decision \u201coutrageous.\u201d He said he had discussed it with Netanyahu and that they would meet next week to discuss Israel\u2019s response.",
      "He said the move threatened to harden Hamas\u2019 stance in ongoing negotiations to end the war in Gaza and to cut short Israel\u2019s operation in Gaza before it achieves its goals.",
      "Benny Gantz, a centrist Israeli lawmaker and political rival to Netanyahu, wrote that he \u201cvehemently\u201d disagreed with Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, but said the move was a \u201cprofound moral mistake and sends a dangerous message to terrorists around the world.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu is the target of an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court last year over alleged war crimes in Gaza, part of a global wave of outrage at Israel\u2019s conduct during its 20-month war against Hamas. Netanyahu has denied the allegations and accused the court of being biased against Israel.",
      "The Biden administration took the rare step of sanctioning radical Israeli settlers implicated in violence in the occupied West Bank \u2014 sanctions that were lifted by President Donald Trump.",
      "Eitay Mack, an Israeli human rights lawyer who spent years campaigning for the sanctions on Smotrich and Ben-Gvir \u2014 along with violent West Bank settlers \u2014 described Tuesday\u2019s move as \u201chistoric.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt means the wall of immunity that Israeli politicians had has been broken,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that it took so long for Western governments to sanction Israeli politicians, and the fact that it\u2019s being done while Trump is president is quite amazing.\u201d",
      "Mack added: \u201cIt is a message to Netanyahu himself that he could be next.\u201d",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for a future state.",
      "Successive Israeli governments have promoted settlement growth and construction stretching back decades. It has exploded under Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition, which has settlers in key Cabinet posts.",
      "There are now well over 100 settlements across the West Bank that house more than 500,000 settlers. The settlers have Israeli citizenship, while the territory\u2019s 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority administering population centers.",
      "Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal, and Palestinians see them as the greatest obstacle to an eventual two-state solution, which is still seen internationally as the only way to resolve the conflict."

      "The vessel departed as Israel allowed a trickle of aid into Gaza after lifting a widely condemned blockade that had barred the entry of food, medicine and other vital supplies for more than two months.",

      "The GHF's centers have been intermittently closed over the week after dozens of Palestinians were shot and killed near its operations.",

    "story": [
      "As U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet for trade talks in London this week, a primary concern for Washington will be whether Beijing eases the flow of rare earth materials, which have become key components of modern life.",
      "China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths, mining about 70% and refining 90% of the materials used to produce everything from wind turbines and defense equipment to electric vehicles and car seats. The United States produces virtually none of the world\u2019s rare earths, whose extraction can be devastating for the environment.",
      "That economic vulnerability has come into sharper focus since April, when China imposed export controls on seven strategic rare earth metals and related magnets amid an escalating trade war with President Donald Trump. Companies, especially automakers and business associations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere have sounded the alarm, warning that China\u2019s rare earth restrictions risk delays that could bring manufacturing to a halt.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Monday that U.S. negotiators in London were seeking a \u201chandshake\u201d from China on rare earths after Trump said last week that Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to resume their flow in the first call between the two leaders since Trump returned to office.",
      "\u201cThey were kind of releasing them, but it was going a lot slower than some companies believed was optimal,\u201d Hassett said.",

    "story": [
      "A Burmese American woman was eager to bring her siblings over to the U.S. from Myanmar amid a more than 15-year wait for visas. She\u2019d been hoping to reunite with them since the 1990s, during military rule in her home country, so her brother\u2019s family could start a life in the U.S. But a day after she bought the plane tickets, President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban that included Myanmar.",
      "The woman, 51, and her husband, who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, had sponsored her brother and sister-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The siblings were then were hoping to bring their own adult kids, too, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to fulfill mandatory military service in the country\u2019s active civil war.",
      "With the travel ban in effect Monday, they said the policy has a heightened impact on people from war-torn countries like Myanmar who had hopes of finding sanctuary in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating because we were on the cusp of securing their safety to leave that situation,\u201d said her husband, 57, adding he felt like a \u201crug got pulled out from under us in an instant.\u201d",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump\u2019s policy is in the \u201cbest interest of the American people and their safety.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis commonsense, country-specific travel restrictions include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe restrictions fulfill the President\u2019s day one promise to protect American citizens from dangerous foreign actors who may come to the United States and cause us harm.\u201d",
      "The travel restrictions, announced on Wednesday, completely bar entry to the U.S. for people from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in addition to those from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.",
      "According to Trump\u2019s proclamation, several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals while others had visa overstay rates that the administration deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d A few countries lacked \u201cthe competence of the central authority\u201d for issuing passports, the proclamation said.",
      "Jackson also pointed out a section in the proclamation that allows for applications for refugee status.",
      "\u201cNothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the [international Convention Against Torture], consistent with the laws of the United States,\u201d the proclamation said.",
      "However, after he took office, Trump limited refugee admissions for almost all countries including Myanmar. And in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration. Those immigrants came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and are now subject to deportation.",
      "Myanmar was among the nine countries in the latest proclamation that Trump also targeted during his first term. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. issued 13,284 visas to the country, with business and tourism permits making up the most common types of visas. Myanmar recorded 1,384 overstays that fiscal year, equating to an overstay rate of almost 30%.",
      "The new travel ban comes as Myanmar\u2019s violent military regime fights to hold on to power after it seized control from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup. Since then, violence has escalated across the region as the military clashes with ethnic minority rebel groups and pro-democracy militias.",
      "\u201cJunta forces have slaughtered thousands of civilians, bombed and burned villages, and displaced millions of people,\u201d Tom Andrews, United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said in a press release earlier this year. \u201cMore than 20,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. The economy and public services have collapsed. Famine and starvation loom over large parts of the population.\u201d",
      "Under the new travel ban, anyone who obtained a visa prior to the policy is still able to come to the U.S. But there\u2019s confusion over how the restrictions will be implemented and enforced. The Burmese American woman and her husband are among those with concerns, particularly as there have been several cases of lawful permanent residents and citizens being swept up in the dragnet of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that they could be randomly picked up because somebody had a bad day at the office, or somebody didn\u2019t do their job or didn\u2019t believe that their visa was true,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly terrifying.\u201d",
      "For the woman, reunification with her brother has been a long time coming. She became a citizen in the late 1990s and began the process to help bring her sibling over a few years later. At the time, Myanmar had been under the control of a strict military junta that held power from the 1960s until 2011, and for decades had kept the country in a state of extreme isolation and deprivation. She said her brother, whose children were just a few years old then, hoped to come over and root his family in more stability.",
      "\u201cTheir circumstances in Myanmar at that time were very, very bad. That was the system that I grew up in. There was no future for them, no prosperity,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMy brother was concerned for his children\u2019s future and education.\u201d",
      "Amid moves and address changes, the couple said they never received the standard letter notifying them that the woman's brother had been able to progress in his visa process. They assumed the wait was a product of notorious immigration backlogs. It wasn\u2019t until the situation in Myanmar intensified again in recent years that the couple found out that the brother was close to finally being able to immigrate. But by then, the woman said, her brother\u2019s kids had aged out of the system.",
      "According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, those who turn 21 before being approved for legal permanent resident status are no longer considered a child for immigration purposes and need to file an entirely new application, prolonging the green card process.",
      "At this point, the woman said, her brother and sister-in-law said they were willing to risk possible detention to come to the U.S., particularly if it meant easier access to the American immigration system that would enable them to fight to get their children to come over as well. However, with Myanmar\u2019s military draft in effect, the family is particularly concerned for their safety now that the travel ban adds another barrier to leaving.",
      "\u201cThe reason they wanted to come here was for their kids,\u201d the woman said of her brother and sister-in-law. \u201cNow, it\u2019s really hard to bring my nephews here to save their lives.\u201d",
      "Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the bans are ultimately another part of \u201cthe engine of Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s focused on demonizing immigrant families and communities by denying them family reunification, that we all rightfully deserve to be whole \u2014 especially now, when the world is more dangerous than ever,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "Rather than protecting individuals\u2019 safety, Dinh said, she believes Trump\u2019s policy punishes those who need an escape from dangerous conditions.",
      "\u201cIt perpetuates the violence that is happening across the world, as opposed to creating conditions for peace or humanitarian relief, and for these families who\u2019ve been separated,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "She also said she views the ban as evidence that the U.S. is misunderstanding its role as a humanitarian leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got people who are legitimately trying to escape a civil war,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cNow, because of some arbitrary decision by the Trump administration to pick a certain number of countries \u2026 without consideration of the actual cases, without an exception policy, it hurts them. They\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d"

    "summary": "An aid organization that has sent more than 100 Haitian children with serious cardiac conditions to the U.S. for heart surgery said President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban will stall or cancel lifesaving procedures.",
    "story": [
      "Leaders of an aid organization that has sent more than 100 Haitian children with serious cardiac conditions to the U.S. for heart surgery said President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from 19 countries will stall or cancel lifesaving procedures for at least a dozen children or young adults.",
      "The ban, which goes into effect Monday, has led to widespread uncertainty for many and drawn condemnation from international leaders. The proclamation issued Tuesday offered exceptions for those who are lawful permanent U.S. residents and those traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup and the Olympics, among other examples. No such mention was made for cases of medical necessity, such as those who are seeking treatment in the U.S. through the International Cardiac Alliance.",
      "The International Cardiac Alliance\u2019s total waitlist for Haitians, ranging from infants to young adults, totals at least 316 people who need heart surgery, said Executive Director Owen Robinson. Some are placed in hospitals in the Dominican Republic and occasionally the Cayman Islands. But there are currently five open surgical slots in the U.S.",
      "\u201cSome of them might be able to wait a few months, and others, if they don\u2019t go now, they\u2019re going to pass away very quickly,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "The president\u2019s executive order adds that the secretary of state can issue exemptions for visas in cases that \u201cserve a United States national interest.\u201d It is unclear if clients of the International Cardiac Alliance with medical needs would fit into that description. Neither the White House nor the State Department responded to a request for comment on the matter.",
      "\u201cWe do have kids die every week waiting because there\u2019s not a lot of international slots for these kids,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "Some of the children in the program travel directly from their home country to the U.S., undergo surgery, and then return to Haiti. But for many Haitians, international travel requires multiple levels of logistical wrangling, Robinson said. Some patients and their parents who can secure surgeries in other countries must apply for a visa to the U.S., travel here, and then head to their eventual destination. The United States\u2019 travel ban now throws a wrench in that process.",
      "Fabienne Rene, 16, was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in February. Because of her condition, Fabienne, who lives in Port-au-Prince, cannot even attend school since she experiences shortness of breath, said her father, Fignole Rene. The \u201cbad news\u201d he received about the travel ban causing the postponement or potential cancellation of his daughter\u2019s travel through the U.S. to the Dominican Republic is \u201creally disturbing and breaking my heart,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI was not waiting to hear something like that,\u201d Rene, 53, said in Creole through a translator. \u201cWe know for sure that there is nowhere in Haiti we can have this possibility. The only option that we have was just waiting to have an open door from the Cardiac Alliance.\u201d",
      "He also said the news will be troubling for his family to hear and that they don\u2019t know \u201cwhere they will find another open door that can give her a chance.\u201d",
      "Robinson said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti recently informed him that it most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to issue any visas due to the travel ban. In the past, the embassy has repeatedly issued visas for Haitian children to travel to the U.S. for care. The office of Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has offered to reach out to the State Department to see if the children can receive exceptions, he added.",
      "Dr. John Clark, a pediatric cardiologist at Akron Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio who has worked with the ICA, said many children in impoverished countries like Haiti suffer from Fabienne\u2019s condition because they are not seen by a doctor and treated for the common illness strep throat. Untreated, recurring strep infections can lead to rheumatic heart disease.",
      "St. Damien Pediatric Hospital in Port-au-Prince received visiting pediatric surgical teams from 2015 to 2019, Robinson said. Now, dangerous conditions in Haiti prevent doctors from other countries from entering or providing care. Meanwhile, Haiti does not have enough doctors practicing there, and the loss of opportunities for a medical education in Haiti only perpetuates the problem, Clark said.",
      "Clark participated in a surgical mission there in 2019, when visiting U.S. doctors were performing two heart surgeries per day, he said. A drastic rise in gang violence \u2014 including an attack on one of the hospital\u2019s ambulances and a worker being stoned to death \u2014 ended most medical missions to Haiti.",
      "Gang violence has only escalated since then, United Nations figures show, particularly after the assassination of Haiti\u2019s President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world, and more than half of Haitians live below the poverty line. The country is also plagued with government corruption, gang violence and food insecurity, as well as vulnerability to natural disasters, including a devastating 2010 earthquake that killed at least 220,000 people. Lack of adequate health care also fuels diseases like cholera, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\u201cI hope things can calm down one day enough that we can get back there [to Haiti],\u201d Clark said. \u201cBut right now, there\u2019s no way for us to go back down.\u201d",
      "Andrice Boncoeur of Port-au-Prince received free open-heart surgery at CEDIMAT Cardiovascular Center in the Dominican Republic to repair a valve when he was 9 years old. That procedure, however, was only meant to be a temporary solution. Now, plans for Andrice, 16, to travel through the U.S. for more permanent surgery have been disrupted.",
      "On Thursday, Andrice\u2019s father, Andre Boncoeur, said he had not yet told his son about the travel ban preventing him from passing through the U.S. Boncoeur said he knows \u201csomething can change at any time.\u201d",
      "Still, children like Andrice do not have much time to wait. In April, Andrice was once again hospitalized for three days at Haiti\u2019s Centre Hospitalier Eben-Ezer for heart failure. Boncoeur said his family has spent \u201ceverything that we had\u201d and that their funds are \u201calmost gone.\u201d He said he hopes the situation will change so that his son, who aspires to become a pastor, \u201ccan have a chance to live his life as a normal kid.\u201d",
      "Clark, Robinson and the patient\u2019s parents all agree it comes down to the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to accommodate the sick children.",
      "\u201cThese children are somebody\u2019s child and somebody\u2019s grandchild  and they don\u2019t have access to lifesaving care,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIs there any room for compassion?\u201d"

      "Views of the U.S. and confidence in its leader to handle world affairs have taken a dive in more than a dozen countries over the last year, according to a poll from the Pew Research Center released Wednesday and conducted over the first few months of President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "These declines are most pronounced among residents in neighboring Mexico and Canada, which have been at the center of high-profile spats with the administration, as well as a handful of NATO countries (like Sweden, Poland and the Netherlands) amid it Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "Public sentiment about the U.S. has gone up in a few countries over the last year, most notably in Israel. But most of the two-dozen countries surveyed saw public opinion about the U.S. dip as Trump began his second term.",
      "Overall, the poll shows an international community full of increased skepticism of Trump and his \"America First\" foreign policies, from his administration's antagonistic relationship with traditional close allies to its focus on tariffs to its friendly posture toward right-wing, populist movements that have been amassing more power in Europe.",
      "Yet while the results in many countries are negative, Trump's marks are broadly higher this year in these nations than they were during the beginning of his first term eight years ago.",
      "Fifteen countries have seen significant drops in their opinion of America over the last year. In Mexico, 61% of respondents had a favorable opinion of the U.S. in 2024, but just 29% feel that way this year.",
      "In Sweden, which joined NATO in 2024 following the Russian invasion of Ukraine two years prior, a 47% favorable rating of the U.S. last year plummeted to just 19% this year, with 79% of Swedish respondents viewing America unfavorably.",
      "And in Canada, a 54% favorability mark in 2024 dropped 20 points in 2025, to 34%, amid Trump's repeated threats to make the country America's newest state.",
      "On the other end of the spectrum, the share of people in Turkey, Nigeria and Israel who rated the U.S. favorably increased significantly over the last year.",
      "Pew polled 28,333 adults across 24 countries mostly over the phone or in person (Australia was the only country where people were polled online). The survey was in the field for various times across different countries between Jan. 8 and April 26. Polling in every country except Indonesia began after Trump\u2019s inauguration, but was either concluded or close to done by Trump\u2019s April 2 announcement of sweeping international tariffs.",
      "When it comes to Trump specifically, a majority of respondents in five countries of the 24 surveyed said they have a lot or some confidence in the president to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs: Hungary, India, Israel, Nigeria and Kenya. Majorities in nine of the 10 European countries tested have either not too much or no confidence in Trump at all, with at least three-quarters of respondents saying so in the Netherlands, France, Spain, Germany and Sweden.",
      "Men, younger people and those who view their country's right-wing populist parties favorably are more likely to have more confidence in Trump.",
      "For example, 51% of Japanese people between the ages of 18 and 34 have confidence in Trump, according to the poll, while 31% of Japanese people 50 years or older say the same.",
      "In the United Kingdom, 45% of men say they have confidence in Trump, compared with 28% of women.",
      "Respondents across 13 nations registered a double-digit decline in confidence in the U.S. president on world affairs between 2024 and 2025. While 63% in both Sweden and Germany had confidence in then-President Joe Biden last year, just 15% and 18%, respectively, said they have confidence in Trump.",
      "The survey also tested how well respondents felt several different personal characteristics described Trump. At least 60% of adults across 21 of the 24 countries surveyed said the word \"arrogant\" described Trump well.",
      "Majorities in 20 countries said he's \"a strong leader,\" while majorities in 21 countries called him \"dangerous.\"",
      "Majorities in three countries (Nigeria, India and Kenya) said Trump was \"honest,\" and majorities in five countries (Greece, Japan, Indonesia, Hungary and Kenya) called him \"diplomatic.\"",
      "Compared with his first term, the share of people across most of the surveyed countries who see Trump as a strong leader and qualified has increased. There has also been a dramatic increase in the share of adults who believe America's president is \"dangerous\" in countries where Pew also tested Biden\u2019s first year in office.",
      "On confidence in Trump to tackle global economic problems, Trump is underwater in every European country surveyed, though Hungarians are effectively split. The survey was mostly conducted before Trump announced global tariffs on April 2.",
      "In Mexico, where the survey was conducted following weeks of changing tariff policies on the country, 83% lack confidence in Trump\u2019s economic policies. In Canada, which has faced similar targeting from Trump, 74% lack confidence, and 57% said they have no confidence at all.",
      "Majorities in three countries \u2014 Kenya (56%) and Nigeria and Israel (62% each) \u2014 have confidence in Trump to handle \"the conflict between Israel and its neighbors.\" His numbers among the countries tested are the lowest in Turkey, where 7% are confident in his handling of the issue.",
      "Though a majority of Israelis expressed confidence in Trump\u2019s ability to handle the ongoing war, the poll found that confidence in Trump among right-wing Israelis is nearly four times higher, at 83%, compared with the 21% of left-wing Israelis who have confidence in Trump on the issue. Adults in most other countries said they were not confident in Trump's ability to handle the conflict.",
      "On Trump\u2019s handling of the Russia-Ukraine war, majorities in nearly all of the European countries surveyed, with the exception of Greece and Hungary, expressed little or no confidence in Trump. (Adults in Greece were split, and a narrow majority of Hungarians had at least some confidence in Trump to handle that conflict.) In France, Germany, Spain and Sweden, about three-quarters of adults said they had little or no confidence in Trump to handle the war."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 A life-size Labubu figure has been sold in China for more than $170,000, a record for the highly sought-after toothy monster toy boosted by celebrities.",
      "The 4-foot-tall mint-green doll, whose price included a 15% commission, was traded in Beijing on Tuesday at what was billed as the world\u2019s first auction dedicated to Labubu collectibles. Event organizer Yongle Auction said the life-size doll, which is made of hard-plastic PVC, is the only one of its kind.",
      "The auction sold all 48 lots for total sales of 3.73 million yuan, or about $520,000, with nearly 1,000 collectors making bids either in person or online, Yongle said in a statement Wednesday. The event came amid a global frenzy over Labubu, which is sold in \u201cblind boxes\u201d by Chinese toy company Pop Mart.",
      "The \u201cintense\u201d bidding showed the \u201cgrowing momentum of pop art in the auction market,\u201d Yongle said, adding that it will start holding Labubu auctions \u201cregularly.\u201d",
      "The Labubu item that received the second-highest bid was another life-size figure that sold for more than $130,000 and measured 5 feet tall. Coming in third was a set from a series called \u201cThree Wise Labubu\u201d \u2014 one doll crossing its arms, one making a peekaboo gesture and one covering its mouth \u2014 that sold for more than $80,000, including commission.",
      "The success of Labubu at auction reflects the \u201cgrowing presence\u201d of art toys in the market and the progress of Hong Kong and mainland China in setting trends in contemporary culture, said Felix Kwok, a registered auctioneer of China and the founder of Art and Culture Exchange.",
      "\u201cIn a somewhat stagnant art auction market, this development is both stimulating and indicative,\u201d he told NBC News via a messaging app.",
      "Created in 2015 by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung, Labubu is one of \u201cThe Monsters\u201d in his children\u2019s book series inspired by Nordic mythology. With high, pointed ears and serrated teeth, the small monster is \u201ckind-hearted and always wants to help, but often accidentally achieves the opposite,\u201d according to Pop Market.",
      "Labubu dolls are often sold in \u201cblind boxes,\u201d sealed packages whose contents are revealed only upon opening. In the U.S. store,  one blind box from a recent collection retails for $27.99, while a set of six costs $167.94, though prices can more than double on resale sites such as eBay.",
      "The dolls have also been popularized by celebrities such as Rihanna and Lisa from the South Korean girl group Blackpink, both of whom have been spotted sporting Labubu charms on their handbags.",
      "Despite the global trade disruptions caused by U.S. tariffs, fans have continued to line up at Pop Market shops across the world to buy Labubu dolls. Last month, the Chinese retailer even paused Labubu sales in all 16 shops in the U.K. to avoid safety issues following reports of disorderly lines and fights.",
      "In the first three months of this year, Pop Market\u2019s overseas revenue rose almost 480% overall compared with a year earlier, and nearly 900% in the Americas, according to its quarterly report.",
      "As Labubu\u2019s popularity soars globally, Wang Ning, the founder of Pop Market, became $8 billion richer between 2024 and 2025, a fivefold increase in his wealth, according to Forbes."

    "story": [
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina \u2014 Argentina\u2019s highest court upheld a six-year prison sentence for former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in a ruling Tuesday that permanently banned her from public office over the corruption conviction that found she had directed state contracts to a friend while she was the first lady and president.",
      "The explosive Supreme Court ruling left Fern\u00e1ndez, Argentina\u2019s charismatic yet deeply divisive ex-leader, subject to arrest and sent her supporters pouring into the streets of Buenos Aires, Argentina\u2019s capital, and blocking major highways in protest.",
      "The court asked Argentina\u2019s security ministry to set up a detention center to hold 72-year-old Fern\u00e1ndez. Her defense lawyer Carlos Beraldi told C5N, a television station in Buenos Aires, that he had requested Fern\u00e1ndez be allowed to serve her sentence in house arrest given her age.",
      "The ruling bars Fern\u00e1ndez from running in this fall\u2019s Buenos Aires legislative elections just days after she launched her campaign.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez \u2014 who dominated Argentine politics for two decades and forged the country\u2019s main left-wing populist movement known as Kirchnerism, after her and her husband, former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner \u2014 rejects the charges as politically motivated.",
      "During Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s eight years in office (2007\u20132015), Argentina expanded cash payments to the poor and pioneered major social assistance programs. But her governments funded the unbridled state spending by printing money, bringing Argentina notoriety for massive budget deficits and sky-high inflation.",
      "Critics blamed Argentina\u2019s years of economic volatility on Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s policies, and outrage over successive economic crises and the country\u2019s bloated bureaucracy helped vault radical libertarian President Javier Milei to the presidency in late 2023.",
      "The ruling dealt a severe blow to Milei\u2019s opposition during a crucial midterm election year. He celebrated the ruling, writing on social media: \u201cJustice. Period.\u201d",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez was embroiled in multiple corruption scandals during her tenure. She was convicted in 2022 in this corruption case, which centered on 51 public contracts for public works awarded to companies linked to L\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a convicted construction magnate and friend of the presidential couple, at prices 20% above the standard rate in a scheme that cost the state tens of millions of dollars.",
