      "Critics expecting an underwhelming, designer-less show were swiftly proven wrong. Chanel\u2019s studio punched above its weight, delivering a collection of striking hues and diverse designs showcasing its couture ateliers\u2019 unrivaled artistry.",
      "For a designer famous for revolutionizing fashion with the use of black, this collection went against the grain. Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel\u2019s lesser-known talent as a colorist took center stage, with joyful pastels, bold tones, midnight blue, and classic black following a complete cycle from day to night \u2014 something like a \u201cgreatest hits\u201d collection on the eve of the reboot.",
      "The runway pieces struck a balance between whimsy and drama. Beyond the house's bread-and-butter tweed skirt suits, leg-of-mutton sleeves brought historical grandeur, evoking a sense of Victorian elegance. Sequins and paillettes shimmered under the bring Grand Palais light. Silk trains in bold red injected a sense of drama. Playful neckties hinted at a 1970s influence.",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum, which he said will be renovated and expanded in a major overhaul within the next ten years",
      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron announced Tuesday that the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum under a major renovation and expansion of the Paris landmark that will take up to 10 years.",
      "The renovation project, branded \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d will include a new entrance near the River Seine, to be opened by 2031, and the creation of underground rooms, Macron said in a speech from the Louvre room where Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece is displayed.",
      "Macron did not disclose an exact amount budgeted for the project to modernize the most visited museum in the world, plagued with overcrowding and outdated facilities. But it is estimated to reach up to 800 million euros ($834 million).",
      "The Louvre's latest overhaul dates back to the 1980s, when the iconic glass pyramid was unveiled. Now, the museum is not up to international standards anymore.",
      "A look at what's at stake:",
      "Macron said the expansion of the museum will allow the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d to be moved to a new, dedicated room accessible to visitors through a special ticket. That will make the visit simpler for those who want to see the painting and ease the life of other visitors in the rest of the museum, he said.",
      "The \u201cMona Lisa\u201d is now being shown behind protective glass in the museum\u2019s largest room, overcrowded with long, noisy queues of visitors eager to take a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s masterpiece. That makes some other paintings in the room by the greatest Venetian painters like Titian and Veronese go unnoticed by many.",
      "The museum\u2019s latest big renovation in the 1980s was designed to receive 4 million annual visitors.",
      "Last year, the Louvre received 8.7 million visitors, over three-quarters being foreigners mostly from the United States, China and neighboring countries Italy, the UK, Germany and Spain.",
      "Macron said a new entrance for the Louvre will be created near the River Seine by 2031, to be financed by ticket sales, patronage and licensing money from the museum's Abu Dhabi branch.",
      "A design competition is to be staged in the coming months, he said. In addition, some new underground rooms will be created to expand the museum.",
      "A French top official said the cost of the renovation is estimated at 700 to 800 million euros ($730 to 834 million) over the next ten years, including half for the creation of the new entrance. The official could not be named in line with the French presidency\u2019s customary practices.",
      "Macron said ticket prices will be raised for foreign visitors from outside the European Union, up from 22 euros ($23) now. He promised the museum will be safer and more comfortable for both the public and the staff.",
      "Half the Louvre's budget is currently being financed by the French state, including the wages of the 2,200 employees.",
      "The other half is provided by private funds including ticket sales, earnings from restaurants, shops and bookings for special events, as well as patrons and other partners.",
      "The renovation announcement comes after Louvre Director Laurence des Cars expressed her concerns in a note to Culture Minister Rachida Dati earlier this month saying the museum is threatened by \u201cobsolescence.\u201d",
      "According to the document first released by French newspaper Le Parisien, she warned about the gradual degradation of the building due to water leaks, temperature variations and other issues \u201cendangering the preservation of artworks.\u201d",
      "The pyramid that serves at the museum\u2019s entrance, unveiled in 1989 as part of late President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s project, now appears outdated. The place is not properly insulated from the cold and the heat and tends to amplify noise, making the space uncomfortable for both the public and the staff, des Cars stressed.",
      "In addition, the museum suffers from a lack of food offerings and restroom facilities, she said."

      "The Grammys will look a little bit different this year",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Grammy Awards will look a little bit different this week.",
      "Each year, the Recording Academy hosts a multitude of events to welcome the music industry during Grammy week and record labels do the same. However, many institutions have canceled their plans \u2014 Universal Music Group, Sony, Spotify, BMG and Warner Music Group among them \u2014 and instead are allocating resources to help those affected by the devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires.",
      "The Grammys will still take place on Sunday at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles but now will focus its attention on helping wildfire victims.",
      "Within days of fires ravaging the Pacific Palisades and Altadena neighborhoods, the Recording Academy and its affiliated MusiCares charity launched the Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort with a $1 million dollar donation. According to a letter sent to members on Jan. 13, thanks to additional contributions, they\u2019ve already distributed $2 million in emergency aid.",
      "Once the fund was set up, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason jr. said they began focusing on reformatting what Grammy week would look like \u2014 many conversations conducted \u201con the road, mobile-y, virtually\u201d as staffers had evacuated their homes.",
      "\u201cThat process has really consisted of reaching out to just listen and learn from a lot of people \u2014 state officials, local officials, the governor\u2019s office, the mayor\u2019s office, the fire department. We talked to hotel managers, just really trying to get a grasp on what was happening currently. What did they project was going to happen in the next week to 10 days? Would be safe to have a show?\"",
      "Ultimately, the Recording Academy decided to condense its pre-Grammy week plans to just four events, each featuring a fundraising element.",
      "On Friday, MusiCares, an organization that helps music professionals who need financial, personal or medical assistance, will hold its annual Persons of the Year benefit gala\u2009celebrating the Grateful Dead.",
      "On Saturday, the Special Merit Awards Ceremony and Grammy nominees' reception will still take place, followed by Clive Davis' pre-Grammy fundraising event.",
      "Then the Grammys take the stage on Sunday.",
      "Events like the annual pre-Grammy Black Music Collective event, Grammy advocacy brunch, and others scheduled to take place at the immersive pop-up Grammy house have been canceled.",
      "\u201cWe thought consolidating the events would allow us to have more impact,\u201d Mason explains. \u201cAnd we just don\u2019t feel it was the right time to have social gatherings or places to party or schmooze and just hang out. We wanted to have our events be places that could be purposeful and impactful. Some of the party settings, we decided to fold down into our fundraising efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cObviously, we can\u2019t have a normal show in the midst of people\u2019s belongings being burned or loss of life or other things like that. At the same time, canceling would not have helped,\u201d Mason says.",
      "\u201cWe needed to raise money. We needed to show unity and come together around music. We need to support the city of L.A. (Over) 6,500 people work on our shows and ancillary gatherings. So, once we decided to move forward, it was really a conversation with (Grammy producers) Ben Winston, Raj Kapoor and Jesse Collins and myself. And we started to think about, \u2018How do we make the show have the greatest impact?\u2019\u201d",
      "They decided the path forward was to still give out awards and host performances to give viewers and attendees a bespoke concert experience. But most importantly, the show could raise awareness, drive donations and resources to funds that benefit people in need.",
      "And the conversations are ongoing. \u201cWe have some great things in the show that will definitely help to raise funds,\" he assures. \"It will honor some of the heroes that have been protecting our lives and our homes. It will hopefully shine a light on some people that need more help and more services.\u201d",
      "Don't expect a traditional telethon, but he says the show will feature announcements and activations in the arena.",
      "\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll be talking about things that have been pledged from the sponsors or from the community,\u201d he adds.",
      "\u201cWe know right off the bat that we\u2019ve got almost 3,000 requests for help from our members or people in the music community,\u201d Mason says. \u201cSo that was just in the first few days.\u201d",
      "The immediate needs have been \u201cthe basics,\u201d as he explains. \u201cFood, water, shelter, the bare necessities to live.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe next phase will involve, you know, where they\u2019re going to live, how are they going to replace maybe damaged or destroyed instruments, studios. How will they make a living? I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some mental health component that people may need assistance with. But it\u2019s really across the board. But the early, immediate relief is around just the bare necessities.\u201d",
      "There's no shortage of natural disasters, and they affect the music community too. Mason brings up the COVID-19 pandemic as a recent example. With MusiCares, they were able to contribute \u201cover $40 million to people who needed help.\u201d They have the infrastructure to provide assistance quickly.",
      "However, he notes, the Grammys are the first major award show taking place after the wildfires, which means \u201cthere's no playbook for this.\"",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019ve always said it all changes if the fires were to continue, or possibly got worse, or the winds changed. So, I always want to reserve that right. We\u2019re not going to go blindly forward if things are unsafe or if it feels inappropriate,\" he says.",
      "But consider the fundraising, the economic and financial impacts, and the possibility of unity, \u201cIt all makes sense for us to move forward.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- A New York judge set a March 2026 trial date on Monday and moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week as the public feud between Blake Lively and her \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d costar and director Justin Baldoni continued to grow and accelerate.",
      "And in a new and separate front in the series of legal battles surrounding the film that became a surprise hit last summer, Lively in a Texas court filed a request for a deposition of a man she says was central to turning online sentiment against her during its release and promotion.",
      "The New York federal judge, Lewis J. Liman, told both sides in an order late Monday to prepare for a March 9, 2026, trial.",
      "He also moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week and told lawyers to be prepared to address complaints about pretrial publicity and attorney conduct.",
      "Liman took the actions after Lively\u2019s lawyers claimed in a filing on Monday that an attorney for Baldoni was trying to taint potential jurors over lawsuits the actors have filed against each other.",
      "The lawyers said Baldoni\u2019s attorney was trying to wreck Lively\u2019s career and turn potential New York jurors against her by creating a website to release selected documents and communications between Lively and Baldoni.",
      "The lawyers said attorney Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni, was \u201cengaging in this extrajudicial campaign to influence these proceedings and the public perception of legal filings to this Court, and there already is a serious risk that his misconduct is tainting the jury pool.\u201d",
      "They added: \u201cThe endless stream of defamatory and extrajudicial media statements must end.\u201d",
      "Freedman said in a statement in response to Monday's assertions that the \u201cirony is not lost on anyone that Ms. Lively is so petrified of the truth that she has moved to gag it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will always respect the court; however, we will never be bullied by those suggesting we cannot defend our clients with pure, unedited facts,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cAll we want is for people to see the actual text messages that directly contradict her allegations, video footage that clearly shows there was no sexual harassment and all the other powerful evidence that directly contradicts any false allegations.\u201d",
      "In a letter to the judge on Thursday, Baldoni attorney Kevin Fritz accused Lively of a publicity campaign that left Baldoni and other defendants the \u201cobjects of public scorn and contempt.\u201d",
      "He said the actions had damaged those she sued so that they were \u201cexiled from polite society and suffered damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars due to Ms. Lively\u2019s scorched-earth media campaign.\u201d",
      "In the separate filing in Hays County, Texas, a precursor to another potential lawsuit, Lively asks for an order for a deposition from Jed Wallace, a crisis management specialist she alleges was behind much of the social media manipulation surrounding the film that turned public sentiment against her through posts on Reddit and TikTok.",
      "Wallace and his Texas-based firm Street Relations were brought on as subcontractors by publicists working with Baldoni and his production company, the filing said.",
      "\u201cHe weaponized a digital army around the country, including in New York and Los Angeles, to create, seed, manipulate, and advance disparaging content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums,\u201d the filing alleges.",
      "Wallace is identified in Lively's federal lawsuit, but he is not a defendant.",
      "Freedman, who the filing says is Wallace's lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment on the issue.",
      "Lively sued Baldoni, his production company and others in New York in late December for sexual harassment and attacks on her reputation and asked for unspecified damages. Baldoni sued earlier this month, accusing Lively and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d actor Ryan Reynolds, of defamation and extortion and seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "The judge said Monday that he'll likely combine the lawsuits for trial.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel that begins as a romance but takes a dark turn into domestic violence, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie\u2019s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",

      "Taylor Swift is likely headed to her second straight Super Bowl",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- You could say that Taylor Swift's championship era is in its second consecutive season.",
      "The 14-time Grammy Award-winning superstar returned to Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday and watched her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and the rest of the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Buffalo Bills 32-29 for a spot in their third consecutive Super Bowl.",
      "Swift walked down the tunnel to her usual suite about 90 minutes before kickoff. And while she was decked out in Chanel for the divisional round against Houston, she opted for a sleek black-and-gold Louis Vuitton look for the AFC title game, including a jacquard knit jacket that retails for $5,000 and a stocking cap with a list price of $830.",
      "Modest fare compared to what suite prices for the Super Bowl will probably run.",
      "Swift will almost certainly be in New Orleans with her celebrity friends when the Chiefs go for an unprecedented third straight Lombardi Trophy against the Philadelphia Eagles on Feb. 9. They got a big game from Patrick Mahomes \u2014 no surprise there \u2014 and some key stops from their defense to get past the Bills.",
      "Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. And their relationship only seemed to blossom into the new year, with Swift eventually celebrating on the field with Kelce after the Chiefs had beaten the Ravens in Baltimore for the AFC championship.",
      "Then came the Super Bowl, and Swift's much-watched dash from a concert in Tokyo for kickoff of the big game in Las Vegas.",
      "She made it with plenty of time to spare, of course. And Swift became the focus of attention in her own right, winning what appeared to be a beer-chugging contest, partying with celebrity suite mates such as Blake Lively, Ice Spice and Lana Del Rey, and standing next to Kelce's mother, Donna, while he held aloft the Lombardi Trophy following the 25-22 win over the 49ers.",
      "The couple eventually locked lips again on the field at Allegiant Stadium.",
      "As confetti flew on the field, they kissed again in celebration at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday night. Swift gave Chiefs coach Andy Reid a big hug, and she celebrated with Donna Kelce and the rest of some 80,000 fans.",

      "But critics lambasted it and audiences didn\u2019t grade it much better.",
      "NEW YORK -- Critics lambasted it and audiences didn\u2019t grade it much better. But despite the turbulence, Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cFlight Risk\u201d managed to open No. 1 at the box office with a modest $12 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "On a quiet weekend, even for the typically frigid movie-going month of January, the top spot went to the Lionsgate thriller starring Mark Wahlberg as a pilot flying an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) and fugitive (Topher Grace) across Alaska. But it wasn\u2019t a particularly triumphant result for Gibson\u2019s directorial follow-up to 2016\u2019s \u201cHacksaw Ridge.\u201d Reviews (21% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a \u201cC\u201d CinemaScore) were terrible.",
      "President Donald Trump recently named Gibson a \u201cspecial ambassador\u201d to Hollywood, along with Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone.",
      "Going into the weekend, Hollywood\u2019s attention was more focused on the Sundance Film Festival and on Thursday\u2019s Oscar nominations, which were twice postponed by the wildfires in the Los Angeles region.",
      "The weekend was also a small test as to whether the once more common Oscar \u201cbump\u201d that can sometimes follow nominations still exists. Most contenders have by now completed the bulk of their theatrical runs and are more likely to see an uptick on VOD or streaming.",
      "But the weekend\u2019s most daring gambit was A24 pushing Brady Corbet\u2019s \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d a three\u2013and-a-half-hour epic nominated for 10 Academy Awards, into wide release. Though some executives initially greeted \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which is running with an intermission, as \u201cun-distributable,\u201d Corbet has said, A24 acquired the film out of the Venice Film Festival and it\u2019s managed solid business, collecting $6 million in limited release.",
      "In wide release, it earned $2.9 million \u2014 a far from blockbuster sum but the best weekend yet for \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "The audience was downright miniscule for another best-picture nominee: RaMell Ross\u2019 \u201cNickel Boys.\u201d Innovatively shot almost entirely in first-person POV, the Amazon MGM Studios release gathered just $340,171 in 540 locations after expanding by 300 theaters.",
      "Coming off one of the lowest Martin Luther King Jr. weekends in years, no new releases made a major impact.",
      "Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cPresence,\u201d a well-reviewed horror film shot from the perspective of a ghost inside a suburban home, debuted with $3.4 million in 1,750 locations. The film, released by Neon and acquired out of last year\u2019s Sundance, was made for just $2 million.",
      "The top spots otherwise went to holdovers. The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d in its sixth weekend of release, scored $8.7 million to hold second place. After starting slow, the Barry Jenkins-directed film has amassed $626.7 million globally.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d the Keke Palmer and SZA led comedy from Sony Pictures, held well in its second weekend, dropping just 32% with $8 million in ticket sales. In recent years, few comedies have found success on the big screen, but \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d has proven an exception.",
      "Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.",
      "1. \u201cFlight Risk,\u201d $12 million.",

      "Hermes illuminated a gloomy Paris afternoon with its fall 2025 men\u2019s collection, as Veronique Nichanian turned to the racetrack for inspiration",
      "PARIS -- Hermes illuminated a gloomy Paris afternoon with its fall men\u2019s collection Saturday, as Veronique Nichanian turned to the racetrack for inspiration. Jockeys\u2019 vibrant racing silks became her muse, a dynamic counterpoint to the French maison\u2019s storied equestrian roots. \u201cI wanted this collection to be strong and energetic,\u201d Nichanian explained, her palette pivoting from deep browns and dark teals to flashes of tomato red and lemon yellow.",
      "The collection radiated warmth, both in spirit and texture. Fuzzy mohair coats, velvet varsity jackets and plush sheepskin outerwear wrapped models in an embrace that seemed designed to counter winter\u2019s chill. Layering was less pronounced this season, a deliberate move to retain sleek, streamlined silhouettes. Even gray pinstripe suits \u2014 pared back to essentials \u2014 eschewed bulk, echoing Nichanian\u2019s vision of men unencumbered as they race through life.",
      "Sweaters emerged as the collection\u2019s unsung heroes. Their bold chevrons and geometric patterns were lifted directly from the vibrant stripes of racing silks, a playful nod to Palais d\u2019I\u00e9na\u2019s soaring, angular architecture. A standout turtleneck, with its patchwork of triangles, rectangles, and squares in canary yellow, seemed to channel a nostalgic love for trigonometry. Elsewhere, a jacket with a shawl collar mirrored the same graphical bravado, rendered in cool tones of blue, black and white.",
      "Though grounded in classic tailoring, the collection celebrated irreverence. Nichanian\u2019s juxtaposition of tradition and innovation captured Herm\u00e8s\u2019 ethos with a quiet confidence. Here, functionality was imbued with a touch of whimsy, proving once again that the maison\u2019s refinement can still surprise and delight. In a season steeped in nostalgia and geometry, Herm\u00e8s delivered a collection that was, quite literally, off to the races."

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Rose Byrne plays a mother in the midst of a breakdown in the experiential psychological thriller \u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You.\u201d",
      "Anticipation was high for the A24 film, which will be released sometime this year. Its premiere Friday at the Sundance Film Festival was easily the hottest ticket in town, with even ticketholders unable to get in. Those who did make it into the Library theater were treated to an intense, visceral, inventive story from filmmaker Mary Bronstein that has quickly become one of the festival\u2019s must-sees.",
      "Byrne plays Linda, who is barely hanging on while managing her daughter\u2019s mysterious illness. She\u2019s faced with crisis after crisis, big and small \u2014 from the massive, gaping hole in their apartment ceiling that forces them to move to a dingy motel, to an escalating showdown with a parking attendant at a care center. The cracks in her psychological, emotional and physical wellbeing are become too much to bear.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never seen a movie before where a mother is going through a crisis with a child but our energy is not with the child\u2019s struggle, it\u2019s with the mother\u2019s,\u201d Bronstein said at the premiere. \u201cIf you\u2019re a caretaker, you shouldn\u2019t be bothering with yourself at all. It should all be about the person you\u2019re taking care of, right? And that is a particular kind of emotional burnout state that I was really interested in exploring.\u201d",
      "Byrne and Bronstein went deep in the preparation phase, having long discussions about Linda with the goal of making her as real as possible before the quick, 27-day shoot. Byrne said she was obsessed with figuring out who Linda was before the crisis. The film was in part inspired by Bronstein\u2019s experience with her own daughter, but she didn\u2019t want to elaborate on the specifics.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s her story to tell,\u201d Bronstein said.",
      "Part of Linda\u2019s story involves her therapist, played by Conan O\u2019Brien, who joked that he didn\u2019t realize he was in a movie.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not looking out for movie scripts or anything. But when I got a call from A24 that they wanted me to read something, I\u2019m not stupid,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI showed it to my wife, who is one of the smartest people I know, and she read through it and she said, \u2018I didn\u2019t know they made movies like this anymore.\u2019\u201d",
      "He was particularly in awe of his director and co-star, saying he felt like a fraud standing beside them.",
      "\u201cIt was an amazing experience, one of the best experiences of my life, just to be with them and watch them work,\u201d O'Brien said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how (Byrne) did that and not check into a hospital afterwards, because I haven\u2019t seen any actor, man or woman, sustain that level for an entire movie.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like I have to go to a hospital now, because this was the first time I watched it,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m a mess.\u201d",
      "A$AP Rocky also co-stars, as a man Linda meets at the motel, but was not in Park City for the premiere. He is currently on trial, charged with firing a gun at a former friend.",
      "The film is full of ambiguity, metaphor and just plain artistic expression that Bronstein hesitated to explain, from the name itself to the hole in the ceiling, which takes on a somewhat supernatural quality.",
      "\u201cWhen we have nothing left to give, we have an emptiness inside of us,\u201d Bronstein said. \u201cAnd that emptiness is actually not empty: It\u2019s filled with all the darkness and self-hate and doubt and fear and dread and regret and everything. \u2026 That to me is what the hole is.\u201d",
      "Some of it, she said, she doesn\u2019t even fully understand. The point is the experience, and critics and Sundance audiences are already fully on board.",
      "Bronstein, a bit of a cult figure in the film world, made her directorial debut in 2008 at the SXSW festival with \u201cYeast,\u201d which featured a pre-fame Greta Gerwig and was hailed by by New Yorker critic Richard Brody as a \u201cmumblecore classic.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You\u201d is only her second feature.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time that anybody else has paid for me to make art,\u201d Bronstein said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say that this is the film that came directly from my head to the screen.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- To celebrate an upcoming milestone, Alyssa Math could think of nothing more fitting than front-row tickets to \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d author Rebecca Yarros' appearance at The Town Hall in Manhattan.",
      "\u201cI'm getting married next weekend, so this is my bachelorette party,\u201d said Math, an accountant who traveled with friends from her home near Annapolis, Maryland. She has been one of millions of admirers of Yarros' work and a year ago drove two hours to Reston, Virginia, to see the author.",
      "\u201cIt's a huge cult following,\u201d said Math, wearing a white veil in homage to one of Yarros' characters. \u201cThe drama (of her books) keeps you on the edge of your seat.\u201d",
      "Friday night at The Town Hall had the feel of a costume party, rock concert and family reunion as a capacity crowd of around 1,500 clapped, laughed and shouted, \u201cYes, Queen!\" The \u201cEmpyrean\u201d series has made Yarros one of the country's most popular and obsessed-about leaders of romantasy, a newly branded genre combinging romance and fantasy.",
      "\u201cOnyx Storm\u201d is the much-awaited third installment of a planned five centered on the lovers Violet and Xaden, and the first since the million-selling \u201cIron Flame\u201d came out in 2023. In its first week of publication, \"Onyx Storm\" has already topped the bestseller lists of Amazon and sold more than 300,000 copies just through Barnes & Noble, according to a spokesperson for the superstore chain.",
      "Yarros, interviewed for some 75 minutes by Olympic gymnast and avowed fan Laurie Hernandez, shared a few insights about her writings (she already knows how the series will end), spoke lovingly of her husband (\"He's 6'4\" and hot as hell with a baby strapped to his chest\"), swore casually and joked that hers was the \u201conly profession where you can have imaginary fiends\u201d and not be considered insane.",
      "She expressed relief and pleasure over completing \u201cOnyx Storm,\" noting she had to block out her own popularity to get the writing done.",
      "\u201cAs much as I love you guys, I kind of pretend you don\u2019t exist,\u201d she said. \u201cI kind of ignore you, but I love you at the same time.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnyx Storm\u201d isn't quite a Harry Potter-level phenomenon \u2014 the final Potter book by J.K. Rowling, \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\u201d sold more than 8 million copies in the U.S. in its first 24 hours \u2014 but it carries a similar feeling of obsession, identification and spontaneity.",
      "Like the Potter books, the release of \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d was welcomed with midnight store parties around the country, gatherings for which fans showed up in costume. Some fans at The Town Hall finished the 526-page \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d within hours of receiving it, others are in no hurry.",
      "\"This is a book I personally want to take my time with,\" said Scarlett Fuentes, who arrived with her friend Zy Bao-angan, both of them in black leather.",
      "\"I want to savor this moment,\" Bao-angan said.",
      "Like Potter, enthusiasm for the Yarros books extends well beyond any organized publicity campaigns. The Potter books helped inspire some of the first Internet fan sites for books. Yarros and such fellow romantasy authors as Sarah J. Maas have been favorites of the young readers on BookTok, a TikTok community that has emerged as publishing's most effective driver of sales. Countless fans on BookTok and other social media \u2014 some crying, some cursing in amazement \u2014 have been posting their responses to \u201cOnyx Storm.\"",
      "On Friday, Hernandez and the audience posed questions about her books as if gossiping about friends. If Violet and Xaden were at a bar, what would they order? Violet would go for a lavender lemon drop, Xaden is fine with a beer. And which music genres define them? Xenon is heavy metal, Violet harder to label.",
      "Asked what was the most important lessons she has learned from writing the books, Yarros reminded her fans that she wasn't only a writer or public figure.",
      "\u201cI can say plotting and I can say everything, but probably the most important thing I've learned is that real life is what happens in my house, and what happens around my kitchenette and what happens in my living room chairs and what happens when my kids are all together and my husband's together,\u201d she said. \u201cReal life is not what happens on the internet.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love you guys,\u201d she added. \u201cBut peace out.\u201d"

      "\u201cBlack Box Diaries,\u201d in which a Japanese filmmaker investigates her own sexual assault, had its premiere in Park City last year and was supported by the Institute\u2019s doc film program. \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d made by a Palestinian-Israeli collective, was also supported by the film fund. \u201cPorcelain War,\u201d about Ukrainian artists in wartime, debuted at the festival in 2024, where it won the grand jury prize. \u201cSoundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat,\u201d about the assassination of Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba in 1961, also launched last year and won a special jury prize. And, finally, \u201cSugarcane,\u201d a 2024 festival premiere investing abuse and missing children at an Indian residential school, was supported by a Sundance grant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really special,\u201d said Basil Tsiokos, a Sundance senior programmer. \u201cIt does speak to what Sundance brings to the artistic community and to the support that we show to artists out there.\u201d",
      "On Friday night, \u201cSugarcane\u201d filmmakers Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie are also being given an award at the Institute\u2019s fundraising gala. Newly anointed Oscar nominees James Mangold and Cynthia Erivo are also being honored.",
      "It\u2019s not lost on those who program for the festival and run the artists programs how crucial that initial support can be for someone trying to make a documentary.",
      "\u201cThe funding landscape is challenging, particularly in the nonfiction space,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cGetting early support from the artists programs, from the documentary feature programs is sort of a stamp of approval, of encouragement that helps other funders come in later on to take a seed of an idea and bring it into fruition.\u201d",
      "The Oscars and Sundance have long been connected, especially in the documentary space. For the past 25 years, there has been at least one Sundance movie every year that goes on to get an Oscar nomination. Some that have won the statuette include \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d \u201cMan on Wire,\u201d \u201cSearching for Sugar Man,\u201d \u201c20 Feet From Stardom,\u201d \u201cIcarus,\u201d \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d and \u201cNavalny.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe just provide a space for the films,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cThe films are from the artists. They\u2019re the ones with the vision to make these films possible. We provide them a platform to be able to meet their audiences. That\u2019s quite an important role that we take very seriously.\u201d",
      "This year, the festival has about 40 feature documentaries premiering across sections on everything from Marlee Matlin and Selena Quintanilla, to one about Nairobi women transforming a formerly whites-only library into a cultural hub, to another on Florida\u2019s stand-your-ground laws. While it\u2019s difficult to project what might be in the Oscar race next year, Tsiokos has observed one trend that might help audiences pick and choose.",
      "\u201cThe influence of the international voters is growing. In the last couple of years especially, most of the nominees for the Oscar race tend to be international titles,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cI would tell people to make sure to check out the World Cinema Documentary Competition. There are some real gems.\u201d",

    "summary": "Prosecutors say they won&rsquo;t charge rocker Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation into sexual assault and domestic violence allegations",
    "story": [
      "Prosecutors say they won\u2019t charge rocker Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation into sexual assault and domestic violence allegations",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Prosecutors said Friday that they will not file charges against Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation of allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the allegations are too old under the law and the evidence is not sufficient to charge the 56-year-old shock rocker whose legal name is Brian Warner.",
      "\u201cWe have determined that allegations of domestic violence fall outside of the statute of limitations, and we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Hochman said. \u201cWe recognize and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences, and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation.\u201d",
      "Nearly four years after the investigation began, then-District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said on Oct. 9 that his office was pursuing new leads that added to the \u201calready extensive\u201d file that authorities had amassed.",
      "LA County sheriff\u2019s detectives said early in 2021 that they were investigating Manson for incidents between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood, where Manson lived at the time. The probe included a search warrant that was served on his West Hollywood home. The case was initially turned over to prosecutors in September 2021, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office requested more evidence-gathering and the investigation resumed.",
      "\u201cWe are very pleased that, after a thorough and incredibly lengthy review of all of the actual evidence, the District Attorney has concluded what we knew and expressed from the start \u2014 Brian Warner is innocent,\u201d his attorney, Howard King, said in a statement.",
      "The identities of the women police and prosecutors spoke to were not revealed, but \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Esm\u00e9 Bianco \u2014 who sued Manson in a case that has been settled \u2014 said she was part of the criminal investigation. Before the decision not to prosecute, she criticized how long the process was taking at a rally for Hochman, who was elected soon after.",
      "\u201cAlmost four years ago, I did what victims of rape are supposed to do: I went to the police,\u201d she said on Oct. 10. \u201cI described to them in agonizing detail how the rock musician Brian Warner \u2014 better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson \u2014 had raped and abused me over the course of our relationship.\u201d",
      "Bianco said she gave investigators \u201chundreds of pieces of evidence, including photos of my body covered in bites, bruises and knife wounds, emails and text messages, threats to my immigration status.\u201d",
      "In her lawsuit, Bianco alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, and said that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England for non-existent roles in music videos and movies.",
      "\u201cWhilst I am deeply disappointed by the decision of the District Attorney to not bring charges in the case against Brian Warner, I am sadly not surprised,\u201d Bianco said in a statement released by her lawyer. \u201cOnce again, our justice system has failed survivors. Not the individual prosecutors and detectives who worked for years on this case, but the system that made them do so with one hand tied behind their collective backs.\u201d",
      "In 2021 Manson's former fianc\u00e9e, \u201cWestworld\u201d actor Evan Rachel Wood, named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post.",
      "Wood and Manson\u2019s relationship became public in 2007 when he was 38 and she was 19, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.",
      "\u201cHe started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,\u201d Wood said.",
      "Manson replied on Instagram that these were \u201chorrible distortions of reality.\u201d He sued Wood, saying she and another woman fabricated accusations against him and convinced others to do the same. A judge threw out significant sections of the suit, then in November, Manson agreed to drop it and pay Wood's attorney fees.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they\u2019ve been sexually abused, unless they come forward publicly as Bianco and Wood have done.",
      "Other women sued Manson in the months after Wood came forward. Wood's representative did not immedately return a message Friday.",
      "Manson emerged as a musical star in the mid-1990s, known as much for courting public controversy as for hit songs like \u201cThe Beautiful People\u201d and hit album\u2019s like 1996\u2019s \u201cAntichrist Superstar\u201d and 1998\u2019s \u201cMechanical Animals.\u201d"

      "Junya Watanabe has opened his latest menswear show at Paris Fashion Week with beige hunting jackets paired with discreet shirts and ties",
      "PARIS -- Beige hunting jackets with oversized pockets, paired with discreet shirts and ties, opened Junya Watanabe\u2019s latest menswear show at Paris Fashion Week Friday.",
      "It was a deceptively classic start for the avant-garde Japanese designer, whose signature knack for subversive tailoring and patchwork soon disrupted conventions.",
      "What looked like classic Americana \u2014 thick denim jeans, caps, and check shirts \u2014 quickly morphed into something far less predictable. Exaggerated blown-up check pants in red with dramatic turn-ups injected a sense of whimsy, as did splashes of vivid color. A pale yellow jacket and a tactile padded coat in soft pastels softened the masculinity, reworking the rugged aesthetic into something gender-fluid.",
      "Flashes of bold hues, from vibrant red to bright blue checks, became a defining motif. The palette danced across reimagined hunting jackets and distinctly masculine silhouettes, which were disrupted by the designer\u2019s famed use of patchwork. Here, it wasn\u2019t just a technique but a conceptual statement \u2014 ideas and styles stitched together, creating contradictions.",
      "Hunting jackets might evoke tradition, but here they felt fresh, even irreverent, with their clever layering of fabrics and unexpected details. The collection demonstrated Watanabe\u2019s mastery in blending the familiar with the avant-garde, offering a \u201cbro\u201d aesthetic turned on its head by bursts of feminine color.",
      "The recurring themes of denim and disruptive tailoring felt polished yet safe, lacking the urgency or political edge that defined his earlier work."

    "story": [
      "Opening statements are beginning at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is accused of firing a handgun at a former friend",
      "A$AP Rocky is the celebrity in the room, but A$AP Relli will star at his trial.",
      "The hip-hop star, fashion maven and actor, whose legal name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers, is accused of firing a gun at his former friend Relli, born Terell Ephron, on whose testimony prosecutors are pinning their case.",
      "Opening statements are set to begin Friday at the trial after a jury of seven women and five men was selected over the course of three days. Rocky is charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm.",
      "He took a major risk by turning down a prosecution plea deal offer of just six months in jail and instead choosing to go to trial. If convicted, he could be sentenced to a term of up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The defense plans to paint Ephron as a money seeker and point out he has sued Rocky in civil court, seeking financial damages for the incident.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the witness that this case will rise and fall on, for sure,\u201d Rocky\u2019s lead attorney Joe Tacopina said after a recent pretrial hearing. \u201cWhether he\u2019s a star is something that remains to be seen.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s jealousy obviously, and he\u2019s made that clear. He became a hater,\u201d Tacopina said. \u201cThis is in large part about money, money, money.\u201d",
      "Rocky and Relli were part of a group of young creators in high school in New York who called themselves A$AP \u2014 for Always Strive and Prosper \u2014 and initially remained close as Rocky found wealth and fame through music. The relationship soured, coming to a head with the alleged shooting on Nov. 6, 2021, when Ephron says Rocky fired on him and grazed his knuckles.",
      "The defense plans to call witnesses to testify that a firearm seen on a security video is a starter pistol that Rocky carried as a prop for security.",
      "They likely will say that is why, despite a search of the spot by many police officers, no shell casings were found at the site near Hollywood and Vine. Police did not recover a gun in the case.",
      "Ephron went to the police two days later and brought 9 mm shell casings he had picked up himself, which are both points the defense will seize on. No fingerprints were recovered from the casings.",
      "The trial\u2019s celebrity goes beyond Rocky. The Grammy-nominated hip-hop star\u2019s longtime partner is Rihanna and the couple have two toddler sons together.",
      "Tacopina suggested it\u2019s unlikely Rihanna will show up in court and her name may not come up at all, though it did frequently during jury selection when many prospective jurors said they were fans.",
      "Rocky has been named one of the celebrity chairs of the Met Gala in May and has a major role in a Spike Lee-directed film with Denzel Washington to be released soon after. But his life could be upended with a conviction.",
      "In the deal from prosecutors he rejected, Rocky was to plead guilty to one of the two counts in exchange for a sentence recommendation of 180 days in jail, a seven-year suspended prison sentence and three years of probation.",
      "Beyond Ephron, the prosecution's witnesses primarily will be the police who worked on the case.",
      "They also will rely heavily on surveillance video that captured parts of the incident and the circumstances. Prosecutors at the 2023 preliminary hearing showed a still image taken from video with a man in a hooded sweatshirt whose face is not visible holding what appears to be a gun, along with another image showing the face of the man in the sweatshirt, with no gun visible. A detective testified that investigators established it was Rocky.",
      "Rocky himself could take the stand and his attorney has said he wants to, but the lawyers say they have not yet decided and he is legally allowed to avoid testifying."

      "Marlee Matlin gives an unflinchingly honest account of her experiences as a deaf actor in the funny and revelatory documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Marlee Matlin gives an unflinchingly honest account of her experiences as a deaf actor in the funny and revelatory documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d The film kicked off the 41st Sundance Film Festival Thursday, as the first major premiere in the Eccles Theater in Park City, Utah.",
      "After the screening audiences in the theater, some wiping tears away, greeted Matlin with a standing ovation when she took the stage.",
      "The film delves into all aspects of her life, personal and professional: Her childhood and how her family handled learning she had become deaf at 18 months; her experience winning the best actress Oscar for her first movie role in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d and her allegedly abusive romantic relationship with her co-star, the late William Hurt, which he denied; and her experiences in an industry not equipped to accommodate deaf actors.",
      "The film was directed by Shoshanna Stern, who also is deaf. Matlin specifically requested that Stern take on the project when American Masters approached her about doing a documentary.",
      "Matlin has written about her experiences before, including her volatile relationship with Hurt and drugs, in a memoir, \u201cI\u2019ll Scream Later.\u201d But before the #MeToo movement, she felt her allegations were largely dismissed or glossed over.",
      "Interviews from the book's press tour show journalists were more interested in the \u201camazing sex\u201d she said she had with Hurt than the stories of the alleged physical and verbal abuse. One interviewer asked her why she waited \u201cso long\u201d to come forward with the claims.",
      "The documentary isn\u2019t just a portrait of Matlin, but a broader look at deaf culture and how Matlin was thrust into the spotlight at a young age as a de facto spokesperson for all deaf causes.",
      "In addition to being the first, and until Troy Kotsur won for \u201cCODA\u201d in 2022, only deaf actor to win an Academy Award, she helped lobby Congress for closed captioning and delved into the Gallaudet University protest about hiring hearing people to preside over the university, which is the subject of another Sundance documentary, \u201cDeaf President Now!\u201d",
      "Matlin also faced backlash when she spoke while presenting the best actor Oscar the year after she won, an experience that she said made her distance herself from deaf causes.",
      "It features moving interviews from her longtime translator and other important figures in her life such as Henry Winkler, who met her when she was a student at age 12.",
      "Winkler watched her perform a song during a school production after she wrote him a fan letter. Later, she stayed in his home for two years after her breakup with Hurt and had her wedding there. In the film, Matlin said she never would have pursued acting if it weren\u2019t for Winkler, although he disagreed.",
      "The film is closed captioned and includes verbal translations for hearing audiences. In a unique approach, the subjects were interviewed by Stern with an earpiece, allowing them to hear translations from another room.",
      "Matlin said she has struggled occasionally to convince the industry to let her play roles that aren\u2019t necessarily written for a deaf actor. Aaron Sorkin, who wrote a part for her in \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d dispelled the notion it is difficult to write for deaf actors.",
      "When \u201cCODA\u201d came around, the studio wanted to cast an A-list, hearing male star opposite Matlin. She threatened to walk if it weren\u2019t a deaf actor and was gratified when Kotsur won the Oscar, hence the \u201cnot alone anymore\u201d subtitle. Her big disappointment was not being able to say a few words on stage during the event.",
      "Asked why this moment was the right time for a documentary, Matlin said, \u201cIt\u2019s never really the right time. So, why not?\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Reality TV couple Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt are suing the city of Los Angeles after losing their Pacific Palisades home in the wildfires that have torn through Southern California in recent weeks.",
      "The couple, who rose to stardom on \u201cThe Hills,\" a spin-off of \u201cLaguna Beach,\u201d filed the lawsuit Tuesday along with more than 20 other property owners and residents who were affected by the Palisades Fire. The complaint blames Los Angeles and its municipal water department for the water issues that hampered firefighting efforts and says it ultimately led to the damage to their properties.",
      "The Eaton and Palisades fires, ignited by strong winds during one of the region's driest years on record, have killed 28 people and destroyed more than 12,000 structures, putting them among the most destructive fires in California history.",
      "There has been intense scrutiny over hydrants running dry and problems with water pressure, leading to a barrage of lawsuits against the city and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called for an independent investigation into the LA water utility over the issues.",
      "The complaint filed by the couple and others mentions that the Santa Ynez Reservoir, which services the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, was offline and had been out of commission since February 2024 while awaiting repairs. The hydrants in the neighborhood were connected to three tanks that held 1 million gallons (3.7 million liters) of water each and went dry within 12 hours, the complaint said, citing Janisse Qui\u00f1ones, the water utility's chief executive and chief engineer.",
      "Without water from the reservoir, firefighters had to primarily rely on the water tanks, which were not designed to fight such a large fire, the complaint said.",
      "The city and water utility did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "While the repairs to the reservoir were requested in January 2024, the water utility told the Los Angeles Times they would not be completed until April or May 2025.",
      "The lawsuit called the Palisades Fire an \u201cinescapable and unavoidable consequence\u201d of the water system operated by the city and water utility.",
      "\u201cThe system necessarily failed, and this failure was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs to suffer the losses alleged in this complaint,\u201d it said.",
      "The plaintiffs cite the principle known as \u201c inverse condemnation,\u201d which is the same mechanism that requires utilities to pay for wildfire damages caused by their equipment."

      "Opening statements at the Los Angeles trial of the 36-year-old hip-hop superstar and fashion maven will likely begin Friday after the 12 jurors were selected. Four alternates still need to be selected.",
      "Rocky turned down a prosecution plea offer of 180 days in jail to risk years in prison if the jurors find him guilty of two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm. He has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer says he committed no crime.",
      "He opted instead to risk trial on two counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, charges that with conviction bring a penalty of up to 24 years in prison.",
      "It took the two sides 2 1/2 days to pick the jurors from a pool of more than a hundred candidates who packed into a downtown LA courtroom. Those chosen include a woman who is a podcast editor and actor, and a man who has worked for more than 20 years at Trader Joe's.",
      "Many were excused for cause, others sent away by one of the two sides. Each had 10 jurors they could excuse without a reason. The defense used seven of their challenges, the prosecution just two.",
      "One man questioned Thursday works as a civilian with the Los Angeles Police Department and has extensive ties to law enforcement including a cousin who was on the case's witness list but is not expected to be called.",
      "After the judge declined to dismiss him for cause, Rocky's lawyer Joe Tacopina took him off the jury.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s a shocker, we\u2019re going to thank and excuse juror number 27.\u201d",
      "Attitudes toward police were a common topic during jury selection. In a heated moment, Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold, a former sheriff's deputy, questioned those who said they mistrusted police, nearly debating with some of them.",
      "He asked one woman, a speech pathologist, whether he should mistrust all speech pathologists based on his bad experience with one.",

      "When she brought up the Rodney King case, he asked, \u201cYou are going to hold against current police something that happened before they were born?\u201d",
      "Many questions were about the fame of both Rocky and especially Rihanna, his longtime life partner and the mother of his two toddler children. She was not in court Thursday, and it's not certain whether she will show up during the trial.",
      "\u201cWhat if Rihanna comes here to court, is it going to be hard for you to look over there, and see the defendant\u2019s family, and deliver a guilty verdict?\u201d Deputy District Attorney John Lewin asked one woman.",
      "After a long pause, she said \u201cyes.\u201d",
      "Rocky is accused of firing three or four shots at Terell Ephron, a friend from his teenage years, on the streets of Hollywood in 2021. Ephron said the shots grazed his knuckles. Rocky has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers say he wasn't even holding a real gun, but a starter pistol he used as a prop."

      "The film academy had plenty of surprise nominations Thursday for the 97th Oscars",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- In one of the more wide-open Oscar fields in recent history, there were plenty of nominations surprises Thursday.",
      "Not too long ago, it seemed that people like Angelina Jolie and Nicole Kidman were destined for best actress nominations, while general audience disinterest in the young Donald Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d might have indicated its awards chances were dead on arrival.",
      "But the members of the film academy had something different in mind. Here are some of the biggest snubs and surprises from the 97th Oscar nominations.",
      "The young Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d has been one of the bigger awards season question marks, especially after it failed to resonate with moviegoers in theaters. And yet both Jeremy Strong, for his portrayal for Trump lawyer Roy Cohn, and Sebastian Stan (who was also in the conversation for \u201cA Different Man\u201d ), for playing the future two-time president, made it in. Only Strong got nominated by the Screen Actors Guild.",
      "This will forever be one of the more confounding awards season oversights. Marianne Jean-Baptiste delivered one of the all-time great performances in Mike Leigh\u2019s \u201cHard Truths,\u201d as the perpetually aggrieved and sharp-tongued London woman Pansy. The general thinking is that it was either going to be Jean-Baptiste or Fernanda Torres, and Torres got in for the equally beloved \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "This is perhaps up for debate, but there was certainly a lot of goodwill behind Anderson\u2019s movie-star turn in Gia Coppola\u2019s \u201cThe Last Showgirl,\u201d especially considering her SAG nomination. But like with Jennifer Lopez and \u201cHustlers\u201d a few years ago, it was not meant to be at the Oscars.",
      "James Mangold has directed several awards darlings, including \u201cFord v Ferrari\u201d and \u201cWalk the Line\u201d but had consistently missed out on a best director nomination, until this year with \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d It may have come at the expense of Edward Berger, who missed out on a nod for \u201cConclave\u201d or Denis Villeneuve for \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d",
      "Daniel Craig gave one of his best performances as an American expat in Mexico in the torrid May-December romance in \u201cQueer,\u201d but it hasn\u2019t been resonating with awards voters. The Oscar snub is the final piece in a puzzle that just never came together.",
      "If there ever were a shoo-in for a nomination and an Oscar, on paper at least, it would be for Angelina Jolie playing opera legend Maria Callas. Filmmaker Pablo Larra\u00edn had not missed yet in getting best actress nominations for his famous, tragic women biopics, including Natalie Portman for \u201cJackie\u201d and Kristen Stewart for \u201cSpencer.\u201d But somehow Jolie did not make the cut in the end.",
      "\u201cBabygirl\u201d is not a cliche awards movie by a long stretch, but Nicole Kidman\u2019s performance as Romy, the buttoned-up, married CEO who begins a dangerous affair with a young intern at her company was undeniable. But a best actress win at the Venice Film Festival has never guaranteed Oscar success.",
      "Despite the wide love for \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d Felicity Jones has been curiously absent from many nominations lists for her sharp portrayal of Erzs\u00e9bet T\u00f3th. The cast did not even get recognized by SAG. But it just goes to show that it\u2019s never too late to sneak in for the big one",
      "A few years after Danielle Deadwyler was famously snubbed for \u201cTill,\u201d she has another snub to add to her resume for Malcolm Washington\u2019s adaptation of \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d This latest campaign might not have had as much steam behind it as \u201cTill,\u201d but at the very least one would assume that it could have been a make good.",
      "Supporting actress was one of the more chaotic and unpredictable categories this year, with so many deserving performers in the mix. Monica Barbaro was one of those that was on the fringe of possibilities for her turn as Joan Baez, singing and all, for \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "One who was not so lucky was Selena Gomez for \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d perhaps because she was partially competing with her co-star, Zo\u00eb Salda\u00f1a who simply had more momentum (and gave a moving speech at the Golden Globes).",
      "The incarceration drama \u201cSing Sing\u201d did get several significant nominations including for Colman Domingo, adapted screenplay and original song. But Clarence \u201cDivine Eye\u201d Maclin, who delivered a revelatory performance based on his own experience, was not among them. He is, however, credited with helping to write the story.",
      "Margaret Qualley seems to have been unfairly left out of much of the awards conversation around \u201cThe Substance,\u201d a movie that only works with a great Sue. But the focus has been more on Demi Moore, overdue for such recognition, and Coralie Fargeat \u2014 the only woman to score a best director nomination.",
      "Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross delivered one of their most popular scores ever this year for \u201cChallengers\u201d and yet were left off in a batch of nominees that included \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Robot.\u201d It\u2019s not even that they\u2019re consistently overlooked by the academy \u2014 they\u2019ve already won twice, for \u201cSoul\u201d and \u201cThe Social Network.\u201d",
      "Everyone expected the Latvian cat movie \u201cFlow\u201d to get a best animated feature nomination, especially after it won the Golden Globe. But the big surprise is that it got a second for best international feature \u2014 a first for Latvia. This is not a first for an animated movie to get into the international category, though: \u201cWaltz with Bashir\u201d and \u201cFlee\u201d had the honor before \u201cFlow,\u201d but neither ended up winning.",
      "RaMell Ross\u2019 \u201cNickel Boys\u201d has had quite the rollercoaster awards season journey, even though it\u2019s widely considered one of the best films of the year. The film academy thought so too, including it among the 10 best picture nominees (alongside other relative surprises like \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d). Oddly, though, it missed out on cinematography despite its inventive first-person point of view."

    "summary": "Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan",
    "story": [
      "Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan, the chief of the World Health Organization said Sunday, part of a series of attacks coming as the African nation's civil war escalated in recent days.",
      "The attack on the Saudi Teaching Maternal Hospital, which local officials blamed on the rebel Rapid Support Forces, came as the group was experiencing apparent battlefield losses to the Sudanese military and allied forces under the command of army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan. That includes Burhan appearing near a burning oil refinery north of Khartoum on Saturday that his forces said they seized from the RSF.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Foreign Ministry denounced the attack as \u201ca violation of international law.\u201d",
      "International mediation attempts and pressure tactics, including a U.S. assessment that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide, and sanctions targeting Burhan, haven't halted the fighting.",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted the death toll in the hospital attack in El Fasher on the social platform X.",
      "Officials and others in the capital of North Darfur province had cited a similar figure Saturday, but Tedros is the first international source to provide a casualty number. Reporting on Sudan is incredibly difficult given communication challenges, the indiscriminate violence faced by civilians and exaggerations by both the RSF and the Sudanese military. Sudan's Foreign Ministry accused the RSF of launching a drone attack targeting the hospital's emergency ward, describing the assault as a \u201cmassacre.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe appalling attack on Saudi Hospital in El Fasher, Sudan, led to 19 injuries and 70 deaths among patients and companions,\u201d Tedros wrote. \u201cAt the time of the attack, the hospital was packed with patients receiving care.\u201d",
      "Another health facility in Al Malha also was attacked Saturday, he added.",
      "\u201cWe continue to call for a cessation of all attacks on health care in Sudan, and to allow full access for the swift restoration of the facilities that have been damaged,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cAbove all, Sudan\u2019s people need peace. The best medicine is peace.\u201d",
      "Tedros didn't identify who launched the attack, though local officials had blamed the RSF for the assault. U.N. official Clementine Nkweta-Salami, who coordinates humanitarian efforts for the world body in Sudan, warned Thursday that the RSF earlier had given \u201ca 48-hour ultimatum to forces allied to the Sudanese Armed Forces to vacate the city and indicated a forthcoming offensive.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince May 2024, El Fasher has been under RSF siege,\u201d she said. \u201cCivilians in El Fasher have already endured months of suffering, violence and gross human rights abuses under the prolonged siege. Their lives now hang in the balance due to an increasingly precarious situation.\u201d",
      "The RSF didn't immediately acknowledge the attack in El Fasher, which is more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) southwest of Khartoum. The city is now estimated to be home to more than 1 million people, many of whom have been displaced by the war.",
      "The U.N. said in December that the RSF siege had killed 782 civilians and wounded more than 1,140 others, warning that the figures likely were higher.",
      "The Saudi hospital, just north of El Fasher's airport, sits near the front lines of the war and has been repeatedly hit by shelling. Still, its doctors continue surgeries, sometimes by the light of cellphones while the hospital is hit.",
      "However, the RSF appeared in recent days to have lost control of the Khartoum refinery, the biggest in Sudan and crucial to both its economy and that of South Sudan. Burhan's forces also say they broke another RSF besiegement of the Signal Corps headquarters in northern Khartoum. The rebels claimed they were \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around that base.",
      "Sudan has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the RSF joined forces to lead a military coup in October 2021.",
      "Al-Bashir faces charges at the International Criminal Court over carrying out a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s in the western Darfur region with the Janjaweed, the precursor to the RSF. Rights groups and the U.N. say the RSF and allied Arab militias are again attacking ethnic African groups in this war.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in April 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country.",
      "Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "On Sunday, Burhan traveled to the military's General Command headquarters in Khartoum, a building he hadn't been to since the fighting broke out in 2023. The headquarters is near Khartoum International Airport, which has seen fierce fighting during the war.",
      "\u201cThe armed forces are in their best condition and we will move forward with the determination of our people to eliminate the rebellion in all of Sudan,\u201d Burhan said, according to the state-run SUNA news agency.",

      "Weeks after the worst of the deadly fires tore through Los Angeles suburbs, families are grappling with the reality that toxic ash from burned cars and homes could be a health issue for awhile, especially for children",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Kelli Ferrone wiped blinds and window sills inside her daughters\u2019 elementary school, just a half mile from the devastating Palisades Fire that scorched the coastal enclave in Los Angeles. The cotton swabs and wipes came up black.",
      "There is scattered ash and soot at her feet. Outside, it's on the ground next to a playground.",
      "Ferrone, who recorded videos and shared them with The Associated Press, wanted to see for herself this week if Canyon Charter Elementary School had been adequately cleaned before the school reopens. She wasn't impressed.",
      "Weeks after the most intense days of fire across the Los Angeles area, parents are grappling with the reality that toxic ash from burned homes and cars could be harmful to their children. It's a risk that is becoming more common as wildfires burn in cities.",
      "In the Pacific Palisades, Canyon Charter could reopen as soon as Monday. School officials say staff are working hard to make sure schools are clean and safe and they're confident in their decision. But some parents feel the school is rushing to open. They're urging officials to temporarily relocate, while others try to transfer their students elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThe (Los Angeles Unified School District) has never experienced a disaster like this in their history,\" said Ferrone, who has two daughters at the school, one with asthma. \"And I do think people are trying really hard, but our school needs a new temporary home with classrooms and teachers teaching in-person. That is the only thing that is going to make people feel comfortable.\u201d",
      "In a statement, LAUSD said staff \u201chas worked diligently to prepare schools for a return to in-person instruction.\u201d That includes inspecting ventilation systems, replacing filters and installing air purifiers in classrooms and offices, and cleaning inside and outdoors. An environmental consultant is inspecting campuses. Staff monitors air quality. The district has an Office of Environmental Health and Safety and is following its protocols.",
      "Some schools are within a \u201cdo not drink water\u201d advisory, including Canyon Charter. That means fountains are turned off and bottled water is provided, the district said.",
      "Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, said the school is taking all the right steps. Yet, she said, \u201cthere\u2019s no zero risk.\"",
      "The ash is a toxic soup of incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and every other kind of personal belonging. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead, all of which children are more vulnerable to.",
      "\u201cChildren often have more hand-to-mouth behavior and their bodies are rapidly growing in these first few years, and so they can be more sensitive to this type of pollution,\" said Patel. \"There will be a risk for a while to come in terms of exposure.\u201d",
      "Some materials form reactive chemical compounds when they burn.",
      "Scientists still don't know the long-term health impacts of exposure to massive urban fire like this year's in California or the one in Maui, Hawaii in 2023. Three schools in Lahaina didn't reopen for two months after that. But some chemicals have been linked to heart disease and lung issues, while exposure to minerals like magnetite, which can form when fire burns iron, has been associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "In Pasadena, Emily Stough is trying to minimize the risks for her 11- and 14-year-old who returned to Blair High School, which includes a middle school, this week. She made sure they took masks. In an email to parents last week, the Pasadena Unified School District said some 38 tons of outdoor debris have been hauled away from campuses, and they will only open \u201cafter rigorous cleaning and sanitizing and environmental tests.\"",
      "Stough said she trusts the district to do its due diligence, but she wants more information.",
      "\u201cDid they test air quality? Did they test ash samples? Were the ash samples from inside the school, in the hallways, from outside the schools?,\" she wonders. \"Air quality both inside and outside the schools? I\u2019d like to see that. I\u2019d like to know what cleaning was done.\u201d",
      "The PUSD did not respond to questions from the AP.",
      "It\u2019s hard to know how long these fire toxins will stay in the environment, said Patel, but it could be a few months. Strong winds like the Santa Anas could also blow them distances where they could enter soil and groundwater.",
      "Plastics in particular could last a long time, said Dr. Ilan Shapiro, medical affairs officer for AltaMed and a fellow with the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cAnd we need to remember that the fires are still going. That we still have burn materials coming out.\" As communities recover and clean up, that ash will be moved again, he said.",
      "Longfellow Elementary School in Pasadena is set to reopen next week, but Tanya Reyes doesn\u2019t plan to send her kids back just yet. The school is about two miles from where the Eaton Fire burned down the home they rented. Even with the school's safety measures, \u201cmy gut is saying \u2018no,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be around that area. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d",
      "Her family is staying in West Hollywood, and she\u2019s looking for schools there, somewhere the kids can attend for a little while. She's considering home schooling, too, but still figuring it all out.",
      "It's hard for parents because they understand all the ways kids need school.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this in so many different ways, whether it\u2019s been wildfire smoke or the pandemic,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWhen kids miss school, that is also a detriment to their health. It impacts their learning, it impacts their socioemotional development, their sense of connection and community during a time of crisis.\"",

      "President Trump\u2019s first week in office included a flurry of executive orders with implications for Earth\u2019s climate and environment",
      "President Trump's first week in office included a flurry of executive orders with implications for Earth's climate and environment.",
      "While former President Joe Biden made climate change a hallmark of his administration and some of his policies remain, at least for now, Trump is quickly unraveling that.",
      "Experts say Trump's moves to step away from global climate action, ramp up domestic oil and gas production and remove incentives for electric vehicles are worrisome as the planet continues to heat up. 2024 was Earth's hottest year on record, and climate scientists say the rising heat is contributing to extreme weather affecting millions.",
      "\u201cThese orders will make our air dirtier, make people sicker, make energy more expensive, and make our communities less prepared for extreme weather,\" wrote Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, a marine biologist, policy expert and author who co-founded the non-profit think tank Urban Ocean Lab.",
      "Here are some of Trump's most notable moves affecting climate and environmental issues in his first week:",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday directing the United States to again withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement aimed at global cooperation on climate change.",
      "The agreement requires participating countries to come up with nationally determined contributions to the effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the planet. Trump's move means the federal government won't be trying to meet emissions reductions goals, nor any financial commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",
      "\u201cWalking away from the Paris Agreement won\u2019t protect Americans from climate impacts, but it will hand China and the European Union a competitive edge in the booming clean energy economy and lead to fewer opportunities for American workers,\u201d said Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Trump declared an energy emergency via executive order earlier this week amid a promise to \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d",
      "The order urges oil and gas expansion including through federal use of eminent domain and the Defense Production Act, which allow the government to use private land and resources to produce goods deemed to be a national necessity.",
      "Experts dispute his description of an \u201cinadequate energy supply\u201d as part of the basis for the order.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that the United States is well-supplied with energy in all of its forms,\u201d said Gary Dirks, senior director of the Global Futures Laboratory at Arizona State University. Dirks said he thinks the move is actually more targeted at bringing down prices at the pump.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the United States right now is the largest producer of oil of any nation in history. And we got to that point under the Biden administration, not because of the Biden administration\u2019s policies necessarily, but because of policies that have been ongoing for four decades,\u201d he said.",
      "One section of the order declaring an energy emergency states that the Endangered Species Act cannot be an obstacle to energy development.",
      "The Endangered Species Act has been a hurdle for the development of fossil fuels in the U.S. for decades, and weakening it would accelerate the decline and potential extinction of numerous endangered species, including whales and sea turtles, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "Trump also opened up areas in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling. Biden had previously both restricted and approved drilling in other parts of the Arctic, part of a long process mired in litigation and complicated by political battles.",
      "\u201cI would begin by pointing out that there was an attempt to lease for oil drilling recently and nobody bid,\u201d Dirks said. \u201cI don\u2019t actually think that the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge is an exciting place for oil and gas exploration.\u201d",
      "But he expressed concern about preserving biodiversity, something other scientists and environmental groups have highlighted.",
      "\u201cThe Arctic is a very fragile system,\u201d said Peter Schlosser, vice president and vice provost of global futures at Arizona State. Schlosser added that drilling there would disrupt the land and sea, and that potential contamination or oil spills are more difficult to clean up there due to low temperatures.",
      "Trump promised to eliminate what he incorrectly calls Biden's \u201celectric vehicle mandate.\"",
      "What that means in practice is that the order will revoke a non-binding goal set by Biden to have EVs make up half of new cars sold by 2030. He will also likely seek repeal of a $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases approved by Congress as part of Biden\u2019s landmark 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "All of that is likely frustrating for automakers, who have to make long-term decisions, said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at auto-buying research firm Edmunds. As the rest of the world moves to electric cars, automakers have to decide how to factor in the global direction the industry is headed alongside the sudden lack of federal support.",
      "\u201cWe do think that the long-term end goal here is going to be electrification. It\u2019s just the timeline it seems is uncertain right now,\u201d she said.",
      "When the government reviews new facilities that emit pollution, officials are no longer likely to consider a concept known as environmental justice, or how that new pollution will add to the emissions that have tended to fall more heavily on poor and minority communities.",
      "Those are sweeping moves that Rena Payan, chief program officer at nonprofit Justice Outside, called \u201crolling back decades of progress in addressing environmental discrimination.\u201d",
      "That means more of a burden for state and local groups to fight to protect those communities. Trump\u2019s decision to cut off support will hurt, but many of these organizations are used to operating without federal support \u2014 they have done so for years, according to Peggy Shepard, co-founder and executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m grappling right now with is both the grief of these losses, and the fact that we were on an upward swing, if you will, just weeks ago,\u201d said Jade Begay, an Indigenous rights and climate organizer.",

      "Vaccination bills are popping up in more than 15 states as lawmakers aim to potentially resurrect or create new religious exemptions from immunization mandates, establish state-level vaccine injury databases or dictate what providers must tell patients...",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Vaccination bills are popping up in more than 15 states as lawmakers aim to potentially resurrect or create new religious exemptions from immunization mandates, establish state-level vaccine injury databases or dictate what providers must tell patients about the shots.",
      "Many see a political opportunity to rewrite policies in their states after President Donald Trump's return to the White House and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 's nomination as the next secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency oversees virtually every aspect of vaccination efforts in the U.S., from funding their development to establishing recommendations for medical providers to distributing vaccines and covering them through federal programs.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates against dangerous infections like measles and polio continue to fall nationwide, and the number of parents claiming non-medical exemptions so their kids don't get required shots is rising.",
      "In 2024, whooping cough cases reached a decade-high and 16 measles outbreaks, the largest among them in Chicago and Minnesota, put health officials on edge. Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "About half of Americans are \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d concerned that those declining childhood vaccination rates will lead to more outbreaks, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Yet only about 4 in 10 Americans oppose reconsidering the government\u2019s recommendations for widely used vaccines, while roughly 3 in 10 are in favor. The rest \u2014 about 3 in 10 \u2014 are neutral.",
      "Scott Burris, director of Temple University\u2019s Center for Public Health Law Research, has tracked public health legislation for years, and watched backlash against COVID-19 vaccines grow to include more routine vaccines as anti-vaccine activists take hold of powerful political pulpits.",
      "\u201cI think COVID and the politics gave standard vaccine denialists a lot of wind in their sails,\" he said.",
      "It's hard to predict what will pass into law in the states, Burris said, considering the vast majority of proposed bills in any state go nowhere. But the proposed legislation offers a glimpse into lawmakers\u2019 thoughts, and what else might follow.",
      "Religious exemptions for school vaccine requirements are among the most popular proposals so far. Lawmakers in New York, Virginia, Connecticut and Mississippi have introduced bills that would allow more people to waive routine shots. Indiana lawmakers will weigh religious exemptions for medical students.",
      "Earlier this month, West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order on his first day in office that enabled families to receive religious exemptions from required school vaccinations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a huge step,\" said Brian Festa, co-founder of the law firm We The Patriots USA, which works on vaccination-related cases throughout the country. \"That\u2019s a state that never had a religious exemption.\u201d",
      "Now, only four states allow just a medical exemption from childcare and K-12 immunization requirements: Connecticut, California, New York and Maine.",
      "Festa credited West Virginia's new religious exemption to Trump's nomination of Kennedy, as well as a 2023 federal court ruling that required Mississippi to allow residents to cite religious beliefs when seeking exemptions from state-mandated vaccinations for children.",
      "\u201cI think the writing\u2019s on the wall and they did feel the pressure,\u201d Festa said of West Virginia.",
      "In Connecticut, at least four Republican bills will try to revive the state's religious exemption for schools, colleges and daycares \u2014 something a contentious 2021 state law eliminated for students without an existing exemption.",
      "Connecticut health experts said at the time there was a slow but steady increase in the number of religious exemptions and declining vaccination rates in some schools. The state has historically maintained some of the highest childhood vaccination rates in the county, and in the 2023-2024 school year, more than 97% of kindergarteners protected against chickenpox, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and more.",
      "Given that the U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge to the Connecticut law and the statehouse is controlled by Democrats, GOP state Sen. Eric Berthel said he\u2019s not optimistic legislative leaders will allow debate on his exemption bill, but does believe the broader cultural shift means \u201cmaybe there is a bit of an appetite to look at things like this again.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that we\u2019re not being fair to families who have a true faith-based reason to not vaccinate their child,\u201d he said.",
      "There's one outlier so far among statehouse trends on exemptions. Hawaii, where legislators are looking to move in the opposite direction with a bill to eliminate all non-medical waivers after struggling for years with high exemption rates.",
      "Other vaccine-related bills touch on some of the opposition that's been growing since the pandemic.",
      "Oklahoma and Alabama have proposals that would require parental consent for any vaccine given to minors. Bills in Wyoming, Oregon and Oklahoma would prohibit \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against people who aren\u2019t vaccinated against COVID-19 or other diseases.",
      "New York and Oklahoma have bills that would require providers to give people getting shots a full ingredient list, and Florida legislation would ban edible vaccines, though none are approved for use in the U.S. and research is still in early stages.",
      "Vaccine injury is also a popular topic, and bills in Indiana and North Dakota propose creating state versions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System \u2014 a federal database that drew the attention of vaccine skeptics during the pandemic. Anyone can file a report about a potential issue after a vaccine, though the CDC\u2019s website notes a report doesn\u2019t prove the shot caused a health issue.",
      "North Dakota Republican state Sen. Dick Anderson said he's not against people getting vaccines \u2014 he got one COVID-19 shot himself \u2014 but proposed the bill because many people don't trust the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe have to do something to restore trust in the system,\" Anderson said.",
      "But experts note state databases are unnecessarily duplicative.",
      "\u201cA lot of these proposals, they're trying to fix something that's not broken and really working to counter the goal of preventing the spread of communicable disease,\u201d said Andy Baker-White, senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "Policy should be focused on getting rid of barriers to vaccination, not adding to them, said Dr. Susan Kressly, a pediatrician and president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Many families miss vaccinations not because of ideology, she said, but because of lack of transportation or not having primary care doctors or clinics nearby, among other things.",
      "But because most Americans are vaccinated, they haven't seen the effects of dangerous infections like bacterial meningitis that Kressly fielded calls about from fearful parents early in her career.",

      "Mifepristone has been under attack by abortion opponents, with several states seeking in federal court to restrict its use.",
      "Now used in two-thirds of U.S. abortions, mifepristone blocks a hormone needed to sustain a pregnancy. It's typically used with misoprostol, which causes contractions and bleeding.",
      "In the study, 133 women who were up to nine weeks' pregnant took a 60 milligram dose of ulipristal acetate, the active ingredient in the prescription contraceptive Ella, followed by misoprostol 24 hours later.",
      "For 97% of them, that drug combo was effective at inducing an abortion, an effectiveness equal to the mifepristone-misoprostol combination. Four women needed a procedure or an additional medication to complete the abortion.",
      "The 60 milligram dose of ulipristal used in the study is twice the dose of Ella, a prescription drug used for emergency contraception.",
      "The company that makes Ella says on its website that it won't end an existing pregnancy. It can be taken up to five days after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy.",

      "Digital screens are pervasive at work and in homes and schools stores",
      "NEW YORK -- The trouble started every day at around 3 p.m., after Cathy Higgins had spent five or six hours staring at an array of computer screens at her desk. Her university job overseeing research projects involved peering closely at numbers and details on contracts, applications and budgets.",
      "\u201cMy vision was so blurry, I couldn\u2019t even see what was on the screen, and I was squinting so much that I could not function,\u201d Higgins said.",
      "When her eyesight got bad, Higgins walked around and spoke with members of her staff. She began planning in-person meetings for afternoons. But she would resume the computer work late at night after her children went to bed.",
      "\u201cIf I had to continue working through the blurry vision, that\u2019s when the migraines would happen,\u201d Higgins said.",
      "Digital screens are pervasive, not only at work but in our homes, schools and shops. An estimated 104 million Americans of working age spend more than seven hours a day in front of screens, according to the American Optometric Association. All that screen time can take a toll.",
      "Too much exposure to screens can lead to dry or watery eyes, fuzzy vision and headaches. It can also lead to myopia, or nearsightedness, in some people, especially children. Some technology workers even describe short bouts of vertigo when they look at screens for too long.",
      "One reason for the discomfort is that staring closely at screens for prolonged periods causes the muscle that helps eye focus to tighten up.",
      "\u201cThat muscle's not supposed to stay tight all day long. And if it does, it's like picking up a light weight and trying to hold it over your head for hours,\u201d American Optometric Association President Steven Reed said. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to pick it up. But after a while, even though it\u2019s not a heavy lift, your body just gets tired.\u201d",
      "Fortunately, exposure to blue light from computer screens and devices has not been shown to cause permanent eye damage, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology.",
      "Nevertheless, symptoms can disrupt work, family time and rest. As an optometrist in Mississippi, Reed sees patients who complain of frequent eye pain, headaches and blurry vision associated with computer use. He advises getting an eye exam and taking frequent breaks.",
      "For Higgins, trying to catch up on the work she couldn't do when her eyes were too fatigued on weekdays cut into time she spent with her daughters on weekends. \u201cThey\u2019d be playing together, and I couldn\u2019t be as engaged as I would have liked to have been in what they were doing,\u201d she said.",
      "Here are some tips from eye health professionals to reduce eye strain caused by devices.",
      "Take a break every 20 minutes from sitting at a computer. During the break, focus your eyes on something that's about 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Pausing close-up work and looking at something in the distance gives tired, tight muscles time to relax.",
      "\u201cLuckily, eye strain is temporary,\u201d said Raj Maturi, an ophthalmologist at Midwest Eye Institute in Indianapolis who serves as spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. \u201cThe best way to avoid these symptoms is by taking breaks from our screens or near work activities and using lubricating eye drops, if needed.\u201d",
      "People usually blink about 18 to 22 times per minute. But when looking at a screen, the rate drops to three to seven times per minute, according to the Cleveland Clinic. That's where eye drops come in.",
      "It's good to move around and go outside, but when you don't have time for an outdoor walk, frequent 20-second breaks can help.",
      "Some people find that using a larger computer monitor helps reduce eye fatigue. You can also increase the font size on your laptop, monitor or smartphone screen.",
      "Higgins did all of the above after she started a new job as senior vice president at Stand Up to Cancer. Since she works remotely from home in Midlothian, Virginia, she got a 29-inch monitor and sits about three feet away from it, about a foot farther than in most office setups.",
      "The changes helped. She still has occasional issues with blurriness, but not as frequently. \u201cWhen I have an extended day, like a 12-hour day, that\u2019s when I start to have vision issues again,\u201d she said.",
      "Sitting an arm\u2019s length away from your screen and adjusting it so you\u2019re looking slightly downward also can help reduce eye strain, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology.",
      "Some products, such as blue light glasses, are marketed with claims that they will reduce digital eye strain, improve sleep and prevent eye disease. But several studies have found the glasses are not very effective, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology. It's really our behavior with digital devices that causes symptoms, not the small amount of blue light coming from screens, the group said.",
      "After stepping away from computers at work, many people find themselves reading or scrolling on smartphone screens. It's not just workers: children are using laptops, tablets and smart screens in school settings throughout the day.",
      "Too much screen time or focusing on nearby objects can accelerate the onset and progression of nearsightedness, especially in children, said Ayesha Malik, pediatric optometrist in the division of ophthalmology at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Anyone streaming shows should do so on a television, instead of a tablet, to help relieve eye strain, she said.",
      "Children should follow the 20-20-20-2 rule, which includes an extra \u201c2\u201d at the end to encourage playing outdoors for 2 hours a day, which helps with eye development, she said.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that most children are engaging with screens throughout the day at school and home. It becomes difficult to track the total number of hours,\u201d Malik said. \u201cAim for not more than 20 minutes during any one session.\u201d",
      "The blue light that digital screens emit can increase alertness, so watching Netflix on an iPad or scrolling through social media feeds in bed may make it hard to get restful sleep.",
      "To give your eyes and brain the rest they need, doctors recommend turning off screens one to two hours before going to sleep. You can also set devices to \u201cdark mode\u201d in the evening to reduce the impact of bright light. If you\u2019re used to streaming videos at night, try listening to an audiobook or podcast instead.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has inspected a facility that produces nuclear material and called for bolstering the country\u2019s nuclear capability, state media reported Wednesday, as the North looks to increase pressure on the United States following the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Kim\u2019s visit suggests a continued emphasis on an expansion of North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal, though Trump has said he\u2019s willing to talk to Kim again to revive diplomacy. Many analysts view North Korean weapons moves as part of a strategy to win diplomatic talks with Washington that could result in aid and political concessions.",
      "The official Korean Central News Agency reported that Kim visited the nuclear-material production base and the Nuclear Weapons Institute. It didn\u2019t say where those facilities are located, but North Korean photos of Kim\u2019s visit indicated that he likely visited a uranium-enrichment facility that he went to last September. That visit was North Korea\u2019s first disclosure of a uranium-enrichment facility since it showed one to visiting American scholars in 2010.",
      "During the latest visit, Kim praised scientists and others for \"producing weapons-grade nuclear materials and in strengthening the nuclear shield of the country.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, North Korea said it tested a cruise missile system, its third known weapons display this year, and vowed \u201cthe toughest\u201d response to what it called the escalation of U.S.-South Korean military drills.",
      "North Korea views U.S. military training with South Korea as invasion rehearsals, though Washington and Seoul have repeatedly said their drills are defensive in nature. In recent years, the United States and South Korea have expanded their military exercises in response to North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear program.",
      "The start of Trump\u2019s second term raises prospects for the revival of diplomacy between the United States and North Korea, as Trump met Kim three times during his first term. The Trump-Kim diplomacy  in 2018-19 fell apart due to wrangling over U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea.",
      "During a Fox News interview broadcast Thursday, Trump called Kim \u201ca smart guy\u201d and \u201cnot a religious zealot.\u201d Asked whether he will reach out to Kim again, Trump replied, \u201cI will, yeah.\u201d",
      "Many experts say Kim likely thinks he has greater bargaining power than in his earlier round of diplomacy with Trump because of his country\u2019s enlarged nuclear arsenal and deepening military ties with Russia.",

      "Syria\u2019s Civil Defense has uncovered over two dozen charred bodies in two basements in rural Damascus, adding to the growing tally of mass graves discovered since the ousting of Bashar Assad",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- The charred remains of at least 26 victims of the Bashar Assad government were located Tuesday by Syrian civil defense workers in two separate basements in rural Damascus.",
      "The discovery adds to the growing tally of mass graves unearthed since the fall of the Assad government in December. The remains, which are believed to include men, women and children, showed evidence of gunshot wounds and burning.",
      "Members of Syria\u2019s White Helmets, a volunteer civil defense group, exhumed the fragmented, weathered skeletal remains from the basement of two properties in the town of Sbeneh, southwest of the capital. Wearing hazmat suits, they carefully logged and coded each set of remains before placing them into body bags, which were then loaded onto trucks for transport.",
      "Since Nov. 28, the White Helmets have uncovered \"more than 780 bodies, most of unknown identity,\u201d Abed al-Rahman Mawwas, a member of the rescue service, told The Associated Press. He said many were found in shallow graves uncovered by locals or dug up by animals. The bodies are transferred to forensics doctors to determine their identities, time of death and cause of death, as well as to match them with possible family members.",
      "\u201cOf course, this takes years of work,\u201d he said.",
      "Mohammad al-Herafe, a resident of one of the buildings where remains were uncovered, said the stench of decomposing bodies was overwhelming when his family returned to Sbeneh in 2016 after fleeing because of fighting in the area during the country's uprising-turned-civil war that began in 2011.",
      "He said they found the bodies in the basement but chose not to report it out of fear of government reprisals. \u201cWe could not tell the regime about it because we know that the regime did this.\u201d",
      "The Assad government, which ruled Syria for over two decades, employed airstrikes on civilian areas, torture, executions and mass imprisonment, to maintain control over Syria and suppress opposition groups during the country's 13-year civil war.",
      "Ammar al-Salmo, another Civil Defense member dispatched to the second basement site, said further investigation is needed to identify the victims.",
      "\u201cWe need testimonies from residents and others who might know who stayed behind when the fighting intensified in 2013,\u201d he told the AP.",
      "Mohammad Shebat, who lived in the second building where bodies were found, said he left the neighborhood in 2012 and returned in 2020 when he and his neighbors discovered the bodies and demanded their removal. But no one cooperated, he said.",
      "Shebat believes the victims were civilians who fled the nearby Al-Assali neighborhood when the fighting escalated and the Assad government imposed a siege in 2013. He said forces of the former government used to \u201ctrap people in basements, burn them with tires and leave their bodies.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are several basements like this, full of skeletons,\" he said.",
      "In a report released Monday, the United Nations Syria Commission of Inquiry said that mass graves can be used as evidence to uncover the fates of thousands of missing detainees.",
      "The report, spanning 14 years of investigations and drawing on over 2,000 witness testimonies, including more than 550 survivors of torture, detailed how detainees in Syria\u2019s notorious prisons \u201csuffering from torture injuries, malnutrition, disease and illness, were left to die slowly, in agonizing pain, or were taken away to be executed.\u201d",
      "Assad's fall on Dec. 8 drove hundreds of families to scour prisons and morgues in desperate search of loved ones. While many were freed after years of imprisonment, thousands remain missing, their fates still unknown.",
      "The U.N. commission has said that forensic exhumations of mass graves, as well as safeguarding evidence, archives and crime sites, may offer grieving families a chance to learn the truth.",
      "The commission was established in 2011 by the Human Rights Council to investigate Syria\u2019s alleged violations of international human rights law.",
      "The U.N. report documented brutal methods of torture by the former government, including \u201csevere beatings, electric shocks, burning, pulling out nails, damaging teeth, rape, sexual violence including mutilation, prolonged stress positions, deliberate neglect and denial of medical care, exacerbating wounds and psychological torture.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor Syrians who did not find their loved ones among the freed, this evidence, alongside testimonies of freed detainees, may be their best hope to uncover the truth about missing relatives,\u201d said Commissioner Lynn Welchman.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says President Donald Trump has invited him to visit the White House on Feb. 4",
      "WADI GAZA, Gaza Strip -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that President Donald Trump has invited him to visit the White House on Feb. 4, which would make him the first foreign leader to do so in Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "The announcement came as the United States pressures Israel and Hamas to continue a ceasefire that has paused a devastating 15-month war in Gaza. Talks about the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, which aims to end the war, are set to begin on Feb. 3.",
      "A letter shared by Netanyahu's office, dated Tuesday, invited the prime minister to visit next week: \u201cI look forward to discussing how we can bring peace to Israel and its neighbors, and efforts to counter our shared adversaries.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate comment from the White House. Trump teased the upcoming visit in a conversation with reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday, but didn\u2019t provide details. \u201cI\u2019m going to be speaking with Bibi Netanyahu in the not too distant future,\u201d he said.",
      "The meeting would be a chance for Netanyahu, under pressure at home, to remind the world of the support he has received from Trump over the years, and to defend Israel's conduct of the war. Last year, the two men met face-to-face for the first time in nearly four years at Trump\u2019s Florida Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. military aid, and Netanyahu is likely to encourage Trump not to hold up some weapons deliveries the way the Biden administration did, though it continued other deliveries and overall military support.",

      "Even before taking office this month, Trump was sending his special Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the region to apply pressure along with the Biden administration to get the current Gaza ceasefire achieved.",
      "But Netanyahu has vowed to renew the war if Hamas doesn\u2019t meet his demands in negotiations over the ceasefire's second phase, meant to discuss a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a \u201csustainable calm.\"",
      "Under the deal, more than 375,000 Palestinians have crossed into northern Gaza since Israel allowed their return on Monday morning, the United Nations said Tuesday. That represents over a third of the million people who fled in the war\u2019s opening days.",
      "Many of the Palestinians trudging along a seaside road or crossing in vehicles after security inspections were getting their first view of shattered northern Gaza under the fragile ceasefire, now in its second week.",
      "They were determined, if homes were damaged or destroyed, to pitch makeshift shelters or sleep outdoors amid the vast piles of broken concrete or perilously leaning buildings. After months of crowding in squalid tent camps or former schools in Gaza\u2019s south, they would finally be home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still better for us to be on our land than to live on a land that\u2019s not yours,\u201d said Fayza al-Nahal as she prepared to leave the southern city of Khan Younis for the north.",
      "At least two Palestinians set off for the north by sea, crowding into a rowboat with a bicycle and other belongings.",
      "Hani Al-Shanti, displaced from Gaza City, looked forward to feeling at peace in whatever he found, \u201ceven if it is a roof and walls without furniture, even if it is without a roof.\u201d One newly returned woman hung laundry in the ruins of her home, its walls blown out.",
      "Under the ceasefire, the next release of hostages held in Gaza, and Palestinian prisoners from Israeli custody, is set to occur on Thursday, followed by another exchange on Saturday.",
      "In the ceasefire\u2019s six-week first phase, a total of 33 hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that ignited the war should be released, along with almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Israel this week said a list provided by Hamas confirmed the fears that eight of the 33 hostages to be freed are dead, bringing fresh grief to Israeli families who have long pressed the government to reach a deal to bring everyone home before time runs out.",
      "On Tuesday, one of the first hostages to be released under the current ceasefire \u2013 just the second in the war \u2013 shared a glimpse of life in captivity.",
      "Naama Levy, 20, wrote on social media that she spent most of the first 50 days alone before being reunited with other soldiers kidnapped from her military base on Oct. 7, well as other civilian captives.",
      "\u201cThey gave me strength and hope,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe strengthened each other until the day of our release, and also afterwards.\u201d",
      "A surge in humanitarian aid into Gaza continued under the ceasefire.",
      "\u201cIn this past week alone, approximately 4,200 trucks carrying aid have entered the Gaza Strip following inspections,\u201d said Israel\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel.",
      "Under the deal, 600 trucks of aid are meant to enter per day.",
      "The government of Qatar, a mediator in the ceasefire talks, said Tuesday that while complaints have been raised by both sides, no confirmed ceasefire violations have occurred that could cause the agreement to collapse.",
      "The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas. Militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 assault and abducted another 250.",
      "Israel responded with an air and ground offensive that has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",

      "Serbia\u2019s populist Prime Minister Milos Vucevic has resigned following weeks of massive anti-corruption protests over the deadly collapse of a concrete canopy in November",
      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia\u2019s populist Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigned Tuesday in an attempt to calm political tensions and pressure roiled by weeks of massive anti-corruption protests over the deadly collapse of a concrete canopy.",
      "The canopy collapse in November, which killed 15 people in the northern city of Novi Sad, has become a flashpoint reflecting wider discontent with the increasingly autocratic rule of Serbia\u2019s populist President Aleksandar Vucic. He has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms in Serbia despite formally seeking European Union membership for the troubled Balkan nation.",
      "\u201cIt is my appeal for everyone to calm down the passions and return to dialogue,\u201d Vucevic told a news conference announcing his resignation.",
      "Novi Sad Mayor Milan Djuric also stepped down on Tuesday.",
      "Vucevic\u2019s resignation could lead to an early parliamentary election. The resignation must be confirmed by Serbia\u2019s parliament, which has 30 days to choose a new government or call a snap election.",
      "Pro-government media said President Vucic will attend a Cabinet session on Tuesday evening to decide whether a new prime minister-designate will be appointed or an early election called.",
      "Opposition parties have said they would insist on a transitional government that would create conditions for a free and fair election. Vucic's populists have faced accusations of irregularities during past elections.",
      "Vucevic became the prime minister in April 2024, after the Serbian Progressive Party won most votes in an election marred by tensions.",
      "\u201cThey (ruling party) have been in a free fall since the Novi Sad tragedy,\u201d journalist Slobodan Georgiev said on N1 television, adding that Vucic was seeking a \u201cbuffer\u201d with the prime minister's resignation.",
      "Vucic in the past had managed to cushion the impact of anti-government street protests, but the current student movement has garnered widespread support from all walks of life, including actors, farmers, lawyers and judges.",
      "The students' call for justice has resonated in a country where corruption is widespread and few feel that the state institutions work in the interests of citizens.",
      "Branimir Jovancicevic, professor at the Faculty of Chemistry in Belgrade, expressed hope that Vucevic's resignation is a first step toward further political changes in Serbia, where power is concentrated in the hands of the president although his constitutional role is largely ceremonial.",
      "\u201cIf the president thinks that by replacing one, essentially, unimportant figure ... will solve the problem ... he is deeply mistaken,\" said Jovancicevic. \u201dThis must lead to total political changes because autocracy and dictatorship in Serbia, in the heart of Europe, must be stopped.\u201d",
      "On Monday, tens of thousands of people joined striking university students in a 24-hour blockade of a key traffic intersection in the Serbian capital. Serbia's students are demanding accountability for the canopy collapse that critics have blamed on rampant government corruption.",
      "Classes at Serbia's universities and dozens of schools have been blocked for two months with students camping inside their faculty buildings.",
      "In another attempt to defuse tensions, Vucic, Vucevic and Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabic on Monday evening urged dialogue with the students, who have so far rebuffed such invitations. They say Vucic shouldn't be the one holding talks with them but that government institutions such as police and the judiciary should do their job.",
      "Vucevic said the immediate cause for his quitting was an attack on a female student in Novi Sad early Tuesday by assailants allegedly from the ruling Serbian Progressive Party. Vucevic said that \u201cwhenever it seems there is hope to return to social dialogue, to talk ... it\u2019s like an invisible hand creates a new incident and tensions mount again.\u201d",
      "But the outgoing prime minister also said that the street protests \u201cundoubtedly\u201d have been organized from abroad \u201cwith an aim to directly jeopardize Serbia as a state.\u201d Vucevic offered no evidence for his claims that echoed earlier similar statements by Vucic.",
      "\u201cI can never justify or understand many of these protests, blockades of lives, of roads and the freedom of movement of other citizens,\u201d he said.",
      "Students in Novi Sad said they were horrified by the assault they said was carried out by thugs with baseball bats. They attacked two groups of students and chased them in their car, the students said. Prosecutors later said that four people have been detained.",
      "\u201cWe are horrified over the state of our society where such a situation is possible,\u201d the students said in an Instagram post. \u201cWe have had enough of blood.\u201d",
      "The students called a big rally in Novi Sad later Tuesday in response to the attack.",
      "Serbia\u2019s prosecutors have filed charges against 13 people, including a government minister and several state officials for the November canopy collapse. But the former Construction Minister Goran Vesic, who had resigned shortly after the canopy crash, has been released from detention, fueling doubts over the investigation\u2019s independence.",
      "The main railway station in Novi Sad was renovated and inaugurated twice in recent years as part of a wider infrastructure deal with Chinese state companies and a fast railway link with neighboring Hungary.",
      "Several incidents have marred the street demonstrations in the past weeks, including drivers ramming in to the crowds on two occasions, when two young women were injured.",
      "Students and others have been holding daily 15-minute traffic blockades throughout Serbia at 11:52 a.m., the exact same time the concrete canopy crashed down on Nov. 1. The blockades honor the 15 victims, including two children. The blockades were also held on Tuesday."

      "Congo\u2019s security forces were attempting to slow the rebels, who advanced into Goma, a key eastern city, in a major escalation of the decadeslong conflict.",
      "The M23 rebels are one of about 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region in the conflict, one of Africa\u2019s largest.",
      "The protesters demanded that the international community pressure Rwanda over the rebel advance.",
      "\u201cWe denounce the hypocrisy of the international community,\" said Timoth\u00e9e Tshishimbi, one of the protesters. \"They must tell Rwanda to stop this adventure.\u201d",
      "Residents reported gunfire overnight in Goma, a city of 2 million people which the rebels claimed to have captured on Monday. Explosions and gunfire were heard near the now-shut Goma airport.",
      "Goma is a regional trade and humanitarian hub holding hundreds of thousands of the more than 6 million people displaced by eastern Congo's prolonged conflict over ethnic tensions that have resulted in one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.",
      "The M23 rebels temporarily took over Goma in 2012 before being forced to pull out under international pressure, and resurfaced in late 2021 with increasing support from Rwanda, according to Congo\u2019s government and United Nations experts. Rwanda has denied such support.",
      "It was unclear how much of Goma is controlled by the rebels, who marched into the city early Monday to both fear and cheers among residents. It was the culmination of weeks of fighting during which the rebels captured several towns in a shocking advance.",
      "\u201cSince morning we have heard bomb explosions and crackling bullets,\u201d said Sam Luwawa, a resident of Goma. \u201cSo far we cannot say who really controls the city.\u201d",
      "Three South African peacekeepers were killed on Monday when the rebels launched a mortar bomb toward the Goma airport which landed on the nearby South African National Defense Force, while a fourth soldier succumbed to injuries sustained in fighting days ago, the South African Department of Defense said Tuesday.",
      "That makes 17 peacekeepers and foreign soldiers who have been killed in the fighting, according to U.N. and army officials.",
      "The humanitarian situation in Goma \u201cis extremely, extremely worrying, with a new threshold of violence and suffering reached today,\u201d Bruno Lemarquis, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Congo, told reporters in a video news conference on Monday. He said hundreds of thousands of people were attempting to flee the violence.",
      "There were active combat zones in all areas of the city, with civilians taking cover and heavy artillery fire directed at the city center on Monday, Lemarquis said. He said several shells struck the Charit\u00e9 Maternelle Hospital in central Goma, \u201ckilling and injuring civilians, including newborns and pregnant women.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat is unfolding in Goma is coming on top of what is already one of the most protracted, complex, serious humanitarian crises on Earth, with close to 6.5 million displaced people in the country, including close to 3 million displaced people in North Kivu,\u201d Lemarquis said.",
      "Aid groups are reporting they are unable to reach displaced people who rely on them for food and other necessities.",
      "\u201cKey roads surrounding Goma are blocked, and the city\u2019s airport can no longer be used for evacuation and humanitarian efforts. Power and water have reportedly been cut to many areas of the city,\u201d said David Munkley, head of operations in eastern Congo for the Christian aid group World Vision.",
      "In addition to the U.N., several countries including the United States, United Kingdom and France have condemned Rwanda for the rebel advance. The country, however, blames Congo for the escalation, saying it failed to honor past peace agreements, necessitating Rwanda's \"sustained defensive posture.\u201d",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the advance by the Rwanda-backed rebels in a call with Congo President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi on Monday during which both leaders agreed on the importance of advancing efforts to restart peace talks between Congo and Rwanda \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement.",

      "The theft of the helmet and three golden wristbands also on display sent shockwaves through the art world, and devastated Romanian authorities who thought they were loaning the items to a nation where security for museums was paramount.",
      "\u201cIt is a pitch dark day for us,\u201d museum director Harry Tupan said.",
      "Investigators had found few clues by late Monday beyond a burnt-out car close to the museum, indicating the thieves wanted to cover their tracks.",

      "The shooting came a day after 24 people were killed and more than 130 wounded when Israeli troops opened fire on protesters who breached roadblocks set up along the border.",
      "Under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire on Nov. 27, Israeli forces were to withdraw from southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah was to move north of the Litani River by Jan. 26. While the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers had already deployed in several villages before the deadline, Israel remained in over a dozen villages.",
      "The United States and Lebanon announced later on Sunday that the deadline to meet the ceasefire terms had been extended to Feb. 18.",
      "In a pre-recorded speech aired Monday, Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said his group won\u2019t accept the extension of the ceasefire deadline, without addressing the fact that the Lebanese government had already done so.",
      "\u201cIsrael has to withdraw because the 60 days are over,\u201d Kassem said. \u201cWe won\u2019t accept any excuses to extend one second or one day.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny delay in the withdrawal is the responsibility of the United Nations, the US, France and Israel,\u201d he added.",
      "Kassem also said his group has not violated the ceasefire terms and acknowledged that they considered retaliating against Israeli airstrikes but were advised by Lebanese authorities against it.",
      "Protests resumed Monday particularly in eastern border villages, where residents again attempted to return home. Israeli troops opened fire, killing one person in the town of Odaisseh and wounding seven others across four southern villages, the Health Ministry reported.",
      "The Israeli military has blamed Hezbollah for pushing people to protest and has said soldiers fired warning shots when demonstrators approached.",
      "In the village of Aitaroun, scores of unarmed residents, some waving Hezbollah flags, marched hand-in-hand or rode motorcycles, escorted by ambulances, bulldozers and Lebanese army tanks. They approached the edge of the town but stopped short of Israeli positions, unable to enter.",
      "\u201cWe are coming with our heads held high and crowned with victory to our village, Aitaroun,\u201d said Saleem Mrad, head of the municipality. \u201cOur village is ours, and we will bring it back more beautiful than it was before. We are staying.\u201d",
      "Hassan al-Ahmad, a Aitaroun resident, said, \u201cWe have to give our blood and our souls. If there had not been blood spilled, the land would not have been liberated.\u201d",
      "Lebanon\u2019s national news agency reported that Israel dropped a bomb at the entrance of the southern village of Yaroun to deter residents from proceeding farther.",
      "In the town of Bint Jbeil, Hezbollah members handed out flyers featuring slain leader Hassan Nasrallah with the words, \u201cVictory has arrived.\u201d Some residents waved Hezbollah flags.",
      "Israel blamed the Lebanese army for not deploying to the region fast enough, while the Lebanese military accused Israel of stalling its withdrawal, complicating its deployment efforts.",
      "Some family members who entered border villages Sunday discovered the bodies of their relatives. Israeli strikes have killed over 4,000 people during the war, but Lebanese authorities do not distinguish between fighters and civilians in their death toll.",
      "Since the ceasefire began, Israel has conducted near-daily operations such as house demolitions, shelling and airstrikes in southern Lebanon, accusing Hezbollah of violating ceasefire terms by attempting to move weapons. Lebanon in turn has accused Israel of hundreds of ceasefire violations.",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014-",
      "Associated Press journalist Bilal Hussein in Aitaroun, Lebanon, contributed to this report."

      "Spain attracted a record/whopping 94 million tourists last year, making the Southern European nation famous for its Mediterranean coastline and historic sites one of the most visited countries on earth",
      "MADRID -- Spain attracted a record 94 million tourists last year, making the Southern European nation famous for its Mediterranean coastline, sweeping landscapes and historic cities among the most visited countries on earth.",
      "The surge in visitors has stoked complaints at times from some Spaniards about \u201covertourism, \u201d with concerns about overcrowding, water use and particularly the availability and affordability of housing.",
      "Spain's government has started listening to demands for more regulation, particularly around housing in Spain's big cities, where rising home and rental prices have become a key concern for voters. Earlier this month, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez introduced a 12-part plan to tackle the housing crisis, with measures aimed at bringing stricter regulations to short-term rentals that mainly cater to tourists.",
      "But that doesn't mean Spain is putting the brakes on tourism, an industry that accounts for about 12% of its GDP.",
      "Here's what you should know before planning a visit:",
      "No, but some cities have started to regulate tourism rental properties.",
      "Malaga, an Andalusian port city on the southern Mediterranean coast of Spain, will prohibit new rental properties in 43 neighborhoods of the city where those rentals exceed 8% of the residential stock. The policy went into effect earlier this month and will be tested for three years.",
      "Meanwhile, Barcelona plans to close down all of its 10,000 apartments licensed as short-term rentals in the coming years to safeguard the housing supply for full-time residents. The Mediterranean city known for its beaches, art and surrealist architecture announced last year that it would not renew any new tourism apartment licenses after they expire in 2028.",
      "Yes. Tourists can book hotel stays and short-term apartment-style rentals just about anywhere in Spain.",
      "Spain is in the throes of a growing housing affordability problem. Skyrocketing rents are particularly acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where incomes have failed to keep up, especially for young people. Housing prices are also steadily rising, especially in cities and coastal areas.",
      "Short-term contracts mainly offered for tourists are seen as driving up rental costs for locals, too.",
      "Visitors renting a car in Spain or booking hotel stays will also have to file more paperwork thanks to a new law that requires hotel owners and car rental companies to send personal information to the government for national security reasons.",
      "Passport details, home addresses and payment information used by travelers above 14 are among the details that will be collected.",

      "Serbian farmers on tractors and thousands of citizens joined the blockade that followed weeks of protests demanding accountability of the deadly accident in the northern city of Novi Sad that critics have blamed on rampant government corruption.",
      "A campaign of street demonstrations has posed the biggest challenge in years to the populist government's firm grip on power in Serbia.",
      "Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, at a joint press conference with Prime Minister Milos Vucevic and Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabic, later on Monday urged dialogue with the students, saying that \u201cwe need to lower the tensions and start talking to each other.\u201d",

      "Vucic has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms despite formally seeking European Union membership for Serbia. He has accused the students of working for unspecified foreign powers to oust the government.",
      "Several incidents have marked the street demonstrations in the past weeks, including drivers ramming into the crowds on two occasions, when two young women were injured.",
      "Traffic police on Monday secured the student blockade to help avoid any similar incidents. Protesting students set up tents at the protest site, which is a key artery for the city commuters and toward the main north-south motorway.",
      "Some students played volleyball, others sat down on blankets on the pavement or walked around on a warm day. The students also held a daily 15-minute commemoration silence at 11.52, the exact same time when the canopy at a train station in Novi Sad crashed down on Nov. 1.",
      "Many in Serbia believe the huge concrete canopy fell down because of sloppy reconstruction work that resulted from corruption.",

      "The impeached, jailed president, who had been holed up in his presidential compound for weeks after issuing a shocking martial law decree last month, now faces rebellion charges that are punishable by the death penalty or life in prison.",
      "It's part of a tortuous saga that has plunged South Korea into political turmoil and further riven an already divided society.",
      "And it's not the only legal headache Yoon faces. A separate proceeding will determine whether to formally dismiss Yoon as president or reinstate him.",

      "Meanwhile, rival protests look likely to continue in downtown Seoul.",
      "After a local court on Jan. 19 approved a formal arrest warrant to extend Yoon\u2019s detention, dozens of his supporters stormed the court building, destroying windows, doors and other property. They also attacked police officers with bricks, steel pipes and other objects. The violence left 17 police officers injured, and police detained 46 protesters.",
      "Yoon also has to worry about the Constitutional Court, which has until June to determine whether to formally dismiss or reinstate him as president.",
      "Observers expect a ruling to come sooner than the deadline.",
      "In the cases of two past impeached presidents, Roh Moo-hyun in 2004 and Park Geun-hye in 2016, the court spent 63 days and 91 days respectively before determining to reinstate Roh and dismiss Park.",

      "\u201cHaute couture is fashion when it becomes art,\u201d Armani said, describing the ethos behind Priv\u00e9, the line he launched in January 2005. The name itself evokes rarity and exclusivity, serving as a platform for showcasing meticulous craft and timeless design, the house said.",

Yet, this sense of continuity only heightened the timeless quality of the designs, reminding the audience why Priv\u00e9 remains a key part of the haute couture calendar.",
      "The emotional highlight of the evening came at the finale when Giorgio Armani himself emerged to take his bow. Slowly walking the runway, the nonagenarian designer received a standing ovation from some in the audience, many of whom were visibly emotional by the moment."

      "The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature has asked that a liberal state Supreme Court justice step aside in a pending case that seeks to overturn a 2011 law that effectively ended collective bargaining for most state workers",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature on Tuesday asked that a liberal state Supreme Court justice step aside in a pending case that seeks to overturn a 2011 law that effectively ended collective bargaining for most state workers.",
      "If Justice Janet Protasiewicz agrees not to hear the case, the court would be deadlocked 3-3 between liberals and conservatives. The lawsuit has massive implications for union rights in the battleground state, the court would be deadlocked 3-3 between liberals and conservatives.",
      "A Dane County Circuit judge last month overturned the bulk of the law, saying it violates equal protection guarantees in the Wisconsin Constitution by dividing public employees into \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cpublic safety\u201d employees. Under the ruling, all public sector workers who lost their collective bargaining power would have it restored to what was in place before 2011.",
      "The judge put the ruling on hold pending the appeal. School workers unions that brought the lawsuit have asked the Supreme Court to take it directly, skipping the appeals court. The Wisconsin Supreme Court, controlled 4-3 by liberals, has not yet decided whether to take the case.",
      "Republicans enacted the law in the face of massive protests 14 years ago that made Wisconsin the center of the national fight over union rights. The debate also catapulted then-Gov. Scott Walker onto the national stage, sparked an unsuccessful recall campaign and laid the groundwork for his failed 2016 presidential bid. The law\u2019s adoption led to a dramatic decrease in union membership across the state.",
      "Protasiewicz is the court's newest member and ran in 2023 as an opponent of the union law, known as Act 10. Her victory gave liberals the majority on the court for the first time in 15 years. That majority is on the line again in the April 1 Supreme Court election to fill the seat of a retiring liberal justice.",
      "Protasiewicz said during the campaign that she believes Act 10 is unconstitutional. She also told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that she would consider recusing herself from any case challenging the law. Protasiewicz participated in protests against it and signed the petition to recall Walker.",
      "The Legislature's top Republicans, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, said Tuesday that it would be \u201cright and ethical\u201d for her to step aside.",
      "Protasiewicz did not return an email from The Associated Press asking if she would recuse herself, a decision that is entirely hers.",
      "She is not the only justice on the court with a potential conflict.",
      "Conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn was Walker\u2019s chief legal counsel and had a role in drafting Act 10. During his successful run for the court in 2015, Hagedorn would not promise to recuse himself if a case challenging Act 10 came before the court.",
      "No request has been filed for Hagedorn to step aside.",
      "If both Protasiewicz and Hagedorn recused themselves, liberals would have a 3-2 advantage.",
      "The attorney for the unions that brought the lawsuit did not immediately return a message seeking comment.",
      "Supporters of the law have said it provided local governments more control over workers and the powers they needed to cut costs. Repealing the law, which allowed schools and local governments to raise money through higher employee contributions for benefits, would bankrupt those entities, backers of Act 10 have argued.",
      "Democratic opponents argue that the law has hurt schools and other government agencies by taking away the ability of employees to collectively bargain for their pay and working conditions."

      "WASHINGTON -- Boeing posted a fourth-quarter loss of $3.8 billion on Tuesday as a machinists strike and other problems continued to plague the troubled aircraft manufacturer.",
      "Boeing has lost more than $35 billion since 2019 following the crashes of two then-new Max jets that killed 346 people. For the full year 2024, Boeing logged a loss of $11.8 billion.",
      "The numbers Boeing released are in line with what the company pre-reported last week, including nearly $3 billion worth of charges in the period due to the labor stoppage, job cuts and problems with a number of government programs.",
      "Boeing's loss per share was $5.46 per share, well above the $3.08 loss that Wall Street analysts expected, according to the data firm FactSet.",
      "The fourth quarter caps a rough year for Boeing. A strike by the machinists who assemble the best-selling 737 Max, along with the 777 jet and the 767 cargo plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington, halted production at those facilities and hampered Boeing\u2019s delivery capability.",
      "The walkout ended after more than seven weeks when the company agreed to pay raises and improved benefits.",
      "The company reiterated much of what it reported in last week's release, including that it took charges totaling $1.1 billion related to the 777 and 767 programs in the fourth quarter. Boeing took an additional $1.7 billion in charges related to a number of government programs including a military refueling tanker and Air Force One replacement jets.",
      "Boeing said revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $15.2 billion, below analysts\u2019 updated estimate of $15.7 billion, according to FactSet. Full-year revenue came in at $66.5 billion, a 14$ decline from 2023.",
      "As it also reported earlier this month, Boeing said it supplied 348 jetliners last year, more than a third fewer than the 528 the company finished for airlines and leasing outfits in 2023 and less than half the number of jetliners that Airbus delivered last year.",
      "Deliveries are an important source of cash for plane manufacturers since buyers typically pay a large portion of the purchase price when their orders are fulfilled.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has already forced Colombia to accept deportees by threatening tariffs and is readying the same move against Canada and Mexico as soon as Saturday",
      "WASHINGTON -- Having already forced Colombia to accept deportees by threatening a 25% tariff, President Donald Trump is readying the same move against Canada and Mexico as soon as Saturday.",
      "But this time, the stakes are higher and many economists surveying the possible damage doubt Trump would be comfortable with what they say would be self-inflicted wounds from the tariffs.",
      "\u201cThe potential for such sizable economic impacts ought to act as enough of a deterrent that Trump will not end up implementing these higher tariffs,\u201d said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics.",
      "Trump has repeatedly insisted that tariffs are coming on Canada and Mexico, despite both countries seeking to address his stated concerns about illegal border crossings and the smuggling of fentanyl. But the Republican president is also motivated by the idea that tariffs would force other countries to \u201crespect\u201d the United States.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to immediately install massive tariffs,\" Trump said in a Monday speech, adding, \u201cColombia is traditionally a very, very strong-willed country,\u201d but it backed down rather than face import taxes.",
      "Multiple economic analyses show that universal tariffs against Canada and Mexico risk more inflation and an economic slowdown. It's a much larger play than Trump's moves against Colombia, which accounts for roughly 0.5% of U.S. imports. By contrast, nearly 30% of all U.S. imports hail from Canada and Mexico, amplifying the risk that tariffs could fuel inflation and undermine Trump's campaign promises to get prices under control.",
      "Trump's director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, dismissed these concerns. He said the skeptical analyses of tariffs don't look at the totality of Trump's promises.",
      "\u201cWhen the people who are trying to cause panic over President Trump\u2019s trade policy simulate what it\u2019s going to do, they don\u2019t account for all the other policies,\u201d Hassett said in a Monday interview on the Fox Business Network. \u201cSo President Trump is drill, baby, drill, and deregulate and tax cuts and reduce spending.\u201d",
      "After Trump\u2019s initial threat of 25% tariffs in November, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own. Since then, she has been more measured, choosing to emphasize the strong bilateral relationship and willingness to engage in dialogue as the number of detentions at the U.S.-Mexico border has plunged.",
      "Sheinbaum pointed out in November that drugs were a U.S. problem, but in December the Mexican military seized more than a ton of fentanyl pills in two raids, calling it the biggest catch of synthetic opioids in Mexico\u2019s history.",
      "On Monday, Sheinbaum applauded the agreement reached by the Trump administration and Colombia.",
      "\u201cI believe the important thing, as I said on the first day, is to always act with a cool head, defending each country\u2019s sovereignty and the respect among nations and peoples,\u201d she said.",
      "Top Canadian ministers said last week that Canada was prepared to retaliate if Trump imposed import taxes, even as Canadian Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said they \u201cwill continue to work on preventing tariffs.\u201d The working theory in Canada appears to involve being ready for anything that the U.S. president might do.",
      "On Monday, the economics division of the insurance company Nationwide estimated that Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico would increase inflation by as much as 0.5 percentage points and pull down growth by 0.7 percentage points.",
      "The analysis noted it did not \u201caccount for potential retaliatory tariffs from Canada or Mexico, which could amplify the deleterious impact on inflation and GDP growth.\u201d",
      "Trump has made lower gasoline prices one of his key strategies for tackling inflation, but tariffs on Canada could drive up prices at the pump unless Trump creates carveouts in his plan.",
      "\u201cFor example, 60% of oil and gas imports come from Canada,\" said Oxford Economics' Martin. \"A 25% tariff would lead to higher gasoline, diesel, and petroleum product prices for households and firms, especially in the Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions, where refineries are connected to Canada by pipeline.\u201d",
      "The tax services firm PwC looked at the possible impact of 25% tariffs and found that companies importing from Canada could have to pay $106 billion more annually in import taxes and those importing from Mexico could owe $131 billion more.",
      "\u201cWhen we think about hardest-hit industries, we think about transportation and automotive,\u201d said Chris Desmond, a principal at PwC's international trade practice. \u201cThe amount of companies that have operations in Mexico and Canada in that industry with components and parts as well, including even airplanes, that\u2019s going to be a huge hit.\u201d",
      "Desmond estimates that taxes paid on imports in the transportation sector from all of Trump's tariff plans, which include new taxes on China and other countries, could increase from $4 billion a year to $68 billion. It's unclear how companies would absorb those costs or possibly pass them along to consumers.",
      "None of those analyses is at the forefront of Trump's public thoughts. His argument is that tariffs would make the U.S. wealthy by sheltering it from competition and safer because they could be tools to force other countries to reduce illegal immigration.",
      "\u201cTariffs, I told you, most beautiful word in the dictionary,\u201d Trump said Monday as he recalled his campaign speeches praising the import taxes. He reminisced in that speech how he was criticized for praising the term, prompting him to conclude that tariff is, in fact, the fourth most beautiful word after \u201cGod, love, religion.\u201d"

That\u2019s not the center of commerce for the SBA\u2019s usual clientele. The agency was founded in 1953 and describes itself as \u201cthe only cabinet-level federal agency fully dedicated to small business\u201d by providing \u201ccounseling, capital, and contracting expertise as the nation\u2019s only go-to resource and voice for small businesses.\u201d",
      "As a senator, Loeffler faced ethics complaints over alleged insider trading tied to stock trades she and her husband made as members of Congress first started receiving briefings related to the coronavirus pandemic. The trades occurred weeks before the pandemic caused markets to plummet. Justice Department and Senate inquiries later found no wrongdoing on Loeffler\u2019s part.",
      "Isaacman, another financial services billionaire, was the first wealthy individual to take a space walk through Musk\u2019s company, SpaceX. This choice, as much as any, illustrates Trump\u2019s lean to the wealthy private sector, given that billionaires like Musk and Amazon chief Jeff Bezos are now competing in a space sector that was once the province of the federal government and the agency that Isaacman would lead as NASA administrator."

      "TOKYO -- Asian shares were mixed in thin Lunar New Year trading on Tuesday after Wall Street\u2019s tech superstars tumbled as a competitor from China raised doubts over the recent artificial-intelligence market frenzy.",
      "Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 1.5% to 38,959.05. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was little changed, inching down 0.1% to 8,399.10. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.1% to 20,225.11. Markets in South Korea, Shanghai markets and other parts of the region were closed for holidays.",

      "Fuji Media Holdings, rocked by a sex scandal, rose 1% after a marathon news conference overnight by its top executives that lasted more than 10 hours, in which two of them resigned to take responsibility for the scandal. Fuji's stock price has zigzagged in recent months amid Japanese magazine reports about \u201ca problem\u201d involving an anchorwoman and a Japanese male star. He has subsequently announced his retirement.",
      "On Monday, the S&P 500 dropped 1.5% to 6,012.28, dragged down in large part by a 16.9% fall for Nvidia. Other Big Tech stocks also took heavy losses, pulling the Nasdaq composite down 3.1% to 19,341.83 for its worst loss in more than a month.",
      "The damage was focused on AI-related stocks, while the rest of the market held up much better. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% to 44,713.58, and the majority of U.S. stocks climbed. But anyone holding an S&P 500 index fund, which are found in many 401(k) accounts, felt the pain because of how influential those tech giants have become on indexes.",
      "The shock to financial markets came from China, where an AI company called DeepSeek unveiled a large language model that can compete with U.S. giants but at potentially a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek had already hit the top of the chart for free apps on Apple\u2019s App Store by Monday morning, and analysts said such a feat was particularly impressive given how the U.S. government has restricted Chinese access to top AI chips.",
      "It's unclear, however, how much DeepSeek\u2019s announcement will ultimately shake the economy that\u2019s built around the AI industry, from the chip makers making semiconductors to the utilities hoping to electrify vast data centers gobbling up computing power.",
      "\u201cIt remains to be seen if DeepSeek found a way to work around these chip restrictions rules and what chips they ultimately used as there will be many skeptics around this issue given the information is coming from China,\u201d according to Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s disruption nevertheless rocked AI-related stocks worldwide.",
      "It\u2019s a sharp turnaround for the AI winners, which had soared in recent years on hopes that all the investment pouring in would remake the global economy and deliver gargantuan profits along the way. Such stellar performances also raised criticism that their stock prices had gone too far, too fast.",
      "Before Monday\u2019s drop, which was its worst since the 2020 COVID crash, Nvidia\u2019s stock had soared from less than $20 to more than $140 in less than two years, for example.",
      "A small group of seven such companies has become so dominant that they alone accounted for more than half the S&P 500\u2019s total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. They include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.",
      "Their immense sizes give them huge sway over the S&P 500 and other indexes that give more weight to bigger companies.",

      "It looks like grocery shoppers hoping for soaring egg prices to turn around are likely to be waiting a while",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Bird flu is forcing farmers to slaughter millions of chickens a month, pushing U.S. egg prices to more than double their cost in the summer of 2023. And it appears there may be no relief in sight, given the surge in demand as Easter approaches.",
      "The average price per dozen nationwide hit $4.15 in December. That's not quite as high as the $4.82 record set two years ago, but the Agriculture Department predicts prices are going to soar another 20% this year.",
      "Shoppers in some parts of the country are already paying more than double the average price, or worse, finding empty shelves in their local grocery stores. Organic and cage-free varieties are even more expensive.",
      "Some grocery stores have even limited how many eggs shoppers can buy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just robbery,\u201d said Minneapolis resident Sage Mills, who bought eggs to bake a birthday cake last week. \u201cEggs used to be kind of a staple food for us, but now you know, you might as well just go out to eat.\"",
      "The bird flu outbreak that started in 2022 is the main reason egg prices are up so much.",
      "Anytime the virus is found on a poultry farm, the entire flock is slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. And with massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can cause a supply crunch.",
      "The problem tends to linger because it takes months to dispose of all the carcasses, disinfect barns and bring in new birds.",
      "More than 145 million chickens, turkeys and other birds have been slaughtered since the current outbreak began, with the vast majority of them being egg-laying chickens.",
      "Cage-free egg laws in 10 states may also be responsible for some supply disruptions and price increases. The laws set minimum space for chickens or cage-free requirements for egg-laying hens. They\u2019ve already gone into effect in California, Massachusetts, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Michigan. At a Target in Chicago on Monday, a dozen large conventional eggs cost $4.49 but a dozen large cage-free eggs were selling for $6.19.",
      "Bird flu is primarily spread by wild birds such as ducks and geese as they migrate. While it is fatal to a variety of animals, those species can generally carry it without getting sick, which offers the virus a chance to mutate and thrive.",
      "The virus can be spread through droppings or any interaction between farm-raised poultry and wild birds. It's also easily tracked into a farm on someone's boots or by vehicle.",
      "Unlike previous outbreaks, the one that began in 2022 didn't die out in high summer temperatures.",
      "The virus found another new host when dairy cattle started getting sick last March. That creates more opportunities for the virus to linger and spread and unlike poultry, cattle aren\u2019t slaughtered when they get sick because they rarely die from bird flu.",
      "More than five dozen people have also become ill with bird flu and one person died since last March. Nearly all of them worked around sick animals. Health officials haven\u2019t yet found evidence of the disease spreading from person to person.",
      "Farmers go to great lengths to protect their flocks.",
      "Many poultry farms installed truck washes to disinfect vehicles entering their property and require workers to shower and change clothes before stepping inside a barn. They have also invested in duplicate sets of tools so nothing used in one barn is shared.",
      "Some poultry farmers have even invested in lasers that shoot beams of green light in random patterns to discourage ducks and geese from landing.",
      "Dairy farmers isolate any sick cattle and do additional testing before moving animals off the farm \u2014 especially if there has been a nearby outbreak or if the cows are being sent to a meat processing plant. The government is also testing milk.",
      "Future vaccines might help, but it's not practical to vaccinate millions of chickens through shots, and other countries might refuse to purchase meat from vaccinated birds.",
      "Health officials emphasize that any sick birds or cattle are kept out of the food supply. Cooking meat to 165 degrees (74 Celsius) kills bird flu, E. coli, salmonella or anything else. Pasteurization also kills the virus in milk. Raw milk is the only food product linked to illnesses so far.",
      "It is impossible to know how much farmers have spent to seal barns, build shower houses for workers or to adopt other biosecurity measures.",
      "\u201cOver the last five years, my small farm alone has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on biosecurity,\u201d said Minnesota turkey farmer Loren Brey. \u201cBut not only that, it's the time daily that you're attending to biosecurity.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has spent at least $1.14 billion compensating farmers for the birds they have had to kill. A similar number wasn't immediately available for how much has been spent to aid dairies.",
      "USDA spokeswoman Shilo Weir said the department also spent more than $576 million on its own response.",
      "The prices of turkey, milk and chicken have also seen some pressure from bird flu.",
      "Mike Vickers, a manager at Sentyrz Liquor & Supermarket in Minneapolis, said he can\u2019t even stock any organic, cage-free or brown eggs right now and is limited instead to selling large or jumbo eggs. He understands the pain customers are feeling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in my life that I\u2019ve ever had to be kind of embarrassed on what I'm selling eggs for,\" he said. \"And it\u2019s not our fault. We\u2019re paying today $7.45 for a dozen eggs. We\u2019re selling for $7.59. We\u2019re making $0.14. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t pay the bills.\u201d",

      "A frenzy over an artificial intelligence chatbot made by Chinese tech startup DeepSeek was upending stock markets Monday and fueling debates over the economic and geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China in developing AI technology.",
      "DeepSeek's AI assistant became the No. 1 downloaded free app on Apple's iPhone store Monday, propelled by curiosity about the ChatGPT competitor. Part of what's worrying some U.S. tech industry observers is the idea that the Chinese startup has caught up with the American companies at the forefront of generative AI at a fraction of the cost.",
      "That, if true, calls into question the huge amounts of money U.S. tech companies say they plan to spend on the data centers and computer chips needed to power further AI advancements.",
      "But hype and misconceptions about DeepSeek's technological advancements also sowed confusion.",
      "\"The models they built are fantastic, but they aren't miracles either,\" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, who follows the semiconductor industry and was one of several stock analysts describing Wall Street's reaction as overblown.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not using any innovations that are unknown or secret or anything like that,\" Rasgon said. \"These are things that everybody\u2019s experimenting with.\u201d",
      "The startup DeepSeek was founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China and released its first AI large language model later that year. Its CEO Liang Wenfeng previously co-founded one of China's top hedge funds, High-Flyer, which focuses on AI-driven quantitative trading. The fund, by 2022, had amassed a cluster of 10,000 of California-based Nvidia's high-performance A100 graphics processor chips that are used to build and run AI systems, according to a post that summer on Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. soon after restricted sales of those chips to China.",
      "DeepSeek has said its recent models were built with Nvidia\u2019s lower-performing H800 chips, which are not banned in China, sending a message that the fanciest hardware might not be needed for cutting-edge AI research.",
      "DeepSeek began attracting more attention in the AI industry last month when it released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and was more cost-effective in its use of expensive Nvidia chips to train the system on troves of data. The chatbot became more widely accessible when it appeared on Apple and Google app stores early this year.",
      "But it was a follow-up research paper published last week \u2014 on the same day as President Donald Trump's inauguration \u2014 that set in motion the panic that followed. That paper was about another DeepSeek AI model called R1 that showed advanced \u201creasoning\u201d skills \u2014 such as the ability to rethink its approach to a math problem \u2014 and was significantly cheaper than a similar model sold by OpenAI called o1.",
      "\u201cWhat their economics look like, I have no idea,\u201d Rasgon said. \u201cBut I think the price points freaked people out.\u201d",
      "Behind the drama over DeepSeek's technical capabilities is a debate within the U.S. over how best to compete with China on AI.",
      "\u201cDeepseek R1 is AI\u2019s Sputnik moment,\u201d said venture capitalist Marc Andreessen in a Sunday post on social platform X, referencing the 1957 satellite launch that set off a Cold War space exploration race between the Soviet Union and the U.S.",
      "Andreessen, who has advised Trump on tech policy, has warned that overregulation of the AI industry by the U.S. government will hinder American companies and enable China to get ahead.",
      "But the attention on DeepSeek also threatens to undermine a key strategy of U.S. foreign policy in recent years to restrict the sale of American-designed AI semiconductors to China. Some experts on U.S.-China relations don't think that is an accident.",
      "\u201cThe technology innovation is real, but the timing of the release is political in nature,\u201d said Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Allen compared DeepSeek's announcement last week to U.S.-sanctioned Chinese company Huawei's release of a new phone during diplomatic discussions over Biden administration export controls in 2023.",
      "\u201cTrying to show that the export controls are futile or counterproductive is a really important goal of Chinese foreign policy right now,\u201d Allen said.",
      "Trump signed an order on his first day in office last week that said his administration would \u201cidentify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls,\u201d signaling that he is likely to continue and harden Biden's approach.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s stock dropped 17% Monday, but the company in a statement commended DeepSeek\u2019s work as \u201can excellent AI advancement\u201d that leveraged \u201cwidely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.\u201d",
      "One thing that distinguishes DeepSeek from competitors such as OpenAI is that its models are \u201copen source\u201d \u2014 meaning key components are free for anyone to access and modify, though the company hasn\u2019t disclosed the data it used for training.",
      "But what's attracted the most admiration about DeepSeek's R1 model is what Nvidia calls a \"perfect example of Test Time Scaling\" \u2014 or when AI models effectively show their train of thought, and then use that for further training without having to feed them new sources of data.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just thinking out loud, basically,\u201d said Lennart Heim, a researcher at Rand Corp.",
      "OpenAI's reasoning models, starting with o1, do the same, and it's likely that other U.S.-based competitors such as Anthropic and Google have similar capabilities that haven't been released, Heim said.",
      "But \u201cit\u2019s the first time that we see a Chinese company being that close within a relatively short time period. I think that\u2019s why a lot of people pay attention to it,\u201d Heim said. \u201cI used to believe OpenAI was the leader, the king of the hill, and that nobody could catch up. Turns out this is not completely the case.\u201d"

      "Spain's government has started listening to demands for more regulation, particularly around housing in Spain's big cities, where rising home and rental prices have become a key concern for voters. Earlier this month, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez introduced a 12-part plan to tackle the housing crisis, with measures aimed at bringing stricter regulations to short-term rentals that mainly cater to tourists.",

      "Malaga, an Andalusian port city on the southern Mediterranean coast of Spain, will prohibit new rental properties in 43 neighborhoods of the city where those rentals exceed 8% of the residential stock. The policy went into effect earlier this month and will be tested for three years.",
      "Meanwhile, Barcelona plans to close down all of its 10,000 apartments licensed as short-term rentals in the coming years to safeguard the housing supply for full-time residents. The Mediterranean city known for its beaches, art and surrealist architecture announced last year that it would not renew any new tourism apartment licenses after they expire in 2028.",
      "Yes. Tourists can book hotel stays and short-term apartment-style rentals just about anywhere in Spain.",
      "Spain is in the throes of a growing housing affordability problem. Skyrocketing rents are particularly acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where incomes have failed to keep up, especially for young people. Housing prices are also steadily rising, especially in cities and coastal areas.",
      "Short-term contracts mainly offered for tourists are seen as driving up rental costs for locals, too.",
      "Visitors renting a car in Spain or booking hotel stays will also have to file more paperwork thanks to a new law that requires hotel owners and car rental companies to send personal information to the government for national security reasons.",

      "On Friday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n called on the EU to intervene in a gas dispute that his country has with Ukraine.

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is nearly certain to keep its key interest rate unchanged at its policy meeting this week, just a few days after President Donald Trump said he would soon demand lower rates",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is nearly certain to keep its key interest rate unchanged at its policy meeting this week, just a few days after President Donald Trump said he would soon demand lower rates",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is nearly certain to keep its key interest rate unchanged at its policy meeting this week, just a few days after President Donald Trump said he would soon demand lower rates.",
      "Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, have cut their rate for three meetings in a row, to about 4.3%, from a two-decade high of 5.3%. Yet with several recent economic reports showing healthy hiring and some progress on inflation, policymakers have said that the pace of rate cuts will slow this year. Some have suggested that few reductions are needed at all.",
      "While the two-day meeting that ends Wednesday may be uneventful, it nevertheless kicks off what is likely to be a turbulent year for the Fed. Trump, last Thursday, made clear he expects to comment on interest-rate policy and said, \u201cI know interest rates much better than they do.\"",
      "At the same time, Fed officials are also navigating a delicate period for the economy: They want to keep borrowing costs high enough to push inflation back to their 2% target, without keeping them too high for too long and plunging the economy into a recession.",
      "The last time he was in the White House, Trump threatened to fire Powell, whom he appointed in late 2017, but he has more recently backed off such threats. Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026, when Trump can name a replacement.",
      "Until then, Trump's comments Thursday suggest he expects to regularly second-guess the Fed in public, despite a decades-long tradition among previous presidents of taking a hands-off approach to the central bank. Former president Joe Biden reappointed Powell, rather than replacing him, in a nod to central bank independence from politics.",
      "Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Investments and a former top economist at the Fed, said Powell won't let Trump's attacks affect his policy decisions.",
      "\u201cIf you like your independence, then you got to live with criticism,\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cIf it\u2019s all talk, it\u2019s not a particular concern to the Fed. I think Chair Powell understands that\u2019s the rules of the game.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Fed officials have clearly signaled they expect to skip a rate hike, at least in January, to evaluate the job market and economy.",
      "\u201cIn January, we kind of need to see what\u2019s going to happen,\" Fed governor Christopher Waller said earlier this month in an interview on CNBC. Fed officials \u201cneed to see a little more progress on inflation,\u201d he added, though he also said it is getting \u201cvery close\u201d to their target.",
      "Annual inflation was just 2.4% in November, according to the Fed's preferred gauge, only modestly above its goal, but it has been stuck there for about six months. Still, there are signs that prices should cool later this year. A spurt of apartment construction is bringing down the growth in rental costs, and car insurance inflation has also slowed.",
      "Some officials, including Beth Hammack, president of the Fed\u2019s Cleveland branch, have argued that the persistence of inflation means the Fed should keep its key rate elevated. Hammack voted against the Fed\u2019s quarter-point cut last month.",
      "Hiring rebounded in December, reversing a downshift in the fall that had unnerved the Fed. Policymakers had agreed to cut the Fed's key rate by a half-point in September, partly because they worried that a then-weakening job market could lead to a recession. Yet the jobless rate ticked down to a low 4.1% last month. A sharp slowdown in hiring would likely spur the Fed to cut rates more quickly.",
      "Fed officials in December signaled that they expected to reduce rates just twice this year. But the 19-member committee that makes interest rate decisions is clearly divided. Some officials, such as Waller and Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, expect inflation to keep cooling and argue that the Fed's rate doesn't need to be so high.",
      "Others, such as Hammack and Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Kansas City branch, say that with inflation still above target and the economy healthy, there is no need to reduce borrowing costs, or at least not by much.",
      "A big unknown for the Fed this year is whether Trump will impose tariffs, how sweeping they will be, and whether they will push up prices. Mass deportation of immigrants could also force employers to pay more for workers to fill jobs, which could also lift inflation.",
      "Most economists forecast that widepread tariffs will likely lift inflation by roughly several-tenths of a percentage point \u2014 not a large amount, but potentially enough for the Fed to postpone rate cuts. It could take months for the tariffs to be formally imposed and then to evaluate their impact on the economy. Some economists don't think the impact will be apparent until next year.",
      "Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and a potential candidate to replace Powell, argued in a recent column in the Wall Street Journal that Trump's promises to reduce regulation could push in the other direction, by reducing costs for businesses, and bring down inflation."

    "story": [
      "The Japanese network Fuji Television and its parent company say its president and chairperson are resigning immediately to take responsibility for a widening sex assault scandal linked to one of Japan\u2019s top TV celebrities",
      "TOKYO -- The Japanese network Fuji Television and its parent company said Monday that its president and chairperson were resigning immediately to take responsibility for a widening sex assault scandal linked to one of Japan's top TV celebrities.",
      "The scandal centers on Masahiro Nakai, a former leader of Japan\u2019s once-hugely popular boy band SMAP, and his costly settlement with a woman over the alleged sex assault at a 2023 dinner party that Fuji TV staff allegedly helped to organize.",
      "The allegations surfaced in magazine articles in December and have since triggered claims of systematic cover-ups by Fuji TV executives. The public outrage over the lack of transparency and explanation at the network's earlier news conference this month have led to an avalanche of advertising losses at Fuji, one of the networks where Nakai worked.",
      "Fuji Television Network President Koichi Minato said his company mishandled the case.",
      "\u201cWe are very sorry that we mishandled the case because of our lack of awareness about human rights and corporate governance ... and as a result our responses to the involved woman were inadequate,\u201d Minato said. \u201cWe are very sorry to have destroyed our credibility.\u201d",
      "Minato said the case violated the woman's human rights, without providing details on grounds of privacy. He said it was handled as an \u201cextraordinary\u201d case requiring maximum confidentiality and sensitivity for the woman's mental health and was shared by a small group of officials. The company had continued allowing Nakai to appear on Fuji shows for a year and six months, he said, but denied covering up the case because it involved a big star.",
      "Minato said he did not think what happened was sexual assault and that the case was not reported to the company\u2019s compliance office until the magazine report came out",
      "He also denied a Fuji TV employee\u2019s involvement but said allegations that the employee had previously organized barbecue and other parties for Nakai needed to be investigated.",
      "Fuji officials also acknowledged that female announcers and other female employees have in the past participated at parties for stars, talent agency executives and sponsors, though they denied any sexual services. Minato said he believed top officials were complacent about the outdated gender roles and they now need to \u201cupdate their mindset.\u201d",
      "Nakai last Thursday announced his retirement from the show business, which has already been hit by a series of sexual assault allegations in recent years in what is seen as a delayed #MeToo movement that began in Western nations in the 2010s. He said he was taking responsibility for the \u201ctrouble\u201d and massive business losses as a result. He had earlier denied any violence or involvement of a third party.",
      "Minato said he last saw the victim last summer when she visited his office to tell him she was quitting.",
      "Shukan Bunshun weekly, one of the magazines that exposed the scandal, also alleged that Fuji TV has long exploited its female announcers to entertain stars like Nakai.",
      "The chair of the companies, Shuji Kanoh, was also resigning in a decision made at a board meeting prior to the news conference, officials said.",
      "Japan\u2019s entertainment industry is in the midst of a wave of sexual assault cases, including the abuses of hundreds of boys and young men by late talent mogul Johnny Kitagawa, whose now-defunct agency Johnny & Associates managed many boy bands, including the one to which Nakai belonged, SMAP.",
      "Following massive protests and criticism from even their own employees, Fuji TV and its parent company announced after a board meeting last week that they have set up an independent panel of lawyers to be submitted by March."

      "An official survey shows that China\u2019s factory activity contracted in January for the first time in four months",
      "HONG KONG -- Manufacturing slowed in China in January for the first time in four months as workers began leaving assembly lines to travel to their hometowns for Lunar New Year holidays.",
      "The National Bureau of Statistics said its purchasing managers index, based on a survey of factory managers, slipped to 49.1 in January from 50.1 the month before. A PMI reading above 50 indicates expansion. Under 50 signals a contraction in activity.",

      "Skyscraper-studded Dubai has been on a hot streak for the last five years \u2014 and some are starting to get burned",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Skyscraper-studded Dubai has been on a hot streak for the last five years \u2014 and some residents are starting to feel burned.",
      "The city-state has seen record-breaking real estate transactions and as more and more people come to live there, and its state-owned airline Emirates is booking record earnings. But all that growth comes with strains for the city's population.",
      "Traffic feels worse than ever on Dubai's roads. The price of housing continues to spike even with new real estate projects being announced almost daily. Caught in the middle are both its Emirati citizens and the vast population of foreigners who power its economy \u2014 sparking rare public expressions of concern.",
      "\u201cDubai is on steroids but affordability risks are increasing,\u201d warned Hasnain Malik in a starkly titled report he wrote for the global data firm Tellimer, where he's a managing director.",
      "Under Dubai's current plans, the city aims to have 5.8 million residents by 2040, adding more than half its current estimated population in just 15 years. Since 1980, its population has already soared from around 255,000 to around 3.8 million.",
      "Real estate lit the fire in Dubai's growth in 2002, when the desert sheikdom began allowing foreigners to own property. After sharp falls during both the 2008-2009 financial crisis and Dubai's brief coronavirus lockdown, prices have been soaring.",
      "Today, average prices per square foot are at all-time highs, according to Property Monitor. Rental prices increased as much as 20% in key neighborhoods last year, with further rises likely this year, with some residents moving to communities further out in the desert, the real estate firm Engel & V\u00f6lkers said.",
      "Even before the boom, some people who worked in Dubai chose to live in the neighboring emirate of Sharjah, some 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the city's downtown, or further away. Some 1 million commuters from other emirates jam the 12-lane Sheikh Zayed Road that runs through the center of the city and other highways every day, as studies suggest that as many as four out of five employees drive to work alone.",
      "That traffic has only intensified with Dubai's new arrivals.",
      "While the rest of the world saw as much as a 4% increase in the number of registered vehicles in the last two years, the city's Road and Transportation Authority says there's been a 10% increase in the number of vehicles.",
      "So many vehicles have been registered that the city has had to make license plates longer.",
      "And while the city keeps building new flyovers and other road improvements, more cars are coming from more directions than ever before.",
      "\u201cDubai is very attractive, more and more people are coming,\u201d said Thomas Edelmann, the founder and managing director of RoadSafetyUAE, which advocates about traffic issues. \u201cI think it\u2019s easier to get people quickly to come to Dubai and to convince them about Dubai, then to build a new intersection or a new highway.\u201d",
      "Congestion has got so bad that it's driving even prominent Emiratis to break their customary silence on public affairs.",
      "Habib Al Mulla, a prominent Emirati lawyer, wrote on the social platform X in December that while authorities were working on congestion, the problem demanded \u201ca set of immediate and long-term mechanisms.\u201d He followed up by publishing an opinion piece twice mentioning \u201ccongestion\u201d as being among \u201cpressing issues\" for global cities like Dubai.",
      "While phrased in mild language, Al Mulla\u2019s comments represented rare public criticism in the United Arab Emirates, where speech is tightly controlled by criminal law and social norms favor raising issues at a \u201cmajlis\u201d \u2014 a semiprivate setting convened by a traditional ruler.",
      "\u201cThe concentration of wealth and opportunities created in global cities may cause income inequality that pushes out lower-income residents,\u201d Al Mulla warned in the English-language Khaleej Times newspaper on Jan. 15.",
      "\u201cThe problem becomes acute when the wealth and opportunities remain inaccessible to segments of the national population who witness the city\u2019s allure being seized by outsiders. This may carry significant social risks, if not mitigated.\u201d",
      "Then there's demographic concerns as the Emirati share of the population dwindles. While the number of citizens isn't public, a back-of-the-envelope, informal calculation shared for years by experts suggests Emirati citizens represent around 10% of the country's overall population of more than 9 million people, a number that's likely falling as foreigners rush in.",
      "In December, sermon scripts issued for the Dec. 13 Friday's prayers directly touched on the duty of having more children.",
      "\u201cIncreasing offspring is both a religious obligation and a national responsibility, as it contributes to the protection and sustainability of nations,\u201d the sermon read, according to a transcript issued by the federal government's General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments.",
      "For Dubai's autocratic government, overseen by ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, possible solutions to the grinding traffic have ranged from the practical to the fanciful. The government in recent months has repeatedly encouraged companies to allow more remote work options, including in a report released in November that also suggested staggered and flexible working hours.",
      "Adding as many as five remote workdays a month, along with the other steps, \u201ccan reduce morning peak travel time across Dubai by 30%,\u201d the study stated.",
      "Dubai's road toll system, known as Salik, has added gates to charge drivers more and will institute surge pricing at the end of the month. Dubai's Metro, which boasts the world's longest self-driving rail line, will also grow beyond its broadly north-south routes in a nearly $5 billion expansion.",
      "Then there's the flying taxi project. Since 2017, Dubai has been announcing plans for airborne cabs in the city. A first \u201cvertiport\u201d is being built by Dubai International Airport with the aim of offering the service from next year.",
      "Dubai also plans 3,300 kilometers (2,050 miles) of new pedestrian paths, although during Dubai's summer months pedestrians have to contend with high humidity and heat of around 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "\u201cIn the coming years, residents of Dubai will be able to move around by walking, cycling, its extensive network of roads and bridges, the Metro and its new lines, water taxis, or flying taxis on specific air routes,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed said on X in December.",
      "But for now, Dubai keeps attracting more people and more cars \u2014 and the traffic jams only get longer."

      "Retired swingman Andre Iguodala will become just the seventh player to have his number retired by the Golden State Warriors in a ceremony next month",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- As Andre Iguodala moves around town in the Bay Area these days, he is regularly stopped by fans eager to praise him for how he carried himself while playing for the Golden State Warriors.",
      "For his grit and his drive. For doing all the little things many never saw.",
      "Some even share how his example influenced the way they raise their own kids \u2014 because that's how much he has meant to big-time basketball both on the court and off it.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m used to getting stopped a lot but now it throws me off because I don\u2019t play basketball anymore,\u201d Iguodala said. \"You can see a good fan versus a bad fan from a mile away, and so I\u2019m able to see, OK, this is a decent human being, and this is a genuine interaction. I think the folks that I\u2019m running into in the Bay are of high value and morals, and so 99% are really good interactions.",
      "\u201cYou walk away feeling a little bit better about yourself, actually, because you realize it\u2019s bigger than you.\u201d",
      "Now, Iguodala will give them more to celebrate and cheer about.",
      "The Warriors announced Tuesday that Iguodala is becoming the seventh player to have his number retired by the franchise \u2014 set to join Rick Barry (24), Wilt Chamberlain (13), Nate Thurmond (42), Al Attles (16), Chris Mullin (17) and Tom Meschery (14).",
      "Golden State will honor Iguodala and hang his No. 9 jersey following an afternoon game against Dallas on Feb. 23, meaning former teammate Klay Thompson will have the chance to be there.",
      "\u201cAndre will go down as one of the smartest, shrewdest and most unique and successful players ever to wear a Warriors uniform,\u201d owner Joe Lacob said.",
      "Iguodala retired in October 2023 after 19 NBA seasons and four championships with Golden State, including an NBA Finals MVP award in 2015. Shortly after announcing he was done playing, Iguodala became the acting executive director of the National Basketball Players Association.",
      "The 40-year-old Iguodala was the No. 9 overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft out of Arizona and played in 1,231 career games. He spent eight seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers, one in Denver, six with the Warriors, two in Miami and the last two back for Golden State. He was part of NBA champions in 2015, \u201817, \u201918 and 2022.",
      "A defensive stopper who took on a variety of roles, Iguodala not only mentored teammates at the end of his career but also provided insight to coach Steve Kerr.",
      "It was Kerr who trusted Iguodala to perform on the big stage that the coach moved him into the starting lineup trailing 2-1 to the Cavaliers in the 2015 Finals and gave him the assignment of guarding then-Cleveland star LeBron James.",
      "\u201cA lot of those things go unnoticed,\" the retired swingman said. \u201cI constantly get stopped by folks and they say, 'You know, you really helped me raise my children in terms of bringing a proper approach, to whatever it is that you do, respecting what you do, doing it at a high level, teamwork, discipline. Sacrifice is probably the biggest thing that they use in regards to me, with sometimes less is more, but knowing when to be ready for the big moments.\u201d",

      "SCHLADMING, Austria -- Swiss skier Loic Meillard posted the fastest first-run time in a rain-affected men's World Cup night giant slalom Tuesday as his teammate and overall World Cup leader Marco Odermatt finished nine-tenths off the pace.",
      "Odermatt had won the last three giant slaloms, and 15 of the last 18, but the Olympic and world champion struggled throughout to find his rhythm in the last GS before next month's world championships in nearby Saalbach-Hinterglemm.",
      "Last year in Schladming, Odermatt finished the opening run 0.98 seconds off the lead but still managed to win the race with a frenetic final run.",
      "On Tuesday, persistent rain weakened the course and low clouds in the upper part of the Planai forced organizers to lower the start gate, which reduced run times by about 14 seconds.",
      "Meillard, the 2023 winner, completed his run in 51.43 seconds to lead Norwegians Alexander Steen Olsen and Henrik Kristoffersen by 0.11 and 0.24 seconds, respectively, with Zan Kranjec of Slovenia one-hundredth further back in fourth.",
      "Lucas Pinheiro Braathen, who switched from the Norwegian to the Brazilian federation this season, had 1.22 second to make up in the second run later Tuesday.",
      "Alexis Pinturault, a two-time Olympic bronze medalist in GS who crashed in a super-G and was airlifted from the course in Kitzbuehel last Friday, will likely miss the rest of the season.",
      "The French ski federation said Tuesday that Pinturault sustained a fracture of the internal tibial plateau in his right knee and was expected to gradually start rehabilitation in six weeks' time.",

      "They were all unanimous, or just about unanimous, rookie of the year selections. Everybody knew long before the ballots were cast who was going to win the award that season. There was no mystery.",
      "If this season's voting was held today, good luck figuring out what would happen.",
      "No rookie has emerged as the leader of this year's class. There isn't a single first-year player on pace to average 15 points and appear in enough games to qualify for the league's leaderboard; the last time that happened was 2016-17. And right now, according to BetMGM Sportsbook, the favorite to win rookie of the year is someone who has started four games all season, all of them in the last week or so \u2014 Miami's Kel'el Ware.",
      "\u201cIt means I'm doing something right on the court,\u201d Ware said.",
      "He's not wrong, but it also speaks to how nobody in this rookie group has stepped to the front of the class, either.",
      "Here were the current leaders in terms of rookie of the year odds, according to BetMGM, as of Monday night: Ware (+200) tops the list, San Antonio's Stephon Castle (+275) is second, and Memphis' Jaylen Wells and Washington's Alexandre Sarr (both +350) are tied for third.",
      "Grizzlies center Zach Edey (+1400) is fifth. After that, everyone is at least 40-1 at this point.",
      "If Castle wins, the Spurs would have done something that's been managed only once in the last half-century \u2014 having back-to-back rookies of the year. It happened in 2015 and 2016 when Andrew Wiggins and Towns won for Minnesota.",
      "\u201cHe really has a chance to be special,\u201d Paul said of Castle, his Spurs teammate.",
      "Ware is clearly developing as the season goes along. The center out of Indiana didn't have his first double-figure scoring game for the Heat until Jan. 1. He had three consecutive 20-point games last week for Miami \u2014 the push that vaulted him into the favorite spot on the BetMGM rookie board \u2014 and now seems like a lock to be headed to All-Star weekend in San Francisco for the Rising Stars games (and potentially the All-Star Game itself, if his Rising Stars team wins).",
      "It's all happened very quickly for Ware. A couple weeks ago, he wasn't even seeming like a legit rookie of the year candidate \u2014 much less the favorite.",
      "\u201cBelieve it or not, he\u2019s been ready since he came here,\u201d Heat teammate Tyler Herro said. \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t in the rotation, he was just overly communicative about how he wants to be in the rotation and how he feels like he can help. I always felt like he could help. And now, him just getting his opportunity, I think everybody is starting to see what he\u2019s capable of.\"",
      "If nothing else, there might be a real rookie of the year race when it's time to vote in April. There have been very few of those in the last couple decades \u2014 with the majority of the winners in that span getting 90% or more of the first-place votes.",
      "A rare exception was in 2022, when Toronto's Scottie Barnes won by getting 48 first-place votes to Evan Mobley\u2019s 43. Every other winner over the last 20 years has gotten at least 60% of the first-place votes; the last real \u201cclose\u201d race was for the 2002 award, when Amar'e Stoudemire got 59 first-place votes \u2014 barely 50%. Yao Ming got 45 that year and Caron Butler got 13.",

      "Workers at a factory in rural Ohio were up all night churning out footballs for this year\u2019s Super Bowl",
      "As soon as this year's Super Bowl matchup was set, workers at the Wilson Sporting Goods football factory jumped into action.",
      "The factory in the rural village of Ada, Ohio, makes the game balls used by every NFL team along with many of the nation\u2019s top college programs and high schools.",
      "But this time of year it's all about the Super Bowl. The Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will face off for the Lombardi Trophy for the second time in three years on Feb. 9 in New Orleans.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the footballs, by the numbers:",
      "The two teams will each get a shipment of 108, plus a dozen more for the kickers, all stamped with the Super Bowl logo and team names. Some of the balls will be for practices, while the best ones will be set aside by the quarterbacks. About 50 of those will be bagged and locked away for each team until it's time for kickoff.",
      "Wilson makes five different sizes for players of all levels, from the pros to youth leagues. Some have different patterns. NFL balls are notable for the lack of a stripe on the ends. They're also embedded with a chip that tracks the ball's position on the field, how far it travels and its trajectory.",
      "Normally it takes three days from start to finish. But the first batch of footballs must be sent to the Super Bowl teams Monday, within about 18 hours, so they have enough time to break them in for practices and the game. That's why the workers start production right away the night of the conference title games.",
      "It's a 20-step process, most of it by hand, from cutting out the four leather panels that are sewn together with 250 stitches to putting in the laces. For NFL footballs, the work goes to the factory's most experienced and skilled workers. \u201cCertain parts of the process require a handmade feel,\u201d said Kevin Murphy, general manager of Wilson Team Sports. \u201cIt's like making a beautiful, sculpted pair of shoes.\u201d",
      "Throughout production the balls are weighed, measured and inspected for flaws. Once finished, they're checked again. By the time they're packaged and ready for shipping, each one will have been touched by about 50 workers.",
      "It churns out roughly 500,000 footballs each year, or about 2,500 per day. NFL teams go through several hundred during a season. For the Super Bowl, Wilson will make between 10,000-20,000 commemorative balls that will be sold by retailers nationwide and at the game site. If there's high demand, the factory will keep producing the souvenir balls well after.",
      "Since 1941, Wilson has made every football used by the league. Its factory in Ada has been making the official game balls since 1955. This year the company opened a new plant in the village that allows for more production and a museum. Fans can tour the factory, too."

      "Dearica Hamby still smiles at the memory of Kobe Bryant sitting courtside at WNBA games.",
      "She had met him years ago. He came to see her old team, the Las Vegas Aces, play all the time.",
      "\u201cI think one of the first things he told me was that I could play defense,\" Hamby recalled. \"And I was kind of like \u2018Wha-at?\u2019 ... That's something I'll cherish with me forever.\u201d",
      "That epitomized the late NBA great's relationship with the women's game. After his 20-year playing career ended, Bryant turned his focus to the next generation, mentoring some of women's basketball's biggest stars, from WNBA champion and Olympic gold medalist Diana Taurasi to former Oregon star Sabrina Ionescu.",
      "He worked out with them, analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of their game and pushed for them to reach the same heights in popularity that he and his NBA peers did.",
      "For Hamby, now with the Los Angeles Sparks, Bryant saw an aspect of her game she didn't even know she had.",
      "\u201cIf Kobe tells you you can play defense, you can play defense,\" she quipped.",
      "Five years after Bryant, 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, several women's basketball players reflected on what he meant to their game and how he championed it. Many of them thought Bryant would be pleased with the overall progress of women's sports, which have skyrocketed in popularity and reach in recent years.",
      "That growth has been most prominent in the women's basketball arenas that Bryant and Gianna loved so much.",
      "The WNBA last season had its most-watched regular season in 24 years and its best attendance in 22 seasons. Some of the league's most popular players currently are competing in a new 3-on-3 league in South Florida called Unrivaled, founded by Olympic gold medalists Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart.",
      "\u201cWe carry this on for him,\u201d said Satou Sabally, a forward with the WNBA's Dallas Wings who plays for the Phantom squad in Unrivaled. \u201cHe would be so proud of this league. He would be proud of \u2019Phe and Stewie. I know that he\u2019s looking down and hopefully he\u2019s smiling and is proud of us.\u201d",
      "Sabally said she still gets emotional when she thinks of that day on Jan. 26, 2020. It reminds her of her playing days at Oregon, when she, Ionescu and their Ducks teammates connected over Bryant.",
      "\u201cI think about ... how we all bonded together over Kobe and how we bonded together for the rest of our lives because he was so impactful,\u201d Sabally added. \u201cHe was really a person that saw us women as the talents who we are. He came to the games, he was so outspoken and he really was really supportive.\"",
      "The shock of the superstar's death echoed throughout the sports and entertainment worlds, with many taking to social media to post emotional tributes to Bryant while expressing their disbelief.",
      "People were glued to their phones and TV screens as news of the crash spread. NBA players were in tears ahead of games that day.",
      "\u201cI still remember exactly where I was whenever we heard the news,\" said Kate Martin of the Golden State Valkyries, playing for Laces BC at Unrivaled, \"and no one really knew if it was fake or real. I think that\u2019s just one of those things where you\u2019re just always going to remember exactly where you were when you heard that.\u201d",
      "Martin never met Bryant but said she cherishes his mentality \u2014 he had a relentless competitiveness \u2014 and the way he elevated women's sports.",
      "Bryant became heavily involved with his daughters' hoops journeys and coached Gianna's youth team. He was often at women's basketball games, especially college ones, with Gianna, who was fascinated with the UConn Huskies. Gianna was in line to further Bryant's legacy on the court. The plan was for her to attend Connecticut, and surely the WNBA was next.",
      "Bryant was passionate about women's sports despite the belief of some that he should not have been involved with the women\u2019s game at all because of a 2003 charge accusing him of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old employee at a Colorado resort.",
      "Bryant had said the two had consensual sex, and the charge was eventually dropped when the woman declined to testify at trial. The woman later filed a civil suit against Bryant that was settled out of court.",
      "There's an image that still circulates in the sports world today: Kobe and Gianna sitting courtside at a 2019 game featuring his Los Angeles Lakers. He wore a bright orange pullover with a white WNBA logo on the front. Gianna sat beaming at his side.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of people started to follow behind Kobe because he recognized our gift and our talent and how special it really is,\" said former Chicago Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon, the current coach of Unrivaled's Vinyl BC. \"And his daughter was right there as well.\u201d",
      "That's who Bryant had become \u2014 a face of women's sports advocacy.",

    "summary": "Alexander Zverev says he is feeling down and emotional after once again coming within one win of earning his first Grand Slam title",

      "Alexander Zverev says he is feeling down and emotional after once again coming within one win of earning his first Grand Slam title",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Alexander Zverev described himself as \u201cquite down\u201d and \u201cquite emotional\" after once again coming within one win of earning his first Grand Slam title.",
      "And unlike his first two defeats in major finals \u2014 both of which he led, and both of which went five sets \u2014 Zverev did not come close to reaching the finish line Sunday in the Australian Open final, which ended with defending champion Jannik Sinner holding the trophy after his 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can. I\u2019m working as hard as I ever did. I think I\u2019m doing all the right things off-court. I think I\u2019m practicing the right things. But I lost in straight sets today. I mean, those are facts. That is a fact. I lost to Jannik in straight sets today,\u201d said Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany who is ranked No. 2 but did not seem anywhere near No. 1 Sinner on this occasion.",
      "\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t want to end my career as the best player of all time to never win a Grand Slam, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Zverev, whose post-match speech was interrupted by someone in Rod Laver Arena calling out the names of two women who have accused him of physical abuse in the past.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll keep doing everything I can,\" Zverev said, \"to lift one of those trophies.\u201d",
      "He is the seventh man in the Open era, which dates to 1968, to start a career with an 0-3 record in title matches at one of the sport's four most important events.",
      "Five of the other six went on to win at least one major championship. The only member of the group who hasn't is Casper Ruud, who is also the only one still active.",
      "Sinner offered support to Zverev during the trophy ceremony Sunday. That came in the form of an arm around the shoulder \u2014 and with his words.",
      "\u201cKeep believing in yourself,\u201d Sinner told Zverev. \u201cKeep working hard, because we all believe that you can lift one of these very, very soon.\u201d",
      "Simone Vagnozzi, one of Sinner\u2019s coaches, said about Zverev: \u201cI really hope, sooner or later, he wins a Slam, because he deserves it.\u201d",
      "Zverev's previous trips to the brink of achieving what he very badly wants came at the 2020 U.S. Open, where he built a two-set lead and even held a match point against Dominic Thiem before faltering, and at the 2024 French Open, where he led Carlos Alcaraz two sets to one before letting that slip away.",
      "This one never got to that sort of stage, and Zverev frequently showed his frustration by cracking rackets",
      "The nearest Zverev came to really making it close was when he was two points from taking the second set. But Sinner took the next four points and that, basically, was that.",
      "\u201cThat was a massive point. I think whoever wins that set, kind of can get a little bit of momentum. Being down two sets to love, especially, then his confidence goes up, mine goes down. It\u2019s a long way back then against someone like Jannik,\u201d Zverev said. \u201cIf it\u2019s one set all, maybe I have a chance. But ... I didn\u2019t stop fighting. I didn\u2019t stop believing. Then, in the third set, I thought he outplayed me more than in the other sets.\u201d",

      "The world championships take place in Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria on Feb. 4-16.",
      "Gut-Behrami was 0.35 seconds faster than Kajsa Vickhoff Lie of Norway, while Federica Brignone was three-hundredths further back in third, a day after the Italian won the downhill on the same hill.",
      "Sofia Goggia, who was runner-up to Brignone in Saturday's race, placed fourth, ahead of teammates Laura Pirovano and Marta Bassino, as the Italian team finished with four racers in the top six.",
      "Keely Cashman shared sixth place with Bassino for the American's career-best result.",
      "Vonn finished 1.4 seconds off the pace in 13th after she had failed to finish her previous two races. The American standout skied out of Saturday's downhill when she missed a gate, but avoided falling.",
      "Vonn returned to ski racing in December after nearly six years of retirement with a new titanium knee.",
      "Last week, Vonn told The Associated Press that she plans to retire again after next year\u2019s Milan-Cortina Olympics.",
      "Last year, Gut-Behrami overtook leader Mikaela Shiffrin in the overall standings in the last two months of the season when the American was out nursing a knee injury.",
      "The Swiss skier then had a slow start to the new campaign after missing the season-opening race in October. However, the defending overall champion then racked up three second places in Super-G before winning Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt's been a weird start of the season, obviously I was struggling a little bit,\u201d Gut-Behrami said. \u201cI had to find the confidence back, the way to push in the skis again.\u201d",
      "Gut-Behrami has now won at least one World Cup race in 11 of the past 12 seasons, with 2018-19 the only exception.",
      "The start of Sunday's race was delayed for 15 minutes as organizers needed more time to prepare the course after overnight snowfall and rain in the hours leading up to the race.",
      "Ariane Raedler had a nasty tumble when she came off the course and lost balance over a patch of softer snow, but the Austrian got up quickly and appeared to have avoided injury.",

    "story": [
      "X is teaming up with Visa to soon offer a system for real-time payments on the social media platform",
      "NEW YORK -- X is teaming up with Visa to soon offer a system for real-time payments on the social media platform \u2014 signaling some progress in a yearslong vision from billionaire owner Elon Musk to create an \u201ceverything app.\u201d",
      "Visa is the first partner for the platform's \u201cX Money Account\" service, which is set to launch later this year, X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a Tuesday post announcing the news. The offering, Yaccarino noted, will support an in-platform digital wallet and peer-to-peer payments connected to users' debit cards, with an option to transfer funds to a bank account.",
      "According to Visa, which also posted about the partnership on X Tuesday, these services will be powered by Visa Direct \u2014 the payment giant's instant money transferring service \u2014 and will be available to X Money Account users in the U.S.",
      "Whether X Money will become available to consumers in other countries, and perhaps through additional payment partners in the near future is still known. And an exact date for the U.S. launch has also not been announced yet.",
      "In her post Tuesday, Yaccarino called the partnership with Visa a \u201cmilestone for the Everything App\u201d and the \u201cfirst of many big announcements about X Money this year.\"",
      "The prospect of San Francisco-based X, formerly known as Twitter, becoming an \u201ceverything app\" has been floated around for some time. Before officially closing the deal to purchase the platform for $44 billion back in 2022, Musk expressed interest in creating his own version of something similar to China\u2019s WeChat \u2014 a \u201csuper app\u201d that does video chats, messaging, streaming and payments.",
      "And his fascination with such a platform began long before the Twitter deal was on the table. Musk has been toying with the idea of an \u201ceverything app\u201d since the late 1990s when he launched a startup called X.com that was later merged into what became X.com. He continued to push for PayPal to diversify but was rebuffed by company CEO Peter Thiel and other executives. PayPal was sold in 2002 to eBay for $1.5 billion \u2014 providing Musk with a windfall that he funneled into the creation of SpaceX and an investment in Tesla in its early days.",
      "The landscape is far more competitive today \u2014 with a handful of companies making similar efforts to expand their in-platform offerings. Other social media giants, such as Facebook parent Meta, have added shopping, games and even dating features.",
      "Consumers now have different platforms at their disposal for communications, payment services, entertainment and more. How X's coming \u201ceverything\u201d features will fare has yet to be seen. Since Musk's 2022 takeover, the platform has already alienated many users and advertisers over reports of rising hate speech and misinformation.",
      "X\u2019s ambitions could also thrust the company into the crosshairs of other powerful tech giants trying to fend off a perceived competitive threat.

      "The 40-year-old founder of China's DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund that now manages a reported $8 billion in assets",
      "BANGKOK -- The 40-year-old founder of China\u2019s DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund and then refined its quantitative models to branch into artificial intelligence.",
      "Liang Wenfeng, who founded DeepSeek in 2023, was born in southern China's Guangdong and studied in eastern China's Zhejiang province, home to e-commerce giant Alibaba and other tech firms, according to Chinese media reports.",
      "The hedge fund he set up in 2015, High-Flyer Quantitative Investment Management, developed models for computerized stock trading and began using machine-learning techniques to refine those strategies.",
      "Like many Chinese quantitative traders, High-Flyer was hit by losses when regulators cracked down on such trading in the past year. However, it reportedly manages $8 billion in assets, ample resources for funding DeepSeek\u2019s AI research.",
      "It also has abundant computing power for AI, since High-Flyer had by 2022 amassed a cluster of 10,000 of California-based Nvidia\u2019s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips that are used to build and run AI systems, according to a post that summer on Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. soon after restricted sales of those chips to China.",
      "\u201cThing is, we are sure now that we want to do this, can do this, and are capable of doing this, so we\u2019re among the best-suited candidates to tackle it at this moment,\" Liang told Waves, a tech media outlet, in 2023.",
      "\u201cCurrently, neither tech giants nor startups have an unassailable lead. With OpenAI paving the way, everyone is working with published papers and open-source code,\u201d it quoted him as saying.",
      "Liang said he spends his days reading papers, writing code, and participating in group discussions, like other researchers.",
      "DeepSeek is exploring what intelligence means, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople may think there\u2019s some hidden business logic behind this, but it\u2019s mainly driven by curiosity,\u201d Liang said.",
      "When DeepSeek was asked, \u201cWho is Liang Wenfeng?\u201d its first answer was to name a different Chinese entrepreneur with the same name, at least as spelled in English letters.",
      "When asked: \u201cWhere is Liang Wenfeng from and where did he go to university?\u201d it said that as of October 2023, the most recent knowledge cutoff for DeepSeek's R1 AI model, \u201cthere is no publicly available information about Liang Wenfeng\u2019s background, including his place of origin or educational history.\"",
      "\"If you are referring to the founder of DeepSeek, details about his personal life or academic background have not been disclosed publicly. For more information about DeepSeek, you can visit its official website,\u201d it said.",
      "Liang's focused approach fits in with his determination to push AI learning forward. After decades of relying on innovation from the West, he says China should be making its own contributions.",
      "\u201cWhat we see is that Chinese AI can\u2019t be in the position of following forever. We often say that there is a gap of one or two years between Chinese AI and the United States, but the real gap is the difference between originality and imitation,\u201d he said in another Waves interview in November. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t change, China will always be only a follower \u2014 so some exploration is inescapable.\u201d",

      "DeepSeek\u2019s emergence has raised concerns that China may have overtaken the U.S. in the artificial intelligence race despite restrictions on its access to the most advanced chips. It's just one of many Chinese companies working on AI, with a goal of making China the world leader in the field by 2030 and besting the U.S. in their battle for technological supremacy.",
      "Like the U.S., China is investing billions into artificial intelligence. Last week, it created a 60 billion yuan ($8.2 billion) AI investment fund, days after the U.S. imposed fresh chip export restrictions.",
      "Beijing has also invested heavily in the semiconductor industry to build its capacity to make advanced computer chips, working to overcome limits on its access to those of industry leaders. Companies are offering talent programs and subsidies, and there are plans to open AI academies and introduce AI education into primary and secondary school curriculums.",
      "China has established regulations governing AI, addressing safety, privacy and ethics. Its ruling Communist Party also controls the kinds of topics the AI models can tackle: DeepSeek shapes its responses to fit those limits.",
      "Here's an overview of some other leading AI models in China.",
      "Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Qwen-2.5-1M is the e-commerce giant's open-source AI series. It contains large language models that can easily handle extremely long questions, and engage in longer and deeper conversations. Its ability to understand complex tasks such as reasoning, dialogues and comprehending code is improving.",
      "Like its rivals, Alibaba Cloud has a chatbot released for public use called Qwen - also known as Tongyi Qianwen in China. Alibaba Cloud\u2019s suite of AI models, such as the Qwen2.5 series, has mostly been deployed for developers and business customers such as automakers, banks, video game makers and retailers as part of product development and shaping customer experiences.",
      "Ernie Bot, developed by Baidu, China\u2019s dominant search engine, was the first AI chatbot made publicly available in China. Baidu said it released the model publicly to be able to collect massive real-world human feedback to build its capacity.",

      "ByteDance says the Doubao 1.5 Pro is better than ChatGPT-4o at retaining knowledge, coding, reasoning, and Chinese language processing. According to ByteDance, the model is also cost-efficient and requires lower hardware costs compared to other large language models because Doubao uses a highly-optimized architecture that balances performance with reduced computational demands.",
      "Moonshot AI is a Beijing-based startup valued at over $3 billion after its latest fundraising round. It says its recently released Kimi k1.5 matches or outperforms the OpenAI o1 model, which is designed to spend more time thinking before it responds and can solve harder and more complex problems. Moonshot claims that Kimi outperforms OpenAI o1 in mathematics, coding, and ability to comprehend both text and visual inputs such as photos and video."

Observers are eager to see whether the Chinese company has matched America\u2019s leading AI companies at a fraction of the cost.",
      "The chatbot's ultimate impact on the AI industry is still unclear, but it appears to censor answers on sensitive Chinese topics, a practice commonly seen on China's internet. In 2023, China issued regulations requiring companies to conduct a security review and obtain approvals before their products can be publicly launched.",
      "Here are some answers The Associated Press received from DeepSeek's new chatbot and ChatGPT:",
      "For many Chinese, the Winnie the Pooh character is a playful taunt of President Xi Jinping. Chinese censors in the past briefly banned social media searches for the bear in mainland China.",
      "ChatGPT got that idea right. It said Winnie the Pooh had become a symbol of political satire and resistance, often used to mock or criticize Xi. It explained that internet users started comparing Xi to the bear over similarities in their physical appearances.",
      "DeepSeek's chatbot said the bear is a beloved cartoon character that is adored by countless children and families in China, symbolizing joy and friendship.",
      "Then, abruptly, it said the Chinese government is \u201cdedicated to providing a wholesome cyberspace for its citizens.\" It added that all online content is managed following Chinese laws and socialist core values, with the aim of protecting national security and social stability.",
      "It might be easy for many people to answer, but both AI chatbots mistakenly said Joe Biden, whose term ended last week, because their data was last updated in October 2023. But they both tried to be responsible by reminding users to verify with updated sources.",
      "The 1989 crackdown saw government troops open fire on student-led pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths. The event remains a taboo subject in mainland China.",
      "DeepSeek's chatbot answered, \u201cSorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let's talk about something else.\u201d",
      "But ChatGPT gave a detailed answer on what it called \u201cone of the most significant and tragic events\u201d in modern Chinese history. The chatbot talked about the background of the massive protests, the estimated casualties and the legacy.",
      "DeepSeek's chatbot's answer echoed China's official statements, saying the relationship between the world's two largest economies is one of the most important bilateral relationships globally. It said China is committed to developing ties with the U.S. based on mutual respect and win-win cooperation.",
      "\u201cWe hope that the United States will work with China to meet each other halfway, properly manage differences, promote mutually beneficial cooperation, and push forward the healthy and stable development of China-U.S. relations,\u201d it said.",
      "ChatGPT's answer was more nuanced. It said the state of the U.S.-China relationship is complex, characterized by a mix of economic interdependence, geopolitical rivalry and collaboration on global issues. It highlighted key topics including the two countries' tensions over the South China Sea and Taiwan, their technological competition and more.",
      "\u201cThe relationship between the U.S. and China remains tense but crucial,\u201d part of its answer said.",
      "Again \u2014 like the Chinese official narrative \u2014 DeepSeek's chatbot said Taiwan has been an integral part of China since ancient times.",
      "\u201cCompatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are connected by blood, jointly committed to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,\u201d it said.",
      "ChatGPT said the answer depends on one's perspective, while laying out China and Taiwan's positions and the views of the international community.

      "NATO is deploying eyes in the sky and on the Baltic Sea to protect cables and pipelines that stitch together the nine countries with shores on Baltic waters",
      "ABOARD A FRENCH NAVY FLIGHT OVER THE BALTIC SEA -- With its powerful camera, the French Navy surveillance plane scouring the Baltic Sea zoomed in on a cargo ship plowing the waters below \u2014 closer, closer and closer still until the camera operator could make out details on the vessel's front deck and smoke pouring from its chimney.",
      "The long-range Atlantique 2 aircraft on a new mission for NATO then shifted its high-tech gaze onto another target, and another after that until, after more than five hours on patrol, the plane's array of sensors had scoped out the bulk of the Baltic \u2014 from Germany in the west to Estonia in the northeast, bordering Russia.",
      "The flight's mere presence in the skies above the strategic sea last week, combined with military ships patrolling on the waters, also sent an unmistakable message: The NATO alliance is ratcheting up its guard against suspected attempts to sabotage underwater energy and data cables and pipelines that crisscross the Baltic, prompted by a growing catalogue of incidents that have damaged them.",
      "\u201cWe will do everything in our power to make sure that we fight back, that we are able to see what is happening and then take the next steps to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. And our adversaries should know this,\" NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said this month in announcing a new alliance mission, dubbed \u201cBaltic Sentry,\u201d to protect the underwater infrastructure vital to the economic well-being of Baltic-region nations.",
      "Power and communications cables and gas pipelines stitch together the nine countries with shores on the Baltic, a relatively shallow and nearly landlocked sea. A few examples are the 152-kilometer (94-mile) Balticconnector pipeline that carries gas between Finland and Estonia, the high-voltage Baltic Cable connecting the power grids of Sweden and Germany, and the 1,173-kilometer (729-mile) C-Lion1 telecommunications cable between Finland and Germany.",
      "Undersea pipes and cables help power economies, keep houses warm and connect billions of people. More than 1.3 million kilometers (807,800 miles) of fiber optic cables \u2014 more than enough to stretch to the moon and back \u2014 span the world's oceans and seas, according to TeleGeography, which tracks and maps the vital communication networks. The cables are typically the width of a garden hose. But 97% of the world\u2019s communications, including trillions of dollars of financial transactions, pass through them each day.",
      "\u201cIn the last two months alone, we have seen damage to a cable connecting Lithuania and Sweden, another connecting Germany and Finland, and most recently, a number of cables linking Estonia and Finland. Investigations of all of these cases are still ongoing. But there is reason for grave concern,\" Rutte said on Jan. 14.",
      "At least 11 Baltic cables have been damaged since October 2023 \u2014 the most recent being a fiber optic cable connecting Latvia and the Swedish island of Gotland, reported to have ruptured on Sunday. Although cable operators note that subsea cable damage is commonplace, the frequency and concentration of incidents in the Baltic heightened suspicions that damage might have been deliberate.",
      "There also are fears that Russia could target cables as part of a wider campaign of so-called \u201chybrid warfare\u201d to destabilize European nations helping Ukraine defend itself against the full-scale invasion that Moscow has been pursuing since 2022.",
      "Without specifically blaming Russia, Rutte said: \u201cHybrid means sabotage. Hybrid means cyber-attacks. Hybrid means sometimes even assassination attacks, attempts, and in this case, it means hitting on our critical undersea infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Finnish police suspect that the Eagle S, an oil tanker that damaged the Estlink 2 power cable and two other communications cables linking Finland and Estonia on Dec. 25th, is part of Moscow\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d used to avoid war-related sanctions on Russian oil exports.",
      "Finnish authorities seized the tanker shortly after it left a Russian port and apparently cut the cables by dragging its anchor. Finnish investigators allege the ship left an almost 100-kilometer (62-mile) long anchor trail on the seabed.",
      "Several Western intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of their work, told The Associated Press that recent damage was most likely accidental, seemingly caused by anchors being dragged by ships that were poorly maintained and poorly crewed.",
      "One senior intelligence official told AP that ships' logs and mechanical failures with ships' anchors were among \u201cmultiple indications\u201d pointing away from Russian sabotage. The official said Russian cables were also severed. Another Western official, also speaking anonymously to discuss intelligence matters, said Russia sent an intelligence-gathering vessel to the site of one cable rupture to investigate the damage.",
      "The Washington Post first reported on the emerging consensus among U.S. and European security services that maritime accidents likely caused recent damage.",
      "The European Subsea Cables Association, representing cable owners and operators, noted in November after faults were reported on two Baltic links that, on average, a subsea cable is damaged somewhere in the world every three days. In northern European waters, the main causes of damage are commercial fishing or ship anchors, it said.",
      "In the fiber-optic cable rupture on Sunday connecting Latvia and Sweden, Swedish authorities detained a Maltese-flagged ship bound for South America with a cargo of fertilizer.",
      "Navibulgar, a Bulgarian company that owns the Vezhen, said any damage was unintentional and that the ship's crew discovered while navigating in extremely bad weather that its left anchor appeared to have dragged on the seabed.",
      "The alliance is deploying warships, maritime patrol aircraft and naval drones for the mission to provide \u201cenhanced surveillance and deterrence.\u201d",
      "Aboard the French Navy surveillance flight, the 14-member crew cross-checked ships they spotted from the air against lists of vessels they had been ordered to watch for.",

Alban, whose surname was withheld by the French military for security reasons.",

      "After the bipartisan law was signed by former President Joe Biden in April, ByteDance said it did not have plans to sell the platform and fought the statute in court for months. China also rebuked Washington over the divestment push, though more recently it appears to be softening its stance.",
      "In media interviews last week, Bill Ford, the chairman of the global investing firm General Atlantic and a ByteDance board member, said the company is prepared to engage with the Trump administration and Chinese officials to find a solution that keeps TikTok available. He also floated the idea that there could be a solution short of a full divesture by ByteDance.",
      "Lawmakers and officials in both parties have raised national security concerns about Chinese ownership and potential manipulation on the immensely popular platform, which is used by more than 170 million U.S. users.",
      "Trump was in favor of a TikTok ban before he reversed his position last year. He credits the platform with helping him win more young voters during the recent presidential election.",
      "Microsoft, along with Walmart, made a failed bid for TikTok during Trump\u2019s first term after Trump tried to ban the app. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella later described it as the \u201cstrangest thing I\u2019ve ever worked on.\u201d"

      "In a statement after the votes were counted Monday night, Whole Foods said it \u201cis proud to offer competitive compensation, great benefits, and career advancement opportunities to all Team Members.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are disappointed by the outcome of this election, but we are committed to maintaining a positive working environment in our Philly Center City store,\u201d the company added.",
      "The company said it provides store employees with a competitive average hourly wage and other benefits, such as 401(k) plans and \u201con-demand\u201d mental health support. It did not disclose its average hourly rate, but some online job postings show store employees can earn $16 per hour or higher.",
      "After the union filed the election petition, workers at the Philadelphia store were given free snacks, and the company repainted their break rooms, according to Young.",
      "Earlier this month, UFCW Local 1776 filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against the company, accusing it of firing one worker in retaliation for union activities and alleging that supervisors told employees they would get paid more if they rejected the union bid. Whole Foods disputed the worker was fired in retaliation.",
      "The union has also accused Whole Foods of withholding region-wide wage increases from employees at the Philadelphia store because of the union activities.",
      "The company acknowledges it did not offer wage increases to workers at the store, even though it did so at a number of other stores as part of a quarterly review. Whole Foods maintains it would have been illegal to make wage adjustments in the lead-up to the union election, an argument Young disputed.",
      "The company said it was delaying the pay bumps until after the election to avoid the appearance of trying to influence the vote with raises.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon has resisted union organizing efforts by its workers. Amazon delivery drivers went on strike in a handful of U.S. cities before Christmas to exert pressure on the the company to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",
      "Workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina are scheduled to vote next month on whether they want to be represented by an upstart union called Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment.",
      "The retail giant has challenged the structure of the National Labor Relations Board in court. Amazon accused the federal agency of tampering in the 2022 union election at the Staten Island warehouse, in part by bringing a lawsuit against the company to reinstate a fired organizer close to when voting began.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said vaccines are not safe. His support for abortion access has made conservatives uncomfortable. And farmers across the Midwest are nervous over his talk of banning corn syrup and pesticides from America's food supply.",
      "The 71-year-old, whose famous name and family tragedies have put him in the national spotlight since he was a child, has spent years airing his populist \u2014 and sometimes extreme \u2014 views in podcasts, TV interviews and speeches building his own quixotic brand.",
      "A son of a Democratic political dynasty, Kennedy is seeking to become the nation's top health official under President Donald Trump. To get there, he's softening those long-held beliefs, hoping to win approval from the Republican Party.",
      "At stake is Kennedy's control of the nation's sprawling $1.7 trillion U.S. Health and Human Services agency, which oversees food and hospital inspections, health insurance for roughly half of the country and vaccine recommendations. The job would finally give him the kind of political power Kennedys have wielded for decades.",
      "He made a long-shot bid for the presidency last year, following uncles John, who won the White House in 1960, and Edward, who lost his bid in 1980, along with his father, Robert, a leading contender who was assassinated after winning the California primary in 1968.",
      "With a strong resemblance to his father and lawyer credentials to match, he found ardent followers who embrace the critiques he's lodged against unhealthy foods, pharmaceutical companies and chemicals.",
      "But he couldn't get Democrats on his side, with some of his relatives shunning him over his vaccine views. His has been a flexible ideological journey, part liberal Democrat, part libertarian, and now, an adherent of the MAGA agenda after dropping out of the race last year to back Trump.",
      "The president has since directed him to \u201cgo wild\u201d on health. Together, they've even hatched a new slogan: \"Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "Kennedy's aspirations now rest with the Republican-controlled Senate, where he can lose only three GOP votes if all Democrats oppose him.",
      "As Kennedy's confirmation hearings approach this week, he faces a coordinated effort to stop his nomination. A television and digital ad campaign is highlighting his anti-vaccine work. And former Vice President Mike Pence, a stalwart of the conservative anti-abortion movement, is lobbying against him, too.",
      "Kennedy's closest supporters believe he'll prevail. He plans to focus on issues that have bipartisan consensus, like reducing food additives and increasing access to healthier foods. When concerns about his views on conservative priorities like abortion come up, he's promised to follow Trump's lead.",
      "Then there is Kennedy's biggest advantage \u2014 and maybe, too, his biggest liability for someone working under Trump \u2014 his star power.",
      "\u201cBobby K. is coming in with a bigger microphone than any HHS Secretary,\u201d said Calley Means, a close adviser to Kennedy.",
      "Kennedy's numerous remarks, anti-vaccine nonprofit and lawsuits against immunizations are likely to haunt him.",
      "He's rejected the anti-vaccine label, instead casting himself as a crusader for \u201cmedical freedom\u201d who wants more research. He and Trump have vowed not to \u201ctake away\u201d vaccines. To defuse criticism, he resigned from the Children\u2019s Health Defense, his nonprofit that has filed dozens of lawsuits against vaccines, including the government authorizations of some of them.",
      "But critics have argued that his work advocating against vaccine use has cost lives. Democrats are poised to home in on his social media campaigns and work in Samoa, the island nation in the Pacific Ocean where doctors say he and his anti-vaccine acolytes seized on a tragedy to campaign against childhood inoculations.",
      "In 2018, two Samoan children died from botched vaccinations, prompting the government to suspend the childhood vaccination program.",
      "Kennedy showed up with his wife, actor Cheryl Hines, to meet with the prime minister, health minister and other health officials in 2019. Kennedy says he promoted a \u201cmedical informatics system\u201d that would \"assess the efficacy and safety of every medical intervention or drug on overall health.\u201d",
      "Later that year, a measles epidemic killed dozens of infants and children.",
      "Democrat Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, an emergency room doctor who organized flights loaded with 50,000 vaccine doses, doctors and nurses to administer inoculations, has led the campaign to highlight Kennedy's role. He shared during one-on-one meetings with a handful of senators earlier this month what he witnessed there, including accounts from villagers who told them about Facebook posts that scared them away from vaccinations.",
      "\u201cHe went there and used celebrity status to scare the country away from vaccinating,\" Green said of Kennedy. \"You have to ask yourself, \u2018Why, RFK Jr., would you go to Samoa and do this to innocent people?\u2019\u201d",
      "Kennedy has denied playing any role in the outbreak.",
      "A Democratic group is running digital ads that accuse Kennedy of spreading misinformation in Samoa. The campaign is targeting senators in nine states, including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and John Curtis of Utah, which boasts a significant Samoan population.",
      "Another they're targeting is Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Senate committee, which holds a hearing Thursday. Cassidy, who is also a doctor, stopped short of endorsing Kennedy after they met and is seen as swayable.",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who suffered from polio as a child, may also be in play. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, McConnell dipped into his own campaign funds to urge Kentucky residents to vaccinate against the virus.",
      "Last month, McConnell sent a warning about attempts to discredit the polio vaccine.",
      "\u201cEfforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\u201d",
      "Other conservatives have question Kennedy's abortion views, after he said last year that it should be legal for full-term pregnancies. His campaign later clarified that he supports abortion rights until fetal viability, around 22 to 24 weeks.",
      "In meetings with some senators, he's promised to follow Trump's directive on the issue.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for example, said he was convinced after talking to Kennedy that he would be a strong anti-abortion advocate.",
      "But skepticism remains, with Pence's advocacy group highlighting his abortion views in an ad campaign.",
      "\u201cRFK Jr. has made certain overtures to pro-life leaders that he would be mindful of their concerns at HHS, there is little reason for confidence at this time,\" his group said in a letter sent to senators last week.",
      "In Iowa, Kennedy's nomination both excites and worries corn and soybean farmer Brian Fyre.",
      "The sixth-generation farmer and Republican thinks Kennedy will offer a fresh perspective, but he also can't afford the ban on corn syrup or pesticides that Kennedy has promised. If confirmed, Kennedy would oversee the Food and Drug Administration, which has the power to enact restrictions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d be pinched out. It would devastate rural, Midwest communities,\u201d Fyre said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a food supply for a nation. You can\u2019t upend that without a viable alternative.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said he planned to offer some \u201ceducating\u201d on agriculture to Kennedy.",
      "Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from a dairy farm state, sees it differently, telling a crowd at the Heritage Foundation last month that Kennedy's agriculture ideas are a promising part of a bigger goal: \u201cto Make America Healthy Again.\u201d"

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- After a half-century of public silence, a freelance photographer from Vietnam has asserted he took one of the most renowned and impactful photos of the 20th century \u2014 the image of a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack in South Vietnam that has long been credited to a staff photographer from The Associated Press.",
      "Nguyen Thanh Nghe claimed authorship of the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cnapalm girl\u201d photograph in the new documentary \u201cThe Stringer\u201d and on the sidelines of its premiere Saturday night at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.",
      "The AP conducted its own investigation and said it has no reason to conclude that anyone other than the long-credited photographer, Nick Ut, made the picture. The news agency said it was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d that filmmakers portrayed it as having reviewed the film\u2019s materials and being dismissive. The AP said it saw the film for the first time at Sundance.",
      "Nghe joined the filmmakers for the post-screening Q&A where he said, through a translator, \u201cI took the photo.\u201d The audience cheered enthusiastically. He did not say why he waited so long to make the claim.",
      "The AP said it was calling on the filmmakers to release their contributors from non-disclosure agreements for the film, including Nghe. It also called on the filmmakers to share a visual analysis they commissioned \u2014 and the film itself. \u201cWe cannot state more clearly that The Associated Press is only interested in the facts and a truthful history of this iconic photo,\" the agency said.",
      "Nguyen says he took the iconic photo of Kim Phuc on June 8, 1972. Nghe said he went to the town of Trang Bang that day as a driver for an NBC news crew and captured the image of Phuc running down the street, crying and naked with arms outstretched. He said he sold his image to the AP for $20, and they gave him a print of the photo that his wife later destroyed.",
      "Representatives for the AP, who saw the film for the first time Saturday at the premiere, are contesting the film's implication that the company reviewed their findings and dismissed them.",
      "\u201cAs recently as December, we reiterated our request to see the filmmakers\u2019 full materials and they did not respond, nor did they include AP\u2019s full response in the film,\" Lauren Easton, an AP spokesperson, said Sunday. \"We were surprised and disappointed that the film portrayed AP as having reviewed the film\u2019s materials and being dismissive of the allegations, which is completely false.\"",
      "The film\u2019s investigation was led by husband-and-wife team of Gary Knight, founder of the VII Foundation, and producer Fiona Turner. Bao Nguyen, a Vietnamese American filmmaker, directed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a journalist by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI had a healthy skepticism, as I think anyone would, going against a 53-year-old truth. ... But as a storyteller and a filmmaker, I thought it was my both or my responsibility and my privilege to be able to uplift the story of individuals like Nghe.\u201d",
      "Before having seen the film, the AP conducted its own investigation over six months and concluded it had \u201cno reason to believe anyone other than Ut took the photo.\u201d Now, the AP is calling on the filmmakers to lift the non-disclosure agreements they placed on their subjects to allow the company to investigate more fully.",
      "\u201cAP stands ready to review any and all evidence and new information about this photo,\" Easton said.",
      "Knight and Turner met with AP in London last June about the allegations. According to the AP, filmmakers requested the news organization sign a non-disclosure agreement before they provided their evidence. AP would not. The film suggests that evidence was presented to the AP, which the AP says is not true.",
      "A primary source in the film is Carl Robinson, then an AP photo editor in Saigon, who was overruled in his judgment not to use the picture by Horst Faas, AP's Saigon chief of photos. Robinson says in the film that Faas instructed him to \u201cmake it staff\u201d and credit Ut for the photo. Both Faas and Yuichi \u201cJackson\u201d Ishizaki, who developed the film, are dead. Robinson, 81, was dismissed by the AP in 1978.",
      "On Saturday, a Sundance Institute moderator asked why he wanted to come forward with the allegations now. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to die before this story came out,\u201d Robinson told the audience after the screening. \u201cI wanted to find (Nghe) and say sorry.\u201d",
      "A variety of witnesses interviewed by AP, including renowned correspondents such as Fox Butterfield and Peter Arnett and the photo\u2019s subject herself, Phuc, say they are certain Ut took the photo.",
      "Robinson was one such person the AP attempted to speak to during their investigation but \u201cwere told we could only do so under conditions\" that they said would have prevented them from \u201ctaking swift action if necessary.\u201d",
      "The film\u2019s investigation took over two years. The journalists enlisted a French forensics team, INDEX, to help determine the likelihood of whether Ut had been in a position to take the photo. The forensics team concluded that it was highly unlikely that Ut could have done it.",
      "Ut's attorney, James Hornstein, had this to say Sunday after the premiere: \u201cIn due course, we will proceed to right this wrong in a courtroom where Nick Ut\u2019s reputation will be vindicated.\u201d",
      "Knight referenced AP\u2019s investigation Saturday, telling the audience that the company's statement is available online. \u201cThey said they\u2019re open always to examining the truth. And I think it was a very reasonable thing to say,\u201d Knight said. \u201cOur story is here and it\u2019s here for you all to see.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThings happen in the field in the heat of the moment. ... We\u2019re all stronger if we examine ourselves, ask tough questions, and we\u2019re open and honest about what goes on in our profession. Now more than ever, I would argue.\"",

      "The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA Director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of President Donald Trump's pick to lead the agency, John Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director.",
      "The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the agency's assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory.",
      "Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities.",
      "\u201cCIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,\u201d a spokesperson for the agency wrote in a statement about the agency's assessment.",
      "Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China's virology labs.",
      "Lawmakers have pressured America's spy agencies for more information about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths.",
      "While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "Some official investigations, however, have raised the the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago a report by the Department of Energy concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the finding.",
      "Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario.",
      "\u201cThe lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense,\u201d Ratcliffe said in 2023.",

      "The rhesus macaques made a break for it on Nov. 6, and mostly hung around near the facility. They're about the size of a cat, weighing roughly 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "It appears a worker unintentionally left the gates unlocked when the monkeys escaped, Westergaard said in November. Workers were supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure.",
      "The monkeys posed no risk to public health, said Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police.",

      "Plugging directly into a power plant would take years off their development timelines.",
      "In theory, the AWS deal would let Susquehanna sell power for more than they get by selling into the grid. Talen Energy, Susquehanna\u2019s majority owner, projected the deal would bring as much as $140 million in electricity sales in 2028, though it didn't disclose exactly how much AWS will pay for the power.",
      "The profit potential is one that other nuclear plant operators, in particular, are embracing after years of financial distress and frustration with how they are paid in the broader electricity markets. Many say they have been forced to compete in some markets against a flood of cheap natural gas as well as state-subsidized solar and wind energy.",
      "Power plant owners also say the arrangement benefits the wider public, by bypassing the costly buildout of long power lines and leaving more transmission capacity on the grid for everyone else.",
      "A favorable ruling from FERC could open the door to many more huge data centers and other massive power users like hydrogen plants and bitcoin miners, analysts say.",
      "FERC\u2019s 2-1 rejection in November was procedural. Recent comments by commissioners suggest they weren't ready to decide how to regulate such a novel matter without more study.",
      "In the meantime, the agency is hearing arguments for and against the Susquehanna-AWS deal.",
      "Monitoring Analytics, the market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid, wrote in a filing to FERC that the impact would be \u201cextreme\u201d if the Susquehanna-AWS model were extended to all nuclear power plants in the territory.",
      "Energy prices would increase significantly and there's no explanation for how rising demand for power will be met even before big power plants drop out of the supply mix, it said.",
      "Separately, two electric utility owners \u2014 which make money in deregulated states from building out the grid and delivering power \u2014 have protested that the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement amounts to freeloading off a grid that ordinary customers pay to build and maintain. Chicago-based Exelon and Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power say the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement would allow AWS to avoid $140 million a year that it would otherwise owe.",
      "Susquehanna\u2019s owners say the data center won't be on the grid and question why it should have to pay to maintain it. But critics contend that the power plant itself is benefiting from taxpayer subsidies and ratepayer-subsidized services, and shouldn't be able to strike deals with private customers that could increase costs for others.",
      "FERC's decision will have \u201cmassive repercussions for the entire country\u201d because it will set a precedent for how FERC and grid operators will handle the waiting avalanche of similar requests from data center companies and nuclear plants, said Jackson Morris of the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Stacey Burbure, a vice president for American Electric Power, told FERC at a hearing in November that it needs to move quickly.",

      "LONDON -- Google pledged to crack down on fake online reviews with tougher punishments for rogue reviewers and businesses that try to profit from them, British regulators said Friday following an investigation.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority said that Google has committed to \u201crigorous steps\u201d to detect and remove sham reviews, so it can quickly identify and investigate businesses and reviewers trying to benefit from the phony posts.",
      "Google will delete all reviews written by people who repeatedly write fake or misleading reviews \u2014 either positive or negative \u2014 for U.K. businesses, the watchdog said. These reviewers will also be banned from posting new reviews, whether or not they're in the U.K.",
      "Businesses that try to artificially boost their star ratings will also face consequences. Warning alerts will be slapped on their Google profiles, and new reviews will not be allowed. And if they repeatedly engage in fake review activity, all their reviews for the past six months or more will be deleted, the CMA said.",
      "Google's also adding a way for consumers to quickly and easily report shady reviews, including payments or rewards offered for a positive review.",
      "\u201cThe changes we\u2019ve secured from Google ensure robust processes are in place, so people can have confidence in reviews and make the best possible choices,\u201d the watchdog's CEO Sarah Cardell said. \u201cThey also help to create a level-playing field for fair dealing firms.\u201d",
      "Google said its \u201clongstanding investments to combat fraudulent content help us block millions of fake reviews yearly \u2013 often before they ever get published.\" The company said in a brief statement that its \"work with regulators around the world, including the CMA, is part of our ongoing efforts to fight fake content and bad actors.\u201d",
      "A separate investigation into Amazon over fake reviews is ongoing, the watchdog said. It opened the probes in 2021 to examine whether the two companies broke U.K. consumer law by failing to protect shoppers. It began looking into phony reviews on some big websites amid the boom in online shopping fueled by the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Phony reviews have long plagued the internet. Some online travel and shopping platforms have banded together to fight fraudulent reviews. Authorities in the U.S. meanwhile have also been trying to crack down, with the Federal Trade Commission banning their sale or purchase and fining businesses and individuals who engage in the practice.",
      "Fake reviews are typically traded on private social media groups between fake review brokers and businesses willing to pay. Sometimes, such reviews are initiated by businesses that offer customers incentives such as gift cards for positive feedback.",

      "Seven families are suing TikTok in France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material",
      "CASSIS, France -- In the moment when her world shattered three years ago, Stephanie Mistre found her 15-year-old daughter, Marie, lifeless in the bedroom where she died by suicide.",
      "\u201cI went from light to darkness in a fraction of a second,\u201d Mistre said, describing the day in September 2021 that marked the start of her fight against TikTok, the Chinese-owned video app she blames for pushing her daughter toward despair.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org. Helplines outside the U.S. can be found at www.iasp.info/suicidalthoughts.",
      "___",
      "Delving into her daughter\u2019s phone after her death, Mistre discovered videos promoting suicide methods, tutorials and comments encouraging users to go beyond \u201cmere suicide attempts.\u201d She said TikTok\u2019s algorithm had repeatedly pushed such content to her daughter.",
      "\u201cIt was brainwashing,\u201d said Mistre, who lives in Cassis, near Marseille, in the south of France. \u201cThey normalized depression and self-harm, turning it into a twisted sense of belonging.\u201d",
      "Now Mistre and six other families are suing TikTok France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material. Out of the seven families, two experienced the loss of a child.",
      "Asked about the lawsuit, TikTok said its guidelines forbid any promotion of suicide and that it employs 40,000 trust and safety professionals worldwide \u2014 hundreds of which are French-speaking moderators \u2014 to remove dangerous posts. The company also said it refers users who search for suicide-related videos to mental health services.",
      "Before killing herself, Marie Le Tiec made several videos to explain her decision, citing various difficulties in her life, and quoted a song by the Louisiana-based emo rap group Suicideboys, who are popular on TikTok.",
      "Her mother also claims that her daughter was repeatedly bullied and harassed at school and online. In addition to the lawsuit, the 51-year-old mother and her husband have filed a complaint against five of Marie\u2019s classmates and her previous high school.",
      "Above all, Mistre blames TikTok, saying that putting the app \"in the hands of an empathetic and sensitive teenager who does not know what is real from what is not is like a ticking bomb.\u201d",
      "Scientists have not established a clear link between social media and mental health problems or psychological harm, said Gr\u00e9goire Borst, a professor of psychology and cognitive neuroscience at Paris-Cit\u00e9 University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to show clear cause and effect in this area,\u201d Borst said, citing a leading peer-reviewed study that found only 0.4% of the differences in teenagers\u2019 well-being could be attributed to social media use.",
      "Additionally, Borst pointed out that no current studies suggest TikTok is any more harmful than rival apps such as Snapchat, X, Facebook or Instagram.",
      "While most teens use social media without significant harm, the real risks, Borst said, lie with those already facing challenges such as bullying or family instability.",
      "\u201cWhen teenagers already feel bad about themselves and spend time exposed to distorted images or harmful social comparisons,\" it can worsen their mental state, Borst said.",
      "Lawyer Laure Boutron-Marmion, who represents the seven families suing TikTok, said their case is based on \u201cextensive evidence.\u201d The company \"can no longer hide behind the claim that it\u2019s not their responsibility because they don\u2019t create the content,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that TikTok\u2019s algorithm is designed to trap vulnerable users in cycles of despair for profit and seeks reparations for the families.",
      "\u201cTheir strategy is insidious,\u201d Mistre said. \u201cThey hook children into depressive content to keep them on the platform, turning them into lucrative re-engagement products.\u201d",
      "Boutron-Marmion noted that TikTok\u2019s Chinese version, Douyin, features much stricter content controls for young users. It includes a \u201cyouth mode\u201d mandatory for users under 14 that restricts screen time to 40 minutes a day and offers only approved content.",
      "\u201cIt proves they can moderate content when they choose to,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said. \u201cThe absence of these safeguards here is telling.\u201d",
      "A report titled \u201cChildren and Screens,\u201d commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron in April and to which Borst contributed, concluded that certain algorithmic features should be considered addictive and banned from any app in France. The report also called for restricting social media access for minors under 15 in France. Neither measure has been adopted.",
      "TikTok, which faced being shut down in the U.S. until President Donald Trump suspended a ban on it, has also come under scrutiny globally.",
      "The U.S. has seen similar legal efforts by parents. One lawsuit in Los Angeles County accuses Meta and its platforms Instagram and Facebook, as well as Snapchat and TikTok, of designing defective products that cause serious injuries. The lawsuit lists three teens who died by suicide. In another complaint, two tribal nations accuse major social media companies, including YouTube owner Alphabet, of contributing to high rates of suicide among Native youths.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to parents who had lost children while testifying last year in the U.S. Senate.",
      "In December, Australia enacted a groundbreaking law banning social media accounts for children under 16.",
      "In France, Boutron-Marmion expects TikTok Limited Technologies, the European Union subsidiary for ByteDance \u2014 the Chinese company that owns TikTok \u2014 to answer the allegations in the first quarter of 2025. Authorities will later decide whether and when a trial would take place.",
      "When contacted by The Associated Press, TikTok said it had not been notified about the French lawsuit, which was filed in November. It could take months for the French justice system to process the complaint and for authorities in Ireland \u2014 home to TikTok\u2019s European headquarters \u2014 to formally notify the company, Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "Instead, a Tiktok spokesperson highlighted company guidelines that prohibit content promoting suicide or self-harm.",
      "Critics argue that TikTok\u2019s claims of robust moderation fall short.",
      "Imran Ahmed, the CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, dismissed TikTok\u2019s assertion that over 98.8% of harmful videos had been flagged and removed between April and June.",
      "When asked about the blind spots of their moderation efforts, social media platforms claim that users are able to bypass detection by using ambiguous language or allusions that algorithms struggle to flag, Ahmed said.",
      "The term \u201calgospeak\u201d has been coined to describe techniques such as using zebra or armadillo emojis to talk about cutting yourself, or the Swiss flag emoji as an allusion to suicide.",
      "Such code words \"aren\u2019t particularly sophisticated,\u201d Ahmed said. \"The only reason TikTok can\u2019t find them when independent researchers, journalists and others can is because they\u2019re not looking hard enough,\u201d Ahmed said.",
      "Ahmed\u2019s organization conducted a study in 2022 simulating the experience of a 13-year-old girl on TikTok.",
      "\u201cWithin 2.5 minutes, the accounts were served self-harm content,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cBy eight minutes, they saw eating disorder content. On average, every 39 seconds, the algorithm pushed harmful material.\u201d",
      "The algorithm \u201cknows that eating disorder and self-harm content is especially addictive\u201d for young girls.",
      "For Mistre, the fight is deeply personal. Sitting in her daughter\u2019s room, where she has kept the decor untouched for the last three years, she said parents must know about the dangers of social media.",
      "Had she known about the content being sent to her daughter, she never would have allowed her on TikTok, she said. Her voice breaks as she describes Marie as a \u201csunny, funny\u201d teenager who dreamed of becoming a lawyer.",
      "\u201cIn memory of Marie, I will fight as long as I have the strength,\u201d she said. \u201cParents need to know the truth. We must confront these platforms and demand accountability.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk is clashing with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the Stargate artificial intelligence infrastructure project touted by President Donald Trump, the latest in a feud between the two tech billionaires that started on OpenAI's board and is now testing Musk's influence with the new president.",
      "Trump on Tuesday had talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion through a new partnership formed by OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, alongside Oracle and SoftBank.",
      "The new entity, Stargate, is already starting to build out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of fast-evolving AI technology.",
      "Trump declared it \u201ca resounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential\u201d under his new administration, with an initial private investment of $100 billion that could reach five times that sum.",
      "But Musk, a close Trump adviser who helped bankroll his campaign and now leads a government cost-cutting initiative, questioned the value of the investment hours later.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t actually have the money,\u201d Musk wrote on his social platform X. \u201cSoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\u201d",
      "Altman responded Wednesday to say Musk was \u201cwrong, as you surely know\u201d and inviting Musk to come visit the first site in Texas that is already under construction.",
      "\"(T)his is great for the country. i realize what is great for the country isn\u2019t always what\u2019s optimal for your companies, but in your new role i hope you\u2019ll mostly put (America) first,\u201d Altman wrote, using a U.S. flag emoji to represent America.",
      "The public clash over Stargate is part of a years-long dispute between Musk and Altman that began with a boardroom rivalry over who should run OpenAI, which both men helped found.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company last year alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.",
      "Musk has since escalated the dispute, adding new claims and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully. A hearing is set for February in a California federal court.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man, whose companies include Tesla, SpaceX and X, last year started his own rival AI company, xAI, that is building its own big data center in Memphis, Tennessee. Musk says it faces unfair competition from OpenAI and its close business partner Microsoft, which has supplied the huge computing resources needed to build AI systems such as ChatGPT.",
      "Tech news outlet The Information first reported on an OpenAI data center project called Stargate in March 2024, indicating that it's been in the works long before Trump announced it.",
      "Another company \u2014 Crusoe Energy Systems \u2014 announced in July it was building a large and \u201cspecially designed AI data center\u201d at the northwest edge of Abilene, Texas at a site run by energy technology company Lancium. Crusoe and Lancium said in a joint statement at the time that the project was \u201csupported by a multibillion-dollar investment\u201d but didn't disclose its backers.",
      "AI technology requires huge amounts of electricity to build and operate and both companies said the project would be powered with renewable sources such as nearby solar farms, in a way that Lancium CEO Michael McNamara said would \u201cdeliver the maximum amount of green energy at the lowest possible cost.\u201d Crusoe said it would own and develop the facility.",
      "It's not clear how and when that project became the first phase of the Stargate investment revealed by Trump. Abilene Mayor Weldon Hurt said construction began about nine months ago but \u201cwe didn\u2019t know it was going to be quite this big. We thought it was going to be about a third of this size.\u201d",
      "Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said Tuesday that the Abilene project is the first of about 10 data center buildings currently being built and that number could expand to 20.",
      "Hurt told The Associated Press that the region surrounding Abilene, a city of about 130,000 people, benefits from a wealth of energy sources, including oil, gas, solar and some of the \u201clargest wind farms in the world,\u201d though Trump signaled opposition to wind power this week by temporarily halting approval of wind projects on federal lands.",
      "\u201cWe have the capability to produce the energy for this market so it really means a lot for a town like Abilene,\u201d Hurt said. \u201cTo have this opportunity here in west-central Texas, to have something like this to make Abilene substantial, we\u2019re just excited about it.\u201d",
      "Missing from Trump's press conference Tuesday was Microsoft, which has long supported OpenAI with billions of dollars in investments and enabling its data centers to be used to build the models behind ChatGPT and other generative AI tools.",
      "Microsoft is also a technology partner in the Stargate project, along with chipmakers Nvidia and Arm, but put out a statement noting that its OpenAI partnership will \u201cevolve\u201d in a way that enables OpenAI \u201cto build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models.\u201d",
      "Asked about Musk's comments about the Stargate deal Wednesday during a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella pivoted to his company's own $80 billion plan to build out its global AI infrastructure, of which $50 billion is being spent in the U.S.",
      "\u201cLook, all I know is, I\u2019m good for my $80 billion,\u201d said Nadella, laughing."

Trump also recently signed executive orders restricting transgender participation in the military, ending federal legal recognition of transgender people, and restricting gender marker changes on federal documents.",
      "Major national medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and more than 20 others argue that gender-affirming care is safe, effective, beneficial, and medically necessary.",
      "Amid an increase in states moving to ban gender-affirming youth care, the American Psychological Association said in February it opposes state bans, \"which are contrary to the principles of evidence-based healthcare, human rights, and social justice, and which should be reconsidered in favor of policies that prioritize the well-being and autonomy of transgender, gender-diverse, and nonbinary individuals.\"",
      "Trump's executive order states that \"it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.\"",
      "The order also moves to exclude transgender-related coverage for young people from federal health insurance policies, including the Department of Defense's TRICARE benefits, the Federal Employee Health Benefits and the Postal Service Health Benefits.",
      "Trump's order expressed concerns that gender-affirming care sterilizes children, saying: \"countless children soon regret that they have been mutilated and begin to grasp the horrifying tragedy that they will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding.\"",
      "Medical experts previously told ABC News that they have not yet seen widespread, long-term fertility issues in puberty-aged youth who temporarily use puberty blockers while undergoing puberty and that hormone therapy does not necessarily make transgender people permanently sterilized, but that it does affect fertility. National guidelines state that physicians should thoroughly warn patients about the potential for reduced fertility before administering hormone therapy.",
      "Gender-affirming surgeries for transgender youth older than 12 are extremely rare, and those that are performed are almost entirely chest-related procedures, according to research in JAMA Network.",
      "A separate study by researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health additionally found little to no usage of gender-affirming surgeries by transgender and gender-diverse minors in the U.S., instead finding that cisgender minors and adults had substantially higher utilization of such gender-affirming surgeries -- such as breast-reduction surgeries for cisgender boys and young men -- than their transgender counterparts.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 20:55:44 -0500",
    "summary": "The Constitution, federal law and court decisions make it clear: President Donald Trump's order to pause federal funding is against the law, legal experts tell ABC News.",
    "story": [
      "They predicted courts would block his move to usurp congressional power.",
      "Despite all the confusion over the impact of his sudden move Tuesday, the Constitution, federal law and court decisions make it clear, experts tell ABC News: President Donald Trump's  controversial executive order to indefinitely pause federal funding is illegal.",
      "\"The basic idea is the power of the purse is given by Article I to Congress,\" Michael Dorf, constitutional law professor at Cornell University Law School, told ABC News. \"If Congress says you're spending that much money on the federal programs, that's how much is being spent. The president cannot stop it even temporarily.\"",
      "While past presidents have tried to impound -- or hold back -- federal funding in specific cases, Trump's directive to indefinitely freeze financial assistance, grants and loans and foreign aid has taken it to a new level, according to Steve Vladeck, a professor of law at Georgetown Law School.",
      "A federal judge agreed Tuesday and temporarily blocked the funding pause from taking effect until next week.",
      "Despite Trump's influence and GOP backing of most of his policies, the experts warned that his orders have no legal ground to stand on -- and history has shown that such blatant disregard for legislative power has been consistently overruled.",
      "\"It's a question of when, not if, this block is overturned by the courts,\" Vladeck told ABC News.",
      "The use of executive power to curtail federal spending came to the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1970s when President Richard Nixon ordered the Environmental Protection Agency not to dole out funding for various programs, including water treatment. The Supreme Court ruled in 1975 in Train v. City of New York that the president had no power to overrule Congress by impounding funding.",
      "Dorf said the controversy over the move led Congress in 1974 to pass the Impoundment Control Act that closed some loopholes and made it harder for a president to try to stop spending money lawmakers allocated.",
      "\"Congress passed this statue this very particular rules of what exactly the president has to do if he wants to not spend money on money Congress has spent,\" Dorf explained. \"He can ask Congress to for a recission, but there is a 45-day clock and a bunch of procedures, none of which have been followed by Trump.\"",
      "Trump's decree, which ordered all funding to pause at 5 p.m. Tuesday, cited vague reasoning for the indefinite halt claiming the White House Office of Management and Budget wanted to review funding that contradicted the president's previous executive order and \"advanced Marxist equity, transgenderism and green new deal social engineering policies.\"",
      "The order was done at the behalf of the acting head of the OMB.",
      "Several challenges to the act and executive impoundment have come through the courts, including the 1998 Supreme Court case Clinton v. City of New York that challenged President Clinton's use of a line-item veto to cut funding, the courts have ruled against executive impoundments.",
      "Vladeck said the broad and vague conditions used to \"shut off the entire tap,\" violate those precedents and legal language set by the courts.",
      "\"They're likely to make a case that this is not an impoundment because it is temporary,\" Vladeck said of Trump's legal team. \"However, the Impoundment Act strictly forbids even a short stop in funding.\"",
      "The experts said Trump's actions were telegraphed by the right wing think tank Project 2025 which proposed using a similar funding tactic, but they questioned whether those proposals were thought through legally.",
      "\"During the first Trump administration they botched a bunch of things if they got better lawyers, such adding citizenship question to the census or ending DACA, Dorf said. \"It may be that lawyers may not have been consulted and whoever in the budget office decided to say, 'Do what you can and see what you can get away with.'\"",
      "Court action has been swift as within hours of Trump's order several state attorneys general and other groups filed suits looking to block the impoundment. U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan ordered a stay that blocks the policy from taking effect until 5 p.m. on Feb. 3.",
      "\"It seems like the Federal Government currently doesn't actually know the full scope of the programs that are going to be subject to the pause,\" she said.",
      "Vladeck said he wouldn't be surprised if the order went to the Supreme Court and was confident that the court would overrule the president.",
      "He noted that last May, the court ruled 7-2 in a case that upheld the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and how Congress decided to fund the agency, despite huge support from conservatives looking to defund the agency.",
      "\"I know folks are pretty locked in their views of the Supreme Court but I do not expect this to be a case that divides the justices down the middle,\" he said.",
      "Vladeck did warn that while this case is being worked out in the courts, millions of people will be at risk due to the limbo by the uncertainty left by the order.",
      "Many organizations, non-profits and local governments have no idea if they've lost federal funding for key programs such as school meals, Medicaid and that confusion has been trickling down on the public, he said. Even if the funding is restored soon, the public has already taken a hit, according to Vladeck.",
      "\"On a scale from 1 to 10, this is a 13. This is not just about the money,\" he said.",

    "summary": "A federal judge has heard competing testimony over a request to block the nation's fourth execution using nitrogen gas",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge has heard competing testimony over a request to block the nation's fourth execution using nitrogen gas",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- The state of Alabama urged a federal judge Tuesday to allow the nation's fourth execution with nitrogen gas to proceed next week, but a doctor who witnessed an earlier execution by the new method told the judge the inmate appeared to be in distress and awake minutes longer than officials predicted.",
      "Alabama has carried out all three of the nation's executions using the gas and has set a Feb. 6 execution date for Demetrius Terrence Frazier, 52. But attorneys for Frazier, who was convicted of the 1991 rape and murder of a woman in Birmingham, sought the hearing asking the court to intervene.",
      "Frazier\u2019s attorneys urged the judge to block the execution unless the state makes changes to its protocol, such as giving the inmate the same sedative used at the start of lethal injections before the gas begins flowing. Separately Tuesday, Frazier's mother and death penalty opponents asked Michigan's governor to bring Frazier back there to finish a life sentence in the state for a separate murder conviction in the killing of a 14-year-old girl. Michigan has no death penalty.",
      "Alabama's method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen. The state maintained Tuesday that the method brings swift death.",
      "Dylan L. Mauldin, assistant solicitor general for Alabama, called Frazier\u2019s legal maneuver a tactic to delay his execution and said the court should deny his request for a preliminary injunction. Mauldin noted the U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled the method unconstitutional.",
      "Meanwhile, a lawyer for Frazier, argued that inmates executed with the gas appeared to be conscious for some minutes, instead of the 30 to 40 seconds he said the state predicted.",
      "U.S. District Judge Emily Marks questioned Frazier\u2019s attorney about why she should intervene when the courts have previously let nitrogen executions go forward.",
      "\u201cSomething is going wrong. Every inmate who has been executed by nitrogen gas has exhibited signs of consciousness beyond the 40 seconds,\u201d Spencer Hahn, an attorney for Frazier, responded.",
      "Dr. Brian McAlary, an anesthesiologist who witnessed the November execution of Carey Dale Grayson, testified that he observed clear \u201cevidence of distress\u201d in the prisoner. He noted Grayson moved his head back and forth, had rapid eye movements and struggled against his restraints.",
      "McAlary said he believed Grayson\u2019s last voluntary movement occurred after about three minutes when he simultaneously raised both legs and held them in the air before letting them fall down. McAlary said he believed the movement was voluntary because \u201cboth legs were moved at exactly the same time, direction and distance.\u201d",
      "The testimony was the first time a medical doctor had testified about observations during a nitrogen execution. The court was previously given news accounts from journalists and the observations of prison staff.",
      "Dr. Joseph Antognini, an anesthesiologist hired by the state as an expert witness, gave competing testimony that such movements did not necessarily indicate Grayson was conscious. Antognini did not witness Grayson\u2019s execution.",
      "\u201cMovement can happen in the absence of pain,\u201d Antognini said. He gave examples of instances when he saw patients move involuntarily during surgery while unconscious. But he acknowledged he had never seen movements like a double leg lift during surgery.",
      "Frazier was in the courtroom throughout, shackled and taking notes in handcuffs on a legal pad.",
      "Alabama Corrections Commissioner John Hamm testified that Grayson was combative at the start of his execution, cursing the warden and raising his middle fingers as he was strapped to the gurney. Hamm testified that he thought Grayson\u2019s head movements were an effort to knock the mask loose.",
      "Frazier's supporters had also argued he should be in a Michigan prison instead of Alabama's death row.",
      "Frazier was first convicted in Michigan and sentenced to life in prison for the 1992 murder of a 14-year-old girl. Prosecutors said Frazier while in police custody in Michigan, confessed to raping and shooting Brown in Alabama after stealing about $80 from her purse. He was convicted in Alabama and given the death penalty. The then governors of Alabama and Michigan agreed in 2011 to place him on Alabama's death row.",
      "Frazier's attorneys had filed a separate appeal to have him sent to Michigan to finish his life sentence there but dropped the request after Michigan\u2019s attorney general wrote in a court filing that Michigan doesn't seek his return.",
      "Death penalty opponents and Frazier\u2019s mother made a last-minute plea to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to intervene and request that Frazier be sent back to Michigan.",
      "\u201cPlease bring my son back to Michigan. Please don't let Alabama kill my son if you can stop it,\u201d Carol Frazier wrote in the letter to Whitmer.",
      "Whitmer\u2019s office declined to comment.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 12:04:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Presidential immunity does not protect Donald Trump from having to pay E. Jean Carroll tens of millions of dollars for defaming her, Carroll's lawyer argued Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Trump is appealing a jury's verdict that awarded Carroll $83 million in damages.",
      "Presidential immunity does not protect Donald Trump from having to pay tens of millions of dollars in damages after being held liable for defaming magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, a lawyer for Carroll told a federal appeals court in a filing Monday.",
      "After being awarded an $83.3 million defamation judgment from a jury last year, Carroll on Monday urged the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to uphold the judgment against Trump, after Trump asked the court to toss out the verdict because he had immunity as president.",
      "\"Dissatisfied with the outcome of the judicial process, Trump now asks this Court to set aside that jury verdict on the theory that he was actually immune from judicial review all along,\" Carroll's attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote in the filing.",
      "In 2023, a jury held Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll in a dressing room of a Manhattan department store in the 1990s, awarding Carroll $5 million in damages. A year later, a different jury in a separate trial ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83 million in damages for defaming her in a 2022 social media post in which he called her allegations \"a Hoax and a lie\" and said \"This woman is not my type!\"",
      "A federal appeals court upheld the $5 million judgment in December, and Trump's appeal of the $83 million judgement is ongoing.",
      "In September, Trump attorney D. John Sauer -- who Trump nominated in November to serve as the new solicitor general -- told a federal appeals court that the $83 million judgment should be thrown out based on a flawed jury instruction, a series of \"highly prejudicial errors\" during the trial, and because presidential immunity protects Trump from liability for public statements made as president.",
      "\"Presidential immunity forecloses any liability here and requires the complete dismissal of all claims,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "In her reply brief filed Monday, Kaplan pushed back against Trump's assertion of immunity, arguing that statements Trump made about Carroll as president would clearly fall outside of his official responsibilities.",
      "\"If there were ever a case where immunity does not shield a President's speech, this one is it,\" Kaplan wrote. \"Donald Trump was not speaking here about a governmental policy or a function of his responsibilities as President. He was defaming Carroll because of her revelation that many years before he assumed office, he sexually assaulted her.\"",
      "Carroll's attorney argued that the $83 million judgement was justified to deter Trump from further defamatory statements, a risk that Kaplan said the jury saw firsthand. Trump attended most days of the 2024 trial, criticizing Carroll as a liar from his seat in the courtroom and sparring with the judge who oversaw the case.",
      "\"Throughout the trial, the jury had a front-row seat to Trump's relentless campaign of malice, including his repeated defamation of Carroll at press conferences he held and in statements he posted on social media while the trial was ongoing,\" Kaplan wrote.",

    "summary": "Interest in buying Greenland has \"popped up from time to time in American politics,\" Tom H\u00f8yem, Denmark's former minister to Greenland, told ABC News in an interview.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump claimed ownership of Greenland is an \"absolute necessity.\"",
      "As President Donald Trump makes a very public effort to acquire Greenland, one former Danish official said Trump's attempts are nothing new -- but he shouldn't expect it to be easy. Interest in buying Greenland has \"popped up from time to time in American politics,\" Tom H\u00f8yem, Denmark's minister to Greenland from 1982 to 1987, told ABC News in an interview.",
      "H\u00f8yem, 83, discussed Greenland's political importance over the years, as well as his reaction to Trump's recent desire to buy the island territory.",
      "\"Trump is living in a narrative where this has been an issue for the last 150 years,\" H\u00f8yem said.",
      "The purchase of Greenland has been a topic of conversation since before World War II, when Denmark sold the Danish West Indies -- now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands -- to the United States in 1917 for $25 million, H\u00f8yem said. Many American policymakers argued the U.S. should also acquire Greenland as well, according to H\u00f8yem.",
      "\"[President] Woodrow Wilson at first said, 'No, it's not worth anything at all. It's just ice. I don't want it.' But there was such a big debate in the U.S. that he was forced to do something,\" H\u00f8yem said.",
      "When Wilson asked for ownership of Greenland, the Danish minister at the time replied, \"No,\" according to H\u00f8yem. Wilson signed an agreement in 1917 stating the United States recognizes Greenland as Danish, H\u00f8yem said.",
      "In the document discussing the transfer of the Danish West Indies, then-Secretary of State Robert Lansing wrote, \"In preceding this day to the signature of the Convention respecting the cessation of the Danish West-Indian Island to the United States of America, the undersigned Secretary of State of the United States of America, duly authorized by his Government, has the honor to declare that the Government of the United States of America will not object to the Danish Government extending their political and economic interests to the whole of Greenland.\"",
      "If Denmark was to ever sell Greenland to any country, H\u00f8yem said the United Kingdom would receive the first right to buy it, since the U.K. held dominion over Canada at the time of the treaty.",
      "\"Canada is only 20 kilometers away. That's why the British said, 'If Denmark ever sells Greenland, we should be the first to decide whether to take it or not,'\" H\u00f8yem told ABC News.",
      "Now, with Trump saying he wants to purchase Greenland, H\u00f8yem said history is repeating itself.",
      "\"Trump grew up hearing these stories,\" H\u00f8yem said. \"His generation and his parents' generation often heard about U.S. attempts to buy Greenland.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly expressed his interest in acquiring the island territory, beginning during his first administration when he tried to buy Greenland, but instead gave $12 million for economic development. Trump has since restated his interest in buying the territory shortly before his second inauguration.",
      "\"For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,\" Trump said in a December 2024 statement.",
      "Trump said the purchase was needed for security purposes, adding he is \"protecting the free world.\" The U.S. also operates Putiffik Space Base, the Defense Department's northern-most base, which sits on the coast of Greenland. The U.S. does not pay Greenland for operating the base in the country, H\u00f8yem said, as part of a NATO agreement signed in 1951.",
      "\"You have approximately 45,000 people there. People really don't even know if Denmark has any legal right to it,\" Trump said, without explanation, during a Jan. 7 press conference at Mar-a-Lago. \"But if they do, they should give it up because we need it for national security. That's for the free world.\"",
      "Greenland is also rich in valuable minerals, including rare earth metals, precious metals, precious stones, and uranium, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Association. While that may sound appealing to a potential buyer, H\u00f8yem said mining there is extremely expensive.",
      "Trump's son, Donald Trump, Jr., visited Greenland on Jan. 7, but stated the visit was for personal reasons. During this trip, his father said on social media, \"Don. Jr. and my Reps landing in Greenland. The reception has been great. They, and the Free World, need safety, security, strength and PEACE! This is a deal that must happen.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio also reiterated an interest in the U.S. securing Greenland during his Senate confirmation hearings.",
      "\"Putting aside all the things that are going on in the media, I think we need to understand that Greenland's been strategically important to the United States and to the West for a very long time,\" Rubio said. \"I think we now have the opportunity to see it for what it is, and that is one, if not the most important, one of the most critical parts of the world over the next 50 to 100 years will be whether there's going to be freedom of navigation in the Arctic and what that will mean for global trade and commerce.\"",
      "H\u00f8yem said he does not know Trump, but thinks \"he needs to be briefed a bit more by his civil servants.\"",
      "\"His new minister of foreign affairs spoke to the Danish foreign minister -- my party leader and friend -- and they both agreed: 'Let's not discuss Greenland for now,'\" H\u00f8yem said.",
      "The prime minister of Greenland, M\u00fate Egsede, has rejected the idea of selling Greenland to Trump, saying, \"Greenland is ours.\"",
      "\"We are not for sale and will never be for sale,\" Egsede said in a statement. \"We must not lose our long struggle for freedom.\"",
      "Officials from Denmark also have not supported Trump's Greenmark proposal, including Danish politician Anders Vistisen, who explicitly urged the newly elected president to \"f--- off.\"",
      "\"Greenland has been part of the Danish kingdom for 800 years,\" Vistisen said during a European Parliament meeting on Jan. 21 in Strasbourg, France. \"It's an integrated part of our country. It is not for sale.\"",
      "H\u00f8yem said if Greenland decided to become independent, \"they would immediately be targeted by major global powers.\" Until then, H\u00f8yem said the territory needs more U.S. military investment to help defend it.",
      "\"I personally can't imagine Greenland becoming fully independent,\" H\u00f8yem said. \"Running a country that large with so few people is nearly impossible.\"",
      "Regardless of the future of Trump's Greenland proposal, H\u00f8yem said the land holds significant power.",
      "\"Trump might have looked at Greenland as a real estate deal, but for Denmark and Greenland, it's a matter of geopolitical survival,\" H\u00f8yem said. \"The Arctic is extremely important, and I agree with Trump on that.\"",

Not only are critics wary of her lack of intelligence experience, they have also accused her of promoting an anti-American agenda, including blaming the U.S. for the war in Ukraine and being sympathetic to U.S. adversaries.",

      "Internal communications reviewed by ABC News show that the Trump administration plans to strictly implement an executive order from the president mandating a 90-day freeze on almost all U.S. foreign aid amid a review, a measure that already has sparked widespread concern among humanitarian organizations.",
      "\"We get tired of giving massive amounts of money to countries that hate us, don't we?\" President Donald Trump said in a speech during the House Republicans' annual retreat in Florida on Monday, touting a blizzard of executive actions he had taken since returning to the White House.",
      "In a memo sent to U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) staff over the weekend, a high-level official within the agency stressed their \"responsibility\" to carry out Trump's directive and signaled that it would be difficult to secure waivers to continue funding for programs during the pause, which he called \"a complete halt.\"",
      "\"It is important to emphasize that it is no longer business as usual. Every program will be thoroughly scrutinized,\" Ken Jackson, USAID's assistant to the administrator for management and resources, wrote.",
      "Jackson said that the agency's only exceptions currently in place covered spending on emergency humanitarian food aid and travel for government officials who were returning to their duty stations, adding that employees should be ready \"to provide detailed information and justification\" for these expenses.",
      "Any waivers for other spending would need to clear multiple hurdles for approval, including proving that the program receiving funding was lifesaving or necessary for U.S. national security.",
      "Failure to comply with the pause or other new policies \"will result in disciplinary action,\" Jackson warned USAID staff.",
      "That warning was not an empty threat. Late Monday, multiple sources said that nearly 60 senior USAID officials had been placed on leave, including nearly all senior attorneys for the agency.",
      "According to an email obtained by ABC News, acting USAID administrator Jason Gray accused the agency of skirting Trump's executive orders but provided no information about the alleged violations.",

      "By then, panic had already set in among international aid groups that rely on U.S. funding. Sources within the international community said the freeze was so expansive that they could hardly believe it was real.",
      "\"The recent stop-work cable from the State Department suspends programs that support America's global leadership and creates dangerous vacuums that China and our adversaries will quickly fill,\" InterAction, the largest alliance of international aid organizations, said in a statement.",
      "\"This halt interrupts critical life-saving work including clean water to infants, basic education for kids, ending the trafficking of girls, and providing medications to children and others suffering from disease. It stops assistance in countries critical to U.S. interests, including Taiwan, Syria, and Pakistan. And, it halts decades of life-saving work through PEPFAR that helps babies to be born HIV-free,\" the statement continued.",
      "Beyond concern for their work, some organizations and officials have also expressed confusion. Many were caught off guard by the State Department's implementation of Trump's order, which they initially believed wouldn't impact programs funded through congressional appropriations.",
      "\"The aid community is grappling with just how existential this aid suspension is - we know this will have life or death consequences for millions around the globe, as programs that depend on this funding grind to a halt without a plan or safety net,\" Abby Maxman, the president and CEO of Oxfam, said in a statement to ABC News.",
      "\"This decision must be reversed, and funding and programming must be allowed to move forward. But at the very least, the administration must communicate clearly so the aid community can plan for the future and determine how to carry on our lifesaving work,\" Maxman added.",
      "Critics of the freeze believe dissent from international aid organizations and U.S. officials has been muted due to fear of retribution from the administration.",
      "In his memo to USAID employees, Jackson stipulated that one of the new policies they must comply with if they wished to avoid disciplinary action was a requirement that all external communication, including with the State Department, first be approved by the agency.",

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, during her first press briefing on Tuesday, faced a barrage of questions on the administration's freeze on federal financial assistance programs that congressional Democrats called flatly illegal.",
      "Agencies faced a 5 p.m. ET deadline to comply with a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget to cease spending on any grant or loan programs if they suspect it might conflict with President Donald Trump's recent executive orders on DEI, foreign aid, climate spending and more.",
      "A federal judge on Tuesday, within minutes of that deadline, issued a brief administration stay of the policy during a virtual hearing. The stay blocks the policy from taking effect until 5 p.m. ET on Feb. 3.",
      "The memo prompted widespread confusion among advocacy organizations and state officials, some of whom reported error messages when trying to access portals to draw down funds for Medicaid, community health centers and more.",
      "A legal challenge was filed by nonprofits and health groups who argue the Office of Management and Budget is exceeding its authority. Democrats, too, are slamming the move as illegal and note the funds have been appropriated by Congress.",
      "\"There's no uncertainty in this building,\" Leavitt said when asked to clarify about exactly what programs will be impacted.",
      "\"Social Security benefits, Medicare benefits, food stamps, welfare benefits, assistance that is going directly to individuals will not be impacted by this pause,\" she said.",
      "Leavitt later added, \"However, it is the responsibility of this president and this administration to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars. That is something that President Trump campaigned on.\"",
      "Leavitt said the freeze was temporary, but did not expand on a specific timeline on when it would end.",
      "When asked if Medicaid was impacted by the pause, Leavitt couldn't immediately say from the podium and she would \"check back.\" She also did not directly respond to a question on the impact on organizations like Meals on Wheels, which provides meals to 2.2 million seniors, or Head Start, a program for preschool education, that receive federal funding.",
      "Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden posted on social media about reports about Medicaid portals being down in states as he criticized the freeze.",
      "Leavitt, after the briefing, wrote on X: \"The White House is aware of the Medicaid website portal outage. We have confirmed no payments have been affected -- they are still being processed and sent. We expect the portal will be back online shortly.\"",
      "An OMB memo obtained by ABC News Senior Political Correspondent Rachel Scott also sought to shed light on the freeze's implications.",
      "According to the memo, \"in addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause.\"",
      "\"Funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance, and other similar programs will not be paused,\" the document read. \"If agencies are concerned that these programs may implicate the President\u2019s Executive Orders, they should consult OMB to begin to unwind these objectionable policies without a pause in the payments.\"",
      "Still, the pause could have sweeping implication as the federal government funds thousands of programs, including housing subsidies and educational grants.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency, which gives grants for an array of national, state and tribal programs -- including some to assist with air and water quality -- said on Tuesday it was temporarily pausing disbursement.",
      "While Democrats are vowing to push back on the directive, Republicans are coming to the administration's defense.",

      "\"This is a work in progress. Everybody. Take a deep breath. Stay calm. Every one of these programs is going to be looked at,\" GOP Sen. James Risch said, arguing that Trump is taking this action as a way to tackle inflation and oversized government spending.",

      "He says, if confirmed, he can still earn referral fees from a firm suing Merck.",
      "In 2020, as a pandemic raged across the globe, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took to social media to appeal to his hundreds of thousands of followers on Facebook.",
      "The son of the late U.S. Attorney General and New York Sen. Bobby Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy, the younger Kennedy said he was looking for parents whose children had been vaccinated against a different virus -- human papillomavirus or HPV -- and later grew sick.",
      "Public health researchers and doctors said there was no evidence that the vaccine, Gardasil, was linked to the health problems he cited, noting 160 favorable studies on safety. A federal court created to compensate people injured by vaccines also had already rejected a similar claim, citing \"insufficient proof\" that the vaccine was behind the plaintiff's health issues.",
      "But in his posts, Kennedy said that he and lawyer Michael Baum \u2013 whom Kennedy calls \"one of my closest friends\" -- believed there was still a path forward. The families could sue the manufacturer Merck in civil court claiming marketing fraud \u2013 allegations Merck denies.",
      "\"If you have been injured by Gardasil, call us,\" Kennedy wrote on Facebook, posting a toll-free number invoking his famous initials \"RFK.\"",
      "According to financial disclosure documents released last week, Kennedy's primary source of income in the past year were large sums of referral fees from multiple law firms, including Baum's office, whose civil lawsuit against Merck's Gardasil vaccine went to trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court last week.",
      "Kennedy's leading role in building a case against Merck is now raising questions about how he might wield his power as the nation's next health secretary \u2013 a job intended as an impartial overseer in public health \u2013 while in line for potential payouts from a major pharmaceutical company.",
      "\"This disclosure shows that RFK Jr. made millions off of peddling dangerous anti-vaccine conspiracies,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is a Democratic member of the Senate Finance Committee that will oversee Kennedy's nomination.",
      "\"Even worse, if he is confirmed, his finances will still be tied to the outcomes of anti-vaccine lawsuits -- even as he'd be tasked with regulating them as health secretary. These are outrageous conflicts of interest that endanger public health,\" Warren said in a statement provided to reporters.",
      "Kennedy, who is expected to testify for the first time Wednesday before the Senate panel, said he has resigned his work with several law firms, including Wisner Baum, and that if confirmed he would no longer be involved in legal cases.",
      "But in a plan greenlit by federal ethics officials, Kennedy said he plans to retain his right to 10% of fees awarded in contingency cases with Wisner Baum, so long as the cases don't involve the U.S. government. The federal government is not a party in the civil lawsuit against Merck.",
      "\"I am entitled to receive a portion of future recovery in these cases based upon the set percentage as set forth in the referral agreement,\" he wrote.",
      "Kennedy disclosed another $856,559 in income from Wisner Baum referral fees, although the documents do not say which legal cases were tied to those fees. Other income included $8.8 million from his firm Kennedy & Madonna. Kennedy said he was terminating his relationship with the firm, which would no longer use his name.",
      "A spokesperson for Kennedy declined to comment on the record.",
      "Baum said on Monday that Kennedy was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in the Gardasil case, but has not received any compensation related to the lawsuit so far.",
      "\u201cUntil he began running for president, he was co-counsel, not just referring counsel,\" Baum wrote in an email. \"His accumulation of science articles and connections to expert scientists willing to work on the Gardasil case was instrumental to establishing a basis and path for litigating Gardasil induced injury cases.\"",
      "He also is pushing back against suggestions that the the lawsuit is \"anti-vaccine.\u201d Baum said Merck failed to properly warn patients of potential side effects.",
      "In a statement on the civil lawsuit, Merck said \"an overwhelming body of scientific evidence, including more than 30 years of research and development along with real world evidence generated by Merck and by independent investigators, continues to support the safety and efficacy of our HPV vaccines. The plaintiff's allegations have no merit, and we remain committed to vigorously defending against these claims.\"",
      "Robert Krakow, a New York lawyer who specializes in vaccine injury cases and has worked with Kennedy in the past, said referral fees are fairly standard when it comes to personal injury claims.",
      "Kennedy has been a \"galvanizing force\" when it came to questioning vaccine safety, providing a special touch when talking to families because \"he was very sincere and listened to people,\" Krakow said. Using social media platforms to recruit clients is a natural extension of that work, he said.",
      "\"It's not often you have a celebrity do that,\" Krakow said of Kennedy's work to find clients who claim vaccine injuries. \"But there's nothing inherently wrong with recruiting people for referral fees.\"",
      "Reuters was first to report Kennedy's extensive role in the Gardasil vaccine lawsuit.",
      "Because Kennedy's financial arrangement was allowed by ethics officials, it's not clear whether the issue will be a sticking point for Republicans eager to align with Trump. According to the agreement released last week, Kennedy can keep the fees from Wisner Baum so long as the independent ethics office at the Health and Human Services Department determines the case does \"not involve the United States as a party and in which the United States does not have a direct and substantial interest.\"",
      "Kennedy also has insisted in private meetings with senators that he is not \"anti-vaccine,\" but only wants more study, according to one person familiar with the discussions.",
      "The messaging aligns with what Kennedy has said publicly. Kennedy often notes he was vaccinated as a child and opted to vaccinate his own children decades ago. His work as chair and chief litigator of the Children's Heath Defense, which opposes the recommended schedule of vaccines for children, did not begin until around 2015.",
      "\"What I've said is I'm pro-science and pro-safety,\" he told a local New Hampshire television station in 2023.",
      "Still, public health experts and many senators -- several of them old enough to remember serious outbreaks of measles and polio in the 1950s -- have expressed serious concerns about his role in eroding confidence in vaccines, even if he says he won't outright block access to them.",
      "\"We potentially face a massive health hazard, maybe especially for our children,\" said Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.",
      "Sanders, who had been seen as someone who might be able to find common ground with Kennedy on environmental and food policy, said the concern with the incoming administration was that \"we may revert back to those terrible days when so many children died\" before age 3.",
      "As head of the Health and Human Services Department, Kennedy would be responsible for the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the selling and marketing of vaccines, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which collects data on vaccines to issue public health recommendations that are closely followed by doctors.",
      "If confirmed, he could insist upon appointing vaccine skeptics to the independent group that reviews FDA data on vaccines.",
      "Kennedy also could alter how information is used from CDC's public reporting system known as \"VAERS\" that allows anyone to flag possible adverse reactions from vaccines. The reports are unverified but used to look for potential patterns that can be investigated.",
      "Health officials say symptoms reported in VAERS are often found to be unrelated from a person's immunization history.",
      "Dorit Reiss, a professor at UC Law San Francisco and expert in legal issues on vaccinations, said handing over that process to someone with Kennedy's track record would be unprecedented.",

    "story": [
      "Florida lawmakers have passed a sweeping immigration bill, setting aside half a billion dollars in public funds to help carry out President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on people in the country illegally",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida lawmakers passed a sweeping immigration bill Tuesday, setting aside half a billion dollars in public funds to help carry out President Donald Trump 's crackdown on those in the country illegally.",
      "In a state where roughly one in every five residents is an immigrant, the legislation would require every level of government \u2014 as well as government contractors \u2014 to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement \u201cto the fullest extent possible.\u201d",
      "Following more than four hours of deliberations on Tuesday, Florida's Republican-dominated Legislature passed the measure largely along party lines. The passage sets up a showdown between Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and state legislative leaders, who have sparred over whose proposals would better carry out Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. DeSantis has called the bill \u201cweak.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe whole goal of this bill is to help President Trump do his job,\u201d said Republican Sen. Gruters, one of the bill sponsors and a Trump ally who said he spoke with the president while shepherding the measure. \u201cHe wants maximum coordination with local government.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers pushed the 80-plus page bill \u2014 titled the Tackling and Reforming Unlawful Migration Policy, or TRUMP Act \u2014 through in a special session, when it's harder for the public to engage in the legislative process. Republican lawmakers filed the bill after rejecting immigration proposals by DeSantis, a rebuke to the lame duck governor who was once floated as Trump's successor.",
      "Notably, one Republican in the House and six in the Senate voted against the measure, leaving the bill short of a veto-proof majority.",
      "\u201cI appreciate the attempt,\u201d said Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, an ally of the governor. \u201cI cannot vote for this because it is nowhere near strong enough for my taste.\"",
      "Ahead of the floor debate on Tuesday, Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez announced additional provisions, after they \u201crequested and received technical assistance from the Trump Administration\u201d, the leaders said.",
      "The amendments included enhancing penalties for all crimes committed in the state by people in the country illegally, and requires that those convicted of capital offenses receive the death penalty. But the Republican sponsors declined to include some of DeSantis' provisions, like restrictions on people in the country illegally sending money overseas and a measure that would have created a legal presumption that people in the country illegally are a flight risk.",
      "Now DeSantis must weigh whether to sign a proposal he's bashed in public as \u201ctoothless\u201d and \u201cwatered-down\" or veto it. He could also decline to sign the bill, allowing it to become law.",
      "The measure passed by lawmakers Tuesday would create a new state immigration enforcement office with more than 140 employees under the direction of a newly minted chief immigration officer, a post to be taken by the state's commissioner of agriculture, and would cede emergency immigration enforcement powers from the governor to the state immigration officer.",
      "The bill allocates $100 million for grants to local law enforcement agencies for training, equipment and reimbursement for leasing detention facilities to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It allocates another $375 million to fund the state's cooperation with the federal government, including efforts related to a program that deputizes local law enforcement for duties typically performed by ICE agents. It also sets aside $25 million to give $1,000 bonuses to local law enforcement officers who cooperate with the federal government.",
      "Democrats repeatedly pressed the bill sponsors on the language requiring government employees to \u201ccooperate to the fullest extent possible\u201d with federal immigration enforcement.",
      "\u201cIf we really don\u2019t want our (school resource officers), our social workers and our teachers defining for themselves what the fullest extent of their cooperation needs to be, then we need to define that,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Christine Hunchofsky.",
      "Gruters said the bill is aimed at requiring more cooperation from local officials running jails and detention facilities, not \u201cstreet-level\u201d enforcement. But he acknowledged that could change with federal priorities.",

      "The order would close the path for transgender troops to serve openly",
      "Transgender service members represented by LGBTQ advocacy groups on Tuesday filed suit against the White House executive order that bans transgender people from serving in the military.",
      "The order signed late Monday rescinded Biden administration policies that permitted transgender service members to serve openly according to their gender identity. The order said the \u201cassertion\u201d that one might identify as transgender would be a \u201cfalsehood \u2026 not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\u201d",
      "Space Force Col. Bree Fram, a transgender woman who came out and transitioned while serving, told ABC News that banning transgender individuals from serving would bring a \u201ccollective harm to our national security.\u201d",
      "Transgender troops \u201care meeting or exceeding the high standards the military has set for performance, and they're doing so here at home, around the world, and in every service, every specialty that the military has to offer,\u201d Fram said, who was speaking in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the Pentagon.",
      "According to the suit filed Tuesday by plaintiffs represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders Law and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, the order directs Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth \u201cto reverse the current accession and retention standards for military service and to adopt instead a policy that transgender status is incompatible with \u2018high standards\u2019\u201d that the executive order lays out.",
      "Sasha Buchert, a senior attorney at Lambda Legal who represented plaintiffs who sued and temporarily blocked a similar order in 2017 in the first Trump administration, called the new order \u201ccruel\u201d and said it \u201ccompromises the safety of our country.\u201d",
      "She told ABC News the order \u201cwill force transgender service members to look over their shoulder\u201d and \u201cstamp them with [a] badge of inferiority.\u201d",
      "Buchert said her firm and the Human Rights Campaign also intend to file suit.",
      "\u201cWe have been here before\u2026as we promised then, so do we now: we will sue,\u201d Buchert said.",
      "Buchert said transgender troops will now \u201cworry about...whether they're going to have to end their illustrious military careers by being drummed out of the military.\u201d",
      "\"Trans military folks have been serving now for 10 years, openly and proudly and deploying to austere environments and meeting every service-based standard that their peers can meet,\" said Buchert, who is a veteran.",
      "The executive order, paired with another that demands the dissolution of diversity, equity, and inclusion \"bureaucracy\" in the Defense Department, came on Hegseth\u2019s first day of work at the Pentagon.",
      "A 2016 study conducted by RAND estimated 2,500 active service members were transgender -- in addition to some 1,500 reservists.",
      "RAND found in its study that the number of active-duty troops seeking transition-related care that \u201ccould disrupt their ability to deploy\u201d ranged from as low as 29 to as high as 129.",
      "The Department of Defense does not track transgender individuals as a separate population.",
      "The executive order does not make reference to transgender individuals. It directs the Pentagon to update guidelines around medical standards for individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria, a precursor to transition care that affirms one\u2019s gender.",
      "The Pentagon said in a statement to ABC News that it \u201cwill fully execute and implement all directives outlined\u201d in all executive orders from the president.",
      "Trump as a candidate said he would take aim at \"transgender insanity\" as president. The order says the military must root out \u201cideologies harmful to unit cohesion.\u201d",
      "The logic around cohesion is familiar, Buchert said.",
      "\u201cWe've seen this as a country on many occasions. We're still correcting improper discharges for people that were, you know, drummed out of the military based on discriminatory motives in the past,\u201d she said.",
      "Cassie Byard, a Navy veteran who served with a service member who was transgender, said she \u201cnever saw any adverse effect on readiness or cohesion.\u201d",
      "Fram believes openness about her identity has made her unit more cohesive.",
      "\"My being authentic is actually reflected back to me and builds the strong bonds of teamwork that we need at the military to succeed, because we need everyone to be able to bring their best self to work,\u201d she said.",
      "While the order brings a \u201cperiod of uncertainty\u201d as the Pentagon weighs updates to medical guidelines over a two-month window to implement it, Fram said \u201cmy job right now, and the job of every transgender service member, is simply to do our duty. It's to lace up our boots and get to work and accomplish the mission that we've been given.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe swore an oath to uphold the duties that we've been given, [to] support the Constitution,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd we're going to continue to do so, unless told otherwise.\u201d",

    "summary": "The tallest building in Havana is impossible to miss",
    "story": [
      "The tallest building in Havana is impossible to miss",
      "HAVANA -- It\u2019s impossible to miss. The huge rectangular mass of concrete and glass \u2014 the tallest building in Havana \u2014 dominates the city skyline, towering 150 meters (490 feet) above colonial homes with its 542 luxury rooms and majestic views of the city and the sea.",
      "The Selection La Habana hotel, managed by Spanish chain Iberostar, has yet to be inaugurated but it is already the target of criticism \u2014 and not only for its unusual shape. Cubans are questioning the government\u2019s allocation of millions of dollars towards luxury tourism while the island grapples with a severe economic crisis and tourism numbers plummet to historic lows.",
      "\u201cAll that money could have been spent to build hospitals and schools,\u201d lamented Susel Borges, a 26-year-old artisan, as she looked up to the towering edifice, known to locals as the \u201cK and 23 building\u201d because of its location.",
      "Located near the legendary Habana Libre hotel and the iconic Coppelia ice cream parlor, the new hotel is part of a government plan to build a dozen luxury establishments \u2014 mainly in Havana \u2014 that did not stop even during the COVID-19 pandemic and while existing luxury hotels remained largely unoccupied.",
      "For decades, tourism drove the Cuban economy, generating annual revenues of up to $3 billion. But in December, Cuban authorities said only 2.2 million tourists visited the island in 2024, a decrease of roughly 200,000 from 2023 and significantly lower than the 4.2 million tourists who visited in 2019.",
      "The government attributes the decline in tourism to a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of factors including supply shortages, a severe energy crisis causing massive blackouts and a lack of personnel, due to emigration and low wages. Furthermore, the island is grappling with a surge in U.S. sanctions, including restrictions on travel by U.S. citizens, a ban on cruise ships and other measures specifically designed to stifle the growth of Cuba\u2019s tourism industry.",
      "\u201cTourism is gone,\u201d said Julio Garc\u00eda Campos, driver of a shiny red 1951 Pontiac with an original engine. \u201cTourists used to line up to get on one of these!\u201d he said, recalling a bygone era when the island was bustling with American and European travelers following a removal of sanctions by then-President Barack Obama.",
      "The new Selection La Habana, like all other hotels in Cuba, is state-owned and operates under GAESA, a conglomerate belonging to the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces that has often been criticized because of the opacity of its businesses. As a military-run operation, it is exempt from audits by the Comptroller General\u2019s Office and has not disclosed the amount it invested in the 40-story hotel.",
      "Cuban economist Pedro Monreal notes the \u201cincongruity\u201d of investing capital in the tourism sector when very little is being allocated to strategic areas such as agriculture.",
      "\"With food insecurity a concern, it\u2019s troubling that agricultural investment lags significantly behind tourism investment, remaining 11 times lower,\u201d Monreal noted last year on social media.",
      "Architects also expressed little enthusiasm for the new hotel, pointing at its disruptive appearance within the environment, its excessive height violating urban regulations and tall glass windows that are ill-suited for a tropical climate.",
      "\u201cThis building serves as a perfect example in our classes of what should not be done in terms of bioclimatic design,\u201d said Abel Tablada, an architect and university professor, adding it's \"unforgivable\" that the little money available to the Cuban state has been allocated to a building that does not add value to the city.",

      "Florida lawmakers have passed a sweeping immigration bill, setting aside half a billion dollars in public funds to help carry out President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on people in the country illegally",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida lawmakers passed a sweeping immigration bill Tuesday, setting aside half a billion dollars in public funds to help carry out President Donald Trump 's crackdown on those in the country illegally.",
      "In a state where roughly one in every five residents is an immigrant, the legislation would require every level of government \u2014 as well as government contractors \u2014 to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement \u201cto the fullest extent possible.\u201d",
      "Following more than four hours of deliberations on Tuesday, Florida's Republican-dominated Legislature passed the measure largely along party lines. The passage sets up a showdown between Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and state legislative leaders, who have sparred over whose proposals would better carry out Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. DeSantis has called the bill \u201cweak.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe whole goal of this bill is to help President Trump do his job,\u201d said Republican Sen. Gruters, one of the bill sponsors and a Trump ally who said he spoke with the president while shepherding the measure. \u201cHe wants maximum coordination with local government.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers pushed the 80-plus page bill \u2014 titled the Tackling and Reforming Unlawful Migration Policy, or TRUMP Act \u2014 through in a special session, when it's harder for the public to engage in the legislative process. Republican lawmakers filed the bill after rejecting immigration proposals by DeSantis, a rebuke to the lame duck governor who was once floated as Trump's successor.",
      "Notably, one Republican in the House and six in the Senate voted against the measure, leaving the bill short of a veto-proof majority.",
      "\u201cI appreciate the attempt,\u201d said Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, an ally of the governor. \u201cI cannot vote for this because it is nowhere near strong enough for my taste.\"",
      "Ahead of the floor debate on Tuesday, Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez announced additional provisions, after they \u201crequested and received technical assistance from the Trump Administration\u201d, the leaders said.",
      "The amendments included enhancing penalties for all crimes committed in the state by people in the country illegally, and requires that those convicted of capital offenses receive the death penalty. But the Republican sponsors declined to include some of DeSantis' provisions, like restrictions on people in the country illegally sending money overseas and a measure that would have created a legal presumption that people in the country illegally are a flight risk.",
      "Now DeSantis must weigh whether to sign a proposal he's bashed in public as \u201ctoothless\u201d and \u201cwatered-down\" or veto it. He could also decline to sign the bill, allowing it to become law.",
      "The measure passed by lawmakers Tuesday would create a new state immigration enforcement office with more than 140 employees under the direction of a newly minted chief immigration officer, a post to be taken by the state's commissioner of agriculture, and would cede emergency immigration enforcement powers from the governor to the state immigration officer.",
      "The bill allocates $100 million for grants to local law enforcement agencies for training, equipment and reimbursement for leasing detention facilities to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It allocates another $375 million to fund the state's cooperation with the federal government, including efforts related to a program that deputizes local law enforcement for duties typically performed by ICE agents. It also sets aside $25 million to give $1,000 bonuses to local law enforcement officers who cooperate with the federal government.",
      "Democrats repeatedly pressed the bill sponsors on the language requiring government employees to \u201ccooperate to the fullest extent possible\u201d with federal immigration enforcement.",
      "\u201cIf we really don\u2019t want our (school resource officers), our social workers and our teachers defining for themselves what the fullest extent of their cooperation needs to be, then we need to define that,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Christine Hunchofsky.",
      "Gruters said the bill is aimed at requiring more cooperation from local officials running jails and detention facilities, not \u201cstreet-level\u201d enforcement. But he acknowledged that could change with federal priorities.",
      "The bill would also repeal a decade-old state law allowing Florida students who are in the country without legal permission to qualify for in-state tuition at public colleges and universities, which as of the 2023-2024 fiscal year benefitted about 6,500 students.

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has heard competing testimony over a request to block the nation's fourth execution using nitrogen gas",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- The state of Alabama urged a federal judge Tuesday to allow the nation's fourth execution with nitrogen gas to proceed next week, but a doctor who witnessed an earlier execution by the new method told the judge the inmate appeared to be in distress and awake minutes longer than officials predicted.",
      "Alabama has carried out all three of the nation's executions using the gas and has set a Feb. 6 execution date for Demetrius Terrence Frazier, 52. But attorneys for Frazier, who was convicted of the 1991 rape and murder of a woman in Birmingham, sought the hearing asking the court to intervene.",
      "Frazier\u2019s attorneys urged the judge to block the execution unless the state makes changes to its protocol, such as giving the inmate the same sedative used at the start of lethal injections before the gas begins flowing. Separately Tuesday, Frazier's mother and death penalty opponents asked Michigan's governor to bring Frazier back there to finish a life sentence in the state for a separate murder conviction in the killing of a 14-year-old girl. Michigan has no death penalty.",
      "Alabama's method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen. The state maintained Tuesday that the method brings swift death.",
      "Dylan L. Mauldin, assistant solicitor general for Alabama, called Frazier\u2019s legal maneuver a tactic to delay his execution and said the court should deny his request for a preliminary injunction. Mauldin noted the U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled the method unconstitutional.",
      "Meanwhile, a lawyer for Frazier, argued that inmates executed with the gas appeared to be conscious for some minutes, instead of the 30 to 40 seconds he said the state predicted.",
      "U.S. District Judge Emily Marks questioned Frazier\u2019s attorney about why she should intervene when the courts have previously let nitrogen executions go forward.",
      "\u201cSomething is going wrong. Every inmate who has been executed by nitrogen gas has exhibited signs of consciousness beyond the 40 seconds,\u201d Spencer Hahn, an attorney for Frazier, responded.",
      "Dr. Brian McAlary, an anesthesiologist who witnessed the November execution of Carey Dale Grayson, testified that he observed clear \u201cevidence of distress\u201d in the prisoner. He noted Grayson moved his head back and forth, had rapid eye movements and struggled against his restraints.",
      "McAlary said he believed Grayson\u2019s last voluntary movement occurred after about three minutes when he simultaneously raised both legs and held them in the air before letting them fall down. McAlary said he believed the movement was voluntary because \u201cboth legs were moved at exactly the same time, direction and distance.\u201d",
      "The testimony was the first time a medical doctor had testified about observations during a nitrogen execution. The court was previously given news accounts from journalists and the observations of prison staff.",
      "Dr. Joseph Antognini, an anesthesiologist hired by the state as an expert witness, gave competing testimony that such movements did not necessarily indicate Grayson was conscious. Antognini did not witness Grayson\u2019s execution.",
      "\u201cMovement can happen in the absence of pain,\u201d Antognini said. He gave examples of instances when he saw patients move involuntarily during surgery while unconscious. But he acknowledged he had never seen movements like a double leg lift during surgery.",
      "Frazier was in the courtroom throughout, shackled and taking notes in handcuffs on a legal pad.",
      "Alabama Corrections Commissioner John Hamm testified that Grayson was combative at the start of his execution, cursing the warden and raising his middle fingers as he was strapped to the gurney. Hamm testified that he thought Grayson\u2019s head movements were an effort to knock the mask loose.",
      "Frazier's supporters had also argued he should be in a Michigan prison instead of Alabama's death row.",
      "Frazier was first convicted in Michigan and sentenced to life in prison for the 1992 murder of a 14-year-old girl. Prosecutors said Frazier while in police custody in Michigan, confessed to raping and shooting Brown in Alabama after stealing about $80 from her purse. He was convicted in Alabama and given the death penalty. The then governors of Alabama and Michigan agreed in 2011 to place him on Alabama's death row.",

      "DENVER -- The U.S. Education Department said Tuesday it was investigating Denver Public Schools for alleged discrimination after the district converted a girl\u2019s restroom on the second floor of a high school into an all-gender restroom while leaving another bathroom exclusive to boys.",
      "The department's accusation that the move may violate of Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, appears to be unprecedented, and it marks a sharp departure from the department's investigations under former President Joe Biden.",
      "The Democrat's administration interpreted Title IX to include LGBTQ+ protections, though the policy was later overturned by a federal judge.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear: it is a new day in America, and under President Trump, (the Office for Civil Rights) will not tolerate discrimination of any kind,\u201d said Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights, in a news release.",

      "\u201cThey are arguing that an all-gender restroom isn\u2019t comparable to a single-gender restroom,\u201d Sokolow said. \u201cYou\u2019d have to establish that somehow you have a right to a single-sex bathroom, and while the Trump administration may believe that, I don\u2019t know if that will be upheld by the courts.\u201d",

      "The founder of a Florida-based neo-Nazi group is on trial for conspiring to attack Maryland\u2019s power grid",
      "BALTIMORE -- As the founder of a Florida-based neo-Nazi group goes on trial for conspiring to attack Maryland\u2019s power grid, his abhorrent beliefs aren\u2019t really the point, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.",
      "They said it is his willingness to act on those beliefs that jurors must consider during the trial, which is expected to last about two weeks in Baltimore federal court.",
      "Brandon Russell, 29, encouraged his then-girlfriend, Sarah Beth Clendaniel, to carry out the power grid attack, hoping to cause chaos in furtherance of their shared white supremacist views, according to prosecutors. The two were arrested in February 2023 \u2014 before their plans were executed.",
      "\u201cMr. Russell was at war. He was at war for his race, the white race,\u201d prosecutor Michael Aubin said during opening arguments Tuesday afternoon.",
      "According to prosecutors, the pair was planning a series of \u201csniper attacks\u201d on electrical substations around Baltimore that could have caused significant damage to the regional power grid. Their goal was to create chaos in the majority-Black city and ultimately spur a \u201crace war,\u201d prosecutors say.",
      "But Russell\u2019s defense attorney argued his participation in the plot was minimal, calling the case \u201ca setup from the very beginning.\u201d While downplaying Russell\u2019s role, attorney Ian Goldstein pinned the conspiracy on Clendaniel and a confidential informant she connected with through Russell.",
      "Clendaniel, 36, pleaded guilty to plotting the attack and was sentenced in September to 18 years in prison.",
      "Russell appeared in court Tuesday wearing a light blue jacket and glasses. He conferred regularly with his attorney, looking cheerful and engaged.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t put people in jail for their beliefs or the things they say,\u201d said Goldstein, who also called his client\u2019s views \u201crepulsive to most people.\u201d",
      "Russell apparently wasn\u2019t on law enforcement\u2019s radar until police responded to a 2017 double homicide at a Tampa apartment building and found him outside crying, dressed in military fatigues. One of his roommates had killed the other two, officials said.",
      "Police concluded Russell had nothing to do with the deadly shootings. But while detectives investigated, they discovered a stash of highly explosive materials and a cache of neo-Nazi signs, posters, books and flags. Russell was in the Florida National Guard at the time and had attended the University of South Florida.",
      "Investigators said Russell co-founded the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, which is German for \u201catomic weapon.\u201d They found flyers in his possession that said, \u201cDon\u2019t prepare for exams, prepare for a race war.\u201d Russell also kept a framed photo of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh in his room and read books like \u201cMein Kampf\u201d and \u201cThe Turner Diaries,\u201d both reading staples of white supremacist extremists.",
      "Devon Arthurs, who later pleaded guilty to killing his roommates, told detectives he shot them for teasing him about his recent conversion to Islam. He also said it was to thwart a terrorist attack by Atomwaffen and claimed Russell had materials in the house \u201cto kill civilians and target locations like power lines, nuclear reactors, and synagogues,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "Goldstein also represented Russell in that case, when the attorney argued that possessing explosives didn\u2019t mean Russell intended to use them to cause harm. Goldstein said his client was traumatized by the deaths of his roommates and already suffered from mental health issues. Family members said Russell was just a follower looking for community and trying to please his friends.",
      "Russell ultimately pleaded guilty to possession of an unregistered destructive device and improper storage of explosive materials. He was sentenced in 2018 to serve five years in prison. During the sentencing hearing, a federal judge in Tampa expressed explicit concern that Russell could fall in with the wrong crowd behind bars.",
      "Several years later, federal investigators discovered his relationship with Clendaniel.",
      "She and Russell began exchanging letters around 2018 while they were incarcerated in different facilities. They developed a romantic relationship that continued after they were released from prison, court records show.",
      "Clendaniel\u2019s defense attorney argued that her abusive childhood and adolescent struggles with addiction made her acutely vulnerable to the influence of people like Russell and other white supremacists. She spent hours on the phone with a confidential informant, discussing how she would obtain a gun and shoot at five electrical substations situated in a ring around Baltimore, according to prosecutors.",
      "When given a chance to address the court during her sentencing hearing last year, Clendaniel affirmed her racist ideology: \u201cIt\u2019s true, your honor, I do still hold National Socialist beliefs,\u201d she said in September.",
      "But she claimed there was a line she wouldn\u2019t cross by acting on them. She said she was struggling with severe mental and physical health problems when she participated in the plot, including a diagnosis of kidney failure that she believed was terminal.",
      "During Russell\u2019s trial Tuesday, his attorney pointed to Clendaniel\u2019s mental state as evidence she had been desperate enough to carry out the attack. Russell, meanwhile, was \u201cmany miles away\u201d in Orlando with no plans to travel to Maryland and help, Goldstein argued."

      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it made an average of 710 immigration arrests daily from Thursday through Monday, up from a daily average of 311 in a 12-month period through September under President Joe Biden. If that rate holds, it would surpass ICE's previous high mark set in the Obama administration, when daily arrests averaged 636 in 2013.",
      "Numbers spiked starting Sunday and included highly publicized operations, including in Atlanta, Dallas and, most prominently, Chicago.",
      "The Trump administration has highlighted participation of other agencies in ICE operations, a departure from Biden. They include the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \u2014 all part of the Justice Department \u2014 and the Homeland Security Department's Customs and Border Protection, which includes the Border Patrol.",
      "Emile Bove, the acting deputy attorney general, observed arrests in Chicago on Sunday in a sign of the Justice Department's growing involvement.",
      "Trump expanded arrest priorities to anyone in the country illegally, not just people with criminal convictions, public safety or national security threats and migrants stopped at the border. Still, some said it was business as usual for ICE \u2014 at least so far.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing unique about it,\u201d said Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge and a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, a research and advocacy group that favors immigration restrictions.",
      "He anticipates more enforcement in next few weeks and believes Congress will approve funding for up to 80,000 beds, about double the current level. ICE needs the space to hold people while any legal proceedings play out and while it arranges deportations.",
      "ICE hasn't said how many people it has deported since Trump took office gain, but the administration has highlighted removal flights, including the use of military planes.",
      "Under Biden, ICE deported more than 270,000 people in a 12-month period that ended in September. That was the highest annual tally in a decade, helped by an increase in deportation flights. The Biden administration did not use military planes.",
      "In an episode that may signal more hardball diplomacy with governments that resist or refuse to take back their citizens, Trump said Sunday that he would raise tariffs 25% on Colombia after President Gustavo Petro refused to let two military planes land with deportees. Trump put the tariffs measures on hold after Petro backed down.",
      "A C-27 military transport plane landed Monday in Guatemala, with 80 deportees in shackles and handcuffs. \u201cIt\u2019s my first attempt of the year and I don\u2019t know if I will try again because it\u2019s hard,\u201d said Jacobo Due\u00f1as, 38, who was arrested Friday on the Texas border.",
      "The Trump administration made it easier for ICE to deport people without appearing before an immigration judge by expanding \u201cexpedited removal\u201d authority nationwide for anyone in the country up to two years. The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging the fast-track deportations in court.",
      "The administration ended a policy to avoid arrests at \u201csensitive locations,\u201d including schools, hospitals and places of worship. It said it may deport people who entered the country legally on parole, a presidential authority that Biden used more than any president.",
      "It also threatened to punish \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.",
      "Trump ended use of a border app to allow migrants to enter the country on two-year permits with eligibility to work, canceling tens of thousands of appointments into early February for people stranded in Mexico. Nearly 1 million people entered the U.S. at land crossings with Mexico by using the CBP One app.",
      "Trump also ended a policy that allowed more than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to fly to the country on two-year permits if they had a financial sponsor.",
      "Other actions will time to play out. Trump secured Mexico's approval to reinstate a hallmark policy of his first term, \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d which requires asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court.",
      "The Pentagon began deploying 1,500 active-duty troops to the border last week but it was unclear if they will break from supporting roles they have played under presidents since George W. Bush, including ground and aerial surveillance, building barriers and repairing vehicles.",
      "An 1878 law prohibits military involvement in civilian law enforcement, but Trump and his aides have signaled he may invoke wartime powers. Trump said in his order that the Defense Department can assist with detention and transportation.",
      "Trump stopped resettling refugees who are vetted abroad before entering the United States until further review, a program that he largely dismantled in his first term and was resurrected under Biden. Groups that provide temporary housing, job training and other support said the State Department told them Friday to stop work immediately.",
      "The Justice Department also told legal aid groups to stop work on federal programs that help people in immigration courts and detention centers navigate complex laws.",
      "Trump said he was ending automatic citizenship for children born on U.S. soil, a precedent established by constitutional amendment in 1868. A federal judge in Seattle has put it on hold.",

Some of them said that approach seemed appropriate, given this will likely be the first formal message the Legislature sends to the Trump administration.",
      "Rep.

      "DORAL, Fla. -- President Donald Trump regaled House Republicans on Monday with a rhetorical highlight reel from his first week in office, and he urged them to support his immigration crackdown and border security proposals.",
      "\u201cWe have no apologies and we\u2019re moving very fast,\" Trump said.",
      "He said that \u201cI really focus on the border more than anything else,\" downplaying the importance of inflation, an issue that fueled his candidacy last year but one that he has less control over as president.",
      "Speaking at House Republicans' annual policy retreat, Trump made clear his political ambitions as he rallied lawmakers to advance their conservative agenda.",

      "The conference is being held at Trump National Doral Miami, a posh resort with four golf courses owned by the billionaire president. Although Republicans are euphoric over election victories that have given them total control in Washington, they're also facing difficult negotiations in the coming weeks and months.",
      "They need to find consensus on a spending bill before a March 14 deadline, when funding for the federal government expires.",
      "In addition, Republicans are working on a budget blueprint that would set the stage for their broader plans, including tax cuts, fossil fuel development and border security. With thin majorities in the House and Senate, they will need near-unanimity to pass their proposals without Democratic support.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, set the first week of February for the House Budget Committee to pass the blueprint that is key to the whole process.",

      "Johnson is trying to lump many of the Republican priorities into one massive catch-all bill that Senate Democrats cannot filibuster, but many Republican senators think it would be better to do two bills \u2014 the first focused on border security and defense, and the second on extending and expanding upon the tax cuts passed in Trump's first term.",

      "Republicans are also eyeing potential changes to key safety net programs, such as work requirements for those participating in Medicaid, to help offset the cost of enacting their priorities. Trump has pushed expensive ideas like exempting tipped wages and Social Security checks from income taxes.",

      "Republicans are warning that if Congress does not act quickly to extend tax relief, capital will remain on the sidelines and families next year would see child tax credits and a guaranteed tax deduction greatly reduced, upping their federal tax bill.",
      "Trump and Republican leaders are also going to have to find a way to extend the nation's debt limit. The limit must be raised by Congress, and failure to do so risks the federal government defaulting on its debt and unable to pay all its bills.",
      "Under President Joe Biden, Republican lawmakers sought concessions on spending before agreeing to suspending the debt ceiling, but it's unclear how adamant they will be on deficit reduction during a Trump presidency."

      "Wisconsin is the only state where governors can partially veto spending bills by striking words, numbers and punctuation to create new meaning or spending amounts. In most states, governors can only eliminate or reduce spending amounts.",
      "And while the Wisconsin governor's veto power has been reduced over the past four decades, it is still considered the strongest in the country. The issue has crossed party lines, with Republicans and Democrats pushing at different times for more limitations on the governor\u2019s veto depending on which party was wielding the power.",
      "Republican state lawmakers on Monday took the latest swing at reducing the veto powers, proposing a constitutional amendment that would eliminate a governor's powers to delete words and rework sentences in bills that spend taxpayer money.",
      "Under the proposal, the governor could only veto entire sections from spending bills instead of individual words.",
      "The partial veto as used by governors currently has turned them into a \u201csuper lawmaker,\u201d according to Republican Sens. Julian Bradley and Cory Tomcyzk and Republican state Rep. Scott Allen. They circulated the proposal for cosponsors Monday.",
      "The idea would have to pass two consecutive legislative sessions and be approved by voters before taking effect. The soonest that could happen is 2027. The Legislature is controlled by Republicans this session, but the 2026 election will determine who will have power starting in 2027.",
      "The governor could not veto the proposal.",

Five amendments were put on the ballot last year and a sixth which would add the state's voter ID law to the constitution is up for voter approval on April 1.",
      "Wisconsin\u2019s partial veto power was created by a 1930 constitutional amendment, but it\u2019s been weakened. Voters adopted constitutional amendments in 1990 and 2008 that removed the ability to strike individual letters to make new words \u2014 the \u201cVanna White\u201d veto \u2014 and the power to eliminate words and numbers in two or more sentences to create a new sentence \u2014 the \u201cFrankenstein\u201d veto.",
      "There is a pending case before the Wisconsin Supreme Court challenging a partial veto Evers made in 2023 that attempts to lock in a school funding increase for 400 years. Evers struck digits to create a new ending year for the increases, 2425.",
      "The Supreme Court is weighing whether to declare that the state constitution forbids the governor from striking digits to create a new year or to remove language to create a longer duration than the one approved by the Legislature."

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to revise the Pentagon\u2019s policy on transgender troops, likely setting in motion a future ban on their military service.",
      "He also ordered troops to be reinstated who had left voluntarily or been booted for refusing COVID-19 vaccines, outlined new rollbacks in diversity programs and provided for the deployment of a space-based missile defense shield for the U.S. \u2014 all on Hegseth 's first day.",
      "Trump and Hegseth had described parts of the anticipated orders throughout the day, but the exact language did not drop until late Monday.",
      "A transgender ban had been widely expected, and Trump's order largely sets the stage for a future ban \u2014 but directs Hegseth to come up with how that would be implemented in policy.",
      "In his order, Trump claimed that service by troops who identify as a gender other than their biological one \u201cconflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one\u2019s personal life\u201d and is harmful to military readiness, requiring a revised policy to address the matter.",
      "Trump had tried to ban transgender troops during his first term, but it was tangled up in the courts for years before being overturned by then-President Joe Biden shortly after he took office.",
      "Two groups, Lambda Legal and Human Rights Campaign, which represented transgender troops the first time, vowed to fight again.",
      "\u201cWe have been here before and seven years ago were able to successfully block the earlier administration\u2019s effort,\u201d Lambda Legal attorney Sasha Buchert said. \u201cNot only is such a move cruel, it compromises the safety and security of our country and is particularly dangerous and wrong. As we promised then, so do we now: we will sue.\u201d",
      "During his first presidency, Trump established U.S. Space Command and the U.S. Space Force, which just marked its fifth birthday. Space continues to be a priority for the president, who has now directed the Pentagon to begin to develop the capability to shoot down missiles from space.",
      "For years, the U.S. has cautioned that China, Russia and others were weaponizing space. It has at times declassified information about both countries' efforts to create offensive weapons to disable critical U.S. satellites, including the capability to move satellites from orbit, temporarily blind them or potentially even destroy them.",
      "The Space Force is building a low-orbit ring of redundant satellites that can more quickly track and detect potential missile launches.",
      "But establishing a way to shoot missiles down from space is something the U.S. has not pursued since President Ronald Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative \u2014 \u201cStar Wars\u201d as it was commonly known \u2014 in the 1980s. The system was never developed due to cost and technological limitations.",
      "In his order called \u201can Iron Dome for America,\u201d Trump called for a multilayer missile defense system capable of countering an array of threats to the U.S., to include development and deployment of space-based interceptors.",
      "At least 8,200 troops were forced out of the military in 2021 for refusing to obey a lawful order when they declined to get the vaccine. Notices advising them they could return were sent out in 2023, but just 113 have reenlisted.",
      "The reinstatement process for any who now want to return requires that they meet military entry standards. Trump and Hegseth have persistently stated that the military must not reduce standards.",
      "\u2033We will offer full reinstatement to any service member who was expelled from the armed forces due to the COVID vaccine mandate,\u201d Trump told a Republican crowd at the Trump National Doral Miami, a resort he owns. \u201cAnd we will restore them to their former rank with full pay. \u2033",
      "In addition to troops forced out for refusing the shot, the order extends the same offer to anyone who signs a sworn statement saying they left the service voluntarily to avoid the vaccine.",
      "The order isn\u2019t expected to have a major impact on the number of service members returning. But it could take a bite out of the budget if more do now, since it requires back pay.",
      "To return, all would have to meet weight, fitness, medical and other requirements, and they could be refused if they now have a criminal record or other disqualifying factor. Officers would have to get recommissioned, which is a simple appointment process.",
      "According to the services, 3,748 Marines were discharged, and 25 have opted to re-enlist; 1,903 Army soldiers were discharged, and 73 returned; 1,878 sailors were discharged and two returned; 671 airmen were discharged and 13 returned.",
      "The Pentagon made the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory in August 2021 for all service members, including the National Guard and Reserve. Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said getting the vaccine was critical to maintaining a healthy, ready force that could be prepared to defend the nation.",
      "The Pentagon formally dropped the mandate in January 2023.",
      "Defense officials said then that many troops appeared to use the vaccine mandate as a way to quickly and easily to get out of their service obligations.",
      "Trump also, as expected, issued a sweeping order to abolish all programs, initiatives and mentions of diversity, equity and inclusion across the Defense Department and the Coast Guard, which is governed by the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The order looks to scrub \u201cany vestiges\u201d of such initiatives that seek to \u201cpromote a race-based preferences system that subverts meritocracy, perpetuates unconstitutional discrimination, and promotes divisive concepts or gender ideology.\u201d",
      "It prohibits the departments from promoting or following \u201cun-American\u201d theories that suggest that America\u2019s founding documents are racist or sexist; that discuss gender ideology; and that promote \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d such as \u201crace or sex stereotyping.\u201d",
      "The order says the defense and homeland security secretaries must issue guidance to implement the order in 30 days. It calls for a review to find any instances of actions taken in pursuit of DEI, which will be due to the defense secretary in 90 days.",
      "The secretaries must submit a report to the White House in six months outlining their progress.",
      "The Pentagon had already been taking steps to comply with Trump\u2019s initial action ending DEI programs across the U.S. government, and it has had far-reaching consequences. Without clearer direction, agencies were taking a broad approach to removing any content that seemed to run afoul of Trump's ban.",
      "That temporarily included videos of the storied Tuskegee Airmen and World War II Women's Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs, which were part of DEI training courses for the Air Force's basic military training.

      "LOS ANGELES -- Rain mostly moved out of Southern California on Monday after the first significant storm of the season brought weekend downpours that aided firefighters while causing ash and mud to flow across streets, but no significant problems were reported in areas scorched by wildfires.",
      "More than an inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain fell in many areas, loosening Los Angeles hillsides burned bare by the recent blaze near the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, where crews cleared inundated roadways including the famed Pacific Coast Highway.",

      "North of Los Angeles, snowy conditions late Sunday shut down the mountainous Tejon Pass section of Interstate 5, a key north-south artery for the state. It reopened Monday afternoon. The highway rises to more than 4,100 feet (1,250 meters) between LA and the San Joaquin Valley, making it susceptible to storm closures.",
      "Mountains across San Bernardino and Riverside counties were under a winter storm warning Monday and were forecast to get about a foot (0.30 meters) of snow from the storm. Chains were required for some vehicles heading to ski resorts in the Big Bear Lake area northeast of Los Angeles because of icy roads.",

      "The Palisades Fire, the largest of the blazes that destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 11 people, reached 94% containment Monday. The Eaton Fire, which broke out near Altadena and has killed at least 16 people, was 98% contained.",

      "Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018, when the town of Montecito, up the coast from Los Angeles, was ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes charred by a huge wildfire. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died.",
      "The rain ended a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Most of Southern California is currently in \u201cextreme drought\u201d or \u201csevere drought,\u201d according to the U.S. Drought Monitor."

    "story": [
      "Current and former European and U.S. officials have raised concerns about some of President Donald Trump\u2019s picks for top intelligence posts",
      "LONDON -- As Russia moved closer to invading Ukraine nearly three years ago, the United States and its allies took the extraordinary step of declassifying and sharing intelligence to expose Moscow\u2019s plans.",
      "Information flew across the Atlantic from U.S. spy agencies to NATO and Western partners showing that Russia was poised to launch the biggest attack on a European country since World War II.",
      "It was designed to muster support for Kyiv, and on the strength of the U.S. warning, some nations sent weapons to Ukraine, which moved some equipment out of the range of Russian strikes.",
      "Now, officials are bracing for a potentially changed security landscape under President Donald Trump. He has criticized America's allies and lambasted its intelligence agencies. He's been accused of disregarding secrecy rules and hoarding classified documents.",
      "Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, has parroted Russian propaganda while his nominee to lead the FBI, Kash Patel, has promised changes that could significantly curtail the flow of intelligence to America's friends. Both are expected to face sharp questioning from lawmakers during confirmation hearings Thursday.",
      "The Associated Press spoke with 18 current and former senior European and U.S. officials who worked in NATO, defense, diplomacy or intelligence. Many raised questions and concerns about Trump's past relationship with America's spies and their ability to share information at a time of heightened terror threats and signs of greater cooperation between U.S. adversaries.",
      "The U.S. and its allies routinely share top-secret information, be it about potential terror threats, Chinese cyberattacks or Russian troop movements. America's closest intelligence partners are New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Britain, and it often shares with other nations or sometimes even adversaries when lives are at stake.",
      "In July, the U.S. helped foil a Russian plot to assassinate the head of a German arms manufacturer that produced weapons for Ukraine. In August, the CIA said it provided intelligence to Austrian authorities that allowed them to disrupt a plan, allegedly inspired by the Islamic State group, to attack a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna.",
      "Cooperation particularly between the U.S. and the U.K. is \u201cstrong and robust enough to withstand some turbulence at the political level,\u201d said Lord Peter Ricketts, former U.K. national security adviser and current chair of the European Affairs Committee of the upper chamber of the British Parliament.",
      "However, any strong intelligence relationship is underpinned by trust, and what if \u201ctrust isn\u2019t there?\u201d Ricketts said.",
      "There was some skepticism about U.S. intelligence ahead of the invasion of Ukraine due to the faulty American information that led to the invasion of Iraq in 2001, said Oana Lungescu, a fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London and formerly NATO's longest-serving spokesperson.",
      "But when combined with information from its security partners, America's \u201cremarkable intelligence\" enabled the NATO alliance to raise the alert about Russia, Lungescu said.",
      "European leaders are working to convince Trump's administration that threats on the continent also are relevant for the United States.",
      "There shouldn't be much debate, said former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Mike McFaul, who said there's a direct relationship between U.S. intelligence sharing and national security. He noted that U.S. authorities have warned of escalating terror threats.",
      "\u201cOne of our great advantages is that we have incredible intelligence capabilities and we have allies that we share that with \u2014 it\u2019s a force multiplier for us,\u201d said McFaul, who now teaches at Stanford University. \u201cWe\u2019ll lose that if we\u2019re no longer considered trustworthy.\u201d",
      "The Trump team has an \u201copen mind and is in a listening mode,\u201d Norway\u2019s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said, adding that was a good sign because \u201cwhen you come in with a new administration in a very eventful, rapidly changing environment, getting on the same footing is a challenge.\u201d",
      "Predicting Trump\u2019s moves, however, is difficult. He has criticized NATO allies for not spending enough on defense. He even suggested he would encourage Russia to invade countries that didn\u2019t pay what he thought they should. But he didn\u2019t follow through on the threat.",
      "\u201cLast time it didn\u2019t turn out so badly: He was going to throw NATO under the bus, but he didn't do that,\" former U.S. Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte said. \"The rhetoric turned out to be transactional.\u201d",
      "Spokespeople for the White House and Gabbard did not respond to questions about Trump and his nominees or how they planned to handle intelligence sharing with America\u2019s allies.",
      "NATO members have hiked their defense spending \u2014 as Trump has demanded \u2014 and the alliance is now bigger than before, with Sweden and Finland joining after Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThere is a big risk of continuing to take American support for European, NATO countries ... and defense of Ukraine for granted,\u201d said Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson.",
      "But it would also be risky to assume \u201cthe U.S. is simply leaving.\u201d On that question, Kristersson said, \u201cthe jury is very much out.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s choice of Gabbard to oversee more than a dozen intelligence agencies has alarmed lawmakers from both parties and many current and former intelligence officials. Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who later became a Trump ally, met since-deposed Syrian President Bashar Assad in 2017 in Damascus and has promoted Russian propaganda about its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "If confirmed, Gabbard would have the power to declassify information and direct some intelligence sharing with allies.",
      "A European intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said that while there is concern around some of Trump\u2019s nominations, there is \u201cno reason to think we can\u2019t trust them because of who is in power.\u201d",
      "The official suggested nominees like Gabbard and Patel \u201chaven\u2019t heard all the facts yet\u201d and could \u201cgrow and learn\u201d when presented with the full picture.",
      "With thousands of professionals working in a multitude of agencies, the day-to-day operations of America\u2019s spy services may look very similar under the Trump administration. And there are safeguards, current and former officials told the AP, that include agencies sharing intelligence but not sources.",
      "But those in top positions will have a huge impact if they lead to staff departures, curtail longstanding surveillance programs as Patel has suggested or politicize their offices in ways that can be exploited by Moscow and other adversaries.",
      "The task for Europe is to convince everybody to focus on Russia, \u201dthe real troublemaker,\u201d the intelligence official said.",
      "Alongside Gabbard, Patel has rattled intelligence insiders in the U.S. and elsewhere because he's criticized surveillance programs like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which U.S. authorities use to keep tabs on suspected spies and terrorists overseas.",
      "The United States shared intelligence gathered through that law with Russia when public safety was at stake, passing along a warning before a deadly concert attack in Moscow in March that killed 145 people. It is not clear if Moscow tried to act on the warning.",
      "The European Union must be realistic that \u201cif the U.S. is reducing its participation in Europe, European members have to be ready to fill any gap,\u201d said former Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6, who has called for the 27-nation bloc to create its own intelligence agency.",
      "Many global tech and communication firms such as Google, Apple and Microsoft as well as Elon Musk\u2019s X are based in the U.S., giving American law enforcement and spy agencies an advantage over their foreign counterparts, which may lack the political or legal means to obtain information.",
      "Niinist\u00f6 hosted a summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2018, in which Trump openly questioned his own intelligence agencies\u2019 finding that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election to his benefit, restating Putin\u2019s claim that Moscow was not involved.",
      "Niinist\u00f6, whose country borders Russia, described his discussions with Trump while in office as clear, open and frank.",
      "\u201cI tried to tell him: \u2018We need you, but you need us, too,\u2019\u201d Niinist\u00f6 said.",

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to welcome Heathrow's expansion on Wednesday, the BBC understands, as she reveals Labour's latest plans for growth.",
      "A move to encourage in principle a planning application for a third runway at the airport will mark the first stage of the process and come as part of a major speech setting out several other projects aimed at boosting the economy.",
      "The announcement will likely anger campaigners - including within Reeves' Labour Party - who have opposed a third runway for decades because of environmental concerns.",
      "The Conservatives have criticised Labour's plans as \"hastily cobbled together\".",
      "In an article in the Times, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said wider government plans would \"kick down the barriers to building, clear out the regulatory weeds and allow a new era of British growth to bloom\".",
      "A third runway at Heathrow would cost tens of billions of pounds and take more than a decade to complete.",
      "But expansion plans at Gatwick and Luton airports starting during this parliament, and the redevelopment of the area around Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium could also be confirmed in the speech.",
      "The speech will also focus on development between Oxford and Cambridge to create a \"Silicon Valley of Europe\".",
      "What's the plan for a third runway at Heathrow Airport?",
      "Will electric planes and sustainable fuel make Heathrow's third runway green?",
      "The Heathrow announcement comes after weeks of hints Labour would back the controversial airport expansion.",
      "On Sunday, Reeves told the BBC she would not comment on \"speculation\" when asked if the government would support a third runway, but added that \"sustainable aviation and economic growth go hand in hand\".",
      "The government cannot prejudge the results of a formal planning application for a specific runway scheme, and the BBC understands there will be no public money for the project announced on Wednesday.",
      "Heathrow has long argued the expansion is needed to help it keep up with rival airports in Europe, which handle less passengers with more runways.",
      "In December, the airport's boss said it needed a \"clear steer\" from the government by the end of 2025 for plans to be taken forward.",
      "But questions remain around who will fully fund works on the M25 motorway around London, and other transport links. The road could need to be rerouted through a tunnel underneath the third runway.",
      "Another potential roadblock is how much the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) will allow Heathrow to pass on the costs of early development work to the airlines.",
      "Many airlines have already expressed concern at the likely costs. The CAA were among the regulators who presented ideas to the chancellor on how to boost growth at a Number 11 meeting earlier this month.",
      "The other issue is how Reeves' own party may react to a third runway at Heathrow.",
      "London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office told the BBC he has \"a long-standing opposition to airport expansion around London\" because of the impact on air quality and noise.",
      "Growth agenda",

      "The government will also review the so-called Green Book rules - guidance issued by the Treasury on how to appraise policies, programmes and projects - which it said have in the past biased infrastructure spending to already fast growing areas, mainly in the south.",
      "A senior minister said they were taking big long term decisions ignored by previous governments in the knowledge that \"the benefit won't be achieved until after this parliament, but they are the right long term decisions\".",
      "The Treasury is confident that there will be \"spades in the ground well before that\".",
      "The key difference, a senior minister said, was that the government will demonstrate that when the growth agenda comes into conflict with something else they \"will make the difficult decisions\".",
      "Labour has been talking about the importance of economic growth in the months before the general election and in the months after.",
      "Reeves has previously suggested big projects like Heathrow need to go ahead to help the UK economy grow.",

      "Figures from January revealed growth in November, but the 0.1% expansion was less than expected.",

    "story": [
      "Boeing lost nearly a billion dollars a month in 2024, as it grappled with a safety crisis, quality control issues and a damaging strike.",
      "The aerospace giant lost $11.8bn across the year, its worst result since 2020, when the aviation industry was grounded by the Covid pandemic.",
      "In the three months to the end of December, when strikes were affecting the business, it lost $3.8bn.",
      "As well as suffering from well-publicised problems at its commercial aircraft unit, Boeing also struggled with issues affecting a number of defence programmes.",
      "Chief executive Kelly Ortberg said the company was focused on what he called the \"fundamental changes\" needed to restore its fortunes and restore trust.",
      "Boeing has had a dreadful year by any measure. In January 2024, a door panel fell off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Investigators said it had not been bolted on properly.",
      "The incident highlighted serious quality control failings at the company \u2013 and at its main supplier, Spirit Aerosystems. It also reignited concerns about Boeing's attitude towards safety.",
      "Boeing had been trying to emerge from the shadow of two high-profile crashes involving a different 737 model, the Max 8, in 2018 and 2019, which killed 346 people.",
      "The latest incident forced Boeing to curb production, as regulators called for changes on the factory floor, and demanded the implementation of a comprehensive safety and quality control plan.",
      "In August, Boeing appointed its new chief executive Mr Ortberg, a veteran engineer who was brought in to steady the ship.",
      "But he immediately faced a serious challenge.",
      "A strike by 33,000 workers, most of them in Boeing's heartlands around Seattle brought two of its most important factories to a halt, and halted production of the 737 Max, the 777 and the 767 freighter.",
      "The seven-week stoppage, which began in September, reflected deep seated resentment among employees over their pay and retirement provisions. The dispute was settled in early November, but it cost the company billions.",
      "Boeing did take action. It announced plans to lay off 10% of its workforce and began raising more than $20bn through a combination of share sales and borrowing in order to protect its credit rating.",
      "It also delayed the entry into service of the 777X. A new version of the long-haul workhorse, it was already years late but had been expected to start operating in 2025. It will not now carry passengers until 2026.",
      "In total, Boeing delivered 348 commercial aircraft last year. Its great rival Airbus delivered 766.",
      "Problems at Boeing's defence business have been less visible, but no less damaging. The unit lost more than $5bn, largely thanks to rising costs on fixed price military contracts.",
      "Commenting on the results, Mr Ortberg said: \"We made progress on key areas to stabilize our operations during the quarter and continued to strengthen important aspects of our safety and quality plan.",
      "\"My team and I are focused on making the fundamental changes needed to fully recover our company's performance and restore trust with our customers, employees, suppliers, investors, regulators and all others who are counting on us.\""

    "story": [
      "The government is proposing to ease restrictions on how some pension schemes are managed, as part of efforts to boost economic growth.",
      "The Treasury said defined benefit pension schemes have a total surplus of \u00a3160bn, but under current rules much of the money is trapped and cannot be invested in the wider economy.",
      "The government has made improving growth its main priority in order to boost living standards, but recent figures indicate the economy is struggling to expand.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told company bosses on Tuesday that the government's \"growth mission\" would be the key factor behind policy decisions.",
      "Sir Keir was speaking after he and Chancellor Rachel Reeves met bosses of firms including Tesco, BT and Unilever as part of their efforts to get more investment to the UK.",
      "The meeting came ahead of a speech by Reeves on Wednesday where she is expected to focus on measures to boost growth amid speculation the government will back a third runway at Heathrow Airport.",
      "Sir Keir said he was \"hard-wiring growth into all the decisions of the cabinet\".",
      "He said he would not speculate about Heathrow, but added: \"What I will say is that growth is the number one priority, wealth creation, making sure that people are better off.",
      "\"Of course, we also have climate commitments, but growth is really important too.\"",
      "'No easy routes' to growth, Reeves tells Labour MPs",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "On Monday, the chancellor told Labour MPs there were \"no easy routes\" to economic growth. She added ministers must start saying \"yes\" to new projects and go \"further and faster\" to boost the economy.",
      "Official figures show that between July and September the economy had zero growth and the latest monthly figure for November showed just a small uptick.",
      "The consultation on pensions reform hopes to unlock billions of pounds within certain defined benefit schemes for alternative use in the economy, the pension schemes or the company.",
      "The previous Conservative government launched a similar consultation last year.",
      "Defined benefit pensions, sometimes known as a final salary scheme, are directly linked to a worker's salary and length of service.",
      "Three-quarters of the funds that pay out these pensions are in surplus - which means they effectively have more money in them than needed to meet those pension payments.",
      "However, just a few years ago, many schemes were in deficit when interest rates were lower - prompting some companies to reduce their pension offer, and a reversal could occur again.",
      "'Bit of a damp squib'",
      "Some pensions experts have warned there are risks around redeploying surplus funds, but The Pensions Regulator (TPR) has expressed its support for the government's plans.",
      "\"Where schemes are fully funded and there are protections in place for members, we support efforts to help trustees and employers consider how to safely release surplus if it can improve member benefits or unlock investment in the wider economy,\" said Nausicaa Delfas, chief executive of TPR.",
      "Many of these pension schemes are closed, so are invested relatively safely in order to ensure they meet their obligations to members, when no extra contributions are coming in.",
      "Pension scheme trustees would need to agree that releasing money will not put members' pensions at danger.",
      "There is no guarantee that companies would use the money to invest - a move that would require confidence in the wider outlook. That would need to happen at scale for economic growth to improve.",
      "Workers might also want the surplus to be used to improve the pension offer made to all staff - including those on more common defined contribution, rather than defined benefit, pensions.",
      "Independent pension consultant John Ralfe said the chancellor was looking for a \"quick win\" in her quest for growth, but doubted the latest proposed reforms would deliver it.",
      "\"The idea that there is a queue of companies waiting to do this is wishful thinking,\" he said, due to most firms looking to offload their pension liabilities altogether to specialist insurance companies.",
      "For those companies that do want to withdraw surpluses , they would need to agree changes with trustees, which would likely be \"long drawn-out process\",\" he added.",
      "\"It will all be a bit of a damp squib,\" Mr Ralfe said.",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, Daisy Cooper, said workers needed a \"cast iron guarantee\" from the government \" that none of these changes will put peoples pensions at risk, especially smaller pensions\".",
      "\"We also need guarantees that any unlocked funds will go to productive investment - not into shareholders' pockets,\" she added.",
      "The proposals follow plans announced last year by the chancellor to create pension \"megafunds\" by merging the UK's 86 council schemes, based on the model used in  Canada and Australia.",
      "The government has also suggested pension schemes need to reach a certain size or pool together. The idea behind this is that larger funds are cheaper to run and are more able to invest in UK infrastructure projects."

    "story": [
      "The speed at which the new Chinese AI app DeepSeek has shaken the technology industry, the markets and the bullish sense of American superiority in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has been nothing short of stunning.",
      "Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen may have said it best. \"DeepSeek-R1 is AI's Sputnik moment,\" he posted to X on Sunday, referring to the satellite which kicked off the space race.",
      "DeepSeek was the most downloaded free app on Apple's US App Store over the weekend. By Monday, the new AI chatbot had triggered a massive sell-off of major tech stocks which were in freefall as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Shares of AI chip designer and recent Wall Street darling Nvidia, for example, had plunged by 17% by the time US markets closed on Monday. Or to put it in even starker terms, it lost nearly $600bn in market value which, according to Bloomberg, is the biggest drop in the history of the US stock market.",
      "This extraordinary, historic spooking can largely be attributed to something as simple as cost. And a claim by DeepSeek's developers which prompted serious questions in Silicon Valley.",
      "While ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has been haemorrhaging money - spending $5bn last year alone - DeepSeek's developers say it built this latest model for a mere $5.6m.",
      "That is a tiny fraction of the cost that AI giants like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have relied on to develop their own models.",
      "EXPLAINED: What is DeepSeek and why did it cause stocks to drop?HANDS ON: Is DeepSeek as good as it seems?",
      "EXPLAINED: What is DeepSeek and why did it cause stocks to drop?",
      "HANDS ON: Is DeepSeek as good as it seems?",
      "As this dramatic moment for the sector played out, there was a palpable silence in many corners of Silicon Valley when I contacted those who are usually happy to talk. Many observers, investors, and analysts appeared stunned.",
      "Some wondered if this marked a buying opportunity. Others questioned the information DeepSeek was providing.",
      "\"I still think the truth is below the surface when it comes to actually what's going on,\" veteran analyst Gene Munster told me on Monday. He questioned the financials DeepSeek is citing, and wondered if the startup was being subsidised or whether its numbers were correct.",
      "The chatbot is \"surprisingly good, which just makes it hard to believe\", he said.",
      "Regardless, DeepSeek's sudden arrival is a \"flex\" by China and a \"black eye for US tech,\" to use his own words.",
      "It was just last week, after all, that OpenAI's Sam Altman and Oracle's Larry Ellison joined President Donald Trump for a news conference that really could have been a press release.",
      "The event represented peak American bullishness on AI.",
      "They announced Stargate, a joint venture that promises up to $500bn in private investment for AI infrastructure: data centres in Texas and beyond, along with a promised 100,000 new jobs.",
      "The US seemed to think its abundant data centres and control over the highest-end chips gave it a commanding lead in AI, despite China's dominance in rare-earth metals and engineering talent.",
      "Some have even seen it as a foregone conclusion that America would dominate the AI race, despite some high-profile warnings from top executives who said the country's advantages should not be taken for granted.",
      "The US may still go on to command the sector, but there is a sense that DeepSeek has shaken some of that swagger.",
      "Trump's words after the Chinese app's sudden emergence in recent days were probably cold comfort to the likes of Altman and Ellison. He called this moment a \"wake-up call\" for the American tech industry, and said finding a way to do cheaper AI is ultimately a \"good thing\".",
      "It is also worth noting that it was not just tech stocks that took a beating on Monday. Energy stocks did too. DeepSeek's arrival on the scene has upended many assumptions we have long held about what it takes to develop AI.",
      "Maybe that nuclear renaissance - including firing up America's Three Mile Island energy plant once again - won't be needed. Maybe it does not take so much capital, compute, and power after all.",
      "For now, the future of semiconductor giants like Nvidia remains unclear.",
      "DeepSeek says its model was developed with existing technology along with open source software that can be used and shared by anybody for free.",
      "But WIRED reports that for years, DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfung's hedge fund High-Flyer has been stockpiling the chips that form the backbone of AI \u2013 known as GPUs, or graphics processing units.",
      "The company has said its models deployed H800 chips made by Nvidia. US policy restricting sales of higher-powered chips to China might get a second-look under the new Trump administration.",
      "OpenAI's Sam Altman was mostly quiet on X Monday. But very late in the day, he wrote that DeepSeek was \"impressive\u2026 particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price\".",
      "\"We will obviously deliver much better models and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor!\" he wrote.",
      "It was Sputnik that truly ushered in the space age. There, too, the US was caught off guard. How its tech sector responds to this apparent surprise from a Chinese company will be interesting - and it may have added serious fuel to the AI race.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 06:00:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Shell companies were used to charter the sanctioned oligarch\u2019s yachts to himself, evading VAT, BBC reveals.",
    "story": [
      "It was Christmas 2011, a year after Roman Abramovich had taken delivery of his new superyacht, Eclipse. But it seemed the oligarch would not be using it over the festive period - records show it had been chartered by a company based in the British Virgin Islands.",
      "And yet photographs from Christmas Day that year show Mr Abramovich in the Caribbean sunshine, standing on the swim platform at the rear of the yacht, with Eclipse's large letter-E logo behind him.",
      "Charter records such as this were part of a decade-long scheme to mislead tax authorities, now uncovered in an investigation by the BBC and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.",
      "The scheme falsely presented the Russian oligarch's fleet of yachts as a commercial leasing operation, to dodge millions of euros in VAT on their purchase and running costs.",
      "\"There has been tax evasion,\" Italian tax lawyer and professor Tommaso Di Tanno told the BBC. \"This is criminal.\"",
      "In a statement, lawyers for Mr Abramovich - who now reportedly divides his time between Istanbul, Tel Aviv and the Russian resort of Sochi - said he had \"always obtained independent expert professional tax and legal advice\" and \"acted in accordance\" with it.",
      "The billionaire, who was sanctioned by the UK in March 2022 over his connection to Vladimir Putin's regime, bought five luxury yachts over the course of the 2000s that were involved in the tax scheme.",
      "Among them was the 115m (377ft) Pelorus, which he reportedly lent to Chelsea footballer John Terry for his honeymoon in 2007 - and Eclipse, which at 162.5m (533ft) was once the largest private yacht in the world and worth an estimated $700m (\u00a3559m).",
      "The scheme to dodge tax on the yachts - and other secrets of the sanctioned oligarch's corporate empire - is laid bare in over 400,000 files and 72,000 emails leaked from a Cypriot corporate service provider, MeritServus.",
      "They show how MeritServus administered the oligarch's businesses through a global network of companies owned by a series of trusts of which Mr Abramovich was the beneficiary.",
      "The BBC and its media partners, including the Guardian, have been reporting on the leaked files since 2023 as part of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' Cyprus Confidential investigation. We previously revealed Mr Abramovich's financial links to one of Mr Putin's closest associates, accused of holding the president's wealth.",
      "The files reveal how Mr Abramovich's advisers helped him avoid paying huge tax bills on the yachts' running costs in EU waters by using companies to hire them out to himself or other companies he controlled.",
      "Documents show how the five yachts were leased to a company in Cyprus called Blue Ocean Yacht Management, which chartered them on to a handful of companies in the British Virgin Islands that appeared independent - but which were all in fact controlled by Mr Abramovich.",
      "'Aware of the risks'",
      "The scheme to dodge VAT in Cyprus was set out in a revealing 2005 memorandum on the proposed \"Operating Structure\" for the management of Mr Abramovich's yachts.",
      "\"We want to avoid paying VAT on the purchase price of the yachts and where possible to avoid paying VAT on goods and services provided to the yachts,\" wrote the memo's author, Jonathan Holloway, then a director of Blue Ocean.",
      "Although Blue Ocean and the companies hiring the yachts were all owned by Mr Abramovich's trusts, they were intended to appear unconnected \"so that an investigator checking on our operation would see it as a legitimate structure\", Mr Holloway wrote in the memo he sent to some of Mr Abramovich's closest associates.",
      "Mr Holloway warned them they should be \"aware of the risks\". He wrote: \"We all have to recognise that a determined investigator could eventually discover this is an in-house structure with the possible consequences that would entail.\"",
      "Mr Holloway wrote that Blue Ocean, the companies to which it leased the yachts, and the ultimate \"customer\" should not have the same shareholders, directors or registered addresses, to avoid any \"common link\" that might arouse suspicion.",
      "As the memo noted, Mr Abramovich's lawyer had agreed to put the ownership of Blue Ocean into an entirely separate trust - apparently distancing it from the other companies.",
      "Sure enough, ownership of the yacht management company Blue Ocean was subsequently transferred from the oligarch's main trust to a new one, the Neptune Trust.",
      "'Hide the reality'",
      "The way Mr Abramovich's companies leased the yachts to each other, Prof Di Tanno told the BBC, was an \"artificial structure\" that evaded tax - a criminal offence.",
      "\"My conclusion is that in the case, there has been a tax evasion\u2026 because all the parties know exactly what to do in order to hide the reality,\" he said.",
      "Tax expert Rita de la Feria told the BBC she had seen in the yacht scheme \"indications\" that they \"may be misrepresenting information\".",
      "\"If that is the case, then we are now in the realm of evasion,\" she added.",
      "Mr Holloway, who stepped down as a director of Blue Ocean about 15 years ago, told the BBC that he \"joined Blue Ocean 20 years ago and was there for a relatively short period of time\".",
      "He said he had \"managed literally hundreds of vessels from many different locations around the world\". \"I can't be expected to remember the individual circumstances of every vessel I have ever managed,\" he said, adding that he \"used structures others in the industry were using\".",
      "Lawyers representing Mr Abramovich told the BBC he denied \"any allegation that he had any knowledge\" or was \"personally responsible\" or liable for \"any alleged deception of any government authority\" to evade tax.",
      "His lawyers said that just as Mr Abramovich sought professional legal and tax advice and acted on it, he expects that \"similar advice was sought at the relevant times by those with responsibility for the day-to-day running\" of the companies involved in the scheme.",
      "If this were a real superyacht leasing business, substantial profits might be expected. However Blue Ocean's accounts show that from 2005 to 2012, its expenses almost matched its income.",
      "This meant almost no corporation tax was due as the company's profits were tiny.",
      "A note from the Blue Ocean director suggests the close matching of expenses and income was no accident and the company would generate charters when the scheme needed to cover expenses.",
      "\"At the beginning of each week we will have a meeting in Blue Ocean where we will look at our current bank balances and our cash needs for the next 1~2 weeks [sic]. If we see a need for a cash injection we will raise an appropriate time charter and invoices,\" he wrote.",
      "There is also evidence in the leaked files that charter agreements were backdated. This includes a time charter agreement supposedly signed in July 2005 by Blue Ocean and another Abramovich company in the BVI called Eyke Services. However, records show Eyke Services did not exist at that point - it was not incorporated until a month later.",
      "In another case, a director of Blue Ocean requested the production of a backdated and signed time charter in order to obtain delivery of duty-free fuel for Mr Abramovich's 86m (282ft) yacht Ecstasea - which could accommodate 15 guests in eight suites - saving the billionaire $44,000 (\u00a335,000) in tax.",
      "In the documents, tax consultants from Deloitte in Cyprus wrote to Mr Holloway, the Blue Ocean director, saying if the ships were pleasure vessels, they would have to pay VAT. But if the vessels were classified as commercial, they would not.",
      "A leading superyacht lawyer Benjamin Maltby told the BBC the type of contracts used for many of Mr Abramovich's luxury yacht charters were actually designed for commercial ships carrying dry cargos such as grain or steel.",
      "This gives us more evidence that the whole commercial \"look\" of the operation was a sham.",
      "'Lawyers got onto it'",
      "Mr Abramovich's superyacht scheme came under legal scrutiny twice, with varying levels of success, the BBC and Bureau of Investigative Journalism has learned.",
      "Richard Bridge captained two of Mr Abramovich's yachts for almost six years from 2006 to 2012, including the Pelorus, and the giant Eclipse, the pride of Abramovich's fleet. A couple of years after he finished working for Mr Abramovich, the captain was stopped and questioned at Amsterdam's Schipol Airport.",
      "Italian prosecutors had started proceedings against three of Mr Abramovich's captains - including Mr Bridge - for unpaid excise duties on refuelling and tax evasion.",
      "But Mr Bridge told the BBC he had contacted Blue Ocean and \"their lawyers got onto it\", telling him a few months later the case had been dropped.",
      "Italian court records seen by the BBC show proceedings were halted after the lawyers \"produced documentation\" proving Pelorus was \"entered in the registers as a commercial boat as it is used for commercial purposes or for hire\".",
      "Mr Bridge said he was unaware Mr Abramovich also controlled the companies that were chartering the yachts.",
      "In Cyprus, tax officials were separately investigating Blue Ocean over up to \u20ac17m (\u00a314.3m) in unpaid VAT, disputing the company's claim to be \"zero-rated\" for VAT because it was a commercial operation.",
      "Blue Ocean's lawyers said demands to provide evidence the vessels had been used commercially by the companies chartering them were \"unreasonable and oppressive\", but they had asked its clients anyway and received no response.",
      "We now know that Blue Ocean's clients were, of course, Mr Abramovich's other companies.",
      "According to an appeal judgement in 2018, VAT investigators found Blue Ocean had failed to present any evidence the companies chartering the yachts were \"engaged in economic activity\" and its claim that the boats were used for commercial purposes was rejected.",
      "In the end, Cyprus pursued Blue Ocean for the lower figure of \u20ac14m (\u00a311.8m).",
      "We do not know if the sum was paid - the company failed to attend its own appeal in March 2024 and was dissolved four months later.",

      "Millions of people use tools such as ChatGPT to help them with everyday tasks like writing emails, summarising text, and answering questions - and others even use them to help with basic coding and studying.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is the name of a free AI-powered chatbot, which looks, feels and works very much like ChatGPT.",
      "That means it's used for many of the same tasks, though exactly how well it works compared to its rivals is up for debate.",
      "It is reportedly as powerful as OpenAI's o1 model - released at the end of last year - in tasks including mathematics and coding.",
      "Like o1, R1 is a \"reasoning\" model. These models produce responses incrementally, simulating a process similar to how humans reason through problems or ideas. It uses less memory than its rivals, ultimately reducing the cost to perform tasks.",
      "Like many other Chinese AI models - Baidu's Ernie or Doubao by ByteDance - DeepSeek is trained to avoid politically sensitive questions.",
      "When the BBC asked the app what happened at Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989, DeepSeek did not give any details about the massacre, a taboo topic in China.",
      "It replied: \"I am sorry, I cannot answer that question. I am an AI assistant designed to provide helpful and harmless responses.\"",
      "Chinese government censorship is a huge challenge for its AI aspirations internationally. But DeepSeek's base model appears to have been trained via accurate sources while introducing a layer of censorship or withholding certain information via an additional safeguarding layer.",
      "Deepseek says it has been able to do this cheaply - researchers behind it claim it cost $6m (\u00a34.8m) to train, a fraction of the \"over $100m\" alluded to by OpenAI boss Sam Altman when discussing GPT-4.",
      "DeepSeek's founder reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips, which have been banned from export to China since September 2022.",
      "Some experts believe this collection - which some estimates put at 50,000 - led him to build such a powerful AI model, by pairing these chips with cheaper, less sophisticated ones.",
      "The same day DeepSeek's AI assistant became the most-downloaded free app on Apple's App Store in the US, it was hit with \"large-scale malicious attacks\", the company said, causing the company to temporary limit registrations.",
      "It was also hit by outages on its website on Monday.",
      "Who is behind DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek was founded in December 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, and released its first AI large language model the following year.",
      "Not much is known about Liang, who graduated from Zhejiang University with degrees in electronic information engineering and computer science. But he now finds himself in the international spotlight.",
      "He was recently seen at a meeting hosted by China's premier Li Qiang, reflecting DeepSeek's growing prominence in the AI industry.",
      "Unlike many American AI entrepreneurs who are from Silicon Valley, Mr Liang also has a background in finance.",
      "He is the CEO of a hedge fund called High-Flyer, which uses AI to analyse financial data to make investment decisons - what is called quantitative trading. In 2019 High-Flyer became the first quant hedge fund in China to raise over 100 billion yuan ($13m).",
      "In a speech he gave that year, Liang said, \"If the US can develop its quantitative trading sector, why not China?\"",
      "In a rare interview last year, he said China's AI sector \"cannot remain a follower forever\".",
      "He went on: \"Often, we say there's a one or two-year gap between Chinese and American AI, but the real gap is between originality and imitation. If this doesn't change, China will always be a follower.\"",
      "Asked why DeepSeek's model surprised so many in Silicon Valley, he said: \"Their surprise stems from seeing a Chinese company join their game as an innovator, not just a follower - which is what most Chinese firms are accustomed to.\"",
      "Australia's science minister has raised some doubts over the security of the app.",
      "\"There are a lot of questions that will need to be answered in time on quality, consumer preferences, data and privacy management,\" Ed Husic told ABC.",
      "\"I would be very careful about that. These type of issues need to be weighed up carefully.\"",
      "How are US companies like Nvidia hit?",
      "DeepSeek's achievements undercut the belief that bigger budgets and top-tier chips are the only ways of advancing AI, a prospect which has created uncertainty about the future of high-performance chips.",
      "\"DeepSeek has proven that cutting-edge AI models can be developed with limited compute resources,\" says Wei Sun, principal AI analyst at Counterpoint Research.",
      "\"In contrast, OpenAI, valued at $157 billion, faces scrutiny over its ability to maintain a dominant edge in innovation or justify its massive valuation and expenditures without delivering significant returns.\"",
      "The company's possibly lower costs roiled financial markets on 27 January, leading the tech-heavy Nasdaq to fall more than 3% in a broad sell-off that included chip makers and data centres around the world.",
      "Nvidia appears to have been hit the worst as its stock price plunged 17% on Monday before slowly beginning to recover on Tuesday, roughly 4% by midday.",
      "The chip maker had been the most valuable company in the world, when measured by market capitalisation, but fell to third place after Apple and Microsoft on Monday, when its market value shrank to $2.9tn from $3.5tn, Forbes reported.",
      "DeepSeek is a privately owned company, which means investors cannot buy shares of stock on any of the major exchanges.",
      "China is celebrating DeepSeek's impact",
      "DeepSeek's rise is a huge boost for the Chinese government, which has been seeking to build tech independent of the West.",
      "While the Communist Party is yet to comment, Chinese state media was eager to note that Silicon Valley and Wall Street giants were \"losing sleep\" over DeepSeek, which was \"overturning\" the US stock market.",
      "\"In China, DeepSeek's advances are being celebrated as a testament to the country's growing technological prowess and self-reliance,\" says Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "\"The company's success is seen as a validation of China's Innovation 2.0, a new era of homegrown technological leadership driven by a younger generation of entrepreneurs.\"",
      "But she also warned that this sentiment may also lead to \"tech isolationism\".",

    "story": [
      "This is a key week for the government and its pledge to grow the UK economy.",
      "On Wednesday, Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to announce plans for a third runway at Heathrow airport as part of measures to propel investment and kick some life into Britain's lacklustre performance.",
      "Growth, Reeves will reiterate, is the priority.",
      "However opponents claim expanding the airport would lead to higher emissions and blight local communities with extra noise and pollution. Last week, Friends of the Earth said it would be \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\".",
      "But is expanding the country's biggest airport the right way to bring an immediate boost to the economy in any case?",
      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and - the airport's owner would argue - provides a vital avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",
      "Expanding the airport would, in theory, provide an avenue for growth that simply isn't there at the moment.",
      "The construction project itself - the biggest privately-funded infrastructure scheme in Europe - would create thousands of jobs.",
      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

      "DeepSeek is powered by the open source DeepSeek-V3 model, which its researchers claim was trained for around $6m  - significantly less than the billions spent by rivals.",
      "But this claim has been disputed by others in AI.",
      "The researchers say they use already existing technology, as well as open source code - software that can be used, modified or distributed by anybody free of charge.",
      "DeepSeek's emergence comes as the US is restricting the sale of the advanced chip technology that powers AI to China.",

    "summary": "The territory's untapped mineral wealth has caught the eye of both mining firms and Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has said he thinks the US will gain control of Greenland, underlining his persistent claim on the Arctic island, on one occasion pointing to \"economic security\" as the reason. While the autonomous Danish territory has been quick to say it isn't for sale, its vast and mostly untapped mineral resources are in great demand.",
      "Jagged grey peaks suddenly appear before us, as the motorboat navigates choppy coastal waters and dramatic fjords at Greenland's southern tip.",
      "\"Those very high pointy mountains, it's basically a gold belt,\" gestures Eldur Olafsson, the chief executive of mining company Amaroq Minerals.",
      "After sailing for two hours we stepped ashore at a remote valley beneath Nalunaq mountain, where the firm is drilling for gold.",
      "It's also scouring the surrounding mountain range and valleys, hunting for other valuable minerals, having snapped up exploration licences spanning over 10,000 sq km (3,861 sq miles).",
      "\"We're looking for copper, nickel, and rare earths,\" says the Icelandic boss. \"This is uncharted, and still has the potential to have multiple big deposits.\"",
      "The base camp is a cluster of mobile buildings and bright orange accommodation tents housing more than 100 staff, including Greenlanders, Australians, and British former coal miners. From there a road climbs up the valley, and we drive by car into the gold mine, following a dark tunnel upwards inside the mountain.",
      "\"See here!\" says Mr Olafsson pointing to a seam of white quartz and a thin dark line. \"Gold, gold, gold. All the way over. Isn't that extraordinary?\"",

      "The mine, which Amaroq bought in 2015, had operated for most of the preceding decade, but closed due to then falling gold prices, and high operating costs.",
      "Amaroq is confident that the mine will now be profitable. And it plans to ramp up production this year, where it has built a brand new processing plant to crush the ore and refine the precious metal into gold bars.",
      "\"We can either walk off site every month with a suitcase of gold, versus a 30,000 tonne ship [carrying the ore],\" explains Mr Olafsson.",
      "He says that Greenland presents an unrivalled opportunity because its huge mineral reserves are largely untouched.",
      "\"It can be the supplier of all the minerals the Western world will need for decades,\" adds Mr Olafsson. \"And that is a very unique position.\"",
      "Yet currently there are just two active mines on the entire island.",
      "Greenland is a self-governing territory that is part of Denmark, but controls its own natural resources.",
      "It's endowed with the eighth largest reserves of so-called rare earth elements, which are vital for making everything from mobile phones to batteries and electric motors. It also has large amounts of other key metals, such as lithium and cobalt.",
      "There is oil and gas too, but new drilling is banned, while deep-sea mining has also been ruled out.",
      "Christian Kjeldsen, director of Greenland's Business Association, says that the global \"geopolitical situation right now is driving interest in the world's biggest island\".",
      "He points to China having the world's largest reserves of rare earth metals, while the West wants to secure alternative supplies.",

      "Up to Greenland to decide its future, Danish PM tells Trump",
      "Trump ramps up threats to gain control of Greenland and Panama Canal",
      "That has fuelled a growing focus among Western nations to get access to Greenland's minerals. China has also been keen to get involved, but its presence is limited.",
      "Reuters recently reported that the US lobbied an Australian mining firm not to sell Greenland's biggest rare earth project to potential Chinese buyers.",
      "Greenland's Minister for Business, Trade and Raw Materials, Naaja Nathanielsen, says that interest in the territory's minerals has \"absolutely increased within the last five years or so\".",
      "She adds: \"We're used to being a hotspot for the climate crisis. We want to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Permits have now been given for 100 blocs across Greenland, where companies are searching for viable deposits. British, Canadian and Australian mining firms are the biggest foreign licence holders, while Americans hold just one.",
      "But there are many more steps before these sites become potential mines.",
      "Yet while Greenland may be sitting on mineral riches, any \"gold rush\" continues to be slow to materialise.",
      "The economy, which has an annual GDP of just over $3bn (\u00a32.4bn), is still driven by the public sector and fishing. And the territory also relies on an annual $600m subsidy from Denmark.",
      "Greenland's politicians hope that mining revenues will reduce reliance on the annual $600m subsidy from Denmark, and help boost independence efforts. But in the meantime Greenland is making more money from tourism.",
      "Officially mining is still important for independence, says Javier Arnaut, head of Arctic Social Sciences at Greenland University. \"But in practical terms, you can see that there are very few mining licenses awarded.\"",
      "Ms Nathanielsen concedes that while there are partnerships being developed with the US and EU, \"we still have not seen large amounts of money flowing into this sector\". She hopes that there will be another three to five mines operating within the next decade.",
      "However mining is not easy in Greenland because of its remote geography and weather. It's the world's largest island and 80% of it is covered by an ice sheet. It has rugged mountains and no roads between settlements.",
      "\"It's an arctic terrain,\" says Jakob Kl\u00f8ve Keiding, from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, which has mapped the territory's deposits. \"We have problems with harsh conditions in terms of the climate and limited infrastructure. So it's quite expensive to open a mine.\"",
      "Those high costs, coupled with low global metal prices, have held back investors.",
      "Others blame red tape for the sector's slow growth. The territory has strict environmental regulations and social impact requirements, and getting permits can take time.",
      "Ms Nathanielsen maintains that most communities do support mining, and that it boosts local economies. \"They [overseas miners] are shopping in the local shop. They're employing local employees. They're chartering a local boat or helicopter,\" she says.",
      "Yet in the south's biggest town, Qaqortoq, resident Heidi Mortensen M\u00f8ller is sceptical whether new mines will lead to employment for locals. \"When they say they're going to add jobs, who are they talking about?\"",
      "Jess Berthelsen, head of local labour union, SIK, says that many people think mining income \"will leave the country\", and not benefit Greenland. But he supports the growth of the sector. \"Greenland needs more income and to earn money from other ways than fishing.\"",
      "It's unclear how Trump's latest gambit on Greenland will play out. However, the territory's prime minister Mute Egede said earlier this month that \"we need to do business with the US\" and that it was \"doors open in terms of mining\".",
      "Mr Kjeldsen from the business association, hopes it will be bring \"much needed investment\" to the sector. \"On the other hand, if the uncertainty surrounding the signals from Trump drag on for a longer period, there is a risk that this might impact the investment environment negatively.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 25 Jan 2025 02:26:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Maxime Chapoutier makes wines that combine French and Australian grapes, a strict no-no in the EU.",
    "story": [
      "Winemaker Maxime Chapoutier would be arrested if he tried to sell two of his newest wines in his native France.",
      "\"There would likely be outrage about these wines in France, and that would be a good thing,\" he says. \"Sometimes you need to be provocative to drive change.\"",
      "The two bottles in question, one white and one red, would be illegal in France because they are made from a blend of French and Australian base wines.",
      "Under both French and European Union law it is forbidden to make a wine that combines EU and non-EU fruit. In France in particular, authorities take such things very seriously.",
      "The French wine industry has a celebrated word called \"terroir\", which applies to all the environmental factors that affect vines growing in a vineyard, such the soil, the climate, and the elevation. As a result, wines from a specific place are held in the highest esteem.",
      "Add a strict appellation or classification system for France's wine regions, and the thought of blending French and Australian wine to create a global hybrid would horrify many French wine lovers.",
      "Yet Maxime has done just this, and it is all thanks to one word - Brexit.",
      "For while he cannot sell the two wines in the EU, he can do so in the UK now that London no longer has to follow food and drink rules set by Brussels.",
      "Maxime has created the wines in partnership with UK online retailer The Wine Society, where they are called Hemispheres Red and Hemispheres White. The red is made from syrah grapes, or shiraz as they are called in Australia, while the white is a blend of marsanne and viognier varieties.",
      "The Australian red and white wine components are shipped in bulk to the UK, where they are blended with wine from France's northern Rhone and Roussillon regions before bottling.",
      "Maxime who works for his family's celebrated Rhone-based wine company Chapoutier, say that while he respects France's focus on terroir, there should be room for global blends to also be sold.",
      "\"Chapoutier has been making wine for more than 200 years, very terroir driven, and biodynamic,\" he says. \"But more and more people are turning their back on French wines because they don't understand the complicated appellation rules.",
      "\"We need to adapt for consumers and make wines more accessible, which international blends can help to do. Maybe the EU law will change. It is also more ecological to ship wine from Australia to Europe in bulk, as you don't have the weight of all the glass bottles.\"",
      "Another wine company now making wines by combining grapes from two continents is Australian firm Penfolds. It sells reds made from both Australian and Californian grapes, and others that mix Australian and French. Again they cannot be sold in the EU, but they can in the UK, US, Australia and elsewhere.",
      "Penfolds refers to these blends as \"wine of the world\", and says that they \"possess an otherness that can best be described as worldly\". Whatever that is supposed to mean.",
      "Unsurprisingly, some more traditional winemakers are not in favour of this development. One such person is Jas Swan, an independent winemaker based in Germany.",
      "While the two-continent blends from Chapoutier and Penfolds are made with care from quality grapes, and priced accordingly, she is fearful that if the trend grows it will mean a lot more cheap, low-grade wine going on sale.",
      "\"I believe that those types of wine would have nothing left of any terroir, even before they left their continent,\" she says. \"Those wines would have seen only machine work, heavy additions to keep them clean, and are manufactured to be easy to drink for the masses.",
      "\"Why can consumers not be more demanding? The consumerism is insane.\"",
      "Peter Richards, who holds the top global wine industry qualification, the master of wine (MW), is also sniffy. \"The notion of cross-country blending for wine isn't something I find outrageous in itself,\" he says. \"My concern is more that this is about creating novelty for novelty's sake.\"",
      "His wife, Susie Barrie, who is also an MW, adds: \"I remain to be convinced that a wine made by blending grapes from different countries can be great in terms of taste.\"",
      "By contrast, wine writer Jamie Goode says that development of two-continent wine \"is actually quite a fun idea\".",
      "\"If the wines are good, and made well from good vineyard sites - and not simply a gimmick blending together cheap bulk wines and then slapping a huge margin on the wine - then this is quite interesting.",
      "\"The fundamental basis for fine wine is the notion of terroir - that wines come from a place, and their flavour expresses this place in unique ways. But not all wines have to be terroir wines, and there's room for wines like this.",
      "\"In some ways, there's a lot of skill required to blend the right wines together to create something interesting coming from such different places.\"",
      "Pierre Mansour, head of buying for The Wine Society, says he and his colleagues came up with the idea of creating two wines made from grapes from different continents as part of the company's 150th birthday celebrations.",
      "\"We were thinking about the future of wine, and we wanted to do something innovative. In the end we thought that one area of innovation is blending, of creating a wine that can mitigate for the impact of climate change on a particular country.",
      "\"And from a carbon footprint out of view, it is more environmentally friendly to ship wine in bulk from Australia to the UK. But at the same time we did expect 'terroirists' to say 'hold on this is fundamentally against the French principle of wine'.",
      "\"So we approached Chapoutier, thinking that they might say 'are you mad, how dare you insult us', but they were great. They were really enthusiastic.\""

      "Children who took part in riots last summer were primarily driven by curiosity and the \"thrill of the moment\", rather than far-right ideology and social media misinformation, the children's commissioner for England has said.",
      "Deep distrust in the police and a lack of opportunities were also behind some children's decisions to take part, a new report suggests.",
      "Violence broke out across the country in the days and weeks following the murders of three children at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport in July 2024.",
      "A government spokesperson said the mobilisation of the police and criminal justice system to bring perpetrators of all ages to justice was vital in restoring order.",
      "But Dame Rachel de Souza told BBC Radio 5 Live that judges should have the power to wipe criminal records clean where youths had \"done their time for some very silly things\".",
      "Her report said her interviews with children charged over the disorder \"paints a more complex picture\" about why they had become involved.",
      "'Real regret'",
      "Dame Rachel told BBC One's Breakfast programme children who had turned up after hearing about the riots had been \"egged on\" by \"adults who were extremist and were really there to do terrible things\".",
      "Many of the children she had spoken to had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and felt they had acted impulsively.",
      "\"One little boy said, 'I broke windows. The next day, I drove past those windows on the bus and I felt terrible.' There was real regret,\" she said.",
      "The children's commissioner's findings come a week after Axel Rudakubana pleaded guilty to the murders of Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe.",
      "He was sentenced to 52 years in prison for the \"meticulously planned rampage\" in which 10 other people, mostly children, were also stabbed on 29 July last year.",
      "False rumours had spread online in the hours after the attack that the perpetrator had been a migrant, and a violent protest took place close to the scene the following day.",
      "Riots in which mosques and hotels housing migrants were attacked soon spread to many other towns and cities across England and Northern Ireland.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the violence at the time as \"far-right thuggery\" and promised that those involved would \"face the full force of the law\".",
      "The children's commissioner's report said at least 147 children had been arrested and 84 charged since the riots, with some as young as 12 sentenced over their involvement.",
      "Dame Rachel said her interviews with 14 of those \"unheard and overlooked\" children \"raise some really serious questions about childhood in England and why our children feel so disaffected and disempowered\".",
      "However, she said her report \"does not excuse criminality\".",
      "\"As children's commissioner, it's my duty to listen to children, regardless of their circumstances,\" she said.",
      "\"The harm caused by these children's actions is undeniable. Many \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the children acknowledged the need for accountability and consequences for their actions.",
      "\"Today's findings offer no simple solutions but paints a more complex picture than has been debated following the riots. However, it is one that we must grapple with in order to create a more positive experience of childhood.\"",
      "Her report suggested that previous negative interactions and a deep-seated mistrust of the police had fuelled the actions of children, who viewed the riots as an opportunity to retaliate against the police.",
      "Poverty and a lack of opportunities in their communities also formed the background of their involvement, the report said.",
      "Dame Rachel criticised the \"unusually severe and swift\" charges which followed the riots, which she said overlooked children's potential for rehabilitation.",
      "She added that variation between regions in terms of children's outcomes amounted to a \"postcode lottery\" for those who became involved with the youth justice system.",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"The senseless violence we saw on our streets after the tragic loss of Bebe, Elsie and Alice brought shame to our nation, and the mobilisation of our police and entire criminal justice system to bring perpetrators of all ages to justice was vital in restoring order. There is no justification for the violence which they endured last year.",
      "\"More widely, work is taking place across government \u2013 underscored by our Plan for Change \u2013 to break down the barriers to opportunity and ensure that every child has the best start in life.\""

      "More than half the year group have handed in their phones, with some pupils telling the BBC they already felt \"less stressed\".",
      "By the age of 12, 97% of children have their own phone, according to the regulator Ofcom.",

      "The school has bought mobile phone storage lockers so Year 7 students can safely store their phones during the day.",
      "Mr Beveridge said when they introduced the scheme just before Christmas, 10 pupils handed in their phones.",
      "Within a month more than half the year group had chosen to drop them off at the start of the day.",
      "Among them is Mila, who said she \"felt better\" and \"less stressed\" without the worry of it going off in class.",
      "Another pupil, Elliot, said his phone was a \"really big distraction\" and he had chosen to hand it in so he did not have to \"think about it all day\".",
      "At the start of the next school year, the scheme will be compulsory for Year 7s and it may be rolled out to older year groups as well.",
      "Mr Beveridge said headteachers across Solihull wanted to take \"collective action\" on the issue, which is why they had written a letter to parents.",
      "It is not about being negative about technology, he added, but about making sure that everyone was aware of the risks.",
      "\"The hope is that sooner or later it will be the social norm not to buy a smartphone until young people are at least 14, maybe older.",
      "\"Then parents won't feel so much pressure,\" he said.",

      "She said the letter from Mr Beveridge had been \"really reassuring\".",
      "On Tuesday night the school is hosting an information evening for 300 parents, where a panel of experts will explain the risks of overuse of smartphones.",
      "Among those speaking will be Harriet, who is in Year 13 at Alderbrook Sixth Form.",
      "She said she had had a phone since she was 11 years old, describing it as a \"necessity\".",
      "But the 17-year-old said they were a \"huge distraction\" and said it was \"crazy\" that she had to use an app to lock her phone and all her apps when she was revising.",
      "She said she had also experienced the \"darker side\" of the technology when last year a man had airdropped inappropriate photos to her at a bus stop.",
      "\"As girls you have to deal with that added pressure,\" she said.",
      "The event had been partly organised by Claire Smith, the principal of nearby Tudor Grange Academy, which has been a phone-free school for many years.",
      "The policy ensured students were safe, that they could socialise and play and that they were not distracted from learning, said Mrs Smith.",
      "She added that she wanted to be involved in the event to open up the conversation beyond schools to families and the community.",

    "story": [
      "One word keeps cropping up during our interview with Glasgow four-piece Mogwai \u2013 and that word is \"weird\".",
      "It was \"psychedelically weird\" when their last album, As The Love Continues, unexpectedly went to number one in 2021.",
      "The achievement was made \"even weirder\" by the fact it happened during the pandemic, \"so we couldn't even go to the pub to talk about how weird it was\", says frontman Stuart Braithwaite.",
      "The success took them all the way to the Mercury Prize gala (\"such a weird ceremony\"), but they didn't let it influence their new album, The Bad Fire.",
      "In fact, they completely forgot to mention the chart achievement to their new producer, John Congleton (St Vincent, The Killers, Blondie, Modest Mouse).",
      "He only found out when a French journalist brought it up in an interview.",
      "\"He was like, 'Wait, your last album went to number one?' And we were like, 'Yeah'.",
      "\"And he was like, 'Wow, that's weird'.\"",
      "To be fair, he was right.",
      "Mogwai are not a band who ever seemed destined for global domination.",
      "Formed by longtime friends who wanted to create \"serious guitar music\", the quartet specialise in long, mesmerising instrumentals, riddled with creeping anxiety and devastating pay-offs.",
      "Their journey to number one took 25 years, aided by chart rules that place higher value on physical record sales over streams when calculating rankings.",
      "Mogwai - a cult band with a fanbase that prizes vinyl \u2013 found the scales tipped in their favour. For one glorious week, they outsold Dua Lipa and Harry Styles.",
      "\"It was a huge surprise,\" Braithwaite reiterates.",
      "\"We want our music to do as well as it can, but we're not uber-ambitious. We're not like Queen, plotting world domination.\"",
      "But even if the band had been inclined to capitalise on their success, fate was conspiring against them.",
      "As they prepared to record the follow-up to As The Love Continues, keyboardist Barry Burns received the news every parent dreads: His daughter might die.",
      "Doctors had diagnosed her with aplastic anaemia, also known as bone marrow failure, where the body stops producing enough blood cells.",
      "\"She had blood coming out of her gums and bruises all over,\" he recalls. \"It was extremely stressful.\"",
      "The condition is exceptionally rare, with only 30 to 40 children diagnosed in the UK per year, but Burns had first-hand experience of how serious it could be.",
      "\"The weird thing was that my neighbour when I was a kid had it and, sadly, she died,\" he says.",
      "\"So obviously, I really panicked because I thought I knew the outcome \u2013 but thankfully the treatment is completely different now.\"",
      "After a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, his daughter recovered.",
      "\"She's going to be fine, but I've had an awful two years.\"",
      "Opaque and impressionistic",
      "It wasn't the only trauma the band experienced while making the record.",
      "Live agent Mick Griffiths, who had worked with them since the start of their career, died of cancer, while bassist Dominic Aitchison lost his father.",
      "Even Braithwaite's pet dog, Prince, had problems that caused turmoil. \"He got cancer and had to have his leg amputated two weeks before we started recording,\" he recalls.",
      "Appropriately enough, the album's title, The Bad Fire, is a Glaswegian term for hell. But anyone expecting an outpouring of grief or a reckoning with mortality is in for disappointment.",
      "\"If anything weighty happens in my life, the last thing I want to do is write a song about it,\" Braithwaite told The Herald newspaper in 2003, an ethos that holds true today.",
      "Largely instrumental, their songs are deliberately left open to interpretation. The band christen their compositions with nonsense titles and in-jokes (You're Lionel Richie, Secret Pint, Simon Ferocious) to avoid the imposition of meaning.",
      "The new album continues that tradition, with deliciously-titled tracks like Pale Vegan Hip Pain and Fanzine Made Of Flesh (although Lion Rumpus may be the most self-descriptive entry in the band's discography).",
      "When lyrics appear, they're opaque and impressionistic. The only hint of the turbulence Mogwai experienced comes on the groggy, distortion-washed 18 Volcanoes, where Braithwaite quietly sings: \"Hope has come another day/Hold me close in every way.\"",
      "\"Some journalists in France said the album was really cathartic, and I can kind of see that,\" he says. \"But I don't think its maudlin at all.",
      "\"It's vaguely upbeat, by our standards.\"",
      "Released last Friday, The Bad Fire is heading for the top five of the UK albums chart amid stiff competition from Central Cee and Teddy Swims.",
      "Again, physical sales will give The Bad Fire an advantage over streaming hits, a situation Braithwaite is pretty happy about.",
      "\"The streaming world is very murky and hard to understand,\" he says.",
      "\"It does make a lot of money, but it makes a lot of money for old music and artists with popular back catalogues, and I think that's really discouraged a lot of big labels from investing in new music.\"",
      "He adds that Spotify is filled with \"fake bands making generic music\" for its curated playlists, especially in genres like chill-out, lo-fi and relaxation.",
      "It's an accusation that's been repeatedly levelled against the streaming service, and which it has called \"categorically untrue\". But Braithwaite is sceptical.",
      "\"You absolutely know that if anyone's going to be making generic AI music, it's going to be the streaming services, just so they don't have to pay humans.\"",
      "Streaming isn't entirely bad for Mogwai, however. Over on YouTube, their crepuscular 2005 album track Take Me Somewhere Nice has been streamed 85 million times.",
      "The video isn't even official. Uploaded by a fan, it's illustrated by a drawing of a girl with her head in an upturned goldfish bowl.",
      "Originally drawn by video game designer Ken Wong, the picture's aura of disconnection and alienation has become so synonymous with Mogwai's song that some fans have turned it into tattoos.",
      "\"I almost want to go, 'Mate, you know, that's not the cover of the record',\" laughs Braithwaite. \"But it's cool.",
      "\"And the comments under the video are a sort of endless message board of young kids who are going through a hard time supporting each other. There's an agony aunt vibe about it.",
      "\"That's one thing I do like about the digital world, that music has these other lives.\"",
      "For Braithwaite, who read a lot of William Blake's poetry during the recording of The Bad Fire, there's something alluring about the prospect of art outliving its creator.",
      "\"I'm kind of obsessed with the concept of eternity within culture,\" he says.",
      "\"William Blake was kind of laughed out of society for his ideas but hundreds of years later, his paintings were projected onto the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, and Jerusalem is the unofficial English national anthem. It's incredible.",
      "\"I like the idea of, when we're long gone, having made some kind of mark.\"",
      "The concept has extra resonance this year, as Mogwai celebrate their 30th anniversary. They've come a long way, from gobby young upstarts who sold T-shirts slagging off their rivals to respected stalwarts of the British rock scene.",
      "So how does it feel to have reached this stage? Was it something they ever anticipated at their first practice, the first Tuesday after Glastonbury, in the front room of his parents' house?",
      "\"Well, I thought we'd have flying cars by this point,\" laughs Braithwaite. \"So any joy at the fact I was still eking out a living as a musician would probably be tempered by the lack of jet packs.\"",
      "To put it another way, it simply feels weird."

      "'I laugh at ridiculousness of racism'",
      "In the first series, Leah confronts the entrenched racism at St. Gilbert's by challenging the display of a racist painting and Campbell says it was hard to perform scenes that tackled issues of racism and microaggressions.",
      "\"I had to really prepare myself for some scenes,\" she explains. \"I was looking at an offensive painting every day and that was hard but I used that fuel to arm my character\".",
      "She adds that it's important for these conversations to be had and Boarders does it well as it \"explores those difficult topics through comedy\".",
      "Tedeku says he appreciated having other actors similar to him around so that when things got too much they could \"group together and laugh at how stupid things are\".",
      "\"I actually think racism is funny in that I laugh at how ridiculous it is that you can hate someone so much that you go out of your way to make fun of them or single them out all because of the colour of their skin.\"",
      "The first season of Boarders was largely praised by critics - The Guardian awarded it four-stars and said the show doesn't get \"bogged down in conflicts about race and class\" and instead \"encompasses all the mess and joy of youth, where few people ever really feel that they fit in\".",
      "Similarly, The Telegraph called Boarders \"razor-sharp\" and said it tackles \"everything from bigotry to inclusion\".",
      "The Daily Mail, however, wasn't impressed, suggesting it was \"full of lazy sterotypes\" and giving it only one star.",
      "In the new series, the students are pitted against each other as the number of scholarships are to be whittled down from five to three.",
      "Tedeku says he knows what it feels like in real life to be set against his peers.",

      "His co-star Sekou Diaby who plays Toby, agrees and explains that the acting industry \"can be a toxic environment\".",
      "\"Competition is healthy but sometimes it's so aggressive it's as if you're actually fighting each other. It's crazy and backwards to push your peers down.\"",

      "\"In America you see more black minority groups working together to achieve something, but in the UK it feels like you're fighting for each other's spot.\"",
      "Diaby adds that it's even harder to break into the industry if you're from a working class background as \"there's a lot of nepotism in the industry\".",
      "\"But being different is also really powerful because your point of view is rarer in the industry so your take on things will be more unique and that's what will make you stand out.\"",

      "At a screening in October, I was struck by the impact Hard Truths had on the audience. Its relatively short 95-minute runtime disguises a film with significant depth and which punches well above its weight.",
      "Speaking to BBC News in December, Jean-Baptiste reflected: \"Pansy comes from a generation where you're taught to just get on with things. It's like the pre-Oprah generation, self-help - it's before all that. You just went, 'I feel rubbish, but I've got to do the laundry.' You get up and you get on with it.\"",

      "When the lists of the most successful songs of 2024 in the charts, streaming and social media were revealed recently, they included the expected big hitters and some evergreen classics. But sprinkled among them was a different type of hit song.",
      "A number of tracks that failed to make a big impact when they were first released, mostly in the 2010s, have since bubbled up and become firm favourites.",
      "The rise of these slow-burning sleeper hits in recent years is \"one of the most fascinating trends right now\", says Stuart Dredge, head of insight at Music Ally.",
      "Here is our guide to the biggest 2010s sleeper hits.",
      "The Night We Met - Lord Huron (2015)",
      "This song only reached number 77 in the UK at the time of release, but was the 60th most popular song in 2024, according to the Official Charts Company's end-of-year list - above Charli XCX's biggest track. It was even higher on Spotify's global end-of-year chart, at 24.",
      "The LA folk-rock group's song first took off after being used in the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack in 2018, and with aching lyrics harking back to the start of a relationship, it has since been recycled in various TikTok memes and Molly-Mae Hague's pregnancy announcement video in 2022 (even though it's actually a break-up song). Cosmopolitan put it top of its playlist of Sad Songs to Blast When You're Feeling Hella Moody.",
      "Sweater Weather - The Neighbourhood (2012)",
      "This one reached the US top 20 but missed the UK top 40. It has snowballed on social media and is now the seventh most-streamed song in Spotify history, spending more than three years in total in its global daily top 50. The California band say the autumnal theme made it an \"accidental seasonal hit\", and it has also been adopted as a bisexual anthem.",
      "Champagne Coast - Blood Orange (2011)",
      "Champagne Coast didn't chart originally but British singer Dev Hynes' seductive \"come to my bedroom\" refrain was used in TV show Euphoria's soundtrack in 2019, and then the song blew up on TikTok last summer. It was the most popular old song on the platform in 2024 and sixth overall on Billboard's end-of-year TikTok chart. It finally reached the UK top 20 in July.",
      "Evergreen - Richy Mitch & the Coal Miners (2017)",
      "Evergreen is just 87 seconds long and didn't chart originally, but became the go-to song for \"hopecore\" videos offering snippets of positivity and optimism on TikTok last year. It spent 35 weeks in the UK top 60 in 2024, and was in the overall end-of-year top 100.",
      "Lovely - Billie Eilish (2018)",
      "Released on the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack, this track didn't reach the UK or US top 40s, but Eilish's delicate duet with Khalid is now her most-streamed song, and 14th on Spotify's all-time list. It is apparently, among other things, good for sending you to sleep.",
      "I Wanna Be Yours - Arctic Monkeys (2013)",
      "I Wanna Be Yours was on the hit AM album but only reached 99 in the UK as a single. However, last year it had more Spotify plays than any other song over a decade old. TikTok users have chosen the melodramatic chorus to soundtrack their romantic declarations.",
      "The Sound of Silence - Disturbed (2015)",
      "Hard rock band Disturbed's brooding but beautiful cover of the Simon and Garfunkel classic has now spent eight months in the UK top 60 in the past year, helped by a dance remix and a TikTok shuffle dance trend.",
      "See You Again by Tyler, the Creator (2017)",
      "See You Again didn't chart at the time but took off on TikTok (where else?), with one snippet turning into a personality quiz (do you sing along with Tyler's \"OK OK OK OK\" or guest vocalist Kali Uchis' \"La la la la\"?). The song finally reached number 21 in the UK in 2023, and was the 19th most-streamed song on Spotify in the US in 2024.",
      "Songs from all eras have been resurfacing for several years, of course.",
      "Many were hits to start with. Mr Brightside by The Killers (2004) is a fixture, while Kate Bush's Running Up That Hill (1985) and Sophie Ellis-Bextor's Murder on the Dancefloor (2001) shot back up the charts thanks to TV and film soundtracks.",
      "But when it comes to songs that weren't as big the first time around, the 2010s dominate.",
      "One reason is that people who grew up in those years are introducing their favourite tunes to others, according to Sarah Kloboves from music data analysts Chartmetric.",
      "\"This revival is pioneered by these older Gen Z listeners [in their mid-20s]. But when they start to create these trends, you also have the younger Gen Zs and even Gen Alpha [young teens and below] that are hearing these songs for the first time - the release date is interesting because it's old, but it's not too old.\"",
      "Dredge agrees: \"A lot of the influencers on places like TikTok are a few years older, so they are probably using songs from the 2010s that soundtracked their teenage years.\"",
      "Taylor Swift's Cruel Summer (2019) could even be described as a sleeper hit - it wasn't released as an official single at the time, but eventually reached number one in 2023 and was the fifth-biggest song of 2024 overall on Apple Music.",
      "Others, though, are not such obvious hits. Musically, most sound quite restrained and atmospheric - they're emotive soundtrack songs rather than upbeat bangers or full-blooded anthems.",
      "\"These aren't songs that were released with the intention of being a pop hit,\" Kloboves says.",
      "\"Not to bash on pop music or pop stars, but sometimes they all sort of sound the same. But I think a lot of these songs are very different from what you might usually hear in the mainstream,\" she says.",
      "\"I think that's why listeners really resonate with them, because they're slightly unique and different-sounding.\"",

      "\"It's having something that emotionally resonates. That could be a lyric. It could be the way that the instrumental lands.\"",

      "\"It's no longer passive listening,\" Mustapha adds. \"People are really active participants in the culture. And they're active because they are taking this music and essentially reimagining it in their own way.\"",
      "Record labels do try to help back-catalogue songs become sleeper hits, but it normally happens organically thanks to fans, Dredge says.",

      "Other songs continue the theme of double-edged romance. Wish You Were Dead is about a relationship that veers between being affectionate and volatile; while in Big Brown Eyes, Young gets weak-kneed when a lukewarm love interest insults her.",
      "Unlike some artists, there's little need to ask Young what her songs are about - the stories are laid out in her raw and razor-sharp lyrics.",
      "But how real are the situations and scenarios about which she sings?",
      "\"Pretty real. As real as it gets, to be honest,\" she replies.",
      "\"I just write from my own experience and they're very real. They're all the things that I've been through, all situations I've had, and all experiences I've had.\"",
      "The honesty of her songwriting sets her apart from many other artists, but she says she knows no other way.",
      "\"I don't think about it. Music is the only place I can be dead honest,\" she says. \"Not that I'm a liar...",
      "\"But I feel like that's my outlet, the place I can be the most honest. I never really think about it. It doesn't feel like a difficult thing to do, or something that feels like I'm baring my soul or anything. It's just I've always done that in my music.\"",
      "The album ends with an equally candid spoken-word outro, in which she says the LP was written to help her accept and love herself, and to realise she doesn't need \"no ugly man (or woman)\".",
      "\"I haven't got there yet but I will,\" she says on the track.",
      "'Different angle' on Brat",
      "Young is managed by two men who separately worked with Amy Winehouse and Adele, and she has something in common with those two artists in her combination of fragility and front.",
      "To that, she adds the conversational tone of Lily Allen and the modern pop sensibility and chaotic energy of Charli XCX.",
      "Young's breakthrough coincided with the reign of Charli's Brat ethos, which she defined as \"a girl who is a little messy, likes to party, maybe says dumb things sometimes, feels herself, and has a breakdown but parties through it\".",
      "Young feels an affinity with that. \"I massively do, and I think it's that thing of empowered women who like to party and be themselves, and that's really important to me,\" she says.",
      "\"I guess I come from a different angle - of a less heightened version of that, I guess. It would be more like, 'I don't really give a [care], but I also really do'. That's what I guess I stand by a little bit more.\"",
      "Bratpop season will stretch further when Young releases her next album later this year. It is nearly finished and will \"dig deeper\" than the last, she says. How much deeper can she really dig?",
      "\"Quite a lot,\" she says. \"There's quite a lot more to say. There's a lot of other topics and things that have happened to me, and things that I've gone through that I want to discuss with people.",
      "\"But also things that are a little bit less about love, and about other things that I've gone through.\"",
      "Now that Messy's cleaned up, we can expect to see more of Young, and her shiny teeth."

    "story": [
      "The Brutalist tells the story of Hungarian immigrant and holocaust survivor L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, who is trying to rebuild his life in post-war America through his work as an architect.",
      "Oscar winner Adrien Brody delved deep into his own family history for his portrayal of the character, reflecting on his mother and grandparents' experiences in fleeing their native Hungary, which after World War Two was becoming a satellite state of the Soviet Union.",
      "\"The wonderful thing is, it's an opportunity for me to honour my ancestral struggles - my mother and my grandparents' hardships and loss in fleeing Hungary in the '50s and emigrating to the United States.",
      "\"[It's] very moving to be reminded of the details and hardships that they experienced that very much parallel the lived experience of my character,\" Brody says.",
      "The actor says his character's drive to create also reflects his own path as an actor.",
      "\"Any artistic person, I think, can relate to the struggle and yearnings to leave, create a body of work and leave behind something of great meaning,\" he says.",
      "'Epic length'",
      "The relationships in the film might be intimate and personal, but they're set against a backdrop that is in so many ways epic - not least its running time. It clocks in at over three-and-a-half hours - something that might put off some moviegoers.",
      "But director Brady Corbet believes The Brutalist's length really shouldn't deter audiences.",
      "\"For me, I think that the length of a movie is similar to the length of a book, a double album, a painting with a big canvas.",
      "\"I love small portraits and I love Anselm Kiefer (a German artist known for his large-scale installations). There's a space for both of them, you know. And at the end of the day, especially because the film has an intermission, it's only 100 minutes on each side, so it's not so bad.\"",
      "Felicity Jones, who plays T\u00f3th's wife, Erzs\u00e9bet, says she spends a huge amount of time looking for realistic female characters who are more than just weak offshoots of their husbands.",
      "\"I spend most of my life foraging through scripts, trying to find decent characters to play. That's a huge part of it,\" she explains.",
      "\"I have to find someone who has some kind of spunk, or has some fight in them. Some sense of defiance is so key, so when I read the script it was an absolute no-brainer.",
      "\"I thought this woman is tremendous. But... they are few and far between, for sure. When you get something like this, you just grab it with both hands.\"",
      "In the film, T\u00f3th is hired by rich industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren to design and build a vast project as a tribute to his late mother. Van Buren, played by Guy Pearce, is a man who is in awe of the architect's talent. A useful parallel, then, for the actor.",
      "\"I suppose so,\" admits the Australian. \"I really admire Adrien and his work. I think he's an extraordinary actor.",
      "\"It was really interesting the way Adrien played his role. He plays a man who has almost more sense of self than Van Buren does, which was a great thing for me to work off because I think Van Buren, even though he admires L\u00e1szl\u00f3, he probably is patronising of him.",
      "\"He probably expects him to be more subservient than he is, so it was a great dynamic between the two of us.\"",
      "On Thursday, the film was nominated for 10 Oscars, including a best-actor nomination for Brody. Even before the Academy Awards shortlists were announced, Brody said how thankful he was for the reception the film had received from awards bodies.",
      "\"I'm just really grateful and I'm very appreciative of having had a chance to flourish in a work that I've dedicated a life towards. And when that is received with respect and appreciation. It's very rewarding.\"",

      "A cunning move and one that helped her achieve her aim of getting him banished, but perhaps she schemed too hard as Freddie chose to write her name on his card at the roundtable, casting doubts over her true identity.",
      "Sister vs sister",
      "There's nothing like a bit of family drama (remember Diane and Ross?) and when Armani and Maia revealed they were sisters, viewers knew they were in for a treat.",

      "The topless video of the 20-year-old sent the internet into a frenzy and of all the thirsty comments on social media, our favourite was a comparison to Peter Andre in the video for Mysterious Girl.",

      "Then, Charlotte lied to the others that Frankie had discovered she was actually a faithful - prompting uncomfortable smiles from Francesca.",
      "\"I feel like the way you're behaving today, you're already going to spin it another way,\" Charlotte said to Frankie. \"She's been so off with me already.\"",
      "Was anyone else watching through their fingers?",

      "After the final roundtable, which saw Charlotte banished, the four remaining contestants gathered by the fire pit for one last game.",
      "Little did they know they were all faithful.",
      "The other three proceeded to banish Alexander, then all voted to banish again.",
      "Earlier in the day, viewers saw Frankie plead with Leanne to trust her as a fellow mother, and it appeared as if Frankie had managed to assuage her fellow faithful's concerns.",
      "But doubts apparently started to creep in as they stood around the fire pit...",
      "\"Charlotte saying the words 'don't trust this woman' is such a bold thing to say,\" said Leanne.",
      "\"She was fighting to stay in the game,\" Frankie responded, but this wasn't enough to avoid the other two contestants' suspicions.",
      "Frankie was banished, and the rest was history.",
      "Leanne comes clean about her real job",
      "Though Leanne was a faithful, she did have one secret from her fellow contestants throughout the series - albeit not a very juicy one.",
      "The former soldier told the other players she was a nail technician and, at times, she had to pretend to be a bit more daunted by the challenges than she actually was...",
      "\"I think if I came in with the truth, I'd have a target on my back straight away,\" Leanne told viewers in the first episode.",
      "At the very end of the series - after Jake and Leanne found out they were walking home with the prize pot - Leanne decided to come clean.",
      "\"I'm not going back to the salon,\" Leanne told Jake. \"I've never touched a set of nails in my whole life. For the past 12 years, I've served as a soldier in the British Army.\""

      "Had the trial gone ahead, Prince Harry would have alleged he had been the victim of unlawful newsgathering by NGN journalists between 1996 and 2011 - and that its leaders covered up wrongdoing by destroying evidence - something that the company denied. But the eight-week trial didn't happen because the two sides suddenly settled.",
      "He's scored an apology for intrusion by The Sun, including NGN accepting that there was unlawful information gathering by private investigators working for the newspaper.",

      "The question is how far, realistically, can a campaign around historical events go? Is this week a reboot of investigations or, in fact, the final chapter?",
      "The main focus of pressure and lobbying will be the police - because campaigners believe Scotland Yard didn't go far enough in its previous investigations, missing opportunities to widen its focus beyond wrongdoing at The News of the World.",

      "The Met for its part says there is no active criminal investigation into alleged newspaper wrongdoing.",

      "So why no investigation?",
      "The police aren't ruling one out, but Sir Mark Rowley, the Met's commissioner, told LBC radio on Friday that they would need to see something \"radically new\".",
      "And that's because Scotland Yard takes the view that it carried out a huge investigation 10 years ago.",
      "Team Harry believe this is profoundly myopic. While some of their planned evidence for the NGN trial had come from the police, his lawyers also obtained new documents from NGN itself under rules for a fair trial.",

      "Net migration could fuel a rise in the UK population to 72.5 million by 2032, figures suggest.",
      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has projected a population growth of 7.3% between 2022 and 2032, compared with an increase of 6.1% over the previous 10 years.",
      "The number is almost entirely based on the net migration - the difference between those entering and leaving the country - of an estimated 4.9 million people over the 10-year period.",
      "Downing Street said it wanted to bring down the \"staggeringly high\" levels of migration, but ruled out an \"arbitrary\" cap.",
      "The number of births and deaths is expected to be roughly equal, while it is projected there will be an additional 1.7 million pensioners by 2032.",

      "The ONS's figures assume that, from 2028, net migration will average 340,000 extra people to the UK per year - up from previous projections of 315,000 - which is lower than current levels.",
      "Net migration into the UK hit a record 906,000 in the year to June 2023, and then fell to 728,000 in the year to June 2024.",

      "The Home Office said the figures were based on historic net migration numbers over a decade and that \"staggeringly high\" levels of migration had been seen in recent years.",
      "It had committed to reducing those numbers \"substantially\", it said, and would be setting out a \"comprehensive plan\" to \"restore order to our broken immigration system\".",
      "The prime minister's official spokesman also promised a plan to reduce migration, adding that Sir Keir Starmer had previously pointed out that a \"supposed cap\" in place before \"didn't have any meaningful impact on reducing immigration\".",

      "The natural change in population - number of births and deaths - is projected to be \"around zero\".",
      "This is because deaths are projected to rise due to a large number of people born in the post-World War Two period reaching older ages, the ONS says.",
      "The projections also highlight an increasingly ageing population, and suggest there could be fewer children due to lower fertility rates.",
      "By the middle of 2029, the number of deaths is projected to overtake births, meaning net migration will be the only source of population growth.",
      "This suggests that if there were no immigration nor a huge increase in babies being born, the population would be shrinking.",

      "Her comments come after days of speculation she will confirm government support for expanding Heathrow in a major speech on Wednesday - risking a rift with some Labour MPs who oppose the idea.",
      "On Sunday, Reeves told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that \"sustainable aviation and economic growth go hand in hand\" but said plans would be set out in due course.",
      "Speaking at a weekly meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, Reeves said: \"Kick starting economic growth is this Labour government's number one mission because I do not believe low growth is our destiny.",
      "\"Will that growth come easy? No. There are no easy routes out.",

      "However, Labour mayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan, who won a third term in 2024 on a platform of opposing airport expansion in the capital, has said his views \"haven't changed\" and suggested any plans would need mitigations for noise pollution and carbon emissions.",
      "On Monday, Miliband told MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee any future airport expansions \"will only be able to go ahead if it is consistent with our carbon budgets\".",
      "\"That is a legally binding framework,\" he added.",
      "Former shadow climate change secretary Barry Gardiner has signalled his objection to a third runway at Heathrow, warning it would undermine the government's progress toward net zero carbon emissions.",
      "He told the BBC: \"I think Rachel is wrong to pit decarbonising the economy against economic growth.",

      "Six years later, a third runway was once again given the green light by Theresa May's government.",

      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",

      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",
      "Expanding the airport would, in theory, provide an avenue for growth that simply isn't there at the moment.",
      "The construction project itself - the biggest privately-funded infrastructure scheme in Europe - would create thousands of jobs.",
      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

    "story": [
      "When Zara Mohammed became the first female leader of one of the largest representative bodies for British Muslims in 2021, she already had a lot on her plate: rising Islamophobia, the Covid-19 pandemic, and a government refusing to engage with the group.",
      "The then 29-year-old could not have imagined three years later, she would be facing one of the biggest challenges of her career - rioting across England and Northern Ireland, often explicitly targeting Muslims, and still no government contact.",
      "The violent unrest, triggered by false rumours that the Southport knife attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker, saw bricks hurled at mosques and Islamophobic chants on the streets.",
      "Many Muslims and people of colour felt afraid to leave their homes.",
      "\"It was so visceral. We were watching on our screens: people breaking doors down, stopping cars, attacking taxi drivers, smashing windows, smashing mosques,\" she told the BBC. \"The kind of evil we saw was really terrifying and I felt like, am I even making a difference?\"",
      "As Ms Mohammed ends her time as general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain \u2013 on Saturday, Wajid Akhter was elected as her replacement \u2013 she spoke to the BBC about the difficulties she has faced.",
      "She described an \"unbelievable tidal wave of Islamophobia\" in the UK, which she said was made more difficult to tackle due to the ongoing policy of government non-engagement.",
      "\"It was the Southport riots for us that made it really quite alarming. The justification was there, the urgency, the necessity of engagement was there, British Muslims were under attack, mosques were under attack and the largest umbrella Muslim organisation wasn't being talked to,\" she said.",
      "Strains in the relationship between successive governments and the MCB began over a decade ago. Ties were severed with the MCB in 2009 under then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, after the group's deputy leader signed a declaration advocating attacks on the Royal Navy if it tried to stop arms for Hamas. Hamas's military wing had been proscribed as a terror group in the UK eight years earlier.",
      "The deputy secretary later resigned and Ms Mohammed said the MCB made clear such actions did not reflect the organisation, leading to a brief period of re-engagement.",
      "However, under consecutive governments, that engagement was broken again. In 2018, when asked about Islamophobia in the Conservative Party, then Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the government did not engage with MCB as \"too many of their members have had favourable comments on extremists and that's not acceptable\" - claims the MCB vehemently denied at the time.",
      "For Ms Mohammed, there were hopes that engagement would be renewed when Labour entered government last year as she described \"strong\" and \"positive\" relationships with Labour MPs. However, the policy of non-engagement has continued without any explanation.",
      "She said this was having a \"terrible impact\" on communities who \"do not feel Islamophobia is being taken seriously\". \"At least have a conversation about it, but to not say anything and not tell us why? Surely what happened 14 years ago cannot be the justification.",
      "\"What is the issue now? We're not illegal, we're not proscribed. We do not harbour any extremist views. We have a broad-based demographic of British Muslims,\" she added.",
      "A spokesperson for the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) confirmed there had been no change to the policy of non-engagement with MCB but did not detail why.",
      "\"All forms of religious and racial hatred have absolutely no place in our society,\" the spokesperson said. \"The government engages regularly with faith communities to help foster strong working relationships and we are exploring a more integrated and cohesive approach to tackling racial and religious hatred, including Islamophobia.\"",
      "Various government departments engage with faith organisations to discuss relevant issues and policy, including on the Covid-19 pandemic and tackling hate crime.",
      "The rise in Islamophobia has personally affected Ms Mohammed, who faces frequent abuse online. She was also the victim of a hate incident on the London Underground by a man who used offensive language.",
      "\"I've definitely got more of a fear of my personal security than I've ever had before,\" she said. \"There's been an onslaught of far-right, thuggish, anti-Islam, quite disgusting, really awful graphic content that's posted on my account.\"",
      "National monitoring group Tell Mama UK recorded 4,971 incidents of anti-Muslim hate in the year after the Hamas attacks on Israel - the highest total in 14 years - with Muslim women particularly vulnerable.",
      "Challenged on whether the MCB had done enough to support communities, particularly without government engagement, Ms Mohammed said the organisation had done \"a lot of community building \" and \"political advocacy\" to address anti-Muslim hate, including interfaith projects, an Islamophobia event in Parliament and a Visit My Mosque initiative.",
      "However, she said this had not changed mainstream narratives around British Muslims. \"There has been such a normalisation of Islamophobic rhetoric without it being challenged or condemned.\"",
      "\"We could say we're making a difference but then what is being seen in national discourse does not seem to translate,\" she added.",
      "'Constantly firefighting'",
      "Ms Mohammed recognised this as part of a broader trend of hostility directed at Muslim politicians and leaders, drawing attention to former Conservative MP Lee Anderson saying \"Islamists\" had \"got control\" of the mayor of London.",
      "Sadiq Khan condemned the remarks as \"pouring fuel on the fire of anti-Muslim hatred\".",
      "As more Muslim professionals and politicians reached new heights, like Humza Yousaf becoming Scottish first minister and Sir Sadiq being knighted, they \"faced disgusting levels of Islamophobia which others have not ever faced\", said Ms Mohammed.",
      "A BBC Woman's Hour interview with Ms Mohammed was also accused of being \"strikingly hostile\" with more than 100 politicians, writers and other prominent figures criticising Ms Mohammed's \"mistreatment\" on the show. The BBC said it promised to \"reflect on\" the concerns raised following the interview.",
      "These ongoing challenges has left Ms Mohammed in two minds about her legacy.",
      "\"You're constantly firefighting. Did we make British Muslims' lives better? On one hand, yes, because we raised these issues, we took them to a national platform. But with Islamophobia, we're still having the same conversation.",

      "But Leadbeater said she understood the \"passion\" around the debate and vowed to \"continue to work as hard as I can to make sure that the genuine concerns that are there are considered\" as the bill went through Parliament.",
      "In November, MPs backed Leadbeater's bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales by 330 to 275 in a free vote - meaning MPs were allowed to vote with their conscience, rather than following party orders.",

      "\"We will take oral evidence from over 50 witnesses, which is highly, highly unusual for a private members bill,\" she said.",
      "This week, the first stages of line-by-line scrutiny of the bill sparked heated debate, with accusations of bias towards pro-assisted dying voices.",
      "But Leadbeater argued she had taken \"a really open approach\" to the bill, welcoming amendments.",
      "\"It is upsetting and disappointing sometimes to people who are suggesting otherwise - because we've got to get this right,\" she said.",
      "\"It is not just about passing the law, it's about passing good law that achieves what we are trying to achieve but does not create other problems and takes into account everybody's views.\"",
      "The bill's committee will begin its first oral evidence session on 28 January.",
      "There are still many months of parliamentary activity ahead, and the bill must pass votes in both the Commons and Lords before the proposed changes can become law."

    "published": "Sat, 25 Jan 2025 01:54:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Westminster's drinking culture is in the spotlight after a bar was closed over an alleged spiking incident.",
    "story": [
      "The closure of Strangers' bar, in the House of Commons, while an alleged spiking incident is investigated has thrown the spotlight on Westminster's drinking culture and what goes on in its many watering holes.",
      "You are certainly never far from a bar in the Palace of Westminster.",
      "For centuries, British politics has floated along on a tide of booze. Drink is part of the fabric of the place, but the drinking dens of Parliament are not what you might imagine.",
      "The bars reserved exclusively for MPs and peers \u2013 in the deeper recesses of the ancient building \u2013 such as the Pugin Room or the Members' Smoking Room (which is now non-smoking) may have the feel of a Mayfair gentlemen's club, all leather armchairs and hushed tones.",
      "But the most popular venue on the estate, The Woolsack, is more like a traditional British pub that you would find in any market square or High Street.",
      "Closing bars could risk MPs' safety, says minister",
      "Westminster drinking culture blamed for bad behaviour",
      "Parliament bar closed after alleged spiking incident",
      "Until 2018, it was called the Sports and Social Club but was rebranded and placed under new management after it gained a reputation for drunken brawls and other misdemeanours.",
      "Slightly shabby and old school, with its wood panelling, trophy cabinets and a carpet that has seen better days, it does a roaring trade with a younger, after-work crowd.",
      "This is where researchers, Parliamentary staff and the occasional MP come to talk shop and catch up with gossip.",
      "It is not easy to find, tucked away in a courtyard between loading bays with no sign outside, adding to the clubby sense of exclusivity that must be part of the attraction.",
      "It's open to passholders with a maximum of two guests and taking pictures or filming is strictly prohibited.",
      "The prices are attractive too. You can get a pint of House of Lords lager for \u00a34.30, for example, a pint of San Miguel for \u00a35.25 or a small glass of Sauvignon Blanc for \u00a35.60.",
      "This is pretty cheap for central London. Similar drinks at pubs within easy walking distance of Parliament, such as the Red Lion, the St Stephen's Tavern or the Marquis of Granby would set you back a bit more (according to our extensive research).",
      "The Parliamentary authorities insist drinks on the estate are not directly subsidised - and are \"benchmarked\" against prices in the outside world.",
      "But the Commons catering department, which oversees 27 bars, restaurants and cafes, as well as banqueting services, was subsidised by taxpayers in 2022/23 to the tune of \u00a36.4m, according to the annual accounts.",
      "Until it was closed, Strangers' bar also did a roaring trade, particularly in the summer months when it serves drinks to thirsty punters on the Commons terrace, enjoying spectacular views of the Thames.",
      "It is smaller and has a more upmarket feel than The Woolsack, but has also seen its share of bad behaviour over the years.",
      "When late night sittings were more common, it would be packed with increasingly inebriated MPs and party whips, trying to keep them in line.",
      "Journalists have traditionally headed to Strangers if they want to a catch a word with an MP.",
      "(The Westminster press pack have their own bar and caf\u00e9, Moncrieff's, named after the late, and legendary, Press Association reporter Chris Moncrieff, but few seem to use it.)",
      "Along the corridor from Strangers, you will find function rooms which are another hub of Westminster's social life, playing host to receptions and events most evenings where the (free) booze flows.",
      "Speaking on condition of anonymity, one member of the catering staff tells me that the excitement can sometimes go to guests' heads.",
      "\"I've never seen anyone throw up. I've seen four or five pass out,\" he says.",
      "The majority of MPs are polite and courteous to the staff, he says, but like most things at Westminster, when there is bad behaviour it tends to divide along party lines.",
      "\"The more pretentious Tory MPs will say 'do you know who I am?'. Labour ones are more like 'do you know how important I am?',\" he laughs.",
      "One thing he has noticed is that the new intake of MPs seem to be a less boozy crowd than their predecessors.",
      "Last July's general election saw an unprecedented clear out of MPs, and many of the 350 new MPs are younger, and more likely to have school age children.",
      "One of the new intake, Liberal Democrat Steff Aquarone, 40, thinks Westminster's bar culture is well past its sell by date.",
      "\"This one of the few remaining places where it's still possible to drink at lunchtime in the workplace. Most of the rest of the world of industry has moved on from that.\"",
      "The North Norfolk MP says this is \"problematic\" because \"it creates all sorts of circumstances where behaviours that are not only undesirable but in some cases wholly toxic end up becoming accepted as the price of socialising\".",
      "Commons leader Lucy Powell argued this week that it was safer for MPs and their staff to drink in Westminster's bars, where they are protected by security guards and codes of conduct, than in ordinary London pubs.",
      "Aquarone says he understands Powell's point but, he argues, some people in Parliament need to be protected from colleagues.",
      "\"If I wanted to go for a drink with my team, I could choose anywhere in London where no one would know who we were and no one would know that we were there and that's actually a far more secure way of having a safe night out.\"",
      "One new Labour MP said with many of the new intake in their 30s with young children, there may be some drinking on a Monday night when there's no vote until 10pm, but MPs are more aware that they shouldn't be drinking with staff.",
      "The terrace provided a good place to get to know new colleagues last summer and were bonding over booze, but the Labour MPs of old who had a pint at lunchtime are gone, they said.",
      "In fact, some new MPs are pushing for Parliament's bars to be closed at lunchtime, or even shut down altogether, as part of a modernisation programme.",
      "This would not go down well with ordinary Parliamentary staff or many of the 14,500 pass holders with access to the pubs and bars on the estate.",
      "\"Parliament is a unique place, it's like a village, why shouldn't we have a bar? It's the Houses of Parliament, not Ibiza,\" one woman, who has worked in Parliament for nearly three decades, tells me.",
      "She is enjoying an after work pint with a friend in the Lords Terrace bar, which has the slightly soulless feel of an airport lounge and tends to attract an older crowd.",
      "They both think the public have got the wrong idea about Westminster drinking \u2013 friends are always disappointed when they get to see what the bars are actually like, they say.",
      "\"It's just a place to relax and have a chat with your pals,\" says the woman, as she drains her pint and pulls on her coat.",
      "It's certainly hard to imagine life at Westminster without pubs and bars, but changing social attitudes are lapping at the gates of its historic drinking dens.",
      "Maybe one day they will call time.",

    "summary": "The chancellor raised taxes in the Budget - but now she wants to get rid of barriers to business. Why the change of focus?",
    "story": [
      "Rachel Reeves is suddenly in a rush.",
      "She'd hate the comparison, but the way she's been talking over recent weeks sounds more like a Conservative chancellor.",
      "She wants to get rid of barriers to business and make it harder for green groups to put the brakes on big development. She's easing off plans to make life more expensive for wealthy non-doms \u2013 and is expected to approve new airport runways and cut welfare.",
      "It doesn't sound much like Reeves' Budget in October, in which she raised whopping taxes, increased spending on public services and reminded us, time and time again, how much trouble the economy was in and how the Conservatives \u2013 she claimed \u2013 had left that fabled \u00a322bn black hole.",
      "So why the switch in focus?",
      "Treasury insiders say in private that almost as soon as she sat down after the Budget, she was banging the table with officials and pushing for more ideas to get the economy growing. After all, she and Sir Keir Starmer always said growth was their priority.",
      "The plan for her big speech next Wednesday \u2013 in which she is expected to unveil more changes to cut back planning rules and announce a new runway at London's Heathrow \u2013 was hatched back then, and she's only come under more pressure since to respond to the howls of business.",
      "One City source told me: \"Labour did a great job of pretending to be pro-business up until [the Budget]. No one would say they are now.\"",
      "Ouch!",
      "The metrics that measure how the government is doing in their touted top priority \u2013 making the UK more prosperous \u2013 are patchy at best, and bleak at worst. We had a wobble in the markets and warnings of a \"doom loop\" on the way.",

      "As one FTSE chief executive told me: \"There's been nervousness about this year, sentiment has definitely got worse, with a lack of a positive drum beat.\"",
      "There's also been \"argy bargy\" with the unions, one union leader told me, with \"robust conversations\" about the best way to get the economy going, and where to spend public money to support growth. \"The bottom line is that growth is anaemic \u2013 they need to massively invest,\" they say.",

      "Faisal Islam: Soaring UK borrowing costs are a problem for Rachel Reeves",
      "Inside Number 11, there's a suggestion that the jitters have been helpful, because it's restored a \"sense of urgency and put the focus back on the Treasury\".",
      "Sources say it's enabled Reeves to make the argument more strongly to her colleagues for things like another runway at Heathrow.",
      "Others also say Reeves' new push reflects that she and the rest of the Cabinet are no longer apprentices, and are settled into their roles.",
      "The need to \"move at speed is much clearer\", a senior source told me. Another said \"the market wobble brought that frustration to the fore \u2013 we talked about growth for a long time\u2026 I think its begun to put rocket boosters under that\".",
      "But didn't Starmer's tribe tell you and me hundreds of times in opposition that they were ready to hit the ground running? The evidence from their first months in government is that wasn't exactly true and that masterplan we were told existed wasn't real after all.",
      "A Whitehall source said \"they lost time because the preparing for government team wasn't really preparing for government - they had the opportunity to come in and show what they were made of and they fluffed it\", leading to a \"meandering approach\".",
      "Now, they say, \"this is a correction\", a response to business screaming at them and the arrival of \"the orange man in the White House\".",
      "Shifting gears isn't easy, a senior Labour MP said. \"The levers you pull don't just connect to something \u2013 the dead hand of the Treasury can't simply control economic growth.\"",
      "You'd be forgiven if this sudden rush of positivity and love for swashbuckling business feels a bit confusing.",
      "Broadly speaking, the government has taxed, spent and borrowed heavily, even though they say they want to concentrate on growing the economy.",
      "They say now they want to sweep away rules - but at the same time they are increasing regulation for employers to give workers more rights, on landlords, and even want to regulate football. And on green energy, plans for a national energy company are a huge state intervention.",
      "To help get growth going, ministers would point to planning changes, or their plan to woo big AI companies, even though none other than Sir Paul McCartney notes that's far from straightforward.",

      "In government, there's a belief that better news on wage growth and a tolerable level of inflation has been under-acknowledged. Tomorrow in our studio, and in her big speech on Wednesday, Reeves will try to give you the impression that she is brimming with optimism and in a hurry to get the economy going, so that jobs can be created, the government's tax coffers filled and, ultimately, voters might regain a long-lost feel-good factor.",

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to end so-called Nimby - Not in My Back Yard - challenges from those he says stand in the way of the country's growth. But just how disruptive have these challenges been in the East of England, and why have groups campaigned against the projects cited by the government?",
      "What has the government said?",
      "On Thursday, Sir Keir announced plans to block campaigners from making repeated legal challenges against decisions on major infrastructure projects in England and Wales.",
      "His reasoning was to prevent \"cynical\" and \"hopeless\" appeals blocking plans for things such as wind farms, nuclear stations and transport projects.",
      "As part of the announcement, Downing Street referenced Suffolk's Sizewell C nuclear power station, improvement plans for the A47 in Norfolk and wind farm infrastructure in the region that has been hit by campaigners' challenges.",

    "summary": "Years of delay and dispute have worn down support for what was once the government's flagship policy.",
    "story": [
      "After years of delay and dispute, the Scottish government has ripped up its plans for a National Care Service.",
      "The plans have gone from the flagship announcement of the parliamentary term and potentially a cornerstone of Nicola Sturgeon's legacy, to a non-statutory advisory board.",
      "Some \u00a330m was spent in the process, amid a series of consultations, legislative redrafts and political rows.",
      "But when the plans were first announced, there was widespread support for the principle of reforming social care. Many were in favour of the idea of ending a \"postcode lottery\" across different areas.",
      "So what happened to bring the National Care Service crashing to earth?",
      "Has it been scrapped?",
      "To be clear, yes.",
      "It might be a bit confusing, given the government says it remains committed to a National Care Service, and that the bill to set it up is still going through parliament.",
      "But care minister Maree Todd has agreed to remove part one of the bill - the part literally titled \"the National Care Service\".",
      "The vision originally set out by Nicola Sturgeon - of a game-changing network of care boards across the country, a mirror for the NHS - is completely gone.",
      "It had already been hugely diluted, stripped back to a national oversight board, amid concerns over costs and a lack of detail in the plans.",
      "All that's left now is a non-statutory advisory board, and widely-supported proposals to strengthen the rights of people living in care homes, known as \"Anne's law\".",
      "While it will no doubt do important work, the government has almost 300 advisory boards currently active - this is not the game-changing innovation of a National Care Service as it has ever been promised.",
      "Delivery problems",
      "The vision of a groundbreaking new care service began its slow-motion crash into harsh reality when the government started trying to construct a legal framework for it.",
      "The legislation laid before parliament was an \"enabling bill\", which set out the broad idea of a care service but left finer details to be filled in by ministers later.",
      "MSPs reacted with alarm, with almost every committee in the parliament questioning how they could properly scrutinise the plans when there was so little substance attached.",
      "The bill was held up repeatedly due to a lack of firm costings attached to the project, with members demanding that fresh financial memorandums be drawn up.",
      "Money quickly became a problem, and the budget for setting up the scheme - projected as \u00a32.2bn over ten years at one point - became an easy target when ministers needed to make cuts.",
      "That inevitably led to delays, with the target delivery date drifting from 2026 to 2029.",
      "And when the plans were stripped back, it made the legislative process even more complicated, requiring massive amendments to the bill already before parliament.",
      "It made it all the easier for people to call for the government to start over from scratch - or indeed to bin the plans and just channel the funding directly to frontline care instead.",
      "Industry concerns",
      "The government was keen to pursue a \"co-design\" process with those who would be closely involved in the running and use of a National Care Service.",
      "The sheer breadth of groups involved in caring underlines the difficulty of reform - there are councils, health boards, \"integrated joint boards\", health and social care partnerships, independent care providers, staff unions, and more.",
      "While there was support for the principle of improving care services in many quarters, some of these groups had concerns about the plans from the very outset - and others grew increasingly alienated as time went by.",
      "The original vision would have shifted responsibility for staffing and the delivery of care to the new care boards - which councils saw as undermining local control of services.",
      "The redrafted plans would have seen councils keep more of that control under a \"shared accountability\" model, but that too ultimately proved unpopular.",
      "The decision of council leaders to walk away from negotiations in September 2024 was really the moment which signalled the end of the road.",
      "It followed on the heels of unions which represent many carers - including Unison - coming out against the proposals.",
      "Without the support of those at the sharp end of actually delivering care, there was just no way that the NCS could become a reality.",
      "Political spats",
      "The collapse of the care service plans has spanned the reigns of three first ministers, each of whom insisted at some point that they were completely committed to delivering on them.",
      "Politics has undoubtedly played a part.",
      "But when it was first announced, there was not a wave of opposition to the idea of a care service at Holyrood.",
      "Indeed a few of the opposition parties remain in favour of the plans in principle - Labour in particular have just run on a manifesto promising to set one up at a UK level.",
      "But positions hardened as the policy process dragged on and concerns over the lack of detail in the bill mounted.",
      "The final straw came when the Greens withdrew their support in October 2024.",
      "That left the SNP completely isolated, with no clear way of building a coalition to get the bill passed.",
      "The government is actually quite keen to stress that there is no route through parliament for the bill, because it spreads the blame around other parties.",
      "But it is fair to reflect that political opposition has grown over time, in parallel with concerns about the proposals across a much wider base."

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 22:11:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Scientists say the fires that engulfed Los Angeles were made 35% more likely due to climate warming.",
    "story": [
      "Climate change was a major factor behind the hot, dry weather that gave rise to the devastating LA fires, a scientific study has confirmed.",
      "It made those weather conditions about 35% more likely, according to World Weather Attribution - globally recognised for their studies linking extreme weather to climate change.",
      "The authors noted that the LA wildfire season is getting longer while the rains that normally put out the blazes have reduced.",
      "The scientists highlight that these wildfires are highly complex with multiple factors playing a role, but they are confident that a warming climate is making LA more prone to intense fire events.",
      "\"Climate change increased the risk of the devastating LA wildfires,\" said Dr Clair Barnes, from Imperial College London, the study's lead author.",
      "\"Drought conditions are more frequently pushing into winter, increasing the chance a fire will break out during strong Santa Ana winds that can turn small ignitions into deadly infernos.\"",
      "The Santa Ana winds are strong and gusty east or north-easterly winds that blow from inland California towards the coast.",
      "What are Santa Ana winds and how are they fuelling LA wildfires?",
      "Around 30 people have died and more than 10,000 homes have been destroyed in the fast-spreading, destructive fires that broke out in early January.",
      "This new study looks at what are termed the fire-prone conditions that can lead to dangerous conflagrations.",
      "It's been carried out by a team of researchers from World Weather Attribution (WWA), a global group that publishes rapid analyses of climate-related weather events.",
      "They use climate models to simulate how the warming that has occurred since the middle of the 19th century is influencing heatwaves, droughts, floods and fires.",
      "The widespread burning of coal, oil and gas in the wake of the industrial revolution has driven billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere.",
      "Acting like a blanket, these gases have driven up temperatures by around 1.2C since then.",
      "By using climate models and statistical methods along with real world observations, the WWA group have been able to show how much of an influence climate warming has had on extreme events.",
      "In the case of the LA fires, they found that the hot, dry conditions that drove them are expected to occur once every 17 years.",
      "This is an increase in likelihood of around 35% compared to a world that hadn't experienced warming.",
      "\"We actually see that the models show very much the same results that the [real world] observations have,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, the head of World Weather Attribution.",
      "\"So there, in this combined index, we are quite confident about the result... we have actually a signal that we can say that we definitely can attribute that, also quantitatively.\"",
      "The researchers also examined other important variables that can lead to wildfire including the length of the fire season.",
      "By analysing weather observations, the scientists found that this has increased by around 23 days since the world began warming, around 1850.",
      "The team say that this means the dry conditions and the Santa Ana winds that are crucial for the spread of fires, are increasingly overlapping.",
      "Another key element is drought.",
      "Dry conditions in the LA area over the October to December period are now about 2.4 times more likely than before humans starting using fossil fuels on a large scale.",
      "The researchers are clear that climate change increased the probability of the hot, dry conditions that gave rise to the fires.",
      "However, the authors are more cautious about the link between rising temperatures and the longer fire season or decreased rainfall, saying that the models did not show a significant connection.",
      "Despite these reservations, the conclusion is that a warmer world increased the chances of the devastating wildfires occurring - as more fossil fuels continue to be burnt, those chances will continue to rise.",
      "\"Overall the paper finds that climate change has made the Los Angeles fires more likely despite some statistical uncertainty,\" said Prof Gabi Hegerl, from the University of Edinburgh, who was not part of the study team.",
      "\"This is a carefully researched result that should be taken seriously,\" she said in a statement.",
      "The new work builds on research that was published while the fires were still burning fiercely.",
      "That study linked the wildfires to what's termed \"climate whiplash.\"",
      "The idea is that very wet years are followed almost immediately by very dry ones, which increases the risk of fires.",
      "This is what happened in LA, when two wet winters were followed by an extremely dry autumn and winter this year \u2013 the wet weather promoted the growth of grass and shrubs that became the fuel for the fires that took off in the gusting Santa Ana winds."

      "DeepSeek, on the other hand, responded with just one idea - \"Luna and the Boy Who Chased the Stars\". Its response was 387 words (with no mention of anyone or thing called \"Luna\"), and comprised a story about a curious boy called Milo who lived on the moon.",
      "It struck me that while ChatGPT gave me ideas, DeepSeek wrote a full story. It wasn't particularly good, with a simple focus on a character going from A to B, but it was a start - and it was impressive how quickly it delivered it.",

      "How would the chatbots deal with explaining such a complex and nuanced piece of history? Pretty well.",

    "title": "Meta is ditching fact checkers for X-style community notes. Will they work?",
    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 01:14:24 GMT",
    "summary": "Many have questioned Meta's motivations for ditching fact checkers - but could it be a positive change?",
    "story": [
      "As flames tore through large parts of Los Angeles this month, so did fake news.",
      "Social media posts touted wild conspiracies about the fire, with users sharing misleading videos and misidentifying innocent people as looters.",
      "It brought into sharp focus a question that has plagued the social media age: what is the best way to contain and correct potentially incendiary sparks of misinformation?",
      "It is a debate that Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, has been at the centre of.",
      "Shortly after the January 6th Capitol riots in 2021, which were fuelled by false claims of a rigged US presidential election, Mr Zuckerberg gave testimony to Congress. The billionaire boasted about Meta's \"industry-leading fact checking program\".",
      "It drew, he pointed out, on 80 \"independent third-party fact checkers\" to curb misinformation on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Four years on, that system is no longer something to brag about.",
      "\"Fact checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created, especially in the US,\" Mr Zuckerberg said earlier in January.",
      "Taking their place, he said, would be something totally different: a system inspired by X's \"community notes\", where users rather than experts adjudicate on accuracy.",
      "Many experts and fact checkers questioned Mr Zuckerberg's motives.",
      "\"Mark Zuckerberg was clearly pandering to the incoming administration and to Elon Musk,\" Alexios Mantzarlis, the director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, told the BBC.",
      "Mr Mantzarlis is also deeply critical of the decision to axe fact checkers.",
      "But like many experts, he also makes another point that has perhaps been lost in the firestorm of criticism Meta faces: that, in principle, community-notes-style systems can be part of the solution to misinformation.",
      "Birdwatching",
      "Adopting a fact checking system inspired by an Elon-Musk-owned platform was always going to raise hackles. The world's richest man is regularly accused of using his X account to amplify misinformation and conspiracy theories.",
      "But the system predates his ownership.",
      "\"Birdwatch\", as it was then known, began in 2021 and drew inspiration from Wikipedia, which is written and edited by volunteers.",
      "Like Wikipedia, community notes rely on unpaid contributors to correct misinformation.",
      "Contributors rate corrective notes under false or misleading posts and, over time, some users earn the ability to write them.  According to the platform, this group of contributors is now almost a million strong.",
      "Mr Mantzarlis - who himself once ran a \"crowd-sourced\" fact checking project - argues this type of system potentially allows platforms to \"get more fact checks, more contributions, faster\".",
      "One of the key attractions of community-notes-style systems are their ability to scale: as a platform's userbase grows, so does the pool of volunteer contributors (if you can persuade them to participate).",
      "According to X, community notes produce hundreds of fact checks per day.",
      "By contrast, Facebook's expert fact checkers may manage less than 10 per day, suggests an article by Jonathan Stray of the UC Berkeley Center for Human-Compatible AI and journalist Eve Sneider.",
      "And one study suggests community notes can deliver good quality fact checks: an analysis of 205 notes about Covid found 98% were accurate.",
      "A note appended to a misleading post can also organically cut its viral spread by more than half, X maintains, and research suggests they also increase the chance that the original poster will delete the tweet by 80% .",
      "Keith Coleman, who oversees community notes for X, argues Meta is switching to a more capable fact checking programme.",
      "\"Community notes are already covering a vastly wider range of content than previous systems,\" he told me.",
      "\"That is rarely mentioned. I see stories that say 'Meta ends fact checking program',\" he said.",
      "\"But I think the real story is, 'Meta replaces existing fact checking program with approach that can scale to cover more content, respond faster and is trusted across the political spectrum'.\"",
      "Checking the fact checkers",
      "But of course, Mr Zuckerberg did not simply say community notes were a better system - he actively criticised fact checkers, accusing them of \"bias\".",
      "In doing so, he was echoing a long-held belief among US conservatives that Big Tech is censoring their views.",
      "Others argue fact checking will inevitably censor controversial views.",
      "Silkie Carlo, director of UK civil liberties group Big Brother Watch - which ran a campaign against alleged censorship of David Davis MP by YouTube - told the BBC allegations of Big Tech bias have come from across the political spectrum.",
      "Centralised fact checking by platforms risks \"stifling valuable reporting on controversial content\", she told the BBC, and also leads users to wrongly believe that all the posts they are reading are the \"vetted truth\".",
      "But Baybars Orsek, the managing director of Logically Facts, which supplies fact checking services to Meta in the UK, argues professional fact checkers can target the most dangerous misinformation and identify emerging \"harmful narratives\".",
      "Community-driven systems alone lack the \"consistency, objectivity and expertise\" to address the most harmful misinformation, he wrote.",
      "Professional fact checkers, and many experts and researchers, strongly dispute claims of bias. Some argue fact checkers simply lost the trust of many conservatives.",
      "A trust Mr Mantzarlis claims was deliberately undermined.",
      "\"Fact checkers started becoming arbiters of truth in a substantial way that upset politically-motivated partisans and people in power and suddenly, weaponised attacks were on them,\" he said.",
      "Trust in the algorithm",
      "The solution that X uses in an attempt to keep community notes trusted across the political spectrum is to take a key part of the process out of human hands, relying instead on an algorithm.",
      "The algorithm is used to select which notes are shown, and also to ensure they are found helpful by a range of users.",
      "In very simple terms, according to X, this \"bridging\" algorithm selects proposed notes that are rated helpful by volunteers who would normally disagree with each other.",
      "The result, it argues, is that notes are viewed positively across the political spectrum. This is confirmed, according to X, by regular internal testing. Some independent research also backs up that view.",
      "Meta says its community notes system will require agreement between people with a range of perspectives to help prevent biased ratings, \"just like they do on X\".",
      "But this wide acceptance is a high bar to reach.",
      "Research indicates that more than 90% of proposed community notes are never used.",
      "This means accurate notes may go unused.",
      "But according to X, showing more notes would undermine the aim of displaying only notes that will be found helpful by the most users and this would reduce trust in the system.",
      "'More bad stuff'",
      "Even after the fact checkers are gone, Meta will still employ thousands of moderators who remove millions of pieces of content every day, like graphic violence and child sexual exploitation material, which break the platform's rules.",
      "But Meta is relaxing its rules around some politically divisive topics such as gender and immigration.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg admitted the changes, designed to reduce the risk of censorship, meant it was \"going to catch less bad stuff\".",
      "This, some experts argue, was the most concerning aspect of Meta's announcement.",
      "The co-chair of Meta's Oversight Board told the BBC there were \"huge problems\" with what Mr Zuckerberg had done.",
      "So what happens from here?",
      "Details of Meta's new plans for tackling misinformation are scarce. In principle, some experts believe community notes systems could be helpful - but many also feel they should not be a replacement for fact checkers.",
      "Community notes are a \"fundamentally legitimate approach\", writes Professor Tom Stafford of Sheffield University, but platforms still need professional fact checkers too, he believes.",

    "story": [
      "Jimmy Donaldson - aka MrBeast - was jubilant as he told his tens of millions of TikTok followers about his bid to buy the platform.",
      "\"I might become you guys' new CEO! I'm super excited!\" Donaldson said from a private jet. He then proceeded to promise $10,000 to five random new followers.",
      "The internet creator's post has been viewed more than 73 million times since Monday. Donaldson said he could not share details about his bid, but promised: \"Just know, it's gonna be crazy.\"",
      "Donaldson is one of multiple suitors who have expressed interest in purchasing TikTok, the wildly popular social media platform that's become the subject of a fast-moving political drama in the United States.",
      "Last year, then-President Joe Biden signed a law that gave TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance until 19 January to sell the platform or face a ban in the United States.",
      "The legislation addressed concerns about TikTok's links to the Chinese government and worries about the app being a national security risk.",
      "President Donald Trump has floated the possibility of a joint venture.",
      "\"I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position,\" he said in a Truth Social post on Sunday. \"By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to [stay up].\"",
      "Trump has since signed an executive order that allows the app to stay operational for another 75 days.",
      "Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that China was considering a TikTok sale to Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a close ally of President Trump,  who already owns the social media platform X.",
      "Musk himself wrote on X this week that while he has long been against a TikTok ban, \"the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change\".",
      "At a news conference Tuesday, Trump was asked by a reporter if he would be open to Musk buying the platform.",
      "\"I would be if he wanted to buy it, yes,\" the president replied.",
      "\"I'd like Larry to buy it, too,\" Trump added, referring to Oracle chairman Larry Ellison, a long-time Trump supporter who was on stage with him for a separate announcement.",
      "Oracle is one of TikTok's main server providers, managing many of the data centres where billions of the platform's videos are stored.",
      "Last year, Oracle warned that a TikTok ban could hurt its business. The cloud computing giant was also a leading contender to buy the social media platform in 2020, back when Trump was trying to ban it.",
      "Billionaire investor Frank McCourt has also expressed interest in TikTok, and has been doing media interviews about the prospect for several months.",
      "McCourt has said he wants TikTok to run on technology overseen by the Project Liberty Institute, which he founded. He has been critical of data collection practices of social media companies.",
      "Project Liberty is bidding for TikTok without its proprietary algorithm. McCourt told CNBC this week that Project Liberty is \"not interested in the algorithm or the Chinese technology\" even as he acknowledged that the platform is \"worth less\" without it.",
      "Ultimately, President Trump is likely to have a major role in selecting a US buyer of TikTok.",
      "\"It's going to be a winner that's likely to be politically sympathetic to President Donald Trump,\" said Anupam Chander, a law professor at Georgetown University.",
      "Prof Chander said the 50-50 joint ownership model does not comport with the law's requirements, which might prompt Trump to pressure Congress into revising the law.",
      "For now, the platform's future remains in limbo.",
      "Prof Chander said the Biden administration made an \"unforced error\" by allowing the law to give the president outsized control over who owns TikTok.",
      "\"It was a terrible idea to put the future of a massive information platform into this political maelstrom,\" Prof Chander said."

      "However the platform relies heavily on community moderation, where unpaid individuals known as Redditors decide what is - and isn't - allowed to be published on their own corner of the website.",
      "In many instances, those Redditors have reached a different conclusion, deciding Mr Musk's actions were so offensive that they won't link to content from their subreddits on X, potentially reducing traffic, engagement and - ultimately - revenue.",
      "The biggest subreddits to have enforced the ban include basketball community r/NBA, which has 15 million members, female-focused community r/TwoXChromosomes, which has 14 million members, and American football community r/NFL, which has 12 million members.",
      "It is worth remembering that subreddits are almost always run by fans - it does not mean that the NFL or NBA organisations are taking a stance against Musk.",
      "The BBC has independently verified that at least 100 subreddits have banned X posts.",

    "summary": "Engineers are working on systems that can turn lunar regolith into useful elements like oxygen.",
    "story": [
      "Inside a giant sphere, the engineers pored over their equipment. Before them stood a silvery metal contraption swathed in colourful wires \u2013 a box that they hope will one day make oxygen on the moon.",
      "Once the team vacated the sphere, the experiment began. The box-like machine was now ingesting small quantities of a dusty regolith \u2013 a mixture of dust and sharp grit with a chemical composition mimicking real lunar soil.",
      "Soon, that regolith was gloop. A layer of it heated to temperatures above 1,650C. And, with the addition of some reactants, oxygen-containing molecules began to bubble out.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve tested everything we can on Earth now,\u201d says Brant White, a program manager at Sierra Space, a private company. \u201cThe next step is going to the moon.\u201d",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s experiment unfolded at Nasa\u2019s Johnson Space Center in the summer of 2024. It is far from the only such technology that researchers are working on, as they develop systems that could supply astronauts living on a future lunar base.",
      "Those astronauts will need oxygen to breathe but also to make rocket fuel for spacecraft that might launch from the moon and head to destinations further afield \u2013 including Mars.",
      "Lunar base inhabitants might also require metal and they could even harvest this from the dusty grey debris that litters the lunar surface.",
      "Much depends on whether we can build reactors able to extract such resources effectively or not.",
      "\u201cIt could save billions of dollars from mission costs,\u201d says Mr White as he explains that the alternative \u2013 bringing lots of oxygen and spare metal to the moon from Earth \u2013 would be arduous and expensive.",
      "Luckily, the lunar regolith is full of metal oxides. But while the science of extracting oxygen from metal oxides, for example, is well understood on Earth, doing this on the moon is much harder. Not least because of the conditions.",
      "The huge spherical chamber that hosted Sierra Space\u2019s tests in July and August this year induced a vacuum and also simulated lunar temperatures and pressures.",
      "The company says it has had to improve how the machine works over time so that it can better cope with the extremely jagged, abrasive texture of the regolith itself. \u201cIt gets everywhere, wears out all sorts of mechanisms,\u201d says Mr White.",
      "And the one, crucial, thing that you can\u2019t test on Earth or even in orbit around our planet, is lunar gravity \u2013 which is roughly one sixth that of the Earth. It might not be until 2028 or later that Sierra Space can test its system on the moon, using real regolith in low gravity conditions.",
      "The moon\u2019s gravity could be a real problem for some oxygen-extracting technologies unless engineers design for it, says Paul Burke at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "In April, he and colleagues published a paper detailing the results of computer simulations that showed how a different oxygen-extracting process might be hindered by the moon\u2019s relatively feeble gravitational pull. The process under investigation here was molten regolith electrolysis, which involves using electricity to split lunar minerals containing oxygen, in order to extract the oxygen directly.",
      "The problem is that such technology works by forming bubbles of oxygen on the surface of electrodes deep within the molten regolith itself. \u201cIt is the consistency of, say, honey. It is very, very viscous,\u201d says Dr Burke.",
      "\u201cThose bubbles aren\u2019t going to rise as fast \u2013 and may actually be delayed from detaching from the electrodes.\u201d",
      "There could be ways around this. One could be to vibrate the oxygen-making machine device, which might jiggle the bubbles free.",
      "And extra-smooth electrodes might make it easier for the oxygen bubbles to detach. Dr Burke and his colleagues are now working on ideas like this.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s technology, a carbothermal process, is different. In their case, when oxygen-containing bubbles form in the regolith, they do so freely, rather than on the surface of an electrode. It means there is less chance of them getting stuck, says Mr White.",
      "Stressing the value of oxygen for future lunar expeditions, Dr Burke estimates that, per day, an astronaut would require the amount of oxygen contained in roughly two or three kilograms of regolith, depending on that astronaut\u2019s fitness and activity levels.",
      "However, a lunar base\u2019s life support systems would likely recycle oxygen breathed out by astronauts. If so, it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to process quite as much regolith just to keep the lunar residents alive.",
      "The real use case for oxygen-extracting technologies, adds Dr Burke, is in providing the oxidiser for rocket fuels, which could enable ambitious space exploration.",
      "Obviously the more resources that can be made on the moon the better.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s system does require the addition of some carbon, though the firm says it can recycle most of this after each oxygen-producing cycle.",
      "Along with colleagues, Palak Patel, a PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, came up with an experimental molten regolith electrolysis system, for extracting oxygen and metal from the lunar soil.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really looking at it from the standpoint of, \u2018Let\u2019s try to minimise the number of resupply missions\u2019,\u201d she says.",
      "When designing their system, Ms Patel and her colleagues addressed the problem described by Dr Burke: that low gravity could impede the detachment of oxygen bubbles that form on electrodes. To counter this, they used a \u201csonicator\u201d, which blasts the bubbles with sound waves in order to dislodge them.",
      "Ms Patel says that future resource-extracting machines on the moon could derive iron, titanium or lithium from regolith, for example. These materials might help lunar-dwelling astronauts make 3D-printed spare parts for their moon base or replacement components for damaged spacecraft.",
      "The usefulness of lunar regolith does not stop there. Ms Patel notes that, in separate experiments, she has melted simulated regolith into a tough, dark, glass-like material.",

      "It was first released by Mr Stenberg in 1996 and is now used by millions ever day.",
      "It's important that someone is able to maintain curl when he steps away.",
      "\u201cI just want to make sure that everything is there so the day I go away, someone can take over,\u201d Mr Stenberg says.",
      "It\u2019s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system \u2013 and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free.",
      "The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today\u2019s technology landscape.",
      "In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master\u2019s thesis. \u201cMy concern was graduating,\u201d he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project.",
      "Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark.",
      "\u201cWe're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,\u201d he says.",
      "While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That\u2019s not just because they\u2019ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.",
      "But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.",
      "Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work afterall.",
      "Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the \u201ckernel maintainers are aging\u201d.",
      "Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK\u2019s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades.",
      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",
      "This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it\u2019s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to help STEM talent flight,\u201d Miss Brock adds. \u201cBecause people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they\u2019re in.\u201d",

      "The market hit came as investors rapidly adjusted bets on AI, after DeepSeek's claim that its model was made at a fraction of the cost of those of its rivals.",
      "Analysts said the development raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning.",
      "US President Donald Trump described the moment as \"a wake-up call\" for the US tech industry, while also suggesting that it could ultimately prove \" a positive\" for the US.",
      "\"If you could do it cheaper, if you could do it [for] less [and] get to the same end result. I think that's a good thing for us,\" he told reporters on board Air Force One.",
      "He also said he was not concerned about the breakthrough, adding the US will remain a dominant player in the field.",
      "Optimism about AI investments has powered much of the boom in US stock markets over the last two years, raising fears of a possible bubble.",
      "DeepSeek has become the most downloaded free app in the US just a week after it was launched.",
      "Its emergence comes as the US has been warning of a tech race with China, and taking steps to restrict the sale of the advanced chip technology that powers AI to China.",
      "To continue their work without steady supplies of imported advanced chips, Chinese AI developers have shared their work with each other and experimented with new approaches to the technology.",
      "This has resulted in AI models that require far less computing power than before.",
      "It also means that they cost a lot less than previously thought possible, which has the potential to upend the industry.",
      "Nvidia - the company behind the advanced chips that dominate many AI investments, that had seen its share price surge in the last two years due to growing demand - was the hardest hit on Monday.",
      "Its share price dropped by roughly 17% on Monday, wiping almost $600bn (\u00a3482bn) off its market value.",
      "Janet Mui, head of market analysis at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said investors' first response to something that appears groundbreaking is to sell because of the uncertainty.",

      "DeepSeek's technology has been praised by high profile figures including OpenAI chief Sam Altman who called it \"an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price\", though he added that OpenAI would \"obviously deliver much better models\" moving forward.",

      "Ion Stoica, co-founder and executive chair of AI software company Databricks, told the BBC the lower cost of DeepSeek could spur more companies to adopt AI in their business.",
      "\"If that happens, this reduction in cost can accelerate the progress of AI,\" he said. \"So overall, the market will expand faster, and the value of the market will grow faster.\"",

    "story": [
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni says she has been placed under judicial investigation over Italy's surprise release of a Libyan citizen who had been wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court (ICC).",
      "In a video message shared on social media on Tuesday, Meloni said she was suspected by prosecutors of embezzlement and aiding and abetting a crime.",
      "Osama Najim - also known as Almasri - is the head of Libya's judicial police and the director of an infamous detention centre in Mitiga, near Tripoli.",
      "Mr Najim was arrested in Italy on 21 January and unexpectedly freed days later \"due to a legal technicality\", the interior ministry said.",
      "The ICC, which said it had not been consulted, swiftly issued another arrest warrant for Mr Najim and demanded an explanation from the Italian authorities.",
      "In the video, Meloni said the Rome appeals court released Mr Najim because the ICC warrant had not been sent to the Italian justice ministry.",
      "\"At that point, so as not to let him go free on Italian territory, we decided to expel him and repatriate him immediately, with a special flight,\" Meloni said.",
      "Last week, Justice Minister Carlo Nordio said that Mr Najim had been expelled because of the \"danger\" he posed \u2013 a comment which was derided by the opposition.",
      "The decision to free Mr Najim was heavily criticised by the opposition and NGOs such as Amnesty International, which said Mr Najim was guilty of \"horrific violations committed with total impunity\".",
      "Videos that showed a jubilant crowd welcoming Mr Najim as he stepped off an Italian government plane in Tripoli caused particular uproar.",
      "Meloni said that Nordio, Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi and the cabinet undersecretary for intelligence matters, Alfredo Mantovano, had also been placed under investigation. Being placed under investigation in Italy does not mean that formal charges will necessarily follow.",
      "In a defiant tone, the Italian PM appeared to hint at political motives for the investigation.",
      "She pointed out the lawyer who filed the complaint, Luigi Li Gotti, was a former left-wing politician, while the prosecutor leading the case, Francesco Lo Voi, recently investigated Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini on an unrelated matter.",
      "Meloni ended the video saying that she could not be \"blackmailed or intimidated\".",
      "\"This may be why I'm unpopular among those who don't want Italy to change and improve,\" she said. \"But that's precisely the reason I intend to continue on my way, protecting Italians, especially when the nation's safety is at stake, head held high with no fear.\"",
      "Matteo Renzi of the opposition party Italy Alive (IV) - who was among the first to denounce Mr Najim's release - said he felt Meloni was \"exploiting\" the investigation to \"feed her usual victim complex\".",
      "Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the far-right, anti-migrant Brothers of Italy party, has headed Italy's ruling right-wing coalition since 2022.",
      "She has repeatedly vowed to crack down on immigration and has pledged to stop boats heading to Italy from North Africa, vowing to put an end to illegal departures and human trafficking.",

      "\"Because the world is already perilously close to the precipice, a move of even a single second should be taken as an indication of extreme danger and an unmistakable warning that every second of delay in reversing course increases the probability of global disaster.\"",
      "It warned that the continuing war in Ukraine - now nearing a three-year mark since Russia's full-scale invasion - \"could become nuclear at any moment because of a rash decision or through accident or miscalculation\".",
      "\"Conflict in the Middle East threatens to spiral out of control into a wider war without warning,\" the statement said.",
      "The panel of scientists also said that \"the long-term prognosis for the world's attempts to deal with climate change remains poor, as most governments fail to enact the financing and policy initiatives necessary to halt global warming.\"",
      "In the biological arena, the BAS continued, \"emerging and re-emerging diseases continue to threaten the economy, society and security of the world\".",
      "It also warned that \"an array of other disruptive technologies advanced last year in ways that make the world more dangerous\".",
      "\"Systems that incorporate artificial intelligence in military targeting have been used in Ukraine and the Middle East, and several countries are moving to integrate artificial intelligence into their militaries.\"",
      "The organisation stressed that all these dangers \"are greatly exacerbated by a potent threat multiplier: the spread of misinformation, disinformation and conspiracy theories that degrade the communication ecosystem and increasingly blur the line between truth and falsehood\".",
      "The US, China and Russia, the BAS said, \"have the collective power to destroy civilisation\", adding that the three nations \"have the prime responsibility to pull the world back from the brink\"."

    "title": "Abramovich dodged millions in tax with superyachts-for-hire scheme",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 06:00:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Shell companies were used to charter the sanctioned oligarch\u2019s yachts to himself, evading VAT, BBC reveals.",
    "story": [
      "It was Christmas 2011, a year after Roman Abramovich had taken delivery of his new superyacht, Eclipse. But it seemed the oligarch would not be using it over the festive period - records show it had been chartered by a company based in the British Virgin Islands.",
      "And yet photographs from Christmas Day that year show Mr Abramovich in the Caribbean sunshine, standing on the swim platform at the rear of the yacht, with Eclipse's large letter-E logo behind him.",
      "Charter records such as this were part of a decade-long scheme to mislead tax authorities, now uncovered in an investigation by the BBC and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.",
      "The scheme falsely presented the Russian oligarch's fleet of yachts as a commercial leasing operation, to dodge millions of euros in VAT on their purchase and running costs.",
      "\"There has been tax evasion,\" Italian tax lawyer and professor Tommaso Di Tanno told the BBC. \"This is criminal.\"",
      "In a statement, lawyers for Mr Abramovich - who now reportedly divides his time between Istanbul, Tel Aviv and the Russian resort of Sochi - said he had \"always obtained independent expert professional tax and legal advice\" and \"acted in accordance\" with it.",
      "The billionaire, who was sanctioned by the UK in March 2022 over his connection to Vladimir Putin's regime, bought five luxury yachts over the course of the 2000s that were involved in the tax scheme.",
      "Among them was the 115m (377ft) Pelorus, which he reportedly lent to Chelsea footballer John Terry for his honeymoon in 2007 - and Eclipse, which at 162.5m (533ft) was once the largest private yacht in the world and worth an estimated $700m (\u00a3559m).",
      "The scheme to dodge tax on the yachts - and other secrets of the sanctioned oligarch's corporate empire - is laid bare in over 400,000 files and 72,000 emails leaked from a Cypriot corporate service provider, MeritServus.",
      "They show how MeritServus administered the oligarch's businesses through a global network of companies owned by a series of trusts of which Mr Abramovich was the beneficiary.",
      "The BBC and its media partners, including the Guardian, have been reporting on the leaked files since 2023 as part of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' Cyprus Confidential investigation. We previously revealed Mr Abramovich's financial links to one of Mr Putin's closest associates, accused of holding the president's wealth.",
      "The files reveal how Mr Abramovich's advisers helped him avoid paying huge tax bills on the yachts' running costs in EU waters by using companies to hire them out to himself or other companies he controlled.",
      "Documents show how the five yachts were leased to a company in Cyprus called Blue Ocean Yacht Management, which chartered them on to a handful of companies in the British Virgin Islands that appeared independent - but which were all in fact controlled by Mr Abramovich.",
      "'Aware of the risks'",
      "The scheme to dodge VAT in Cyprus was set out in a revealing 2005 memorandum on the proposed \"Operating Structure\" for the management of Mr Abramovich's yachts.",
      "\"We want to avoid paying VAT on the purchase price of the yachts and where possible to avoid paying VAT on goods and services provided to the yachts,\" wrote the memo's author, Jonathan Holloway, then a director of Blue Ocean.",
      "Although Blue Ocean and the companies hiring the yachts were all owned by Mr Abramovich's trusts, they were intended to appear unconnected \"so that an investigator checking on our operation would see it as a legitimate structure\", Mr Holloway wrote in the memo he sent to some of Mr Abramovich's closest associates.",
      "Mr Holloway warned them they should be \"aware of the risks\". He wrote: \"We all have to recognise that a determined investigator could eventually discover this is an in-house structure with the possible consequences that would entail.\"",
      "Mr Holloway wrote that Blue Ocean, the companies to which it leased the yachts, and the ultimate \"customer\" should not have the same shareholders, directors or registered addresses, to avoid any \"common link\" that might arouse suspicion.",
      "As the memo noted, Mr Abramovich's lawyer had agreed to put the ownership of Blue Ocean into an entirely separate trust - apparently distancing it from the other companies.",
      "Sure enough, ownership of the yacht management company Blue Ocean was subsequently transferred from the oligarch's main trust to a new one, the Neptune Trust.",
      "'Hide the reality'",
      "The way Mr Abramovich's companies leased the yachts to each other, Prof Di Tanno told the BBC, was an \"artificial structure\" that evaded tax - a criminal offence.",
      "\"My conclusion is that in the case, there has been a tax evasion\u2026 because all the parties know exactly what to do in order to hide the reality,\" he said.",
      "Tax expert Rita de la Feria told the BBC she had seen in the yacht scheme \"indications\" that they \"may be misrepresenting information\".",
      "\"If that is the case, then we are now in the realm of evasion,\" she added.",
      "Mr Holloway, who stepped down as a director of Blue Ocean about 15 years ago, told the BBC that he \"joined Blue Ocean 20 years ago and was there for a relatively short period of time\".",
      "He said he had \"managed literally hundreds of vessels from many different locations around the world\". \"I can't be expected to remember the individual circumstances of every vessel I have ever managed,\" he said, adding that he \"used structures others in the industry were using\".",
      "Lawyers representing Mr Abramovich told the BBC he denied \"any allegation that he had any knowledge\" or was \"personally responsible\" or liable for \"any alleged deception of any government authority\" to evade tax.",
      "His lawyers said that just as Mr Abramovich sought professional legal and tax advice and acted on it, he expects that \"similar advice was sought at the relevant times by those with responsibility for the day-to-day running\" of the companies involved in the scheme.",
      "If this were a real superyacht leasing business, substantial profits might be expected. However Blue Ocean's accounts show that from 2005 to 2012, its expenses almost matched its income.",
      "This meant almost no corporation tax was due as the company's profits were tiny.",
      "A note from the Blue Ocean director suggests the close matching of expenses and income was no accident and the company would generate charters when the scheme needed to cover expenses.",
      "\"At the beginning of each week we will have a meeting in Blue Ocean where we will look at our current bank balances and our cash needs for the next 1~2 weeks [sic]. If we see a need for a cash injection we will raise an appropriate time charter and invoices,\" he wrote.",
      "There is also evidence in the leaked files that charter agreements were backdated. This includes a time charter agreement supposedly signed in July 2005 by Blue Ocean and another Abramovich company in the BVI called Eyke Services. However, records show Eyke Services did not exist at that point - it was not incorporated until a month later.",
      "In another case, a director of Blue Ocean requested the production of a backdated and signed time charter in order to obtain delivery of duty-free fuel for Mr Abramovich's 86m (282ft) yacht Ecstasea - which could accommodate 15 guests in eight suites - saving the billionaire $44,000 (\u00a335,000) in tax.",
      "In the documents, tax consultants from Deloitte in Cyprus wrote to Mr Holloway, the Blue Ocean director, saying if the ships were pleasure vessels, they would have to pay VAT. But if the vessels were classified as commercial, they would not.",
      "A leading superyacht lawyer Benjamin Maltby told the BBC the type of contracts used for many of Mr Abramovich's luxury yacht charters were actually designed for commercial ships carrying dry cargos such as grain or steel.",
      "This gives us more evidence that the whole commercial \"look\" of the operation was a sham.",
      "'Lawyers got onto it'",
      "Mr Abramovich's superyacht scheme came under legal scrutiny twice, with varying levels of success, the BBC and Bureau of Investigative Journalism has learned.",
      "Richard Bridge captained two of Mr Abramovich's yachts for almost six years from 2006 to 2012, including the Pelorus, and the giant Eclipse, the pride of Abramovich's fleet. A couple of years after he finished working for Mr Abramovich, the captain was stopped and questioned at Amsterdam's Schipol Airport.",
      "Italian prosecutors had started proceedings against three of Mr Abramovich's captains - including Mr Bridge - for unpaid excise duties on refuelling and tax evasion.",
      "But Mr Bridge told the BBC he had contacted Blue Ocean and \"their lawyers got onto it\", telling him a few months later the case had been dropped.",
      "Italian court records seen by the BBC show proceedings were halted after the lawyers \"produced documentation\" proving Pelorus was \"entered in the registers as a commercial boat as it is used for commercial purposes or for hire\".",
      "Mr Bridge said he was unaware Mr Abramovich also controlled the companies that were chartering the yachts.",
      "In Cyprus, tax officials were separately investigating Blue Ocean over up to \u20ac17m (\u00a314.3m) in unpaid VAT, disputing the company's claim to be \"zero-rated\" for VAT because it was a commercial operation.",
      "Blue Ocean's lawyers said demands to provide evidence the vessels had been used commercially by the companies chartering them were \"unreasonable and oppressive\", but they had asked its clients anyway and received no response.",
      "We now know that Blue Ocean's clients were, of course, Mr Abramovich's other companies.",
      "According to an appeal judgement in 2018, VAT investigators found Blue Ocean had failed to present any evidence the companies chartering the yachts were \"engaged in economic activity\" and its claim that the boats were used for commercial purposes was rejected.",
      "In the end, Cyprus pursued Blue Ocean for the lower figure of \u20ac14m (\u00a311.8m).",
      "We do not know if the sum was paid - the company failed to attend its own appeal in March 2024 and was dissolved four months later.",

    "story": [
      "Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic has resigned, following nationwide protests over the deadly collapse of a railway station canopy.",
      "He said he had acted \"to avoid further complicating things\" and so as to \"not further raise tensions in society\".",
      "Fifteen people died in November when a concrete canopy at a railway station collapsed in the city of Novi Sad. Tens of thousands of people have been regularly taking to the streets since then, demanding accountability for the collapse and protesting against corruption.",
      "In a TV address late on Tuesday, President Aleksandar Vucic said he would decide within the next 10 days on whether to hold parliamentary elections or form a new government.",
      "More than a dozen people have been charged in connection with the Novi Sad incident, including former Transport Minister Goran Vesic - who resigned days after it happened.",
      "Students have taken the lead with the protests, halting traffic daily and blockading universities for months.",
      "Last Friday, many Serbians stayed off work in response to a call for a general strike, while in December an estimated 100,000 people attended a demonstration in Belgrade. Many smaller protests have been held in towns and cities across the country.",
      "Tensions rose on Monday when, during a 24-hour blockade of the busiest road junction in the capital, Belgrade, a female student was injured in clashes between the opposition and supporters of the governing party.",
      "That evening, President Vucic said he would pardon students and university tutors who faced charges in connection with the protests and announced a major government reshuffle, saying he expected more than half of ministers to be replaced.",
      "In his Tuesday's address after an emergency meeting with the government, the president said he would sign pardons for 13 people on Wednesday.",
      "He insisted that he and the government had now met student protesters' demands for transparency about the reconstruction of Novi Sad railway station.",
      "Opposition parties have been calling for a transitional government which they say could create the conditions for free and fair elections. But Vucic rejected those demands, saying Serbians \"want normal people in power, not politicians who have no trust\".",

      "When ChatGPT stormed the world of artificial intelligence (AI), an inevitable question followed: did it spell trouble for China, America's biggest tech rival?",
      "Two years on, a new AI model from China has flipped that question: can the US stop Chinese innovation?",
      "For a while, Beijing seemed to fumble with its answer to ChatGPT, which is not available in China.",
      "Unimpressed users mocked Ernie, the chatbot by search engine giant Baidu. Then came versions by tech firms Tencent and ByteDance, which were dismissed as followers of ChatGPT - but not as good.",
      "Washington was confident that it was ahead and wanted to keep it that way. So the Biden administration ramped up restrictions banning the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "That's why DeepSeek's launch has astonished Silicon Valley and the world. The firm says its powerful model is far cheaper than the billions US firms have spent on AI.",
      "So how did a little-known company - whose founder is being hailed on Chinese social media as an \"AI hero\" - pull this off?",
      "DeepSeek: the Chinese AI app that has the world talking",
      "China's DeepSeek AI shakes industry and dents America's swagger",
      "Watch DeepSeek AI bot respond to question about China",
      "The challenge",
      "When the US barred the world's leading chip-makers such as Nvidia from selling advanced tech to China, it was certainly a blow.",
      "Those chips are essential for building powerful AI models that can perform a range of human tasks, from answering basic queries to solving complex maths problems.",
      "DeepSeek's founder Liang Wenfeng described the chip ban as their \"main challenge\" in interviews with local media.",
      "Long before the ban, DeepSeek acquired a \"substantial stockpile\" of Nvidia A100 chips - estimates range from 10,000 to 50,000 - according to the MIT Technology Review.",
      "Leading AI models in the West use an estimated 16,000 specialised chips. But DeepSeek says it trained its AI model using 2,000 such chips, and thousands of lower-grade chips - which is what makes its product cheaper.",
      "Some, including US tech billionaire Elon Musk, have questioned this claim, arguing the company cannot reveal how many advanced chips it really used given the restrictions.",
      "But experts say Washington's ban brought both challenges and opportunities to the Chinese AI industry.",
      "It has \"forced Chinese companies like DeepSeek to innovate\" so they can do more with less, says Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "\"While these restrictions pose challenges, they have also spurred creativity and resilience, aligning with China's broader policy goals of achieving technological independence.\"",
      "The world's second-largest economy has invested heavily in big tech - from the batteries that power electric vehicles and solar panels, to AI.",
      "Turning China into a tech superpower has long been President Xi Jinping's ambition, so Washington's restrictions were also a challenge that Beijing took on.",
      "The release of DeepSeek's new model on 20 January, when Donald Trump was sworn in as US president, was deliberate, according to Gregory C Allen, an AI expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "\"The timing and the way it's being messaged - that's exactly what the Chinese government wants everybody to think - that export controls don't work and that America is not the global leader in AI,\" says Mr Allen, former director of strategy and policy at the US Department of Defense Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.",
      "In recent years the Chinese government has nurtured AI talent, offering scholarships and research grants, and encouraging partnerships between universities and industry.",
      "The National Engineering Laboratory for Deep Learning and other state-backed initiatives have helped train thousands of AI specialists, according to Ms Zhang.",
      "And China had plenty of bright engineers to recruit.",
      "Is China's AI tool DeepSeek as good as it seems?",
      "BBC's AI correspondent explains why DeepSeek has caused shockwaves",
      "The talent",
      "Take DeepSeek's team for instance - Chinese media says it comprises fewer than 140 people, most of whom are what the internet has proudly declared as \"home-grown talent\" from elite Chinese universities.",
      "Western observers missed the emergence of \"a new generation of entrepreneurs who prioritise foundational research and long-term technological advancement over quick profits\", Ms Zhang says.",
      "China's top universities are creating a \"rapidly growing AI talent pool\" where even managers are often under the age of 35.",
      "\"Having grown up during China's rapid technological ascent, they are deeply motivated by a drive for self-reliance in innovation,\" she adds.",
      "Deepseek's founder Liang Wenfeng is an example of this - the 40-year-old studied AI at the prestigious Zhejiang University. In an article on the tech outlet 36Kr, people familiar with him say he is \"more like a geek rather than a boss\".",
      "And Chinese media describe him as a \"technical idealist\" - he insists on keeping DeepSeek as an open-source platform. In fact experts also believe a thriving open-source culture has allowed young start-ups to pool resources and advance faster.",
      "Unlike bigger Chinese tech firms, DeepSeek prioritised research, which has allowed for more experimenting, according to experts and people who worked at the company.",
      "\"The Top 50 talents in this field might not be in China, but we can build people like that here,\" Mr Liang said in an interview with 36Kr.",
      "But experts wonder how much further DeepSeek can go. Ms Zhang says that \"new US restrictions may limit access to American user data, potentially impacting how Chinese models like DeepSeek can go global\".",
      "And others say the US still has a huge advantage, such as, in Mr Allen's words,  \"their enormous quantity of computing resources\" - and it's also unclear how DeepSeek will continue using advanced chips to keep improving the model.",
      "But for now, DeepSeek is enjoying its moment in the sun, given that most people in China had never heard of it until this weekend.",
      "The new AI heroes",
      "His sudden fame has seen Mr Liang become a sensation on China's social media, where he is being applauded as one of the \"three AI heroes\" from southern Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong.",
      "The other two are Zhilin Yang, a leading expert at Tsinghua University, and Kaiming He, who teaches at MIT in the US.",
      "DeepSeek has delighted the Chinese internet ahead of Lunar New Year, the country's biggest holiday. It's good news for a beleaguered economy and a tech industry that is bracing for further tariffs and the possible sale of TikTok's US business.",
      "\"DeepSeek shows us that only if you have the real deal will you stand the test of time,\" a top-liked Weibo comment reads.",
      "\"This is the best new year gift. Wish our motherland prosperous and strong,\" another reads.",
      "A \"blend of shock and excitement, particularly within the open-source community,\" is how  Wei Sun, principal AI analyst at Counterpoint Research, described the reaction in China.",
      "Fiona Zhou, a tech worker in the southern city of Shenzhen, says her social media feed \"was suddenly flooded with DeepSeek-related posts yesterday\".",
      "\"People call it 'the glory of made-in-China', and say it shocked Silicon Valley, so I downloaded it to see how good it is.\"",
      "She asked it for \"four pillars of [her] destiny\", or ba-zi - like a personalised horoscope that is based on the date and time of birth.",
      "But to her disappointment, DeepSeek was wrong. While she was given a thorough explanation about its \"thinking process\", it was not the \"four pillars\" from her real ba-zi.",
      "She says she will still give it another go at work, as it will probably be more useful for such tasks."

      "All three were killed together on 7 November last year by a Russian attack in a war that has devoured Ukraine since 2022 \u2013 but which no longer dominates the international agenda.",
      "Some of Adam's last moments were captured by Tetiana in a video on her phone. The two of them were out on a walk with Adam's mum Sophiia. Blond-haired, blue-eyed Adam wears a red anorak and a woollen hat, with a Mickey Mouse sticker on the front. \"Don't take off your hat,\" Tetiana tells him gently, \"you will be cold\".  He does it anyway.",
      "One hour later the trio were at home, about to get a bite to eat, when a Russian guided aerial bomb sliced through their block of flats. Adam, Sophiia and Tetiana were killed, along with six other civilians.",

      "Every time they come, there are more graves stretching out into the distance. The cemetery is expanding \"at a staggering pace,\" Yuliia says. Rows of blue and yellow flags, marking the graves of fallen soldiers, pierce the sombre grey sky.",
      "Zaporizhzhia, where the family lived, is a regular target for Russian forces. It is a strategically important industrial city, near front-line fighting. Europe's largest nuclear power plant \u2013 about 55km (34 miles) from the city \u2013 is held by the Russians.",
      "On the day of the attack that killed Sophiia, Tetiana and Adam, Yuliia called her daughter from western Ukraine, where she was on a work trip.",

      "In the days that followed some belongings were reclaimed from the rubble - a china cup of Sophiia's, somehow unbroken, a toy fish Adam played with in the bath, and the little red jacket he wore on his last walk. These are now family treasures, along with many precious memories.",
      "\"Every evening when I came home from work, I would take Adam for a walk,\" says Serhiy. \"He was very curious about the sky. He'd point his little finger up, and we'd tell him about it. And he loved birds.\"",
      "Another family video shows Adam hoisted in Sophiia's arms, being swung from side to side, and then running around on the ground, surrounded by pigeons. \"He had almost started talking,\" Yuliia says, \"and he was always smiling. He was healthy, beautiful and smart. He and my daughter made us happy every day\".",

      "\"Russia is an aggressor, that came to our country, and destroyed our homes, and our families,\" Yuliia says. \"So, there can be no talk of any ceasefire or peace talks. If we leave this glutton [Russian President Vladimir Putin] with our territories and do not avenge the people we lost, we will never win.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:06:25 GMT",
    "summary": "A kabaddi club has helped Indian girls find new opportunities and become financially independent as adults.",
    "story": [
      "Meena's eyes dart from left to right and back again, searching for the fleeting moment when she can make her move.",
      "She is playing Kabaddi, an Indian contact sport now played in more than 50 countries across the world.",
      "A Kabaddi game is played between two teams, each with seven players. Individuals take turns to run into the opposition's half of the pitch to tag opponents and make it back to their own half without being tackled to the ground.",
      "But for 14-year-old Meena, this is about more than winning points. The sport offers an escape from a restricted, rural life and opens up a world of opportunities.",
      "\"It feels different when I play,\" she says shyly, struggling to find the words. \"In that moment, I am not the Meena who is bound to housework, weighed down by pressures and expectations. It's just me and the opponent\u2026 It feels like I am more powerful than other girls who don't play.\"",
      "Meena lives on the outskirts of a small tribal village, Kudoshi, about 230km away from India's financial capital, Mumbai, where girls' lives traditionally revolve around household chores, marriage and children.",
      "But 15 years ago, a group of teachers at the village school decided they wanted to give girls more opportunities.",
      "\"I have a daughter. I want her to achieve things in life, live the best life she can, be something,\" says one of them, Daji Rajguru. \"Why can't girls play Kabaddi and make a career out of it?\"",
      "So he and his colleagues, who had played Kabaddi when they were younger, thought it would be good to teach local girls how to play. The pooled their savings - 5,000 rupees ($60; \u00a350) - persuaded the school to let them use its grounds, and opened what they believe was the region's first all-girls Kabaddi club.",
      "At the start, just two girls, who were pupils at the school, joined up. \"Parents were not ready to let their girls play Kabaddi as it meant spending a lot of time away from home,\" he says. \"They also worried about the impact it might have on their daughter's marriage prospects,\" as traditional families would not approve of girls going out and coming home late.",
      "Daji and his colleagues went door to door reassuring parents their daughters would be safe playing Kabaddi at training sessions before and after school. They reassured them they would supervise the girls properly and not let them be distracted by boys.",
      "At the start, the teachers would pick the girls up from their homes and drop them off, but as numbers grew they were no longer able to do that. Now, there are about 30 girls in the club and they estimate that about 300 have trained with them since they began coaching, including Daji's own daughter. Some start playing as young as seven years old.",
      "Like the rest of the members of the club, Meena trains for two hours before school and two hours after classes finish. She has to leave home at dawn and doesn't get back until nightfall.",
      "\"I go alone and it's dark [in the morning]. I used to be afraid that somebody could do something to me. My family was not supportive then, and are still unhappy with my choice to become a sportswoman,\" she says.",
      "But she is persevering, inspired by club members who have excelled over the years and joined state teams or local leagues.  Siddhi Chalke and Samreen Burandkar were among the first batch of girls who trained at the club for about eight years. Now, at the age of 25, they are professional league players and are financially independent.",
      "At the start, their families thought playing Kabaddi was a phase that would pass, and when the women decided to make a career of it, their parents were not happy. There is still pressure for them to get married but at the same time their families are also proud that the women are doing well.",
      "\"No-one in my family earns as much as I do,\" says Samreen. \"I now live in a big city and get to make my own choices. Coming from my community, it's difficult for girls to go after what they want. I am only here because of Kabaddi,\" she says.",
      "Siddhi plays on the same team as Samreen - their friendship born out of Kabaddi. They have travelled around India for competitions, winning medals and championships. \"I could only do that because of Kabaddi. Otherwise, I would have been married and ended up at my husband's place washing the dishes,\" says Siddhi and they both laugh, seemingly relieved that they have escaped this fate.",
      "Excelling in sports in India can also help players get jobs in the public sector. Indian states allocate jobs for high achievers in sports, guaranteeing an income even after a player's active sporting years are over.",
      "Many rural girls take up sport with the dream of getting financial independence via these jobs. It can also help them get greater respect and a sense of identity.",
      "\"When we started the sports club, no-one gave any importance to these girls. They were always secondary citizens in their homes, in society,\" says Vilas Bendre, a young coach at the club.",
      "\"But we realised that when rural girls climb ahead in their lives through sports, their lives change significantly. The way they talk, the way they carry themselves, their lifestyle, everything changes.\"",
      "Even if they haven't become professional sportswomen, many members of the club have seen their confidence grow and have persuaded their families to let them go to university and delay marriage until they are older.",
      "The community has become more accepting too, and when they see girls exercising, people don't frown at them any more.",
      "The club is funded by the coaches, cash prizes that the team win in competitions and occasional donations. Most of the girls are from poor and underprivileged families and don't have to pay any subscription fees.",
      "As well as training in term time, the club organises and funds residential sports camps at the school in the summer, provides food such as eggs, bananas and milk, and often pays for treatment for players' injuries.",
      "Over time, parents' fears have been assuaged, but critics sometimes question the coaches' motives. \"People say things indirectly like. 'Why don't you coach boys?'\" says Daji. But he says there are already opportunities for boys, and there is a gap when it comes to girls.",
      "\"We are not just their coaches,\" adds Vilas. \"At times we are their parents, guiding them, disciplining them, helping them make the right choice.\"",
      "And Meena knows the potential of this prized opportunity: \"I want to be the best raider and become the captain of India's Kabaddi team,\" she says, daring to dream about medals, championships and leaving an ordinary village girl's life behind.",

      "The scale of the looming humanitarian challenge is hard to comprehend.",
      "\"There are no facilities, no services, no electricity, no water, no infrastructure,\" Gazan journalist Ghada el-Kurd said, as she prepared to make her own way back north from Deir el-Balah, where she's been sheltering for months.",

      "Some of the areas left behind were obliterated, while others have just about survived.",
      "The UN estimates that around 70% of the Gaza Strip's buildings have been damaged or destroyed since October 2023, with much of the worst destruction in the north.",
      "Jabaliya, home to a pre-war population of 200,000, about half of whom lived in one of Gaza's oldest and biggest refugee camps, has been virtually destroyed.",
      "It is clear that for many people, the days of living in a tent are far from over.",

      "The UN says it's now able to bring in 20,000 tents that have been stuck on the border since August, along with large quantities of tarpaulin and mattresses. But it says it's going to struggle to meet the sudden demand for shelter.",
      "\"There simply aren't that many manufactured tents for aid operations anywhere in in the world,\" Mr Rose said.",
      "People who have managed to stay in the north throughout the war fear that pressure for accommodation, already acute, will get worse as civilians return and look to move back into homes abandoned over a year ago.",

      "\"Now they have to empty these houses and give them back to their owners. So a new kind of displacement has started.\"",

    "summary": "In her new musical, \"Redwood,\" the Tony Award-winning star of \"Wicked\" and \"Rent\" plays a woman seeking a refuge, and a purpose, by escaping into a redwood forest.",
    "story": [
      "Last fall, when superstar Idina Menzel wasn't in New York, she hung out in Oakland, Calif. At Bandaloop Studios, she was learning to dance suspended at the end of a rope \u2026 and this from a woman who says she isn't much of a dancer on the ground. \"I don't know what I'm doing!\" she exclaimed.",
      "But when you see exactly why she was doing this, it suddenly all makes sense.",
      "In the new Broadway musical \"Redwood,\" the audience is transported to the heart of the redwood forest, and seemingly into the trees themselves. It's loosely inspired by a woman named Julia Butterfly Hill, who, in the late '90s, spent more than two years living in a thousand-year-old redwood to save it from being cut down. Her effort worked: the tree was saved.",
      "And now, Menzel and writer-director Tina Landau are taking their own leap of faith with an idea they've been kicking around for more than a decade.",
      "Asked if she was ever worried that their experiment would fail, Landau said, \"Yes, I'm still worried. I didn't know. But it was one of those passion projects for both myself and Idina where it was just like, let's just trust that what is meant to happen will happen.\"",
      "\"Redwood\" is about a workaholic mom who runs away from it all, and finds herself in the redwood forest where her life is changed forever.",
      "One of the themes of the show is based on the fact that 300-foot redwoods actually support each other. Landau said, \"Their roots only go five or six feet into the ground. Their roots go sideways instead of down, until they reach the roots of other trees, and they intertwine with those. So, all the trees end up holding each other up.\"",
      "To listen to Idina Menzel perform \"Great Escape,\" from the musical \"Redwood,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The musical, which is currently in previews, is all-new, but Menzel is on familiar ground. She's performing at the Nederlander Theatre, which is the same theatre where she opened in \"Rent\" in 1996. \"Yeah, it's like a homecoming for me. It's full circle. It's very emotional for me. When I did 'Rent,\" that was the first professional job I ever had \u2013 and it was a Broadway show. So, I was super-lucky. That was a beautiful time in my life.\"",
      "It was beautiful. She was 25 years old, and her performance in \"Rent\" put her squarely on the map, with a Tony Award nomination. \"I got a record deal that I always wanted to get,\" she said. \"I wanted to be signed to a record label so badly and make my own album, and I did. And that was a dream come true. But then I only sold, like, three albums. So, then I got dropped from the label. And then by that time, my whole kind of momentum of being this Tony-nominated actress from the hit musical 'Rent,' it sort of dissipated. And then I had to kind of keep pounding the pavement again. It wasn't until 'Wicked' that things started to really look up again.\"",
      "As the original Wicked Witch Elphaba in Broadway's \"Wicked,\" Menzel won a Tony, and helped turn the show into a mega-hit, though it wasn't always easy being green. Asked what Elphaba gave her, Menzel replied, \"Green ears for the rest of my life!\"",
      "Idina Menzel performs \"Defying Gravity\" from \"Wicked\" on \"The Late Show With David Letterman\":",
      "And then, she was an animated princess in Disney's \"Frozen,\" singing the song that millions of would-be princesses couldn't get out of their heads. \"My relationship with 'Let It Go' is fabulous,\" she said. \"It's one of the best things that's ever happened to me. People always say, 'Do you get sick of a song like that?' And maybe they think I'm lying to you, but I really don't.\"",
      "Idina Menzel, as Elsa, performs \"Let It Go\" in \"Frozen\":",
      "\"When I was a little girl, if I would have dreamt that I'd be up there singing a song like this, I wouldn't have believed it. Or, no, I would have, 'cause I really was very cocky when I was little, and I actually, you know, believed in myself and thought, 'Definitely, it's definitely gonna happen for me.'\"",
      "But the task of writing Menzel's next big song went to someone who'd never written for a big Broadway star (or for anyone). \"Redwood\" is composer Kate Diaz's very first show, but you'd never know it. Asked what it's like to write for The Idina Menzel, Diaz said, \"It's amazing. I had never written for anybody else before, so great place to start, for sure! What an incredible voice to write for.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is there a little part of you that's like, 'Let me just see if she can do this'?\"",
      "\"I mean, she usually can,\" Diaz replied, \"So, not really.\"",
      "And she can do it on demand, as she demonstrated in the new \"Wicked\" film where she brought back her classic vocal riff.",
      "Her new show offers a different way to go green: an immersion in a leafy redwood forest. Even the seats in the newly-remodeled Nederlander are green. For Menzel it's almost hard to believe: \"It's just so rare that you get to see it come to fruition after so many years, and they're literally loading things into the Nederlander as we speak. That accomplishment isn't lost on me, and it's just, I'm so emotional about it.",
      "And now she's hoping to defy gravity, again. \"But I think green and being high, flying, literally or figuratively, is just something that I must respond to or attract in my life, in my characters,\" Menzel laughed. \"And I'm kind of happy with that!\"",

    "story": [
      "It's hard to believe, but as author and Illustrator Dav Pilkey recently told students at Boy's Prep in the Bronx, he created Dog Man back when he was in second grade. \"He looks a little bit different,\" he said.",
      "The kids loved hearing when someone with learning disabilities (\"I had ADHD, and I was dyslexic, and I was the class clown, and I couldn't sit still,\" he said) could go on to be so successful.",
      "Every book in Pilkey's Dog Man series has been the bestselling children's book for the year it came out.",
      "And as the new film out next week reminds us, it all started when a police officer and his dog got into a bad accident \u2013 and doctors sewed the head of the dog onto the man's body, creating \u2026 Dog Man!",
      "And while he's part man, he's all dog. \"Oh, yeah, yeah. The man part doesn't really come out that much,\" Pilkey said.",
      "But in addition to all the fun, Pilkey tries to layer meaning into the Dog Man books, even in their titles, from \"The Scarlet Shedder\" and \"Fetch-22,\" to \"Lord of the Fleas,\" and \"A Tale of Two Kitties.\" \"I was looking at Charles Dickens' 'A Tale of Two Cities,' which is such a wonderful book. It talks about sacrifice, self-sacrifice, and the value of that.\"",
      "\"And you hope that children will be moved to read these classics?\" I asked.",
      "\"I hope so, yeah,\" Pilkey replied. \"I hope they don't think 'Oh, that Charles Dickens stole an idea from Dav Pilkey.' That wouldn't be so good!\"",
      "Pilkey's sense of humor is what made director Peter Hastings want to make the \"Dog Man\" movie. He also directed a TV series based on Pilkey's \"Captain Underpants\" books. \"I just love his sensibility, the playful anarchy of his work,\" Hastings said.",
      "Comedian Pete Davidson gets top billing in the film: \"I'm a huge Dav Pilkey fan,\" he said. \"I grew up reading all the 'Captain Underpants' books. My mom got them for me. All the young kids in my family, they all read 'Dog Man,' they're obsessed with 'Dog Man.' And then right around the time I started noticing that, we got the offer.\"",
      "It was an offer to play Dog Man's nemesis, Petey the Cat. Davidson said it was fun to play the villain: \"It's a really fun, loud, layered character,\" he said. \"I don't get a lot of opportunities to stretch like that.\"",
      "In fact, as readers of the \"Dog Man\" books know, things start to change when Petey tries to clone himself, and instead creates \u2026 an adorable kitten!",
      "\"His character has a great arc in the story,\" said Hastings.",
      "\"It's the best arc I've ever been given\" Davidson laughed. \"Usually I'm in a movie for, like, nine minutes, and then shot in the face, so it was nice to have a full [arc]!\"",

      "Sian Heder's film \"CODA\" premiered at Sundance in 2021. It went on to win three Oscars the following year, including best picture. It doesn't always happen that way, but the Sundance Film Festival does have a pretty good track record of catapulting independent filmmakers into a career.",
      "Its alumni include the likes of Steven Soderbergh (\"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\"), Quentin Tarantino (\"Reservoir Dogs\"), Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\"), and Lulu Wang (\"The Farewell\"). They were all introduced not only to audiences, but to powerful film distribution companies, at the annual festival held high in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah.",
      "\"I think that was the big breakthrough with Sundance, is that finally these new voices, these exciting new filmmakers had a place where they could actually show what they had done and potentially sell them,\" said eight-time Oscar nominee Glenn Close.",
      "She first heard about Sundance from its famous founder, Robert Redford, on the set of \"The Natural.\" His idea \u2013 then in its infancy - was in some ways just as pure as baseball itself.",
      "As Redford told us in 2018, \"I said, wait a minute, there are other stories out there. There are other voices to be heard that are not being given a chance. What if we created something, an opportunity, for those people to get their films made and have them distributed? \u2026 The smaller stories. The more offbeat stories. The more controversial.\"",
      "Which is why he wanted his non-profit Sundance Institute to be held as far away from profit-focused Hollywood as possible. So, he set it up amid the pines and aspens of Utah's Provo Canyon, on land he bought after the success of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\"",
      "Close said, \"You are surrounded by nature in a way that, if you're from a city, it's undeniable,\" she said. \"It's a spiritual thing. And I think that was very important for Bob.\"",
      "Redford said he didn't think the idea he started would last beyond two or three years. But the Sundance Institute has lasted 44 years and counting. It's become for film what Michelin Stars are to fine dining.",
      "You don't choose Sundance; Sundance chooses you.",
      "Michelle Satter, the Institute's founding senior director, has been by Redford's side since 1981. \"We'll get 3,000 scripts; we'll select 12,\" she said. \"That's a tiny number. But there are a lot of people globally who want to tell stories, and we believe in the power of storytelling.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you know when you've found a unique story or a unique talent?\"",
      "\"It speaks to me,\" Satter replied. \"If they don't have a voice that is unique, we're not interested.\"",
      "\"And what does that mean to you, voice'?\"",
      "\"There's something about the way they tell the story that does not feel generic, like anybody could tell the story,\" said Satter. \"But they're bringing something from their own experience, from their own connection to storytelling that uplifts it.\"",
      "According to Satter, \"A film is not complete until it reaches an audience and engages with an audience.\"",
      "Last Spring, Satter allowed us into Sundance's storied Directors and Screenwriters Lab, this time held in Estes Park, Colorado. One of the lab's advisors was four-time Oscar nominated actor-director Ed Harris.",
      "\"It's not about ego,\" Harris said. \"It's not about anything other than learning, making mistakes. I love the work. It's all about the work, and I learn as much as I probably help anybody.\"",
      "All the Sundance \"Fellows,\" as they're called, bring projects already in the works, like Hannah Gray Organschi, polishing up her upcoming feature film. \"There's tough feedback, like, feedback that's good,\" she said. \"And to have that at the phase where you can really be deepening and honing the characters and story is, it feels lucky.\"",
      "Casey Modderno was fine tuning her rom-com: \"The questions I think that you're normally asked as a filmmaker are, like, about budget, about accessibility, about market response. And so, to be asked questions about the feeling of the film and the aesthetics of the film and the texture, and just go deep in craft, it's, like, super-special.\"",
      "And then there's Sean Wang. \"This experience has just, like, changed my DNA as a filmmaker,\" he said.",
      "What got him accepted to Sundance was his screenplay for his first feature film, \"Didi.\" He had been toiling away on the film pretty much by himself with his crew for six years. \"I was just obsessed with, 'Who won Sundance this year? Who won the Audience Award? Who won the Jury Prize? What's the next filmmaker that is coming out of Sundance?'\" he said.",
      "Turns out he was one of those Sundance filmmakers. Last year, \"Didi\" not only won two of the Sundance Film Festival's top prizes; it got him a distribution deal.",
      "Wang notes that Sundance doesn't finance films. \"They have no financial stake in your movie,\" he said. \"When we sell the movie, they're not like, 'Great. Where's our 10%?' It's a very giving environment. Obviously they want your films to succeed.\"",
      "This year the California wildfires cast a long shadow over the festival. Michelle Satter's home, where we did our interview, is now gone, as are so many others.",
      "None of those victims were forgotten in Utah this past week. As Satter told the audience, \"We lost our village, but at the end of the day, we are the village.\"",
      "As for Robert Redford, the visionary who started it all is now 88. He hasn't been here in person for the last three years, but his spirit remains. Independent film has forever been changed \u2013 a legacy that he and others have taken to the box office bank.",
      "Glenn Close said, \"He put his money where his mouth is. And you know, I'm in awe of that. And I salute him for it.\"",

      "Adam Ross, the acclaimed author of \"Mr. Peanut,\" returns with \"Playworld\" (Knopf), a novel dipped in nostalgia and flecked with love and sorrow, about a child actor coming of age as the object of attraction for an older woman.",
      "Read an excerpt below.",
      "\"Playworld\" by Adam Ross",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Prologue",
      "In the fall of 1980, when I was fourteen, a friend of my parents named Naomi Shah fell in love with me. She was thirty-six, a mother of two, and married to a wealthy man. Like so many things that happened to me that year, it didn't seem strange at the time.",
      "Two decades later, when I finally told my mother\u2014we were on Long Island, taking a walk on the beach\u2014she stopped, stunned, and said, \"But she was such an ugly woman.\" The remark wasn't as petty as it sounds. If I was aware of it then, it neither repulsed me nor affected my feelings for Naomi. It was just a thing I took for granted, like the color of her hair.",
      "Wiry and ashen, it had the shading but not the shimmer of pigeon feathers. Naomi kept it long, so that it fell past her shoulders. I knew it by touch, for my face was often buried in it. Only later did I wonder if she considered herself unattractive, because she always wore sunglasses, as if to hide her face, large gold frames with blue-tinted prescription lenses. When we were driving together, which was often that year, she'd allow these to slide down her nose and then look at me over their bridge. She might've considered this pose winning, but it was more likely to see me better. Her mouth often hung slightly open. Her lower teeth were uneven, and her tongue, which pressed against them, always tasted of coffee.",
      "Naomi's car was a silver Mercedes sedan\u2014300sd along with turbo diesel nickel-plated on the back\u2014that made a deep hum when she drove. The interior, enormous in my mind's eye, was tricked out with glossy wood paneling and white leather, back seat so wide and legroom so ample they made the driver appear to be far away. It was in this car that Naomi and I talked most often. We'd park, and then she'd lean across the armrest to press her cheek to mine, and I'd sometimes allow her to kiss me. Other times we'd move to the back. Lying there with Naomi, her nose nuzzled to my neck, I'd stare at the ceiling's dotted fabric until the pattern seemed to detach and drift like a starred sky. This car was her prized possession, and like many commuters, she had turned the machine into an extension of her body. Her left thumb lightly hooked the wheel at eight o'clock when traffic was moving, her fingertips sliding to eleven when it was slow. She preferred to sit slightly reclined, her free hand spread on her inner thigh, though after she lost her pinky the following summer, and even after being fitted with a prosthesis, she kept it tucked away.",
      "\"I was worried you'd think it was disgusting,\" she said, the digit hidden between the seat and her hip. She'd bought herself a diamond ring to hide the seam, and for the most part the likeness was uncanny, but at certain angles you could tell\u2014the cuticle's line was too smooth, the nail's pale crescent too creamy to match the others. Like my father's fake teeth, which he occasionally left lying around our apartment, I was fascinated by it, though my curiosity wasn't morbid. I was a child actor, you see, a student of all forms of dissembling, and had long ago found my greatest subject to be adults.",

      "It was meant to be a harmless prank. Not even a prank, not initially.",
      "An inside joke, only for the three of them. But now she was locking her apartment door behind two departing police officers.",
      "She had managed to sound appropriately earnest but unworried when they began asking questions. After all, why should May Hanover, of all people, be nervous around police? May was the good girl, always. The one who only needed to be told once by a teacher to open a book to a specific page. The teenager who drove strictly within the limits of her learner's permit. Even her pug, Gomez, seemed to understand at an instinctive level why he needed to break away from his neighbor buddies to ride the building's service elevator while they strutted brazenly with their humans through the lobby.",
      "May, simply put, was a rule follower. A rule enforcer, in fact. It was a trait that had helped her succeed in life, but, as she had learned, could also lead to trouble.",
      "Josh emerged from the bedroom where he'd gone to give her privacy when the police arrived. Gomez waddled slightly behind him. \"Was that about Roland Shaw?\"",
      "Shaw was the man she'd convicted in her final in-person trial as an assistant district attorney after he was found breaking into his next victim's apartment. \"How'd you know?\" Could a question be a lie? That one probably counted. So many lies since she'd gotten home yesterday from her long weekend in the Hamptons.",
      "\"That was a major case for you. I recognized the big guy from the news.\"",
      "The trial was before she and Josh had found themselves suddenly living together. Before they were engaged. The media coverage consisted of two small articles in the Post, including a photograph of a defiant-looking May flanked by two detectives in the courthouse hallway\u2014one of them the \"big guy\" Josh recognized. Whereas May was obsessed with all things crime-related\u2014in her job, the news, truth or fiction\u2014Josh found it all, quote, \"dark and depressing.\" But Josh was interested in all things May-related. Of course he had followed the coverage.",
      "\"The DA's Office got an inquiry from another jurisdiction and needed to clear something up,\" she said. Misleading, but technically true.",
      "\"They couldn't just call you?\" he asked.",
      "\"Actually, he called, but I didn't see the message.\" That one was a full-on lie. \"Guess he's training a new guy and wanted a change of scenery.\"",
      "\"Well, I'm glad they were quick. I really wanted a Negroni but thought the sound of a cocktail shaker might be inadvisable while you were in official law enforcement mode.\"",
      "\"Another reason why you should stir,\" she said. \"I like what I like.\"",
      "\"Make two? I'm getting back into my comfy clothes.\" She called Lauren once she was alone in the bedroom. \"Hey there, woman. We were just saying we miss you.\"",
      "\"Yes, we miss you!\" Kelsey called out in the background. \"Come back here right now. It's boring without you.\"",
      "May could hear a few drinks' worth of enthusiasm in Kelsey's voice. \"You're clearly having a miserable time. Absolutely suffering.\" She felt a knot form in her sternum as she steeled herself to explain why she was calling. \"I don't even know how to say this, but the police are probably going to call you. Both of you.\"",
      "\"What? How would they even know about us?\" Lauren asked. \"They came to my apartment. They asked who I was with. I didn't have a choice. They have your names. And your phone numbers.\"",
      "\"How? Were there cameras or something?\"",
      "\"No, it was because of me. I'm so sorry.\"",
      "What had she gone and done? No one was supposed to know about any of their stupidity. And now something really, really bad was going to happen\u2014she could feel it. Something she couldn't control. She wanted to open her mouth wide to scream\u2014to scream impossibly loudly again, like last time.",

      "The wisest souls say that pure mountain air makes us all go a little mad. A wind\u2014lawless and long-tailed\u2014slices through the snow-stippled Apuan alps and the Apennines with all the wantonness of La Befana, the winter witch. Swifts catch this wind on their wings, carving up the crisp blue morning. Dipping down into the valley, the wind now worries over the murmuring blue tongue of the Serchio river on its journey to the Tyrrhenian Sea. It slips\u2014an unseen spirit\u2014under Devil's bridge. Shivers along the great gray hunch of the Devil's back. Hissing over every ancient stone. Rising from the river, the wind picks up speed, hastening toward the woods. Hurtling toward chestnut trees spaced like the pews of a great Duomo. The wind now weaves between golden leaves. Whispering quick consonants between the branches, borrowing an autumnal aura. Sweet sigh of ripe chestnuts and shed leaves. And here\u2014where the wind steals woodland scents\u2014hides a curiosity. Cloistered by soil, moss, stone and leaf litter, a thing unseen\u2014a thing quite mysterious\u2014lies in waiting.",
      "A thing that sits buried, like old bones.",
      "What lies under the soil has stayed secret. It is an underground barterer. A schemer who has set a trap in the soil. A sylvan swindler. A tormentor.",
      "A tiny god.",
      "Swelling to irresistible bulk, it has ripened into a knobbled fruit of corruption. And now the time has come. The tiny god releases a lusty sigh, soundlessly unfurling a phantom into the wind.",
      "No more visible than the notes of nightingale song.",
      "No more audible than a wordless wish.",
      "The tiny god has released a cipher.",
      "The breath of the tiny god is whisked away by the breeze, slipping through the damp woodland of chestnut worship. Deeper into the woods, the breath in the breeze paints the pupils of a fallow deer into great glistening lakes. Fur stiffens along a back freckled in the white of first snow. The doe salivates in answer to the call of the stranger she can smell but cannot see. Her nostrils flutter, messages flood her bloodstream. But the breath blows on.",
      "Now a wild sow lifts her moist snout from the leaf litter and inhales a slip of the wind. Instantly intoxicated, her muddy snout snuffing. The grunting sow is aroused into a frenzy. Bristled legs stab at the soil as she arranges them to assume her stance, ready to receive the boar she smells. Turning her head toward her tail, she hunts for him, but\u2014and here is the trick, here is the olfactory deception\u2014there is no boar and the breeze blows on through the woods, fanning the sensual scent along with it.",
      "See-through scarves of scent curl from the forest and swirl toward a beautiful medieval village, perched upon a peak. Its tallest point an 11th century bell tower with memories of steel swords and shields. The wind, pickled with flavors of the forest, ridden by the breath of the tiny god, tickles trees of olive and cyprus. Until it dangles its string of little calamities above cobblestone streets and terracotta roof tiles.",
      "And it settles upon the medieval village like a spell.",

      "The couple, who rose to stardom on \"The Hills,\" a spin-off of \"Laguna Beach,\" filed the lawsuit Tuesday along with more than 20 other property owners and residents who were affected by the Palisades Fire. The complaint blames Los Angeles and its municipal water department for the water issues that hampered firefighting efforts and says it ultimately led to the damage to their properties.",
      "The Eaton and Palisades fires, ignited by strong winds during one of the region's driest years on record, have killed 28 people and destroyed more than 16,000 structures, Cal Fire says, putting them among the most destructive fires in California history.",

      "The complaint filed by the couple and others mentions that the Santa Ynez Reservoir, which services the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, was offline and had been out of commission since February 2024 while awaiting repairs. The hydrants in the neighborhood were connected to three tanks that held 1 million gallons of water each and went dry within 12 hours, the complaint said, citing Janisse Qui\u00f1ones, the water utility's chief executive and chief engineer.",
      "Without water from the reservoir, firefighters had to primarily rely on the water tanks that weren't designed to fight such a large fire, the complaint said.",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's controversial pick to head the federal Department of Health and Human Services, will appear Wednesday before a Senate panel that is crucial to advance his nomination.",
      "Kennedy is due to appear first at the Senate Committee on Finance, the panel that will ultimately be the committee with the deciding vote on whether his nomination to be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services advances to the full Senate. He must receive a majority of senators to be confirmed to head HHS, which encompasses America's federal health agencies.",
      "The committee's jurisdiction largely focuses on the department's mammoth Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs for seniors and low-income Americans, which make up the largest share of mandatory spending in the federal budget.",
      "He will head next to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, or HELP, which is scheduled to question Kennedy on Thursday.",
      "That committee's focus includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health, all agencies that would fall under Kennedy's authority if he is confirmed to lead the department.",
      "Trump's picks to head all of those agencies will also need to face their own Senate confirmation hearings. While some have voiced different opinions from him in the past, Kennedy could have broad authority to override them as secretary.",
      "What is RFK Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda?",
      "This week's hearings will offer the first public window into Kennedy's broad \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda in many weeks, after Kennedy and other nominees retreated from public appearances and social media posts.",
      "Advisers have been huddling with Kennedy for months behind closed doors, multiple advisers say, hashing out how and whether to implement dramatic changes he has sought to the federal government's health bureaucracy.",
      "Kennedy's supporters say many of his stances, like questioning ultra-processed foods and the risks of synthetic food additives and dyes, have hit on broad appeal among both Republicans and some Democrats that could buoy his chances to clear the Senate.",
      "Through the FDA, Kennedy would be able to exercise substantial authority on how foods are regulated, labeled and recommended by the federal government.",
      "But Kennedy is also facing criticism from both sides of the aisle, setting up a confirmation battle that multiple allies say he has privately acknowledged will be an uphill fight.",
      "His aides are facing mounting criticism over a department-wide communications \"pause\" that has stymied releases across the health agencies, which is timed to end in the days after Kennedy's confirmation hearings wrap up.",
      "What is RFK Jr.'s stance on abortion rights?",
      "Conservative groups have also been divided over Kennedy's nomination, with some criticizing his past statements voicing support for abortion rights.",
      "The issue is expected to be a large focus of Kennedy's hearings: as secretary, he would have authority over how the FDA regulates medications used for abortions.",
      "Kennedy has reassured conservative groups and lawmakers that he would hew closely to Mr. Trump's campaign trail promise to defer the issue to the states.",
      "But Kennedy and the Trump administration will have little room to avoid the issue, given an ongoing federal court case against the FDA. Conservatives have called on the Trump administration's FDA to roll back moves made since 2016 to ease access to abortion pills.",
      "The FDA's decision to ease those so-called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies or REMS restrictions on the abortion pill mifepristone were the focus of a Supreme Court case last year that ended in defeat for abortion opponents.",
      "\"Walking back REMS has significantly increased safety risks for women. And so from our perspective, as directed by the administration, we do believe that an RFK HHS has the ability to direct the FDA to review safety,\" said John Mize, CEO of Americans United for Life.",
      "Mize's group has petitioned the FDA \"urging the reinstatement of basic safety measures\" while additional data is collected on their risks. He cited the death of Amber Thurman in a high-profile case that made headlines last year after a medication abortion.",
      "\"I've seen this from RFK in the past, that he is absolutely laser focused on the safety of pharmaceuticals. And so this gives us a really good opportunity to expose a safety issue,\" said Mize.",
      "FDA officials have defended their decision to ease the restrictions, saying that multiple reviews by the agency's staff support the safety of easing the limits on when during a pregnancy the pills can be taken and allowing mail-order and retail pharmacies to dispense the medication.",
      "What is RFK Jr.'s stance on vaccines?",
      "Many Democrats, nonprofits and health experts have also blasted Kennedy over his record of misleading and unfounded health claims, in addition to work by him and his allies opposing the approvals and authorizations of a range of vaccines, including COVID-19 and polio shots.",
      "Kennedy has sought to assuage concerns that he would upend vaccines using his authority, pledging in the days after the election not to ban any shots.",
      "In his government ethics agreement, Kennedy also promises for a year to not intervene in any matters involving a nonprofit he chaired, Children's Health Defense, which has battled federal agencies over vaccine authorizations and requirements.",
      "\"They're not interested in validating the press narrative that Bobby's going to come in and make sweeping changes in vaccine policy. That's going to be kind of political suicide right now,\" Dr. Robert Malone, a close Kennedy ally who has fiercely opposed the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, told CBS News.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a medical doctor and head of the Senate's health committee, said he had \"a frank conversation\" on \"vaccines at length\" with Kennedy after voicing concern over his past statements.",
      "The FDA's top vaccines official has also voiced optimism that he might find common ground with Kennedy over vaccines.",
      "\"This is how the sausage gets made. And you know, it's not always pretty and it isn't always what you want, but I'm really encouraged to see Bobby be pragmatic about the political realities here,\" said Malone.",
      "Who is RFK Jr?",
      "When Kennedy first announced his campaign as a Democratic presidential candidate in April 2023, he touted his decades-long record as an environmental lawyer.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 whose father, Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign \u2014 says he did not want to immediately enter politics, and instead \"carried on his family's legacy by devoting himself to environmental causes and children's welfare.\"",
      "That followed a struggle with substance abuse when he was younger, which he says spanned 14 years after he started using heroin at 15 years old.",
      "Kennedy made headlines for his environmental work was as founder and president of the nonprofit Waterkeeper Alliance from the 1980s until 2020, ranging from local efforts to clean up the Hudson River to campaigning against an oil pipeline in North Dakota.",
      "What Kennedy has described as his \"reluctant entrance into the vaccine debate\" dates back to 2005, when he wrote an article in Rolling Stone exploring supposed evidence for a link between autism and an ingredient that had formerly been used in some vaccines. The article contained numerous scientific and factual errors and was eventually retracted. Decades of research has established there is no such link.",
      "In 2016, Kennedy joined a nonprofit focused on mercury, which later broadened its focus and rebranded to Children's Health Defense. Kennedy chaired the group and served as one of its loudest voices raising doubts about vaccines and fighting against vaccine requirements and approvals.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, they clashed with federal health agencies over use of ivermectin and the federal mask mandate in travel. In 2021, the FDA denied their petition asking to revoke all COVID-19 vaccine authorizations and ban studies of the shots for children.",
      "As a candidate, Kennedy continued to say that he thought vaccines as well as \"a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods\" were to blame for rising rates of autism and other chronic diseases in U.S. children. Experts have attributed the global rise in autism prevalence in part to broader awareness and changes to how the disorder is classified and diagnosed.",
      "Kennedy's longshot bid to challenge President Joe Biden in the Democratic primary ended in October 2023, when he switched his campaign to an independent presidential bid. He dropped out of the campaign and endorsed Mr. Trump in August 2024.",

      "The White House blamed an \"outage\" for locking out a wide range of organizations and agencies on Tuesday from the online systems responsible for drawing down federal health dollars.",
      "Multiple state Medicaid programs reported late Tuesday they have been able to resume accessing their payment systems after the nationwide lockout.",
      "The interruption had sparked outcry from state governments, nonprofits and lawmakers in the wake of the Trump administration's\u00a0move to freeze spending\u00a0across the federal government. After legal challenges were filed against the funding freeze, a federal judge issued a stay\u00a0temporarily halting\u00a0the move until she can hear arguments in the case.",
      "State Medicaid agencies, federally funded\u00a0Head Start\u00a0early education programs and\u00a0community health centers\u00a0had been among those cut off from access to the\u00a0Payment Management Services\u00a0web portal, or PMS, run by the Department of Health and Human Services, which handles billions of dollars of payments every year.",
      "\"We have confirmed no payments have been affected \u2014 they are still being processed and sent. We expect the portal will be back online shortly,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt   said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",
      "Confusion after Medicaid programs locked out",
      "There was widespread confusion after Medicaid and other programs discovered they were locked out of the federal health payment system. Spokespeople for HHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have not responded to requests for comment, amid the ongoing\u00a0communications \"pause\"\u00a0imposed by the Trump administration at the department.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Association of Medicaid Directors said they had also sought an explanation.",
      "\"My staff has confirmed reports that Medicaid portals are down in all 50 states following last night's federal funding freeze. This is a blatant attempt to rip away health care from millions of Americans overnight and will get people killed,\" Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden\u00a0posted\u00a0on X.",
      "\"Multiple states locked out of Medicaid portal,\" Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii tweeted. \"This is a Trump shutdown, except this time it's unlawful.\"",
      "Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said he was assured Medicaid would not be affected.",
      "\"What the White House has told us just now is that Medicaid is not, categorically not, covered by this,\" Hawley said. \"In other words, there will be no interruption to Medicaid or Medicare or any grant that floats to individuals.\"",
      "Joann Alker of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families had\u00a0called on\u00a0the administration to issue a statement clarifying that\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0should not be affected after its initial memo ordering the spending freeze late Monday, warning it is a\u00a0\"major crisis\"\u00a0as states look to draw down funding for the month.",
      "\"Any pause in federal funding of Medicaid \u2014 the largest source of federal funding received by states \u2014 would be disastrous for states as they need to draw down federal funds to meet their financial obligations to the health care providers and health plans serving Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries,\" Alker said.",
      "Health centers warn of \"irreversible\" consequences",
      "Even as the payment systems come back online, those who rely on the grants say they worry that new \"delays\" on payments imposed by the Trump administration could inflict permanent damage on stretched-thin healthcare systems.",
      "The HHS website currently warns that due \"to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "In a statement ahead of the lockout, HHS\u00a0announced\u00a0it would be reevaluating \"all programs, regulations, and guidance to ensure Federal taxpayer dollars are not being used to pay for or promote elective abortion\" following a previous\u00a0executive order.",
      "\"Even with the best of intentions, these types of funding freezes can do tremendous harm. And could be irreversible to some communities. What we're really talking about is a health center's ability to pay salaries,\" said Amanda Pears Kelly, CEO of the group Advocates for Community Health.",
      "The group lobbies on behalf of community health centers, which are subsidized by the federal government to offer health care to low-income communities.",
      "Pears Kelly said that health centers often rely on being able to request money every-other-week through the system, drawing down their grant to pay bills and make payroll for their staff. Without the money, she warned many health centers facing already slim margins could be forced to trim staff or close their doors.",
      "\"When the system's down, and there's no one to talk to to understand what they need to do, and then on top of that there's an uncertain time to the delay, it's paralyzing,\" said Pears Kelly.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association warned that health centers could face \"significant disruption\" to operations even with a \"temporary funding pause.\"",
      "\"For many patients, Title X-funded health centers serve as their sole source of health care. The Title X family planning program is already chronically underfunded, and this executive action risks destabilizing a health provider network that is already operating under immense strain,\" said Clare Coleman, president and CEO of the association.",
      "School lunches, other programs worry about impact",
      "The implications of the federal grant pause go beyond HHS, but the full effects are still unknown.",
      "It's unclear whether the National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools and school districts each month for the meals they serve children, will still receive funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture if the freeze takes effect. The program feeds about 28 million American schoolchildren each month.",
      "Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations at the School Nutrition Association, said her organization is asking the USDA for more information.",
      "\"We're urging Congress to increase reimbursements for school meals given the financial crisis facing meal programs today, so certainly there's just no room in the budget for missed reimbursements,\" she said.",
      "Meals on Wheels, a nonprofit organization that delivers about 250 million meals each year to more than 2 million seniors, receives federal grant funding. They're not sure what's next either.",
      "\"If in fact this order includes the Older Americans Act, this would presumably halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" a Meals on Wheels spokesperson said. \"And the lack of clarity and uncertainty right now is creating chaos for local Meals on Wheels providers not knowing for sure whether they should be serving meals today, which unfortunately means seniors will panic not knowing where their next meals will come from.\"",
      "They added that since the program is already underfunded, local providers generally \"don't have the ability to absorb a blow like this, especially if it persists for any extended period.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:28:23 -0500",
    "summary": "A different strain of H5N9 has shown up in U.S. birds before.",
    "story": [
      "A California duck farm made headlines this week after the World Organization of Animal Health published a report by U.S. authorities that a strain of bird flu that scientists call H5N9 had been found among sick birds in the flock.",
      "This is far from the first time that H5N9 has been found in birds around the country. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was the first time that H5N9 had been found in American poultry sick with \"highly pathogenic avian influenza,\" meaning it caused severe disease.",
      "\"Clinical signs included increased mortality. State officials have quarantined the affected premises,\" the USDA said of the flock.",
      "What is H5N9 and how is it different from H5N1?",
      "Scientists classify bird flu viruses by which kind of two key proteins are inside of them: the hemagglutinin, like H5 or H3, and the neuraminidase, like N1 or N9.",
      "Different blends of those two proteins alongside many other mutations elsewhere in the virus can affect how sick people and animals get and how it spreads.",
      "H5N1 has been the dominant grouping of strains fueling this past year's outbreaks in the U.S., with different variants of that virus spreading in wild birds, poultry flocks, dairy cattle, pets and into at least 67 confirmed human cases.",
      "A spokesperson for the department said that scientists believe the H5N9 was the result of a \"reassortment,\" where H5N1 was able to\u00a0genetically mix\u00a0with other influenza viruses inside of a duck.",
      "\"The finding was not unexpected, as it is not uncommon to see reassortments and ducks are reservoir hosts for influenza A viruses,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Both H5N9 and H5N1 were found to be infecting ducks at the farm, the USDA said.",
      "\"The H5N1 virus is widely circulating across North America, and these viruses can reassort in species that are susceptible to influenza viruses,\" said S. Mark Tompkins, director of the Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research at the University of Georgia. He agreed that it would not be \"terribly surprising\" to see a reassortment emerge to infect poultry.",
      "\"H5N1 reassorts with other avian influenza viruses quite frequently and even the current H5 HA protein that is infecting dairy cows and commercial poultry farms in the US has been shown to reassort,\"\u00a0Andy Pekosz, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an email.",
      "Has H5N9 been seen in the U.S. before?",
      "H5N9 has been seen before in U.S. birds, but often it results in less severe symptoms, called \"low pathogenic avian influenza\" by veterinarians.",
      "\"H5N9 viruses have been detected in North American wild birds in 2023 and 2024, and before the current outbreak,\" said Tompkins.",
      "Some of the\u00a0earliest records\u00a0of H5N9 around the world date back to turkeys infected in Wisconsin in the 1960s, which U.S. officials\u00a0reported had\u00a0\"mild respiratory symptoms and a severe drop in egg production.\"",
      "The California duck farm's strain of H5N9 is different from those earlier cases because this time it is closely related to a newer variant of the H5N1 virus. That variant is called H5N1 D1.1, the USDA spokesperson said, which has emerged over the past year to dominate U.S. cases in wild birds and poultry.",
      "\"The combination H5N9 is not new and other versions, like H5N5 also exist. Just because this was now detected, doesn't mean trouble necessarily,\" said virologist Florian Krammer, professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in an email.",
      "Krammer pointed to recent detections of the H5N5\u00a0strain spreading from Europe, and then jumping from birds to be able to infect mammals across Canada as prompting more worry for him.",
      "\"It's not really surprising, because we have a history of three years of H5N1 undergoing reassortments that would typically burn out and not emerge as a major one,\" said David Swayne, a private veterinarian and former director of the USDA's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory.",
      "Swayne said that past H5N9 outbreaks have been dead ends, in the handful of times they have been found to be causing severe disease in ducks.",
      "\"So far, I have not heard of any evidence to say this H5N9 has some kind of fitness that is better than the H5N1. If it doesn't have that, it can't outcompete,\" said Swayne.",
      "Is H5N9 a bigger risk to humans than H5N1?",
      "As with H5N1, H5N9 in birds would still need to achieve some key mutations before it is able to spread efficiently among humans.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the U.S. to date. Most cases were blamed on direct contact with sick animals, except for three that have befuddled investigators who failed to identify a likely source.",
      "It is unclear whether authorities followed up with workers at the Merced County farm about potential human infections. A spokesperson for the county did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "If H5N9 gains a foothold in humans, people may possibly have less immunity to the virus than they do to H5N1.",
      "\"The seasonal, human H1N1 virus has an NA protein that is related, but different from the bovine H5N1 NA protein. There is some cross-recognition of avian H5N1 NA in the human population because of this,\" said Pekosz.",
      "Where was the California H5N9 outbreak?",
      "The USDA said the virus was detected at a \"commercial duck meat\" farm in California's Merced County, in an outbreak that started on Nov. 23, 2024.",
      "A total of 118,954 birds were culled at the duck farm by Dec. 2 to stamp out the virus, in an effort to curb the risk of further bird flu spread.",
      "More than 3 million birds have been culled at farms in this California county over the past year due to bird flu outbreaks, the most of any county in the state. California has been hit hard by this past year's bird flu outbreaks, which have resulted in record cullings across the egg industry.",
      "Scientists say ducks are especially susceptible to harboring influenza viruses without being sick, making them common mixing vessels for bird flu strains.",
      "\"Unless you have very tight biosecurity, it is very hard to raise ducks without many low path influenza viruses,\" said Swayne.",
      "Swayne said ducks often need the lowest dose of virus to be infected with bird flu viruses, compared to other poultry, like chickens. One way the virus can spread onto farms is when they are raised outside, mixing with wild ducks.",
      "\"If you look at the natural history, wild ducks are the reservoir of genes for all influenza virus. There's probably an adaptation with the virus. These viruses infect without showing overt clinical disease, they spread very rapidly between the adults to the juveniles,\" said Swayne.",

      "Washington \u2014 Caroline Kennedy, the cousin of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., sent a blistering letter to senators on Tuesday \u2014 a day before his confirmation hearings \u2014 that described him as a \"predator\" whose actions \"have cost lives.\"",
      "In the letter to committee leaders, the former ambassador to Australia urged senators to reject his nomination as health and human services secretary, alleging that he \"preys on the desperation of parents and sick children,\" as well as his own family members.",
      "\"It's no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator,\" the two-page letter said. \"His basement, his garage, and his dorm room were the centers of the action where drugs were available, and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks. It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence.\"",
      "Family members who followed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. down the path of substance abuse, Caroline Kennedy wrote, \"suffered addiction, illness and death, while Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.\"",
      "She also said that while her cousin has discouraged parents from vaccinating their children, he has vaccinated his own.",
      "\"Even before he fills this job, his constant denigration of our health care system and the conspiratorial half-truths he has told about vaccines, including in connection with Samoa's deadly 2019 measles outbreak, have cost lives,\" Caroline Kennedy wrote.",
      "She also read her letter to the senators in a social media post on X.",
      "His \"crusade against vaccination\" serves to enrich him financially, she said. His financial disclosures\u00a0showed\u00a0RFK Jr. still intends to receive legal fees from Wisner Baum, a firm suing the maker of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil over its alleged failure to warn consumers about its risks.",
      "\"In other words,\" she said, \"he is willing to enrich himself by denying access to a vaccine that can prevent almost all forms of cervical cancer and which has been safely administered to millions of boys and girls.\" She went on to say that while she was ambassador to Australia, she learned it was one of the top three cancers afflicting women in a majority of countries.",
      "Caroline Kennedy also excoriated RFK Jr. over his presidential campaign: \"It also wasn't easy to remain silent last year when Bobby expropriated my father's image and distorted President Kennedy's legacy to advance his own failed presidential campaign \u2014 and then groveled to Donald Trump for a job. Bobby continues to grandstand off my father's assassination, and that of his own father. It is incomprehensible that someone who is willing to exploit their own painful family tragedies for publicity would be in charge of American life-and-death situations.\"",

Conservatives groups have expressed concern about his past statements in support of abortion rights, though he has reassured them that he would follow Mr. Trump's promise to defer the issue to states.

    "story": [
      "An Alabama woman passed a major milestone Saturday to become the longest-living recipient of a pig organ transplant \u2013 healthy and full of energy with her new kidney for 61 days and counting.",
      "\"I'm superwoman,\" Towana Looney told The Associated Press, laughing about outpacing family members on long walks around New York City as she continues her recovery. \"It's a new take on life.\"",
      "Looney's vibrant recovery is a morale boost in the quest to make\u00a0animal-to-human transplants a reality. Looney the\u00a0fifth American\u00a0given a\u00a0gene-edited pig organ.",
      "\"If you saw her on the street, you would have no idea that she's the only person in the world walking around with a pig organ inside them that's functioning,\" said Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led Looney's transplant.",
      "Montgomery called Looney's kidney function \"absolutely normal.\" Doctors hope she can leave New York \u2013 where she's temporarily living for post-transplant checkups \u2013 for her Gadsden, Alabama, home in about another month.",
      "\"We're quite optimistic that this is going to continue to work and work well for, you know, a significant period of time,\" he said.",
      "Why scientists are using pig organs for transplants",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike to address a severe shortage of transplantable human organs. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting.",
      "Pig organ transplants so far have been \"compassionate use\" cases, experiments the Food and Drug Administration allows only in special circumstances for people out of other options.",
      "And the handful of hospitals trying them are sharing information of what worked and what didn't, in preparation for the world's first formal studies of xenotransplantation, expected to begin sometime this year. United Therapeutics, which supplied Looney's kidney, recently asked the Food and Drug Administration for permission to begin a trial.",
      "How Looney fares is a \"very precious experience,\" said Dr. Tatsuo Kawai of Massachusetts General Hospital, who led the world's first pig kidney transplant last year and works with another pig developer, eGenesis.",
      "Looney was far healthier than the prior patients, Kawai noted, so her progress will help inform the next attempts.",
      "\"We have to learn from each other,\" he said.",
      "Towana Looney's transplant story",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed, something incredibly rare among living donors. She spent eight years on dialysis before doctors concluded she'd likely never get a donated organ \u2013 she'd developed super-high levels of antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney.",
      "So Looney, 53, sought out the pig experiment. No one knew how it would work in someone \"highly sensitized\" with those overactive antibodies.",
      "Discharged just 11 days after the Nov. 25 surgery, Montgomery's team has closely tracked her recovery through blood tests and other measurements. About three weeks after the transplant, they caught subtle signs that rejection was beginning \u2013 signs they'd learned to look for thanks to a 2023 experiment when a pig kidney worked for 61 days inside a deceased man whose body was donated for research.",
      "Montgomery said they successfully treated Looney and there's been no sign of rejection since \u2013 and a few weeks ago she met the family behind that deceased-body research.",
      "\"It feels really good to know that the decision I made for NYU to use my brother was the right decision and it's helping people,\" said Mary Miller-Duffy, of Newburgh, New York.",
      "Looney in turn is trying to help others, serving as what Montgomery calls an ambassador for people who've been reaching out to her through social media, sharing their distress at the long wait for transplants and wondering about pig kidneys.",
      "One, she said, was being considered for a xenotransplant at another hospital but was scared, wondering whether to proceed.",
      "\"I didn't want to persuade him whether to do or not to do it,\" Looney said.",
      "Instead, she asked if he was religious and urged him to pray, to \"go off your faith, what your heart tells you.\"",
      "\"I love talking to people, I love helping people,\" she added. \"I want to be, like, some educational piece\" for scientists to help others.",
      "There's no way to predict how long Looney's new kidney will work but if it were to fail she could receive dialysis again.",
      "\"The truth is we don't really know what the next hurdles are because this is the first time we've gotten this far,\" Montgomery said. \"We'll have to continue to really keep a close eye on her.\"",

      "More than two years after recalling about 1.7 million Ionic smartwatches sold globally, Google-owned Fitbit will pay a $12.2 million penalty for failing to alert consumers that the products can overheat and cause burns, federal regulators said Thursday.",
      "Fitbit received numerous reports of the lithium-ion batteries in the watches overheating during 2018, 2019 and continuing into 2020, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). In early 2020, Fitbit made an update to address the defect, but continued to hear from people suffering burns and did not report the issue to regulators as legally required.",
      "\"While health-conscious people wore Fitbit Ionic smartwatches to track their fitness, they had no idea that the watches were putting their safety at risk. They didn't know about the hazard because Fitbit said nothing,\" CPSC Commissioner Rich Trumka Jr. said Thursday in a statement.",
      "The CPSC and Fitbit announced a recall of the Ionic smartwatches in March of 2020, saying the company had received 115 reports in the U.S. of the batteries in the devices overheating. Domestic customers reported 78 burn injuries, two involving third-degree burns and four of second-degree burns; another 40 incidents were reported internationally.",
      "Fitbit discontinued production of its Ionic model, which was used to track activity, heart rate and sleep, in 2020.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 22:09:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Many are unclear on how sweeping the federal funding freeze is intended to be. Here are programs it could affect.",
    "story": [
      "A White House memo ordering a broad freeze on federal grants and loans by 5 p.m. Tuesday has ordinary Americans who depend on such aid, as well as seasoned budget experts, scratching their heads.",
      "The memo suspending the federal funding was vague in its wording, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. Adding to the whiplash, a federal judge on Tuesday\u00a0temporarily blocked the freeze\u00a0as she considers arguments from the U.S. government and the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "\"If this was being undertaken pursuant to the executive orders on [diversity, equity and inclusion], why would the administration issue such broad, unclear and confusing directions?\" Tad DeHaven, a policy analyst focusing on economic and fiscal policy issues at the libertarian Cato Institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I don't really understand it, and I think even people who are in positions of power don't really understand it,\" added Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at Brookings, a liberal-leaning public policy research group.",
      "What programs aren't affected by the funding freeze?",
      "The memo, from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), indicated that Social Security and Medicare programs would be exempt from the suspension in federal funding. Additional guidance released Tuesday further specified that \"any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the updated guidance said.",
      "The memo adds that funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance and other similar programs are also exempt.",
      "But even if the order ends up being more narrowly tailored, it could still have serious financial implications for the millions of Americans who receive federal assistance, experts said.",
      "\"If it's resolved quickly, the aggregate economic effects for the first quarter will be modest, but it will matter a whole lot to people on the other side of these expected payments,\" Edelberg said. \"It could be the difference between having a job and not, getting evicted or affording food \u2014 and the economic numbers won't fully reflect how individuals are going to feel this.\"",
      "Here's what to know about who may be affected by the proposed pause in federal funding.",
      "Will I still get SNAP benefits?",
      "The freeze does not apply to all federal financial assistance, according to an Office of Management and Budget memo on Tuesday. The agency indicates that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, better known as food stamps, are excluded, specifying that \"... any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the memo reads.",
      "SNAP serves roughly 41 million low-income Americans.",
      "Yet while the program appears to be exempt from the freeze, \"You are still going to be really worried in the near term whether the federal government is going to make good on those promises,\" Edelberg said. \"And that kind of uncertainty is not good for the economy.\"",
      "Are meals for seniors affected?",
      "The Older Americans Act Nutrition Program, a federal initiative that supports community-based senior nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels, could be affected by the proposed funding pause.",
      "If the order includes the Older Americans Act, it \"would halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" Meals on Wheels said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lack of clarity is creating chaos for Meals on Wheels providers not knowing whether they should be serving meals today.\"",
      "Is housing assistance at risk?",
      "The OMB memo added that rental assistance and other similar programs will not be paused. Still, the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) expressed concern that Department of Housing and Urban Development programs could be covered by the freeze.",
      "\"Even a short pause in funding could cause significant harm to low-income families and their communities,\" NLIHC Interim President and CEO Renee Willis said in a\u00a0statement. \"The longer the freeze continues, the greater the risk that low-income households receiving federal rental assistance could face eviction, and in the worst cases, homelessness \u2014 homeless shelters may be forced to close their doors, and nonprofit organizations may have to lay off staff.\"",
      "Are student loans affected?",
      "The federal funding freeze does not apply to student loans and Pell grants, according to the Department of Education. The funding pause \"only applies to discretionary grants at the Department of Education,\" DOE spokesperson Madi Biedermann said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, an advocate for students with government loans said they are worried about the impact of the freeze.",
      "\"Any kind of freeze to federal financial aid across the board is incredibly harmful to working families just trying to pay for college,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that \"Lots of questions remain about what the freeze applies to and what programs it does not,\"",
      "Meanwhile, many student borrowers rely on different kinds of government assistance to cover costs beyond tuition, Ba\u00f1ez noted.",
      "\"There are other types of federal work-study grants that go directly to colleges and universities, and supplemental education opportunities that go to some of the lowest-income students. People really rely on federal financial aid, and you could see families having to drop out of college or figure out how they will cover this gap,\" she said.",
      "The OMB memo also indicated that Head Start, a preschool program serving nearly 800,000 low-income children that receives federal health funds, is not impacted by the pause.",
      "But the National Head Start Association (NHSA) said that the OMB memo has already \"created panic among Head Start grant recipients who are currently not able to draw down any funds.\"",
      "\"While we understand that this is an evolving story, this disruption, at best, will slow down Head Start agencies' ability to pay hundreds of thousands of staff, contractors, and small businesses who support Head Start operations in every corner of the country,\" NHSA Executive Director Yasmina Vinci said in a statement. \"At worst, this means that hundreds of thousands of families will not be able to depend on the critical services and likely will not be able to work.\"",
      "Despite the updated guidance issued Tuesday stating that programs including Medicaid are excluded from the funding pause, state Medicaid programs on Tuesday\u00a0said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "The White House late Tuesday pointed to an \"outage\" for blocking a range of organizations and agencies from accessing the online systems responsible for tapping federal health dollars.",
      "The Payment Management Services web portal displayed a message reading: \"Due to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments.

      "Only about 6% of federal employees work full-time in office, administration officials said. There are about 2 million federal government employees across the country, which means that the administration expects that as many as 200,000 may take the government's offer.",

      "As Chinese AI application DeepSeek attracts hordes of American users, Trump administration officials, lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are expressing concern that the technology could pose a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, geopolitics and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",

    "summary": "President Trump has painted a bullseye on diversity, equity and inclusion. But what exactly is DEI, and what has it achieved?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government is renewing debate over what DEI is and whether it has benefited workers and companies.",
      "DEI has its roots in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which barred employment discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion and other criteria. In the following decades, a range of policies have sought to root out bias in hiring, promote fairness in the workplace and open career pathways for people of color and for women, while also expanding to include sexual orientation and gender identity.",
      "This push gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, as politicians and social activists pressed companies to do their part in confronting systemic racism. But Mr. Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0order, issued on his first day back in office, criticized DEI as \"illegal and immoral,\" while the following day a memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave.",
      "What is DEI in the workplace?",
      "DEI is often misperceived as focusing only on race, according to DEI experts. But such initiatives comprise many practices that aim to uplift different marginalized groups in the workplace. For example, a policy that accommodates working parents, such as flexible work hours, could qualify as DEI. So could establishing affinity groups based on shared identities, like sexual orientation.",
      "Many critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. Other opponents of the policies go further, arguing that DEI itself promotes racism.",
      "But DEI defenders say that policies that seek to foster diversity and inclusion within organizations aren't in conflict with those that seek to reward the most talented or hardest-working employees.",
      "\"DEI enhances merit by saying, 'How do we find the best people for the job or make sure we are promoting the best people?'\" David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And that means thinking about barriers and biases that might be getting in the way of considering the full talent pool.\"",
      "In defining DEI, Glasgow described \"diversity\" as a commitment to diversifying personnel within an institution so that U.S. workplaces better represent the population at large. \"It's about engaging in effective outreach to places that might be overlooked and making sure hiring and promotion systems aren't screening out women or people of color from being considered,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, when designed and implemented effectively, DEI programs are not discriminatory, according to Jessica Fulton, vice president of Policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit that aims to improve African-Americans' socioeconomic status.",
      "\"These policies don't actually dictate who gets hired. They are ways to open doors to people who might not have access or aren't as well-connected in an industry or occupation,\" she explained.",
      "The equity piece of DEI seeks to level the playing field for groups of workers who have historically been underrepresented in a given field or who, compared with their white or male peers, are underpaid for doing the same work.",
      "\"It could mean making sure women are able to enter traditionally male-dominated occupations, like construction or technology,\" Fulton said. \"It's about addressing issues around equal pay for equal work, making sure people feel safe in the workplace so they don't feel discrimination when they come to work, because workers who don't feel safe are not the most productive.\"",
      "Corporations also commonly aim to develop inclusion policies that help people from diverse backgrounds feel safe within a given workplace and its culture, she explained. They are intended to be, and often are, inclusive of everyone and not just members of marginalized communities, according to Fulton.",
      "\"It is also making sure they can put certain policies in place to make sure their workers stick around and keep working. It is about building a great team and being able to treat that team well and retain the folks they hire,\" Fulton said.",
      "Given the recent backlash against DEI, though, a number of corporations are moving away from such inclusion policies, noting that they could pose a legal risk. That's after many major U.S. employers already ditched their DEI programs in response to pressure from anti-diversity activists. Among them are Ford,\u00a0Harley Davidson,\u00a0McDonald's, Meta and more.",
      "How is success measured?",
      "Many corporate executives have soured on DEI in recent years because of the perception that such policies don't enhance a company's performance, said Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture. Other leaders, while recognizing the value of promoting diversity and inclusion, argue that DEI is inadequate for redressing what are at bottom much broader socioeconomic issues.",
      "Glasgow of NYU Law concedes that it can be hard to determine if DEI programs are succeeding or otherwise clearly assess their outcomes. \"It's difficult to measure certain DEI interventions, like the effectiveness of implicit bias training in the workplace,\" he said. \"It also depends on what you are trying to achieve.\"",
      "One tool employers use to try to gauge the efficacy of DEI policies are internal surveys that ask workers whether they feel like they can be themselves in the office, believe they are respected by their peers, and feel that their opinions matter. When it comes to a company's mentorship and promotion policies, employers will also monitor if members of a particular group of workers, such as veterans and Black employees, are quitting shortly after being hired \u2014 patterns that can yield insights into a workplace's equity and inclusiveness.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:41:02 -0500",
    "summary": "The Fed is expected to hold off on another rate cut at its Jan. 29 meeting. Here's what it means for your finances.",
    "story": [
      "Borrowers hoping for more financial relief from the Federal Reserve may have a wait on their hands, as the central bank is expected to hit the pause button on additional rate cuts at its Jan. 29 meeting.",
      "The Fed is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady on Wednesday at its current range between 4.25% to 4.5%, according to more than 9 in 10 economists polled by financial data site FactSet. Most economists also predict the Fed will hold off on cutting at its March 19 meeting, which means the next rate cut might not occur until the central bank's May 7 meeting, FactSet data shows.",
      "A January pause would mark an end, at least temporarily, to the Fed's flurry of rate cuts that started in September 2024 which have pushed down the federal funds rate by one percentage point. That's helped trim borrowing costs for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other debt, providing some respite to inflation-pinched consumers and businesses.",
      "But in December, the Fed signaled that it expects fewer cuts\u00a0in 2025 than it had earlier projected, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointing to inflation that remains above the central bank's goal of an annual 2% rate. On top of that, economists say it's likely the Fed wants to take a wait-and-see approach to the Trump administration's policies such as adding new tariffs and widespread deportations of immigrants, which could both prove inflationary.",
      "\"The reason why the Fed isn't jumping the gun at lowering the rates faster and further is that, on one hand, inflation is not gone. They looked carefully at the data, and it is still stubbornly above target, so there is concern if you lower rates further, inflation would tick up again,\" Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Secondly, he added, \"Tariffs or mass deportations are expected to be inflationary. For that reason, the Fed is also right to be careful about lowering rates.\"",
      "Here's what to know about a rate pause by the fed.",
      "When does the Fed make its next rate decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will announce its rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Jan. 29, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. EST.",
      "How will a pause on rate cuts impact my money?",
      "The Fed cut its benchmark rate three times last year, kicking off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September. That was followed by two consecutive\u00a00.25 percentage point cuts: one at its November meeting and a second at its December meeting.",
      "But a pause in early 2025 means that consumers can't expect additional near-term relief on borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"Anyone hoping for the Fed to ride in as the cavalry and rescue you from high interest rates anytime soon is going to be really disappointed,\" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, in an email. \"That's true whether you're talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards or most anything else.\"",
      "Because credit card rates and other borrowing costs aren't likely to change, consumers should work on getting their higher-interest debt under control, Schulz added. Turning to a 0% balance transfer credit card or consolidating credit card debt with a personal loan can prove helpful with lowering interest payments, he noted.",
      "If there's a bright side, it's for savers, given that they should still be able to find solid rates on high-yield savings accounts, even though they've declined since the Fed began trimming its benchmark rate last year, Schulz said. Some savings accounts are still paying above 4%, down from about 5% a year ago.",
      "\"Returns on high-yield savings accounts have fallen from their record levels as the Fed has moved to lower rates. However, as the Fed pauses, that decline should slow as well,\" he said.",
      "When will mortgage rates come down?",
      "One of the disappointments for house hunters, as well as homeowners who want to refinance into lower rates, has been stubbornly high mortgage rates. Despite the Fed's three rate cuts last year, the average 30-year home loan remains near 7%, near 25-year highs.",
      "Mortgage rates haven't declined despite the Fed's cuts because home loans are based on a number of factors besides the federal funds rate, including broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "Given concerns from economists that President Trump's plans could prove inflationary, mortgage rates might not come down anytime soon, experts said.",
      "\"The general consensus is that rates will likely remain unchanged until the market has more clarity around potential policy impacts as it relates to immigration, taxes and tariffs,\" noted Austin Walker, CEO of A. Walker & Co., a housing finance company.",
      "Will interest rates go down under President Trump?",
      "Last week at the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would \"demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world.\"",
      "It's unlikely that Mr. Trump could influence the Fed to lower rates, as the central bank is an independent institution that bases its decisions on economic data, rather than orders from elected officials, experts say.",
      "Rates are set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which consists of 12 members \u2014 seven members come from the Fed's Board of Governors; four stem from the eleven Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis, and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Powell, meanwhile, has said he won't step down if Mr. Trump, who has previously criticized Powell's performance, asks him to resign, adding that the president doesn't have the power to fire or demote the Fed chair. His term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "At the same time, economists are forecasting more rate cuts in 2025, but not until May or even later, according to FactSet polling. But one wild card is whether inflation could tick higher in early 2025 due to the Trump administration's policies.",
      "\"Importantly, the outlook is clouded by heightened policy uncertainty as a new administration takes office,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in an email. Daco added he is forecasting three 0.25 percentage point cuts this year \u2014 in March, June and September. \"This year, we expect the Fed will tread carefully.\"",

      "The self-serve condiment bars, home to creamers, milk, sweeteners and stirrers, were removed from Starbucks locations during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Starbucks previously said the return to letting customers do it themselves will help free up baristas to make other drinks.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 12:29:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Chinese startup DeepSeek has debuted an AI app that challenges OpenAI's ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, sending a shock through Wall Street.",
    "story": [
      "A Chinese artificial intelligence company called DeepSeek is grabbing America's attention \u2014 and sending a shock wave through Wall Street \u2014 due to its new tech, which some experts say rivals that of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "DeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according\u00a0to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.",
      "Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "Are there privacy issues with DeepSeek?",
      "Some experts are raising concerns about the personal data that DeepSeek is collecting, given that the company stores data from users \u2014 including their date of birth, keystrokes, text or audio inputs, uploaded files, chat history and other data \u2014 on servers located in China, according to its privacy policy.",
      "That echoes some of the issues raised with TikTok, another company with Chinese ownership that sparked worries about the supposed risks its ties to China posed to national security. Last year, Congress passed a law\u00a0banning\u00a0 TikTok in the U.S. as long as it is under Chinese ownership, although that is now in flux after President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days.",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",
      "Analysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.",
      "What is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.",
      "\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"",
      "But, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"",

According to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election, 100 workers rejected the motion.",

      "The results mark the first successful entry of organized labor into Amazon's grocery business, which includes Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and the Amazon Go convenience stores. Amazon, which purchased Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion, has tried to fend off organizing efforts in its stores as well as by delivery drivers and warehouse workers.",
      "Nearly three years ago, Amazon warehouse workers in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to be represented in labor negotiations by a fledgling union that has since affiliated with the Teamsters. But Amazon has refused to come to the bargaining table.",
      "Employees at the Whole Foods store, located in the center of Philadelphia, started organizing early last year, Young said. They teamed up with UFCW Local 1776 in the late summer, and in November petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold an official election.",
      "The local union said the store workers hoped a successful vote would help them secure higher wages, more affordable health care coverage, child care support, greater work-life balance and better working conditions.",

      "The company said it provides store employees with a competitive average hourly wage and other benefits, such as 401(k) plans and \"on-demand\" mental health support. It did not disclose its average hourly rate, but some online job postings show store employees can earn $16 per hour or higher.",
      "After the union filed the election petition, workers at the Philadelphia store were given free snacks, and the company repainted their break rooms, according to Young.",

    "story": [
      "The Japanese network Fuji Television and its parent company said Monday that its president and chairperson were resigning immediately to take responsibility for a widening sex assault scandal linked to one of Japan's top TV celebrities.",
      "The scandal centers on Masahiro Nakai, a former leader of Japan's once-hugely popular boy band SMAP, and his costly settlement with a woman over the alleged sex assault at a 2023 dinner party that Fuji TV staff allegedly helped to organize.",
      "The allegations surfaced in magazine articles in December and have since triggered claims of systematic cover-ups by Fuji TV executives. The public outrage over the lack of transparency and explanation at the network's news conference earlier this month have led to an avalanche of advertising losses at Fuji, one of the networks where Nakai worked.",
      "Fuji Television Network President Koichi Minato said his company mishandled the case.",
      "\"We are very sorry that we mishandled the case because of our lack of awareness about human rights and corporate governance ... and as a result our responses to the involved woman were inadequate,\" Minato said. \"We are very sorry to have destroyed our credibility.\"",
      "Car manufacturers Nissan and Toyota were among the companies that pulled advertising from Fuji TV, BBC News reported.",
      "Minato said the case violated the woman's human rights, without providing details on grounds of privacy. He said it was handled as an \"extraordinary\" case requiring maximum confidentiality and sensitivity for the woman's mental health and was shared by a small group of officials. The company had continued allowing Nakai to appear on Fuji shows for a year and six months, he said, but denied covering up the case because it involved a big star.",
      "Minato said he did not think what happened was sexual assault and that the case was not reported to the company's compliance office until the magazine report came out.",
      "He also denied a Fuji TV employee's involvement but said allegations that the employee had previously organized barbecue and other parties for Nakai needed to be investigated.",
      "Fuji officials also acknowledged that female announcers and other female employees have in the past participated at parties for stars, talent agency executives and sponsors, though they denied any sexual services. Minato said he believed top officials were complacent about the outdated gender roles and they now need to \"update their mindset.\"",
      "Nakai last Thursday announced his retirement from show business\u00a0in Japan, which has already been hit by a series of sexual assault allegations in recent years in what is seen as a delayed #MeToo movement that began in Western nations in the 2010s. He said he was taking responsibility for the \"trouble\" and massive business losses as a result.",
      "\"I alone am responsible for everything\" and \"sincerely apologize,\" Nakai said.",
      "He had previously issued a statement saying some of what had been reported was \"different from the facts.\"",
      "Minato said he last saw the woman last summer when she visited his office to tell him she was quitting.",
      "Shukan Bunshun weekly, one of the magazines that exposed the scandal, also alleged that Fuji TV has long exploited its female announcers to entertain stars like Nakai.",
      "The chair of the companies, Shuji Kanoh, was also resigning in a decision made at a board meeting prior to the Jan. 17 news conference, officials said.",
      "Japan's entertainment industry is in the midst of a wave of sexual assault cases, including the abuses of hundreds of boys and young men by late talent mogul Johnny Kitagawa, whose now-defunct agency Johnny & Associates managed many boy bands, including the one to which Nakai belonged.",
      "One of Japan's most popular comedians, 61-year-old Hitoshi Matsumoto, has also been accused of sexual assault by two women.",
      "Following massive protests and criticism from even their own employees, Fuji TV and its parent company announced after a board meeting last week that they have set up an independent panel of lawyers to be submitted by March.",

    "story": [
      "Perplexity AI has presented a new proposal to TikTok's parent company that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "The proposal, submitted last week, is a revision of a prior plan the artificial intelligence startup had presented to TikTok's parent ByteDance on Jan. 18, a day before the law that bans TikTok went into effect.",
      "The first proposal, which ByteDance hasn't responded to, sought to create a new structure that would merge San Francisco-based Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business and include investments from other investors.",
      "The new proposal would allow the U.S. government to own up to half of that new structure once it makes an initial public offering of at least $300 billion, said the person, who was not authorized to speak about the proposal. The person said Perplexity's proposal was revised based off of feedback from the Trump administration.",
      "If the plan is successful, the shares owned by the government would not have voting power, the person said. The government also would not get a seat on the new company's board.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Under the plan, ByteDance would not have to completely cut ties with TikTok, a favorable outcome for its investors. But it would have to allow a \"full U.S. board control,\" the person said.",
      "Under the proposal, the China-based tech company would contribute TikTok's U.S. business without the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app, according to a document seen by the Associated Press.",
      "The proposal seems to mirror a strategy Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary during President Donald Trump's first term, discussed Sunday on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures \u2014 that a new investor in TikTok could simply \"dilute down\" the Chinese ownership and satisfy the law. Mnuchin has previously expressed interest in investing in the company.",
      "\"But the technology needs to be disconnected from China,\" he added. \"It needs to be disconnected from ByteDance. There's absolutely no way that China would ever let us have something like that in China.\"",
      "The Perplexity proposal comes as several investors are expressing interest in TikTok. Mr. Trump said late Saturday that he expects a deal will be made in as soon as 30 days.",
      "On\u00a0a flight from Las Vegas to Miami on Air Force One, Mr. Trump also said he hadn't discussed a deal with Larry Ellison, CEO of software maker Oracle, despite\u00a0a report\u00a0that Oracle, along with outside investors, was considering taking over TikTok's global operation.",
      "\"Numerous people are talking to me. Very substantial people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary. ... I'd only do it if the United States benefits.\"",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, TikTok was to be banned in the United States by Jan. 19 if it did not cut ties with ByteDance. The Supreme Court upheld the law, but Mr. Trump then issued an executive order to halt enforcement of the law for 75 days.",
      "Mr. Trump, on Air Force One, noted that Ellison lives \"right down the road\" from his Mar-a-Lago estate, but added, \"I never spoke to Larry about TikTok. I've spoken to many people about TikTok and there's great interest in TikTok.\"",
      "TikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. a week ago, but went back online after Mr. Trump said he would postpone the ban. Mr. Trump had unsuccessfully attempted a U.S. ban of the platform during his first term. But he has since reversed his position and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters during last year's presidential election.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Mr. Trump's inauguration Jan. 20, along with some other tech leaders who've been forging friendlier ties with the new administration.",
      "Congress voted to ban TikTok in the U.S. out of concern that TikTok's ownership structure represented a security risk. The Biden administration argued in court for months that it was too much of a risk to allow a Chinese company to control the algorithm that fuels what people see on the app. Officials also raised concerns about user data collected on the platform.",
      "However, to date, the U.S. hasn't provided public evidence of TikTok handing user data to Chinese authorities or allowing them to tinker with its algorithm.",

    "summary": "President Trump revoked a 1965 rule that prohibited federal contractors from discriminating against employees or job applicants.",
    "story": [
      "Among the flurry of executive orders since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Donald Trump has taken aim at\u00a0rooting out diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs within the federal government. But his efforts go beyond DEI, with one recent order rescinding a Civil Rights-era rule that has helped protect millions of workers from discrimination.",
      "Mr. Trump's Jan. 21\u00a0order \u2014 \"Ending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity\" \u2014 revokes the\u00a0Equal Employment Opportunity\u00a0rule signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u2014 which is still law today \u2014 had a loophole that excluded federal employees.",
      "Johnson signed the Equal Employment Opportunity rule to close the loophole, and those protections were signed into law in 1972. That rule bars federal contractors, who today employ 3.7 million people, from discriminating against job applicants or workers on the basis of race, gender, religion and other protected characteristics. It also gave the Labor Department the authority to take action against discrimination.",
      "Mr. Trump's order does not invalidate the law, and private and federal employees are still protected from discrimination as laid out under the Civil Rights Act. But his order does strike down the 1965 rule prohibiting contractors that do business with the government from taking race, gender and the other protected criteria into account.",
      "More broadly, revoking the 60-year-old Equal Employment Opportunity order eliminates a bedrock of civil rights protection for American workers, signaling an effort to target workplace issues that go beyond DEI, labor experts say. While DEI is shorthand for programs that encourage equality in the workplace for women, minorities and other groups, the Equal Employment Opportunity rule prohibited federal contractors from engaging in acts of discrimination, such as refusing to hire someone due to their race or paying an employee less because of their gender.",
      "\"It is still stunning to me that he took such an extraordinary step,\" said Fatima Goss Graves, CEO of the National Women's Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on gender justice. Revoking the rule signals \"he is going after something bigger: the basic and foundational idea that we should be able to work at workplaces without discrimination.\"",
      "She added, \"We agreed to that 60 years ago, and I'll add that people in this country support it, too.\"",
      "What was the Equal Employment Opportunity rule?",
      "The rule required federal contractors to \"take affirmative action\" to ensure that workers aren't discriminated against based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin. This covered everything from hiring to promotions and pay, with the Department of Labor tasked with overseeing and enforcing the rule.",
      "How does revoking the rule impact protections for workers?",
      "It's still illegal under U.S. law for employers to discriminate on the basis of race, gender or other traits, labor experts said.",
      "But rescinding the Equal Employment Opportunity rule could have a chilling effect on cases where workers at federal contractors allege they have been treated unfairly and could impact the Department of Labor's ability to pursue workplace discrimination cases, Josh Boxerman, government affairs manager at the National Employment Law Project, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Taking away this set of tools puts workers at a disadvantage,\" he added.",
      "Does this have an impact on private employers?",
      "While the Equal Employment Opportunity rule focuses on federal contractors, Mr. Trump's executive orders could spill over to private employers, said Alex Hontos, a partner at law firm Dorsey & Whitney and expert on government contracting.",
      "\"It's not just about government contractors and grantees,\" Hontos said. \"It is clearly a stepwise approach and is going to apply to the private sector. You see that at the back end of the [executive order], where attorneys general have been directed to put a plan together to either call out private-sector companies that are involved in DEI or to actually seek enforcement actions in some way.\"",
      "Even before Mr. Trump's orders banning DEI from federal agencies, corporations, including Meta,\u00a0Ford,\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart, have been stepping back from these programs. Those decisions followed a 2023 Supreme Court decision\u00a0banning affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservative political activists.",
      "Why is President Trump banning DEI and revoking the Equal Employment Opportunity rule?",
      "Mr. Trump's aim is to restore what the administration considers to be a merit-based hiring system, according to officials and his executive orders.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States to protect the civil rights of all Americans and to promote individual initiative, excellence and hard work,' the president wrote in the order to revoke the 1965 rule.",
      "DEI policies, he wrote, have led to \"illegal, pernicious discrimination that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing.\"",
      "Numerous lawsuits have taken aim at DEI programs, with some alleging that the policies discriminate against people who aren't minorities or that they violate some workers' rights to free speech, among other allegations,\u00a0according to New York University's Meltzer Center.",
      "\"The Trump administration isn't getting rid of the concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion as they are typically understood,\" a viewpoint from Erec Smith, research fellow at the Cato Institute and co-founder of Free Black Thought, a nonprofit dedicated to highlighting viewpoint diversity within Black communities. \"He's getting rid of the critical social justice version, which is inherently divisive.\"",
      "The order sends a clear message that the Trump administration does not support such initiatives.",
      "What will happen with DEI programs?",
      "DEI programs are being scrubbed from the federal government, according to the Trump administration's directives.",
      "All federal employees in DEI roles were placed on leave by 5 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday. Agencies were also told to \"take down all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) of DEIA [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility] offices\"; cancel upcoming DEI trainings; and terminate contracts with DEI-related contractors by the same time Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's Jan. 21 executive order requires federal agencies to come up with \"up to nine potential civil compliance investigations\" of publicly traded companies, large nonprofits and other private institutions with DEI programs that \"constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.\"",
      "That part of the executive order \"seems to be an attempt to intimidate the private sector,\" NELP's Boxerman said of the requirement to pursue civil investigations in the private sector. \"This seems to be a clear effort to name and shame companies that are doing the right thing,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:20:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Republican lawmakers are floating a range of ideas to pay for an extension of President Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.",
    "story": [
      "A key economic priority for President Trump this year is to extend the provisions in his signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a 2017 law that lowered tax rates for most Americans, before they expire at the end of 2025. Now, Republican lawmakers have developed a 50-page laundry list of ideas for how to pay for those planned cuts.",
      "The plan from congressional Republicans,\u00a0published earlier by the New York Times, was confirmed by a person familiar with the document, who noted that it represents a menu of policy options for lawmakers to consider. The document also cites several new tax breaks proposed by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail last falls, such as eliminating taxes on overtime and tips.",
      "But extending the TCJA's provisions alone could prove costly, with the Congressional Budget Office forecasting a cost of $4.6 trillion over 10 years. Adding new tax breaks, such as Mr. Trump's promise to ditch taxes on overtime pay, could push up the bill even higher at a time when the nation's debt has spiraled to more than $36 trillion.",
      "According to the document, some ideas for funding those tax breaks include eliminating the mortgage home deduction, a popular break for homeowners, and the deductibility of student loan interest. Other methods to drum up more money include an across-the-board 10% import tariff \u2014 essentially, a universal tax on U.S. imports that would be paid by consumers.",
      "The plan also outlines ideas for cutting federal spending, primarily by trimming outlays for social safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. Overall, the document points to a potential tax overhaul that could put more money in the pockets of wealthier \u00a0Americans while cutting assistance for low- and middle-class taxpayers, experts say.",
      "\"If you are extending the tax cuts and enacting tariffs and cutting Medicaid, that will deliver benefits more among higher-income households, and more of a cost will be born by lower-income households,\" Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a tax-focused think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Adding a blanket 10% tariff could raise $1.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the document shared with Republican lawmakers. But tariffs are largely paid by consumers because companies tend to raise their prices to cover the extra import duties. Mr. Trump's tariffs could add $2,600 a year in costs for the typical U.S. family, according to an August\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic issues.",

      "Economic losses from hurricanes and other natural disasters soared in the U.S. last year and were above average globally, reflecting another year of costly severe storms, floods and droughts.",
      "Damage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton helped push total economic losses from natural disasters in the U.S. to $217.8 billion last year, according to insurance broker Aon PLC. That figure represents an 85.3% increase from 2023, when losses totaled about $117.5 billion. It's also the largest annual tally of economic losses from natural disasters since 2017.",
      "Insured losses, or the portion of economic losses that are covered by insurance, also rose last year. They climbed 36% to $112.7 billion, the most since 2022. In some areas, homes are such great a risk that they're\u00a0too expensive to insure \u2014 if private insurance is even available at all.",
      "Hurricane Helene tore across six southeastern states last fall, costing $75 billion in economic losses, mainly due to inland and coastal flooding. according to Aon. Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton made landfall on the west coast of Florida, causing some $25 billion in economic losses.",
      "\"In 2024, one of the big differences is we had significant U.S. hurricane events that happened,\" said Liz Henderson, global head of climate risk advisory at Aon. \"When those events happen, they affect a large area and they affect areas with large values in terms of properties and people and content. So the losses from those events tend to be significantly higher.\"",
      "At least two other hurricanes, several severe \"convective\" storms and a draught contributed to the losses from natural disasters in the U.S. last year.",
      "In addition to the severe storms in the U.S., deadly floods in the Valencia region of Spain and other natural disasters drove worldwide economic losses from natural disasters to $368 billion last year, according to Aon. That's a 7.3% decline from 2023, but about 14% higher than the annual average going back to 2000. Global insured losses, meanwhile, climbed 15.1% to $145 billion.",
      "While it's impossible to predict the timing, location and losses from natural disasters, 2025 is not off to an encouraging start. The devastating wildfires that erupted in Los Angeles County on Jan. 7, killing at least 28 people and destroying more than 14,000 structures, are already projected to be among the costliest natural disasters.",
      "In a separate report last week, Aon estimated that total economic and insured losses for the two largest wildfires \u2014 the Palisades fire and the Eaton blaze burning just outside Los Angeles \u2014 could reach into the lower tens of billions of dollars, likely making them the costliest wildfires in U.S. history.",

      "Costco shareholders voted down a shareholder proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices.",
      "According to preliminary results shared by Costco executives at its annual meeting Thursday, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal.",
      "In a pre-recorded statement which was played at Costco's 2025 annual shareholders meeting on Jan. 23, the shareholder proposing the anti-DEI resolution, The National Center for Public Policy Research, said that \"Diversity, equity and inclusion may sound benign on the surface, but in reality it is weaponized language concealing a radical Marxist agenda.\"",
      "The shareholder continued to say that DEI \"comes at the expense of merit by not hiring and promoting completely, irrespective of race and sex.\"",
      "Prior to the shareholder meeting, Costco's board of directors had voted unanimously to ask investors to reject the motion. The board had said it believes \"our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary. The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information.\"",
      "Costco's defense of its DEI practices comes as other large U.S. corporations are shifting away from programs that encourage equality in the workplace for women, minorities and other groups. In recent weeks, companies including\u00a0Meta,\u00a0Ford,\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart\u00a0have ended their DEI programs, decisions that follow the 2023 Supreme Court decision\u00a0banning affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservative political activists.",
      "\"Our commitment to inclusion ... does not and has never included quotas or systematic preferences, nor does it mean compromising merit,\" said Tony E. James, Costco's board chair, said at Thursday's meeting. \"The demands of our business and our steadfast commitment to serve our members mean that we cannot afford to do anything but hire and promote the most qualified individuals,\"",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank based in Washington, had earlier submitted a\u00a0proposal\u00a0asking Costco to examine the risks of its DEI program, arguing that such initiatives hold \"litigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders.\"",
      "The think tank, which has made a similar proposal to Apple, cited the U.S. Supreme Court decision in July 2023 that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions.",
      "Costco: Diversity fosters \"creativity and innovation\"",
      "The directors' message to shareholders details how having diverse employees and suppliers has, in their view, fostered \"creativity and innovation in the merchandise and services that we offer\" and led to greater customer satisfaction among Costco members.",
      "In advance of the meeting, Neil Saunders, managing director of consulting firm GlobalData's retail division, said Costco could be confident the proposal would be rejected.",
      "\"I think people generally have confidence in Costco's management, and there's an attitude of 'Why rock the boat? It's sailing very nicely,'\" Saunders said.",
      "Costco's public stance in support of diversity, equity and inclusion programs contrasts with the positions taken in recent months by other big consumer brands that have backed away from DEI. Last week, more than 30 Walmart shareholders, including Amalgamated Bank and Oxfam America, asked the CEO of the nation's largest retailer to explain the business impact of curbing the company's DEI policies, a move they called \"disheartening.\"",
      "Emboldened by the Supreme Court's decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "On Monday, Trump signed an executive order aimed at terminating DEI programs within federal agencies. Conservatives have long condemned them, arguing they violate the U.S. Constitution by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation.",
      "The Trump administration's plan includes leveraging the Justice Department and other agencies to probe private companies pursuing training and hiring practices that conservative critics consider discriminatory against people who do not belong to minority groups, such as white men.",
      "Costco's financial performance",
      "As for Costco, the National Center for Public Policy Research alleged that at least 200,000 of the company's 300,000 employees worldwide \"are potentially victims of this type of illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight.\" If only a fraction of those employees were to sue Costco, the legal costs could be significant, the center said.",
      "Costco has a chief diversity officer, but the company's executive ranks do not reflect the diversity of its customers. Nearly 81% of the executives Costco had in place last year were white, and 72% of them were men, according to data published on its website. Saunders said members of Costco's management team typically stay a long time given the company's solid and stable financial performance.",
      "The warehouse giant's sales rose 7.5% in its most recent quarter versus the year-earlier period, while net income jumped 13% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, Costco's stock has soared about 36% during the past 12 months, outpacing the S&P 500's 26% gain over the same period.",
      "In other ways, Costco has been a bit of a maverick in the corporate world. It doesn't have an official corporate public relations team, and it hasn't focused on building up online business as much as rivals Walmart and Target.",
      "Apple's support of DEI",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research intends to present a proposal at Apple's Feb. 25 shareholder meeting that goes beyond what the think tank wants from Costco. The center's resolution asks the tech company to abolish its inclusion and equity department, policies and goals, describing them as \"consistent with, if not more radical than, most corporate DEI programs.",
      "Apple's board wants shareholders to vote down the proposal, saying the company strives \"to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\"",
      "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon this week joined the corporate leaders taking a stand in support of the expanded diversity goals some companies added after the 2020 police killing of George Floyd. Dimon defended his bank's DEI policies during an interview with CNBC.",

      "\"We are essentially a paycheck-to-paycheck nation,\" Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick said in a statement. \"Fewer Americans have the equivalent of a financial safety net to cover inevitable unexpected expenses, despite low unemployment and steady growth. This is one of the consequences of elevated prices stemming from inflation, the impacts of which are still being felt.\"",
      "A key issue in the 2024 presidential election, inflation and the rising\u00a0cost of everyday items\u00a0continues to impact Americans. Grocery inflation during the height of the coronavirus epidemic reached a\u00a0peak of 13.5% in 2022, while the overall rate of inflation for all products and services topped out at 9.1%.",
      "Although inflation has cooled to an annual rate of 2.9% as of December, prices for food, shelter and many other items remain elevated. Consumers also have found that many common products, from snacks to paper towels, have gotten smaller, a retailing tactic\u00a0known as \"shrinkflation\u00a0aimed at cutting a manufacturer's costs.",
      "In his Jan. 20 inaugural speech, President Trump said he would direct his cabinet \"to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.\"",
      "Whether the Trump administration can engineer such a feat remains to be seen, while polls suggest that many Americans are skeptical that prices will return to earth. Economists also warn that Mr. Trump's policies, which could include steep new tariffs on U.S. imports and the deportation millions of undocumented immigrants, could prove inflationary.",
      "Younger Americans worry most",
      "To be sure, the meteoric rise in the cost of food, housing and health care over the past several years has made it hard for many households to make ends meet, let alone save money. Bankrate's survey shows that 73% of Americans said they're saving less for unexpected expenses, compared with 68% in 2024.",
      "\"Though inflation is no longer rising as quickly as it did in recent years, more people this year feel the economy has affected their savings,\" according to the Bankrate report.",
      "Younger Americans tend to have the strongest concerns about their savings. A whopping 80% of Gen Zers worry about being able to cover immediate expenses if they were to suddenly lose their primary source of income, compared with 72% for Millennials and Gen Xers. Some 58% of Baby Boomers say they regularly fret about having enough money put away, a particular concern given that many are already retired.",
      "Borrower nation",
      "Only 41% of Americans said they would be able to tap their savings to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense, according to Bankrate's report. That's down 3% from 2024 and the lowest the percentage since 2021 (39%)",
      "Another 25% said they would use a credit card to pay for a $1,000 bill, 13% said they would turn to a family member for the money and 5% said they would take out a personal loan. In total, about 43% of respondents told Bankrate they would have to borrow money to pay for an emergency expense of $1,000.",
      "That's a concern given consumers collectively owe a record $1.14 trillion in credit card debt, figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u00a0show. Meanwhile, credit card rates continue to soar, hovering round 24%.",
      "\"The cost of living continues to rise, prompting more individuals and households to turn to credit cards when in a bind,\" Hamrick said. \"They are a terrific tool when used wisely and effectively. But with interest rates still high, we need to avoid a deepening debt burden which could make it more challenging to save.\"",
      "Another 13% of Americans said they would pay for a surprise $1,000 debt by curbing their spending, On a positive note, while 36% of adults said their credit card debt exceeded what they had in emergency savings, Bankrate found that more than half of survey respondents, at 55%, had more emergency savings in 2024 than credit card debt. That's the highest percentage since 2018.",
      "Asked how much they have in emergency savings, 28% of respondents said they had enough to cover six months of expenses; 16% said they had enough to cover three to five months; 29% had enough to cover less than three months' worth of bills; and 27% said they had no emergency savings at all.",
      "Tips for saving now",
      "For people who consider themselves among the roughly one-third of Americans who want to reduce their debt and boost their emergency savings in 2025, Bankrate offers three tips:",
      "Calculate how much you need to save.\u00a0As a general target, experts recommend saving three to six months' worth of expenses in case of emergencies. To figure out how much to put away, add the total amount you spend each month on food, housing, gas and other bills. So if your monthly bills amount to $2,000 a month, you'll need $6,000 in savings to stay afloat in case of an emergency, such as a job loss.",
      "Open a savings account just for emergencies.\u00a0Opening an online savings account, money market account, money market mutual fund or a separate savings account with your existing bank or credit union can help you save for unexpected emergencies.",
      "Open a savings account just for emergencies.\u00a0Opening an online savings account, money market account, money market mutual fund or a separate savings account with your existing bank or credit union can help you save for unexpected emergencies.",

      "As interest rates climbed, major banks charged borrowers more for mortgages and auto loans, yet never increased payouts to savers, despite telling lawmakers they would do so, say two U.S. senators in letters to seven CEOs, shared exclusively with CBS News.",
      "In March 2022, the Federal Reserve started raising the federal funds rate, with banks following suit by hiking rates for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. But those increases were not matched with high interest rate payouts on savings accounts at banks including Bank of America, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, PNC Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo, according to the lawmakers.",
      "\"This tactic \u2014 charging borrowers more, paying savers a little, and pocketing interest paid by the Federal Reserve \u2014 has enabled U.S. banks to rake in record profits of $1 trillion and JPMorgan alone to make record profits of $49.6 billion in 2023,\" according to Sens.

    "summary": "The Sackler family will pay the vast majority of the settlement \u2014 a total of $6.5 billion over 15 years.",
    "story": [
      "The Sackler family and Purdue Pharma, the maker of the addictive painkiller oxycontin, have reached a $7.4 billion settlement with a bipartisan coalition of 15 states for fueling the opioid crisis, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Thursday.",
      "The settlement bars the Sackler family from selling opioids in the U.S. and ends its control of Purdue. This comes seven months after the Supreme Court overturned a prior deal with Purdue that would have given the Sackler family immunity from future opioid lawsuits, a provision that is not part of the new deal.",
      "This is the largest settlement with contributors to the opioid crisis in the U.S. The Sackler family will pay the vast majority of the settlement \u2014 a total of $6.5 billion over 15 years \u2014 while Purdue will pay nearly $900 million up front, if it's approved by the court.",
      "Over half of the settlement will be distributed over the first few years, including almost $3 billion from the Sacklers. The Sacklers will make a $1.5 billion initial payment, adding another $500 million after one year, $500 million after two years and the remaining $400 million after three years.",
      "The funds will go to communities nationwide to support opioid addiction treatment, prevention and recovery programs over the next 15 years.",
      "\"Families throughout New York and across the nation are suffering from the immense pain and loss wrought by the opioid crisis,\" James said in a release announcing the settlement Thursday. \"The Sackler family relentlessly pursued profit at the expense of vulnerable patients and played a critical role in starting and fueling the opioid epidemic. While no amount of money will ever fully repair the damage they caused, this massive influx of funds will bring resources to communities in need so that we can heal.\"",
      "\"The Sacklers' no longer have control of Purdue will never be allowed to sell opioids in the United States again,\" she added.",
      "The deal leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids. The states involved in the settlement will appoint a board of trustees to oversee the company and determine its future.",
      "The previous Purdue bankruptcy settlement was struck down by the Supreme Court in June 2024. In a 5-4 decision, the justices said that Sackler family members could not be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic. The original settlement would have required the Sacklers and Purdue to pay over $4.5 billion.",
      "\"Hundreds of millions of dollars that would have gone to victims was stuck, and we had to go back to square one,\" said Cheryl Juaire, a mother who lost two sons to opioid addiction, at a press conference with James announcing the settlement.",
      "\"Three and a half years ago, in the midst of this case, I lost my second son Sean, also to an overdose. I buried him in the midst of an ongoing mediation,\" she said. \"I truly hope that no one ever has to feel the devastation I have felt in losing two of my three children.\"",
      "Juaire noted that the new deal is \"even more than the original deal\" but emphasized that \"this will only happen if the parties that stood in the way the last time will not do so again.\"",
      "James has secured up to $250 million for New York from the settlement to support opioid treatment and recovery programs. She negotiated the settlement along with attorney generals from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.",

    "story": [
      "More than two years after recalling about 1.7 million Ionic smartwatches sold globally, Google-owned Fitbit will pay a $12.2 million penalty for failing to alert consumers that the products can overheat and cause burns, federal regulators said Thursday.",
      "Fitbit received numerous reports of the lithium-ion batteries in the watches overheating during 2018, 2019 and continuing into 2020, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). In early 2020, Fitbit made an update to address the defect, but continued to hear from people suffering burns and did not report the issue to regulators as legally required.",
      "\"While health-conscious people wore Fitbit Ionic smartwatches to track their fitness, they had no idea that the watches were putting their safety at risk. They didn't know about the hazard because Fitbit said nothing,\" CPSC Commissioner Rich Trumka Jr. said Thursday in a statement.",
      "The CPSC and Fitbit announced a recall of the Ionic smartwatches in March of 2020, saying the company had received 115 reports in the U.S. of the batteries in the devices overheating. Domestic customers reported 78 burn injuries, two involving third-degree burns and four of second-degree burns; another 40 incidents were reported internationally.",
      "Fitbit discontinued production of its Ionic model, which was used to track activity, heart rate and sleep, in 2020.",

      "About 1 million of the recalled smartwatches were sold in the U.S. at retailers including Best Buy, Kohl's and Target, as well as online at Amazon.com and Fitbit.com from September 2017 through December 2021.

    "summary": "The order directs that federally-run insurance programs, including TRICARE and Medicaid, exclude coverage for gender-affirming care for those under 19.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order aimed at cutting federal support for certain types of gender-affirming care for people under age 19, his latest move to roll back protections for transgender people across the country.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\" the order says.",
      "The order covers gender-affirming care that includes puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy and surgical procedures.",
      "The order directs that federally-run insurance programs, including TRICARE for military families and Medicaid, exclude coverage for such care and calls on the Department of Justice to vigorously pursue litigation and legislation to oppose the practice.",
      "Medicaid programs in some states cover gender-affirming care. The new order suggests that the practice could end, and targets hospitals and universities that receive federal money and provide the care.",
      "The language in the executive order \u2014 using words such as \"maiming,\" \"sterilizing\" and \"mutilation\" \u2014 contradicts what is typical for gender-affirming care in the United States. It also labels guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health as \"junk science.\"",
      "On his Truth Social platform, Mr. Trump called gender-affirming care \"barbaric medical procedures.\"",
      "Major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics support access to care.",
      "Young people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth are first evaluated by a team of professionals. Some may try a social transition, involving changing a hairstyle or pronouns. Some may later also receive puberty blockers or hormones. Surgery is extremely rare for minors.",
      "\"It is deeply unfair to play politics with people's lives and strip transgender young people, their families and their providers of the freedom to make necessary health care decisions,\" said Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson.",
      "The order encourages Congress to adopt a law allowing those who receive gender-affirming care and come to regret it, or their parents, to sue the providers.",
      "It also directs the Justice Department to prioritize investigating states that protect access to gender-affirming care and \"facilitate stripping custody from parents\" who oppose the treatments for their children. Some Democratic-controlled states have adopted laws that seek to protect doctors who provide gender-affirming care to patients who travel from states where it's banned for minors.",
      "Lambda Legal promised swift legal action.",
      "Michel Lee Garrett, a trans woman whose teenage child only partially identifies as a girl and uses they/them pronouns, said such policies aim to erase trans people from public life but will never succeed. Her child has not elected to pursue a medical transition, but the mother from State College, Pennsylvania, said she won't stop fighting to preserve that option for her child and others.",
      "\"I'll always support my child's needs, regardless of what policies may be in place or what may come ... even if it meant trouble for me,\" Lee Garrett said.",
      "For Howl Hall, an 18-year-old first-year student at Eastern Washington University, taking testosterone not only changed his body but dramatically improved his experience with depression. With that treatment now under threat, Hall said he's concerned that getting off testosterone would hurt his mental health.",

      "The push is the latest by Mr. Trump to reverse Biden administration policies protecting transgender people and their care. On Monday, Mr. Trump directed the Pentagon to conduct a review that is likely to lead to them being barred from military service.",
      "That order's language stated that identifying as a gender that is \"inconsistent\" with one's biological sex \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life\" and that soldiers who do so \"cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\"",
      "A group of active-duty military personnel sued over the executive order Tuesday.",
      "SPARTA Pride, a nonprofit organization for trans service members and veterans, released a\u00a0statement\u00a0saying: \"Transgender service members have been serving openly for almost ten years, and currently fill critical roles in every branch and specialty, including infantry, aviation, nuclear engineering, law enforcement, and military intelligence, many requiring years of specialized training and expertise. ... The readiness and physical capabilities of transgender service members is not different from that of other service members.\"",
      "Hours after taking office last week, Mr. Trump signed another order that seeks to define sex as only male or female, not recognizing transgender, nonbinary or intersex people or the idea that gender can be fluid. Already that's resulted in the State Department halting issuing passports with an \"X\" gender marker, forcing transgender people to apply for travel documents with markers that don't match their identities.",
      "Mr. Trump said he would address these issues during his campaign last year, and his actions could prove widely divisive.",
      "In the November election, voters were slightly more likely to oppose than support laws that ban gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, for minors under the age of 18 who identify as transgender, according to AP VoteCast. About half of voters, 52%, were opposed, but 47% said they were in favor.",
      "Mr. Trump's voters were much more likely to support bans on transgender care: About 6 in 10 Trump voters favored such laws.",
      "\"It's very clear that this order, in combination with the other orders that we've seen over the past week, are meant to not protect anyone in this country, but rather to single-mindedly drive out transgender people of all ages from all walks of civic life,\" said Harper Seldin, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBTQ & HIV Project.",
      "Seldin said the ACLU is reviewing the order \"to understand what, if anything, has immediate effect versus what needs to go through continued agency action.\"",
      "Even as transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance on some fronts, they've become major targets for social conservatives. In recent years, at least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. Most of those states face lawsuits, including one over Tennessee's ban that's pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Republican-controlled states have also moved to keep transgender women and girls from competing in women's or girls' sports and to dictate which bathrooms transgender people can use, particularly in schools.",

      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters late Tuesday that \"staff have been given a template for waiver requests.\"",
      "Rubio, later on Tuesday, then issued a waiver to his own foreign assistance pause. In a second memo provided to CBS by a senior administration official, Rubio stated the waiver applies to \"life-saving humanitarian assistance\", which he defined as \"life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance.\"",
      "The memo also stated, \"Implementers of existing life-saving humanitarian assistance programs should continue or resume work if they have stopped.\"",
      "The new waiver does not apply to \"activities that involve abortions, family planning conferences, gender or DEl ideology programs, transgender surgeries, or other non-life saving assistance,\" per the memo.",
      "The State Department has not yet provided clarification on whether some U.S.-funded foreign aid programs are now automatically exempt as a result of Rubio's new waiver, or whether all programs globally must still apply for a waiver in order to opt back into receiving U.S. funding.",
      "It is not immediately clear how this new waiver will impact those whose employment has already been terminated.",
      "In the copy of Rubio's initial order obtained by CBS News last Friday, he told all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts to immediately issue \"stop-work\" orders \"for existing foreign assistance awards,\" pending review by the Secretary of State.",
      "Rubio had also stated in his initial order that \"exceptions\" to the pause approved by the State Department Director of Foreign Assistance Office are also exempt, without further specifying what those exceptions are. CBS News has learned that Pete Marocco, a former deputy assistant secretary of African Affairs at the Pentagon, is now serving in a senior directing role within the State Department's Foreign Assistance Office \u2014 known internally as 'F' \u2014 which oversees foreign assistance programs administered by the State Department and USAID.",
      "\"I'm so devastated [as] to what just took place,\" one impacted USAID source said. \"We enjoyed the work we'd done and how it contributed to helping people all over the world. What took place was not fair at all. This has never taken place in any administration change, ever,\" they said, adding that they had respected the change and had been \"looking forward to building a relationship with the new administration for the better good.\"",
      "Two now-former USAID contractors voiced deep concerns about having life-threatening health conditions, in one case exacerbated by frequent work travel, and suddenly finding themselves without medical insurance after the end of the month on Friday.",
      "\"Our contractor could have paid us for two weeks. Or at least through next week so that we could have health insurance through February,\" says another USAID contractor whose employment was terminated on Tuesday. \"It feels apocalyptic. Every email felt like a threat starting last week and then they followed through.\" The source added that in their office on Monday and Tuesday \"people were in disarray and bawling\u2026People are terrified. Direct hires are feeling intense survivor's guilt and don't know what to do.\"",
      "A number of USAID contractors were also terminated last week without being placed on leave or receiving severance as a result of the executive order targeting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs. This included individuals who were not DEI advisers, or did not have primary job functions related to DEI, but may have contributed to collective workplace efforts focused on inclusivity and accessibility in the Biden administration.",
      "Termination letters sent to those employees last Thursday evening read, \"Effective immediately, USAID no longer requires the services you currently perform on the contract. As of today, USAID is ending funding for this position.\"",
      "Multiple sources also told CBS News that in several Washington, D.C.-based USAID annex office buildings, photographs hanging up of the agencies' programs and beneficiaries have been stripped from the walls. The removal of photographs is \"not normal protocol\" between administrations, one source said.",
      "\"They're physically dismantling things in the building,\" a second source said. \"They're erasing our existence,\" said a third.",
      "Contractors with USAID's Bureau for Global Health \u2014 the department responsible for projects covering HIV/AIDS treatment, maternal and child health, malaria, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases \u2014 were among those who received termination notices on Tuesday. According to two sources, all contractors in the Global Health Bureau, roughly 450 technical experts, were terminated. Those contractors make up about 50% of the entire USAID global health staff, leaving only about 450 direct hires still employed in that bureau.",
      "The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR \u2014 started by the administration of George W. Bush in 2003 \u2014 is among the notable government programs suddenly brought to a halt since Rubio issued the order, potentially interrupting the provision of anti-viral medications (ARVs) for millions of HIV and AIDS patients globally.\u00a0 According to the State department, PEPFAR has saved the lives of 26 million people since it started.",
      "While funding could be turned back on pending the outcome of a 90-day review, there is also growing concern among advocates that congressional support for PEPFAR is in peril due to a revelation earlier this month that groups receiving aid performed abortions, which is a violation of U.S. law. Reuters reported that four nurses in Mozambique had performed 21 abortions since 2021. That revelation may also be part of the upcoming State Department review.",
      "Currently 20.6 million people globally are on life-saving drugs due to PEPFAR, one source told CBS News, so the freeze in U.S. aid funding could lead to \"hundreds of thousands of deaths, particularly for women and children, depending on the length of the freeze.\"",
      "\"This is a crime against humanity,\" the source added.",
      "\"This purge is unprecedented, is a threat to our national security, makes America less safe, and seems [to be] circumventing congressional authority,\" one former USAID employee said.",
      "\"To me, this is an unmitigated hostile takeover of our democracy,\" another source impacted by the federal assistance freeze said. \"USAID is just the first casualty. But more are coming imminently. With the intention to wield power for whatever purposes they feel like.\"",

      "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014\u00a0A tie at the Minnesota Senate has come to an end as the DFL's Doron Clark is projected to win the special election for District 60 with 90.9% of the vote.",
      "Clark ran against Republican Abigail Wolters for the seat, which was left empty after Sen. Kari Dziedzic died of ovarian cancer last month. The former Minnesota Senate majority leader had represented the district in northeastern Minneapolis for 12 years.",
      "Doron, who grew up in southeast Minnesota and works in ethics and compliance for Medtronic, won the Jan. 13 primary with 38% of the vote.",

      "What was a 33-33 tie in the Senate will now lean in the Democrats' favor. The chamber had been operating under a power-sharing agreement until the election. After Clark's election is certified and he is seated, the chamber will have to take a vote to undo that deal, which has GOP and DFL lawmakers co-chairing committees and switching off who presides over the Senate chamber.",

    "summary": "Many are unclear on how sweeping the federal funding freeze is intended to be. Here are programs it could affect.",
    "story": [
      "A White House memo ordering a broad freeze on federal grants and loans by 5 p.m. Tuesday has ordinary Americans who depend on such aid, as well as seasoned budget experts, scratching their heads.",
      "The memo suspending the federal funding was vague in its wording, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. Adding to the whiplash, a federal judge on Tuesday\u00a0temporarily blocked the freeze\u00a0as she considers arguments from the U.S. government and the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "\"If this was being undertaken pursuant to the executive orders on [diversity, equity and inclusion], why would the administration issue such broad, unclear and confusing directions?\" Tad DeHaven, a policy analyst focusing on economic and fiscal policy issues at the libertarian Cato Institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I don't really understand it, and I think even people who are in positions of power don't really understand it,\" added Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at Brookings, a liberal-leaning public policy research group.",
      "What programs aren't affected by the funding freeze?",
      "The memo, from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), indicated that Social Security and Medicare programs would be exempt from the suspension in federal funding. Additional guidance released Tuesday further specified that \"any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the updated guidance said.",
      "The memo adds that funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance and other similar programs are also exempt.",
      "But even if the order ends up being more narrowly tailored, it could still have serious financial implications for the millions of Americans who receive federal assistance, experts said.",
      "\"If it's resolved quickly, the aggregate economic effects for the first quarter will be modest, but it will matter a whole lot to people on the other side of these expected payments,\" Edelberg said. \"It could be the difference between having a job and not, getting evicted or affording food \u2014 and the economic numbers won't fully reflect how individuals are going to feel this.\"",
      "Here's what to know about who may be affected by the proposed pause in federal funding.",
      "Will I still get SNAP benefits?",
      "The freeze does not apply to all federal financial assistance, according to an Office of Management and Budget memo on Tuesday. The agency indicates that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, better known as food stamps, are excluded, specifying that \"... any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the memo reads.",
      "SNAP serves roughly 41 million low-income Americans.",
      "Yet while the program appears to be exempt from the freeze, \"You are still going to be really worried in the near term whether the federal government is going to make good on those promises,\" Edelberg said. \"And that kind of uncertainty is not good for the economy.\"",
      "Are meals for seniors affected?",
      "The Older Americans Act Nutrition Program, a federal initiative that supports community-based senior nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels, could be affected by the proposed funding pause.",
      "If the order includes the Older Americans Act, it \"would halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" Meals on Wheels said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lack of clarity is creating chaos for Meals on Wheels providers not knowing whether they should be serving meals today.\"",
      "Is housing assistance at risk?",
      "The OMB memo added that rental assistance and other similar programs will not be paused. Still, the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) expressed concern that Department of Housing and Urban Development programs could be covered by the freeze.",
      "\"Even a short pause in funding could cause significant harm to low-income families and their communities,\" NLIHC Interim President and CEO Renee Willis said in a\u00a0statement. \"The longer the freeze continues, the greater the risk that low-income households receiving federal rental assistance could face eviction, and in the worst cases, homelessness \u2014 homeless shelters may be forced to close their doors, and nonprofit organizations may have to lay off staff.\"",
      "Are student loans affected?",
      "The federal funding freeze does not apply to student loans and Pell grants, according to the Department of Education. The funding pause \"only applies to discretionary grants at the Department of Education,\" DOE spokesperson Madi Biedermann said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, an advocate for students with government loans said they are worried about the impact of the freeze.",
      "\"Any kind of freeze to federal financial aid across the board is incredibly harmful to working families just trying to pay for college,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that \"Lots of questions remain about what the freeze applies to and what programs it does not,\"",
      "Meanwhile, many student borrowers rely on different kinds of government assistance to cover costs beyond tuition, Ba\u00f1ez noted.",
      "\"There are other types of federal work-study grants that go directly to colleges and universities, and supplemental education opportunities that go to some of the lowest-income students. People really rely on federal financial aid, and you could see families having to drop out of college or figure out how they will cover this gap,\" she said.",
      "The OMB memo also indicated that Head Start, a preschool program serving nearly 800,000 low-income children that receives federal health funds, is not impacted by the pause.",
      "But the National Head Start Association (NHSA) said that the OMB memo has already \"created panic among Head Start grant recipients who are currently not able to draw down any funds.\"",
      "\"While we understand that this is an evolving story, this disruption, at best, will slow down Head Start agencies' ability to pay hundreds of thousands of staff, contractors, and small businesses who support Head Start operations in every corner of the country,\" NHSA Executive Director Yasmina Vinci said in a statement. \"At worst, this means that hundreds of thousands of families will not be able to depend on the critical services and likely will not be able to work.\"",
      "Despite the updated guidance issued Tuesday stating that programs including Medicaid are excluded from the funding pause, state Medicaid programs on Tuesday\u00a0said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",

      "The president is expected to sign the order Wednesday, according to a senior administration official.",
      "The executive order also directs the Department of Education to issue guidance to states on how to use federal funding formulas \u2014 which determine how much money to allocate to districts and schools \u2014 to support their K-12 scholarship programs.",
      "The interior secretary, when confirmed, must also submit a plan to the president outlining how families with students at Bureau of Indian Education schools can use federal money to send those children to a school of their family's choosing. About 47,000 American Indian and Alaska Native students are enrolled in Bureau of Indian Education schools.",
      "It's not yet clear how much the administration can do without Congress to prioritize money for school choice programs, or to allow military children to go to the school of their parents' choosing.",
      "It's also not yet immediately clear if the Office of Management and Budget's directive to temporarily pause federal assistance would affect educational grant programs. A federal judge has also issued a stay on the order.",
      "Mr. Trump's new executive action comes as the soon-to-be-released National Assessment of Education Progress for 2024 is expected to show that 40% of 4th graders did not meet basic reading levels, the highest percentage ever recorded.",

He must receive a majority of senators to be confirmed to head HHS, which encompasses America's federal health agencies.",
      "The committee's jurisdiction largely focuses on the department's mammoth Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs for seniors and low-income Americans, which make up the largest share of mandatory spending in the federal budget.",
      "He will head next to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, or HELP, which is scheduled to question Kennedy on Thursday.",

      "This week's hearings will offer the first public window into Kennedy's broad \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda in many weeks, after Kennedy and other nominees retreated from public appearances and social media posts.",
      "Advisers have been huddling with Kennedy for months behind closed doors, multiple advisers say, hashing out how and whether to implement dramatic changes he has sought to the federal government's health bureaucracy.",

      "His aides are facing mounting criticism over a department-wide communications \"pause\" that has stymied releases across the health agencies, which is timed to end in the days after Kennedy's confirmation hearings wrap up.",

      "Conservative groups have also been divided over Kennedy's nomination, with some criticizing his past statements voicing support for abortion rights.",
      "The issue is expected to be a large focus of Kennedy's hearings: as secretary, he would have authority over how the FDA regulates medications used for abortions.",
      "Kennedy has reassured conservative groups and lawmakers that he would hew closely to Mr. Trump's campaign trail promise to defer the issue to the states.",
      "But Kennedy and the Trump administration will have little room to avoid the issue, given an ongoing federal court case against the FDA. Conservatives have called on the Trump administration's FDA to roll back moves made since 2016 to ease access to abortion pills.",

      "\"I've seen this from RFK in the past, that he is absolutely laser focused on the safety of pharmaceuticals. And so this gives us a really good opportunity to expose a safety issue,\" said Mize.",
      "FDA officials have defended their decision to ease the restrictions, saying that multiple reviews by the agency's staff support the safety of easing the limits on when during a pregnancy the pills can be taken and allowing mail-order and retail pharmacies to dispense the medication.",
      "What is RFK Jr.'s stance on vaccines?",
      "Many Democrats, nonprofits and health experts have also blasted Kennedy over his record of misleading and unfounded health claims, in addition to work by him and his allies opposing the approvals and authorizations of a range of vaccines, including COVID-19 and polio shots.",
      "Kennedy has sought to assuage concerns that he would upend vaccines using his authority, pledging in the days after the election not to ban any shots.",
      "In his government ethics agreement, Kennedy also promises for a year to not intervene in any matters involving a nonprofit he chaired, Children's Health Defense, which has battled federal agencies over vaccine authorizations and requirements.",
      "\"They're not interested in validating the press narrative that Bobby's going to come in and make sweeping changes in vaccine policy. That's going to be kind of political suicide right now,\" Dr. Robert Malone, a close Kennedy ally who has fiercely opposed the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, told CBS News.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a medical doctor and head of the Senate's health committee, said he had \"a frank conversation\" on \"vaccines at length\" with Kennedy after voicing concern over his past statements.",
      "The FDA's top vaccines official has also voiced optimism that he might find common ground with Kennedy over vaccines.",
      "\"This is how the sausage gets made. And you know, it's not always pretty and it isn't always what you want, but I'm really encouraged to see Bobby be pragmatic about the political realities here,\" said Malone.",
      "Who is RFK Jr?",
      "When Kennedy first announced his campaign as a Democratic presidential candidate in April 2023, he touted his decades-long record as an environmental lawyer.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 whose father, Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign \u2014 says he did not want to immediately enter politics, and instead \"carried on his family's legacy by devoting himself to environmental causes and children's welfare.\"",
      "That followed a struggle with substance abuse when he was younger, which he says spanned 14 years after he started using heroin at 15 years old.",
      "Kennedy made headlines for his environmental work was as founder and president of the nonprofit Waterkeeper Alliance from the 1980s until 2020, ranging from local efforts to clean up the Hudson River to campaigning against an oil pipeline in North Dakota.",
      "What Kennedy has described as his \"reluctant entrance into the vaccine debate\" dates back to 2005, when he wrote an article in Rolling Stone exploring supposed evidence for a link between autism and an ingredient that had formerly been used in some vaccines. The article contained numerous scientific and factual errors and was eventually retracted. Decades of research has established there is no such link.",
      "In 2016, Kennedy joined a nonprofit focused on mercury, which later broadened its focus and rebranded to Children's Health Defense. Kennedy chaired the group and served as one of its loudest voices raising doubts about vaccines and fighting against vaccine requirements and approvals.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, they clashed with federal health agencies over use of ivermectin and the federal mask mandate in travel. In 2021, the FDA denied their petition asking to revoke all COVID-19 vaccine authorizations and ban studies of the shots for children.",
      "As a candidate, Kennedy continued to say that he thought vaccines as well as \"a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods\" were to blame for rising rates of autism and other chronic diseases in U.S. children. Experts have attributed the global rise in autism prevalence in part to broader awareness and changes to how the disorder is classified and diagnosed.",
      "Kennedy's longshot bid to challenge President Joe Biden in the Democratic primary ended in October 2023, when he switched his campaign to an independent presidential bid. He dropped out of the campaign and endorsed Mr. Trump in August 2024.",

Without the money, she warned many health centers facing already slim margins could be forced to trim staff or close their doors.",
      "\"When the system's down, and there's no one to talk to to understand what they need to do, and then on top of that there's an uncertain time to the delay, it's paralyzing,\" said Pears Kelly.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association warned that health centers could face \"significant disruption\" to operations even with a \"temporary funding pause.\"",

      "It's unclear whether the National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools and school districts each month for the meals they serve children, will still receive funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture if the freeze takes effect.

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s cousin urged senators to reject his nomination as health and human services secretary.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Caroline Kennedy, the cousin of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., sent a blistering letter to senators on Tuesday \u2014 a day before his confirmation hearings \u2014 that described him as a \"predator\" whose actions \"have cost lives.\"",
      "In the letter to committee leaders, the former ambassador to Australia urged senators to reject his nomination as health and human services secretary, alleging that he \"preys on the desperation of parents and sick children,\" as well as his own family members.",
      "\"It's no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator,\" the two-page letter said. \"His basement, his garage, and his dorm room were the centers of the action where drugs were available, and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks. It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence.\"",
      "Family members who followed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. down the path of substance abuse, Caroline Kennedy wrote, \"suffered addiction, illness and death, while Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.\"",
      "She also said that while her cousin has discouraged parents from vaccinating their children, he has vaccinated his own.",
      "\"Even before he fills this job, his constant denigration of our health care system and the conspiratorial half-truths he has told about vaccines, including in connection with Samoa's deadly 2019 measles outbreak, have cost lives,\" Caroline Kennedy wrote.",
      "She also read her letter to the senators in a social media post on X.",
      "His \"crusade against vaccination\" serves to enrich him financially, she said. His financial disclosures\u00a0showed\u00a0RFK Jr. still intends to receive legal fees from Wisner Baum, a firm suing the maker of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil over its alleged failure to warn consumers about its risks.",
      "\"In other words,\" she said, \"he is willing to enrich himself by denying access to a vaccine that can prevent almost all forms of cervical cancer and which has been safely administered to millions of boys and girls.\" She went on to say that while she was ambassador to Australia, she learned it was one of the top three cancers afflicting women in a majority of countries.",
      "Caroline Kennedy also excoriated RFK Jr. over his presidential campaign: \"It also wasn't easy to remain silent last year when Bobby expropriated my father's image and distorted President Kennedy's legacy to advance his own failed presidential campaign \u2014 and then groveled to Donald Trump for a job. Bobby continues to grandstand off my father's assassination, and that of his own father. It is incomprehensible that someone who is willing to exploit their own painful family tragedies for publicity would be in charge of American life-and-death situations.\"",
      "Her cousin, she said,\u00a0is \"addicted to attention and power.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's controversial pick is set to appear Wednesday before the Senate Committee on Finance, which will decide whether to advance his nomination. On Thursday, he is scheduled to testify before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faces opposition from both sides of the aisle. Conservatives groups have expressed concern about his past statements in support of abortion rights, though he has reassured them that he would follow Mr. Trump's promise to defer the issue to states. Democrats and vaccine experts have condemned him for spreading misleading claims on a range of vaccines, including the COVID-19 and polio shots.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Former Rep. Sean Duffy sailed through his Senate confirmation vote to be transportation secretary, just before some of President Trump's more controversial nominees will be facing their\u00a0confirmation hearings\u00a0this week.",
      "In a 77 to 22 vote, the Senate confirmed Duffy. The 53-year-old, represented Wisconsin in the House from 2011 to 2019 and previously served as the district attorney of Ashland County, Wisconsin. He joined Fox News as a contributor and co-hosted a show on Fox Business after leaving Congress, until President Trump announced his selection for transportation secretary. He and his wife, whom he met on a reality television show, have nine children.",
      "The Senate voted unanimously to advance Duffy Monday night, after he appeared before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee earlier this month. At the hearing, he was introduced by the two Wisconsin senators \u2014 Republican Ron Johnson and Democrat Tammy Baldwin.",
      "\"I am confident that Sean is the right person for this job in this upcoming administration,\" Baldwin said, adding that Duffy will work with \"both sides of the aisle to improve our infrastructure and address the challenges that arise in the years ahead.\"",
      "Duffy said in his opening statement that \"transportation impacts every aspect of life,\" pledging that with Mr. Trump and support from Congress, \"I would hope to usher in a golden age of transportation and travel.\"",
      "\"President Trump, he's a builder. He wants to invest in rebuilding our nation's crumbling infrastructure,\" Duffy said, adding that Trump asked him to focus on the \"big, the durable projects that connect our country and connect our people.\"",
      "Duffy said he would work to reduce red tape that slows critical infrastructure projects. And he pledged to prioritize road safety and keep safety as a top priority in aviation. He urged that the nation needs to modernize its systems, pledging to work to restore global confidence in Boeing and \"ensure that our skies are safe.\"",
      "\"Transportation is an extraordinary new era we're entering in,\" Duffy said. \"We're in a global race to out-innovate and out-compete the rest of the world. If confirmed, we will craft clear regulations which balance safety, innovation and cutting edge technology, but always focused on safety.\"'",
      "Duffy received significant bipartisan support for his confirmation. Senate Majority Leader John Thune praised Duffy Monday as a five-term congressman and a co-chair of the Great Lakes task force, whom he said \"worked with Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate on a number of infrastructure projects.\"",
      "\"Mr. Duffy brings valuable experience that will help him in managing our nation's sprawling transportation system,\" Thune said. \"And he has some important work ahead of him.\"",
      "With Duffy's confirmation in hand, Thune teed up votes on a handful of other nominations in the coming days, including on Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Doug Burgum to be Secretary of the Interior, Christopher Wright for energy secretary and Doug Collins for Veterans Affairs secretary. Meanwhile, some of the most controversial nominees \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services and Kash Patel for FBI director \u2014 are set to come before Senate committees for confirmation hearings this week.",

    "story": [
      "The mystery of the unexplained drone sightings over New Jersey and along the East Coast late last year has been solved, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who said she was relaying the update directly from President Trump in the Oval Office.",
      "In her first White House press briefing Tuesday, Leavitt said, \"After research and study, the drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized to be flown by the FAA for research and various other reasons.\"",
      "\"Many of these drones were also hobbyists, recreational and private individuals that enjoy flying drones,\" she added. \"In time, it got worse due to curiosity. This was not the enemy.\"",
      "In December,\u00a0mysterious drone sightings\u00a0in\u00a0New Jersey,\u00a0New York,\u00a0Pennsylvania and other East Coast states prompted a demand for officials\u00a0to find the source\u00a0of the\u00a0flying objects, some of which were spotted near military installations.",

    "summary": "Judges heard nearly four hours of arguments over whether former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had the authority to unwind plea deals reached with three men accused of planning the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Justice Department lawyers and defense attorneys for the three men accused of planning the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks squared off before a federal appeals court Tuesday in a court fight over whether plea agreements reached with the defendants last summer can go forward.",
      "A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is considering whether former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin exceeded his authority when he revoked the pretrial agreements that military prosecutors reached with the defendants, including alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.",
      "The deals with Mohammed and two alleged accomplices, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak bin 'Attash and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi, were agreed to in late July following more than two years of negotiations. The agreements were approved by a senior Pentagon official who oversees the military court at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Brigadier General Susan Escallier, who Austin designated as convening authority for military commissions in 2023.",
      "Under the terms that have been released publicly, the men would plead guilty to eight charges arising from their alleged roles in the 9/11 terror attacks and in exchange, avoid the death penalty. The full parameters of the deals remain under seal.",
      "But shortly after the agreement was announced, Austin said he was rescinding them, writing in a memo that \"in light of the significance\" of the pretrial deals, \"responsibility for such a decision should rest with me.\"",
      "The case arrived before the D.C. Circuit after a military commission judge in Guantanamo Bay, who has been overseeing the case, ruled in November that Austin's nullification was unlawful, rendering the agreements valid and enforceable.",
      "A military appeals court last month declined to let Austin rescind the pretrial agreements because the defendants had begun performing a promise contained in them.",
      "The U.S. government then asked the D.C. Circuit to step in and sought to stop the military tribunal in Guantanamo Bay from accepting the agreements, as well as pause proceedings. The appeals court earlier this month agreed to put the plea hearing on hold and set arguments in the case on an expedited basis.",
      "The Justice Department is asking the D.C. Circuit to find that Austin validly withdrew from the pretrial agreements and bar the military commission from conducting plea hearings, during which the defendants would enter guilty pleas.",
      "\"We think this is the circumstance to issue the writ and effectuate and allow the secretary of defense's determinations to govern the course of the prosecutions of the alleged mastermind of 9/11 and the two alleged co-conspirators,\" Melissa Patterson, a Justice Department lawyer, told the three-judge panel.",
      "Judges Patricia Millett, Robert Wilkins and Neomi Rao heard nearly four hours of arguments over Austin's decision to unwind the deals.",
      "Patterson revealed to the judges that as proceedings were getting underway, the military judge in Guantanamo Bay said he would begin taking the pleas from the three defendants Thursday morning if the D.C. Circuit denied relief to the government.",
      "She asked the court to leave its earlier order pausing proceedings in place if it sides with the 9/11 defendants to allow the Justice Department time to evaluate whether it should seek further review.",
      "Across the arguments, the judges peppered Patterson with questions as to why Austin waited until two days after the plea deals were reached to withdraw Escallier's authority to enter into the agreements and assume that power for himself.",
      "Austin could have placed limits on Escallier's ability to enter the pleas from the beginning, Rao, appointed by President Trump during his first term, said. She later acknowledged that the circumstances of the case and the government's interest are \"extraordinary.\"",
      "The judge said the executive branch had \"every opportunity\" and the power to take actions to exercise control over Escallier, the convening authority, before the agreements were reached.",
      "Millett, named to the D.C. Circuit by former President Barack Obama, said Austin's revocation of the deals two days after the offers were signed put \"all these courts into knots\" trying to figure out the next steps.",
      "The judges also weighed whether Austin missed his window to rescind the agreements altogether, as the rules governing military commissions allow the convening authority \u2014 defined as the secretary of defense or an official designed by the secretary \u2014 to withdraw from a deal at any time before a defendant begins performance of promises contained in them.",
      "\"It undermines the force and plausibility of your argument that the secretary was being prudent by waiting,\" Wilkins said, noting that there are events that could take place that would take away his authority to withdraw the deals.",
      "Michel Paradis, who is representing Mohammed in the case, said it is \"not appropriate\" for the government to ask the D.C. Circuit to \"save itself\" from a pretrial agreement that it entered into, and the defendants began to perform.",
      "The defense secretary, he said, had plenty of opportunities over a span of several years to know about and prevent the deals, but chose not to exercise his authority over the convening authority until two days after the offers were signed.",
      "It's unclear how soon the D.C. Circuit will issue its decision.",

      "\"We've received a few questions about naming within Google Maps. We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,\" wrote Google in a social media post Monday. Their policy is to implement title changes for geographic features in the U.S. after the adjustments appear in the Geographic Names Information System.",
      "\"When that happens, we will update Google Maps in the U.S. quickly to show Mount McKinley and Gulf of America,\" the tech company said.",
      "Also longstanding practice: When official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name. Everyone in the rest of the world sees both names. That applies here too.",
      "Google noted that a location's name may appear differently depending on where Maps users are. When a place's title varies between countries, users will see the official name used by the country where they're accessing Maps. Everyone elsewhere in the world sees both names.",
      "The Interior Department announced Friday that the Gulf of Mexico had been renamed the Gulf of America, and Denali had, again, been renamed Mount McKinley, in response to a directive signed by Mr. Trump shortly after he took office.",

The Associated Press, whose style guidance many news organizations typically follow, said it will call the Gulf of Mexico by its original name while acknowledging the name Gulf of America. The AP will also refer to Denali as Mount McKinley, since Mr. Trump's position gives him authority to alter geographical names of places inside the country.",
      "The Gulf of Mexico first appeared on a world map roughly 400 years ago, as Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum pointed out during a briefing earlier this month where she derided what was at the time Mr. Trump's proposal to rename the ocean basin that shares near-equal lengths of coastline with her country and the U.S. Citing one of Mexico's founding documents that dates to the early 1800s and preceded the nation's constitution, Sheinbaum sarcastically suggested renaming North America \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" which translates to \"Mexican America.\"",
      "Denali's name comes from the Koyukon Indigenous residents of Alaska who are native to area around the mountain. Subject to dispute over the decades, the U.S. designated it Mount McKinley in the early 1900s to commemorate a slain president.

      "\"Maybe we would consider doing it again. I don't know. Maybe we would. They have to clean it up a little bit,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Former health officials tell CBS News they worry the U.S. withdrawal from the WHO could endanger efforts to respond to diseases, both undermining the U.N. agency and also making it harder for American officials to prepare.",

      "\"I don't think we want, particularly as public health experts, to feel like they can only wave the U.S. flag in those positions.

    "summary": "Costco shareholders days ago rejected anti-DEI proposal. The retailer says DEI is good for business.",
    "story": [
      "Republican attorneys general from 19 states want Costco Wholesale to ditch its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, making the call days after the retailer successfully defended its DEI policies as good for business to shareholders.",
      "In a\u00a0letter on Monday to Costco CEO Ron Vachris, the AGs accuse the retailer of \"clinging to DEI policies that courts and businesses have rejected as illegal,\" and called on it to account for the legal risks of its actions.",
      "Led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, the Republican officials instructed Costco to let them know within 30 days whether it would get rid of its DEI policies or explain why not.",
      "Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The GOP letter came after Costco shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that the wholesale club operator evaluate any risks associated to its DEI practices. The shareholder behind the resolution, the National Center for Public Policy Research, argued that DEI \"may sound benign,\" but in fact is \"weaponized language concealing a radical Marxist agenda.\"",
      "Costco's board, however, urged against the conservative think tank's motion ahead of its annual meeting.",
      "\"Among other things, a diverse group of employees helps bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings, promoting the 'treasure hunt' that our customers value,\" the retailer stated. Costco's \"commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary. The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information,\" it added.",
      "A day after Costco held its ground on its DEI policies, discount store chain Target joined Walmart and other corporations in scaling back on diversity initiatives under attack from conservative activists emboldened by high court decisions and President Trump, who recently banned DEI programs across the federal government.",
      "Intended as a means of promoting fairness in the workplace and open paths for people of color, women and expanded to include sexual orientation and gender identity, DEI programs gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed executive orders that could reshape the management and composition of the U.S. military.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed multiple executive orders Monday night that could reshape the management and composition of the military, with provisions addressing diversity measures, transgender service members, and troops who were discharged for refusing COVID vaccinations.",
      "He also signed an executive order to establish a process to develop what the administration is calling an American Iron Dome \u2014 a missile defense shield for the homeland. (Iron Dome is the name often used for\u00a0Israel's system\u00a0for intercepting rockets, which was developed with U.S. support.)",
      "Mr. Trump signed the four orders aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington from a stop in Florida.",
      "One of the orders would reinstate members of the military who were discharged for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. About 8,200 service members were discharged for refusing to comply with the Pentagon's COVID-19 vaccine mandate, according to data provided by the service branches. However, the mandate was rescinded in January 2023 by the Biden administration, and since then, about 110 service members have rejoined the military.",
      "The president also signed an executive order directing the Pentagon to determine a policy for transgender service members based on readiness within 30 days. The action does not immediately ban transgender service members; however, it does state that the Defense Department's policy for troop readiness is \"inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria.\"",
      "The order also states that identifying as a gender that is \"inconsistent\" with one's biological sex \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life\" and that those doing so \"cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\"",
      "Speaking about his plans at a retreat with House Republicans Monday at his property in Doral, Florida, Mr. Trump said, \"To ensure we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military. It's going to be gone.\"",
      "SPARTA Pride, a nonprofit organization for trans service members and veterans, said in a\u00a0statement: \"Transgender service members have been serving openly for almost ten years, and currently fill critical roles in every branch and specialty, including infantry, aviation, nuclear engineering, law enforcement, and military intelligence, many requiring years of specialized training and expertise. ... The readiness and physical capabilities of transgender service members is not different from that of other service members.\"",
      "Another order addresses diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the military, banning the use of race- or sex-based preferences in the armed forces, the Defense Department and the Homeland Security Department.",
      "\"I ordered the end to all of the lawless diversity, equity and inclusion nonsense policies across the government and all across the private sector and the military,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP retreat. \"We're getting it out and we've gotten it out pretty much. We did that in one week, and it wasn't that easy, but everybody wanted it.\"",
      "Under this order, the defense secretary and homeland security secretary are to review the curriculum at the service academies and other academic institutions to ensure DEI and \"gender ideologies\" are eliminated.",
      "The president announced plans last week to end DEI initiatives across the federal government, and the Office of Personnel Management ordered all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave.",

      "The proposed rules, which Oklahoma's education board was set to vote on Tuesday, are in the early stages and would still need approval from lawmakers and the governor to take effect. The proposal from Republican State Superintendent Ryan Walters, the state's education chief, wouldn't prohibit students without legal status from attending schools but would require districts to keep a tally.",
      "A U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1982 affirmed the right of children living in the country illegally to attend public schools, although some conservative lawmakers have questioned whether immigrants without legal residency should have the right to a public education.",
      "Walters has said he would support efforts by Mr. Trump to enforce immigration laws, including allowing federal agents with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement into Oklahoma schools. But there haven't been any instances yet of immigration agents entering schools in Oklahoma, reports CBS Tulsa affiliate KOTV.",
      "\"Schools are crippled by the flood of illegal immigrants and the Biden/Harris open border policy,\" Walters said in a statement. \"Oklahomans and the country elected President Trump and we will do everything possible to help put Oklahoma students first.\"",
      "Walters has spent much of his first term in office attacking what he describes as \"woke\" ideology in public schools, requiring Bible instruction in Oklahoma classrooms and attempting to ban books from school libraries.",
      "The plan has been sharply criticized by teachers and civil liberty groups and caused fear within Oklahoma's immigrant communities, said Rep. Arturo Alonso-Sandoval, a Democrat who represents Oklahoma City's heavily Hispanic south side.",

      "At Oklahoma City Public Schools, one of the state's largest districts with a student population that is 57% Hispanic, Superintendent Jamie Polk said in a letter to parents and staff last month after the rule was first proposed that federal law guarantees every child's right to public education regardless of immigration status.",
      "\"OKCPS does not, nor do we have plans to, collect the immigration status of our students or their families,\" she said.",
      "For decades, children of families living in the country illegally have had the right to attend public school based on the 1982 Supreme Court decision known as Plyler v. Doe. In a 5-4 vote, justices held it is unconstitutional to deny children an education based on their immigration status.",
      "Alabama attempted a similar requirement for public schools to ask the immigration status of students as part of a sweeping immigration law in 2011, but the state ultimately agreed to permanently block those provisions after they had been temporarily halted by a federal appeals court.",
      "Immigration experts say attempts to undermine the Plyler decision should be taken seriously, pointing to recent Supreme Court rulings that have overturn longstanding precedents over abortion rights and affirmative action in higher education."

    "story": [
      "About a dozen Justice Department employees who worked for former special counsel Jack Smith on the investigation and prosecution of President Trump are being fired, two sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. The federal prosecutors were informed of the decision to terminate their positions via a letter sent over email after Justice Department leadership determined they were unable to carry out Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "\"Acting Attorney General James McHenry made this decision because he did not believe these officials could be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president,\" a Justice Department official told CBS News.",
      "Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2022 and took over two ongoing investigations of the president, one related to his handling of classified records and the other tied to his conduct following the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Both cases were dismissed after Mr. Trump won the 2024 presidential election. Smith informed the judges overseeing the cases that Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Throughout his probes, the former special counsel amassed a staff of prosecutors and agents to conduct grand jury investigations and try the cases in court. It is not immediately clear which members of Smith's team were fired, but the move makes good on a Trump campaign promise to clean house in the Justice Department. Last week, the president signed an executive order to take on the \"weaponization of the federal government,\" a characterization he applied to Smith's prosecutions.",
      "Fox News was first to report on the firings.",
      "The news of the firings came on the same day that Washington, D.C.'s top federal prosecutor launched an internal review of the charging decisions behind hundreds of Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot cases. Two people familiar with the move confirmed to CBS News that Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Martin ordered prosecutors in his office to turn in documents, emails and other information related to the previous administration's decision to bring an obstruction charge against more than 200 Capitol attack defendants.",
      "The cases at issue are those in which defendants were charged with obstruction of an official proceeding, a charge that the Supreme Court later ruled was too broadly applied by federal prosecutors.",
      "Throughout the sprawling Jan. 6 investigation that abruptly came to an end last week after President Trump pardoned more than 1,500 individuals, defendants and their attorneys brought challenges against the obstruction case on multiple fronts as they contested the Justice Department's application of the law in the Capitol riot cases. The Supreme Court ultimately limited prosecutors' use of the statute.",
      "The new review is set to examine the decision making behind the use of that charge, the people said.",
      "News of the review was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "The U.S. attorney's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Smith \u2014 who resigned from his position following the completion of his investigation \u2014\u00a0 wrote in his report on the probe that his team had collected evidence \"sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial,\" if the case involving Mr. Trump's alleged conduct around the 2020 election had gone to trial.",
      "Only the first volume of Smith's report, which described the investigation into Mr. Trump's post-2020 election conduct, was released to the public. The second volume is currently shielded from public view while an appeal in the classified documents case is ongoing.",
      "In the report, Smith defended his work as apolitical. And in a letter accompanying the final draft, he wrote, \"To all who know me well, the claim from Mr. Trump that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called Smith \"desperate\" and \"deranged\" and consistently denied wrongdoing throughout the investigations.",
      "Also on Monday, the chief of the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section resigned from his position after being reassigned, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. The official was appointed to the position during the first Trump administration, and his political corruption unit later advised Smith on various aspects of cases against Mr. Trump, according to court documents.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2025 16:52:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Senate Democrats are asking for documents related to allegations the nominee to lead the FBI, Kash Patel, prematurely confirmed hostage rescue details.",
    "story": [
      "Days before this week's high-stakes confirmation hearing of Kash Patel to be FBI director, a bureau insider has come forward with new information questioning Patel's judgment during sensitive hostage rescue missions, CBS News has learned.",
      "The whistleblower, whose identity is being withheld by Senate Democrats for fear of retaliation, worked with the FBI's Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, which leads the government's missions to rescue hostages overseas. The whistleblower alleges that Patel violated firmly entrenched protocols to keep such operations under wraps until the captives are safely in U.S. hands and their families have been notified.",
      "In a letter obtained by CBS News, Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote that Patel, while serving on the National Security Council during the first Trump term, \"broke protocol regarding hostage rescues by publicly commenting without authorization on the then-in-progress retrieval of two Americans held captive by Iranian-backed militants in Yemen in October 2020.\"",
      "According to the letter, on Oct. 14 at 10:55 a.m., the Wall Street Journal published a story in which Patel confirmed that the two American captives and the remains of a third were exchanged for two hundred Houthi fighters who were being held in Saudi Arabia. According to the letter, the news report was published \"several hours before the hostages were in the confirmed custody of the United States.\" In the end the Americans returned home safely, but FBI officials involved in the mission were livid over Patel's leak, which they regarded as reckless and potentially risking tragic results.",
      "Democratic senators sent the letter Monday morning to Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Acting Treasury Secretary David Lebryk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. It asks for all records of communications between Patel and the FBI's Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell concerning the rescue of the captives, as well as any records reflecting authorization for him to disclose the hostage deal before there was confirmation that the Americans were safely in U.S, hands.",
      "No Republican senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee signed the letter.",
      "A source close to the confirmation said in response to the allegations, \"Mr. Patel was a public defender, decorated prosecutor and accomplished national security official that kept Americans safe. He has a track record of success in every branch of government, from the court room to congressional hearing room to the situation room. There is no veracity to this anonymous source's complaints about protocol.\"",
      "Alex Gray, former chief of staff for the National Security Council during the first Trump administration, said in a statement, \"The anonymous allegations in this letter are simply absurd to anyone who has ever actually worked with Kash Patel. In everything he did at the NSC and DoD, Kash put the interests of the American people, and particularly the interests of American hostages and unlawful detainees and their families, first.\"",
      "\"The success President Trump and his NSC had on the counter terrorism and hostage recovery missions was in no small part due to Kash's skill and professionalism,\" Gray said. He referred to the whistleblower's allegations as \"baseles\" and \"the last gasp of discredited political opponents of President Trump.\"",
      "The Durbin letter offers a glimpse into the Democratic strategy for Thursday's confirmation hearing. Knowledgeable sources tell CBS News that senators will seek to show that Patel has engaged in a pattern of poor judgment and self-aggrandizement regarding sensitive life-and-death missions and use that portrayal to cast doubt on his fitness to lead the FBI.",
      "The letter says any official \"who puts missions or the lives of Americans in jeopardy for public notoriety and personal gain is unfit to lead the country's primary federal law enforcement and investigative agency.\"",
      "The Democrats plan to highlight another instance where Patel has been criticized for his handling of a sensitive operation aimed at freeing American captives. Two weeks after the Yemen hostage deal, Patel found himself in the middle of another high-risk operation. Philip Walton was a 27-year-old American who had been seized by armed men at his farm in Niger, near the Nigerian border.",
      "The kidnappers transported Walton to Nigeria and demanded a million dollars in ransom. There were also indications that the kidnappers were contemplating turning him over to a terrorist group operating in the region. Patel was accompanying President Trump on a visit to Fort Bragg, the military installation in North Carolina that is home to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command. While they were there, Patel received intelligence that Walton would be held at an encampment for several hours, enough time to stage a daring Seal Team 6 raid to rescue the hostage. Mr. Trump signed off on the operation, which involved parachuting into Northern Nigeria and trekking for miles to the compound where Walton was being held.",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper had greenlit the plan, but there were still some final questions that needed to be answered before he could give the go order \u2013 primarily whether the Nigerian government had given the U.S. permission to use its air space. According to Esper's memoir, Patel, who was the senior director for counterterrorism at the time, assured Defense Department officials that the State Department had received the necessary permission from the Nigerians. But Patel's information was incorrect: the Nigerians had not given their approval.",
      "By this time, Air Force planes carrying the Navy SEALs were in the air just a few miles from the Nigerian border. Esper wrote in his memoir, \"A Sacred Oath,\" he realized the government had to make an agonizing decision. He told the White House they could go forward with the operation and risk having their planes shot down \u2014 or abort the mission and miss a crucial opportunity to save Walton.\u00a0 But at the last minute, word came that the State Department had received clearance to use Nigerian airspace. The mission went forward, was executed flawlessly, and Walton was returned to safety.",
      "But Esper and other officials were furious at the role Patel had played, believing he had inserted himself into the operation in violation of regular protocol, and then nearly botched it by transmitting false information. According to Esper's account, Patel's carelessness carried significant risk for the SEALs.",
      "\"I was concerned that being packed in an aircraft burning holes in the sky for an extra hour or so would wear on the special operators, that it might affect their readiness somehow,\" he wrote in his memoir.",
      "Esper also wrote of the incident, \"My team suspected Patel made the approval story up, but they didn't have all the facts.\"",
      "Patel has denied Esper's version of events. In his own book, \"Government Gangsters,\" Patel portrays Esper as a \"deep-state\" actor who \"always seemed to be subverting the president's agenda,\" including by putting up obstacles to counterterrorism raids in Africa and the Middle East.\" He argued that Mr. Trump had the ultimate authority to order the mission.",
      "Last week, Durbin met with Patel and asked him about Esper's account of his role in the nearly botched Nigerian raid. Sources said Patel again refuted Esper's version of events. Durbin did not yet have the whistleblower's information about the Yemen hostage deal, but he is expected to closely question the FBI nominee about that episode at Thursday's confirmation hearing.",
      "However Patel's answers those questions, there is no suspense as to how Durbin and his fellow Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee will vote. After his meeting with Patel, Durbin issued a statement saying he will not vote to confirm Patel.",

      "The federal judge who presided over the seditious conspiracy trial of far-right Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes rescinded an order that\u00a0barred Rhodes and his co-defendants from traveling to Washington, D.C. The Justice Department had called on him to modify the sentences of the group members, who were serving years-long sentences after their convictions on crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta said Monday, \"[I]t would be improper for the court post-commutation to modify the original sentences,\" but because President Trump's clemency \"can reasonably be read to extinguish enforcement of Defendants' terms of supervised release,\" the judge vacated his order.",
      "Mehta on Friday had ordered the Oath Keeper members Rhodes, Kelly Meggs, Kenneth Harrelson, Jessica Watkins, Roberto Minuta, Edward Vallejo, David Moerchel, and Joseph Hacket to be barred from entering Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Capitol building \"without first obtaining the permission from the Court.\"",

      "Last week, as part of the mass clemency Mr. Trump extended to those tied to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, he pardoned over 1,500 defendants, but opted to commute the sentences of Rhodes, his co-defendants and certain members of the Proud Boys group who were also charged with seditious conspiracy. Not all of those who received commutations were ultimately convicted of the seditious conspiracy charge.",

    "story": [
      "A palm-sized mammal that lives underground in California  has been caught alive on camera for the first time.",
      "Three undergraduate students came up with an idea to capture the elusive Mount Lyell shrew, native to the Eastern Sierra Nevada region, as part of their fall 2024 project. Vishal Subramanyan, Prakrit Jain and Harper Forbes laid out over 100 traps last November and checked them every two hours, for three days and four nights, to photograph the tiny creatures.",
      "\"The hardest part of getting the photos was one, they're incredibly fast cuz they're always running around,\" Subramanyan told CBS News.",
      "Another reason the Mount Lynell shrews had never been captured alive on camera is that they have an incredibly fast metabolism, Subramanyan said. He and Jain were already taking photos of small mammals for their mammalogy class when they learned that this particular animal had never been photographed before, so they devised a plan.",
      "Researchers have set up similar pitfall traps to capture the shrews, but if they're left in the trap for more than two hours, they'll simply starve to death. That's why Subramanyan, Jain and Forbes had to check their traps every two hours.",
      "To take the photos, the students set up a white background on the bottom of a box, using glass on the top so they could photograph through it. They also had a terrarium with soil and mealworms for the shrews.",
      "The tiny mammals are active through day and night because they have to constantly feed on insects and arachnids to survive. Another challenge in getting the photos were cold fingers, Subramanyan said.",
      "Temperatures in the mountain fell to 15 degrees during the expedition funded with the help of Cal Academy. Subramanyan was part of the organization's inaugural California Creators for Nature program that aims to engage people on social media in conversations about nature, climate and environmental justice.",

      "The world's biggest iceberg\u00a0-- three time the size of New York City -- could drift towards a remote island where a scientist warns it risks disrupting feeding for baby penguins and seals.",
      "The gigantic wall of ice is moving slowly from Antarctica on a potential collision course with South Georgia, a crucial wildlife breeding ground in the South Atlantic.",
      "Satellite imagery suggested that unlike previous \"megabergs,\" this rogue was not crumbling into smaller chunks as it plodded through the Southern Ocean, Andrew Meijers, a physical oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, told AFP on Friday.",
      "He said predicting its exact course was difficult but prevailing currents suggested the colossus would reach the shallow continental shelf around South Georgia in two to four weeks.",
      "But what might happen next is anyone's guess, he said.",
      "It could avoid the shelf and get carried into open water beyond South Georgia, a British overseas territory some 870 miles east of the Falkland Islands.",
      "Or it could strike the sloping bottom and get stuck for months or break up into pieces.",
      "Meijers said this scenario could seriously impede seals and penguins trying to feed and raise their young on the island. The island hosts 1.3 million pairs of Chinstrap penguins \u2014 one of the world's largest colonies \u2014 about 5 million seals, and 65 million breeding birds.",
      "\"Icebergs have grounded there in the past and that has caused significant mortality to penguin chicks and seal pups,\" he said.",
      "Roughly 1,550 square miles across, the world's biggest and oldest iceberg, known as A23a, calved from the Antarctic shelf in 1986. Before its calving in 1986, the colossal iceberg hosted a Soviet research station. falley",
      "It remained stuck for over 30 years before finally breaking free in 2020, its lumbering journey north sometimes delayed by ocean forces that kept it spinning in place. In 2023, the British Antarctic Survey posted a time-lapse of satellite imagery, showing the iceberg's movement.",

      "A23a has followed roughly the same path as previous massive icebergs, passing the east side of the Antarctica Peninsula through the Weddell Sea along a route called \"iceberg alley.\" That is the same current of water that famed explorer Ernest Shackleton used in 1916 to make his storied escape from Antarctica after losing his ship, the Endurance. The legendary\u00a0shipwreck was discovered\u00a0off the coast of Antarctica in 2022.",
      "Weighing a little under a trillion tons, this monster block of freshwater was being whisked along by the world's most powerful ocean \"jet stream\" -- the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.",
      "Raul Cordero from Chile's University of Santiago, who is also part of the National Antarctic Research Committee, said he was confident the iceberg would sidestep South Georgia.",
      "\"The island acts as an obstacle for ocean currents and therefore usually diverts the water long before it reaches the island,\" he said.",
      "\"The iceberg is moved by that water flow, so the chances of it hitting are not that high,\" though chunks could, he said.",
      "Another scientist, glaciologist Soledad Tiranti currently on an Argentinian exploration voyage in the Antarctic, said that icebergs such as A23a \"are so deep that before reaching an island or mainland they generally get stuck\" on the seabed.",
      "It is summer in South Georgia and resident penguins and seals along its southern coastline are foraging in the frosty waters to bring back food to fatten their young.",
      "\"If the iceberg parks there, it'll either block physically where they feed from, or they'll have to go around it,\" said Meijers.",
      "\"That burns a huge amount of extra energy for them, so that's less energy for the pups and chicks, which causes increased mortality.\"",
      "The seal and penguin populations on South Georgia have already been having a \"bad season\" with an outbreak of bird flu \"and that (iceberg) would make it significantly worse,\" he said.",
      "As A23a ultimately melted it could seed the water with nutrients that encourage phytoplankton growth, feeding whales and other species, and allowing scientists to study how such blooms absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",
      "While icebergs are natural phenomena, Meijers said the rate at which they were being lost from Antarctica was increasing, likely due to human induced climate change.",

      "In a post to his Truth Social platform, the president said he has asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration. They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!\"",
      "For his part, Musk had written in an earlier post on his own social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding that \"we will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's post made it sound like Musk himself would be going to space, adding to widespread confusion about what was being planned, in part because the astronauts in question, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, are not \"stranded\" in any conventional sense, and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "They could return to Earth anytime NASA so decides, riding down in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that carried two station crew members to orbit last September with two empty seats specifically for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "They blasted off aboard the Starliner capsule last June 5 for a presumed eight-to-10-day mission. It was the first piloted flight of a Starliner, a key step toward beginning service as an operational alternative to SpaceX's Crew Dragon.",
      "But the flight was marred by propellant leaks and pressurization problems with the Starliner's propulsion system.",
      "After multiple extensions to carry out tests and analyses, NASA managers decided on Aug. 24 to leave Wilmore and Williams aboard the station for an extended stay, bringing the Starliner down under remote control, without its crew, on Sept. 7. There were no major problems.",
      "The decision to keep Wilmore and Williams aloft on the station was made by NASA management based on a risk assessment and a desire to minimize long-range disruption to the carefully choreographed schedule of crew rotation and cargo delivery missions.",
      "In any case, in the wake of NASA's decision, SpaceX launched a four-seat Crew Dragon spacecraft to the space station on Sept. 28 with just two crew members aboard \u2014 NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 leaving two seats available for Wilmore and Williams.",

      "As it now stands, Crew 9 commander Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams are expecting to return to Earth at the end of March. By that point, the two Starliner astronauts will have logged around 300 days in space. Both astronauts have said they understood NASA's decision to extend their mission.",
      "As the founder of SpaceX, Musk was certainly aware of those decisions when they were made and the rationale behind them. There have been no reports of any direct involvement of the Biden administration in the decisions to extend the Starliner crew's stay in space, and Musk offered no criticisms of NASA's decision at the time.",
      "As for what returning the Starliner crew to Earth \"as soon as possible\" might mean, the only obvious answer would be to bring Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams down ahead of schedule. They would not need anyone to come get them.",
      "But an early departure would leave a single U.S. astronaut behind on the space station: Don Pettit, who launched to the lab last year aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "NASA would then have just one astronaut on board the station to operate the multi-module U.S. segment of the lab, likely halting research in its tracks until Crew 10 could arrive aboard the next Crew Dragon.",
      "Rumors indicate the Crew 10 Dragon could be facing additional delays. NASA could opt to move the next station crew to a Crew Dragon earmarked for a commercial trip to the station carrying a crew sponsored by Houston-based Axiom Space. That might move the Crew 9 return up a few days, but not by any significant amount.",

      "The team mapped a surprisingly complex weather system on the planet by tracking the speed of molecules \u2014 they observed a double peak, indicating that one side of the atmosphere is moving towards us and the other away from us at high speed. This indicates that there is a powerful wind current going around the planet.",

    "summary": "Lawmakers and experts say China's DeepSeek AI app could expose U.S. users to risks and promote censorship.",
    "story": [
      "As Chinese AI application DeepSeek attracts hordes of American users, Trump administration officials, lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are expressing concern that the technology could pose a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, geopolitics and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A Chinese artificial intelligence company called DeepSeek is grabbing America's attention \u2014 and sending a shock wave through Wall Street \u2014 due to its new tech, which some experts say rivals that of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "DeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according\u00a0to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.",
      "Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "Are there privacy issues with DeepSeek?",
      "Some experts are raising concerns about the personal data that DeepSeek is collecting, given that the company stores data from users \u2014 including their date of birth, keystrokes, text or audio inputs, uploaded files, chat history and other data \u2014 on servers located in China, according to its privacy policy.",
      "That echoes some of the issues raised with TikTok, another company with Chinese ownership that sparked worries about the supposed risks its ties to China posed to national security. Last year, Congress passed a law\u00a0banning\u00a0 TikTok in the U.S. as long as it is under Chinese ownership, although that is now in flux after President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days.",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",
      "Analysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.",
      "What is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.",
      "\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"",
      "But, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"",

      "The Gulf of Mexico first appeared on a world map roughly 400 years ago, as Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum pointed out during a briefing earlier this month where she derided what was at the time Mr. Trump's proposal to rename the ocean basin that shares near-equal lengths of coastline with her country and the U.S. Citing one of Mexico's founding documents that dates to the early 1800s and preceded the nation's constitution, Sheinbaum sarcastically suggested renaming North America \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" which translates to \"Mexican America.\"",
      "Denali's name comes from the Koyukon Indigenous residents of Alaska who are native to area around the mountain.

      "The push is the latest by Mr. Trump to reverse Biden administration policies protecting transgender people and their care. On Monday, Mr. Trump directed the Pentagon to conduct a review that is likely to lead to them being barred from military service.",
      "That order's language stated that identifying as a gender that is \"inconsistent\" with one's biological sex \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life\" and that soldiers who do so \"cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\"",
      "A group of active-duty military personnel sued over the executive order Tuesday.",

The readiness and physical capabilities of transgender service members is not different from that of other service members.\"",
      "Hours after taking office last week, Mr. Trump signed another order that seeks to define sex as only male or female, not recognizing transgender, nonbinary or intersex people or the idea that gender can be fluid. Already that's resulted in the State Department halting issuing passports with an \"X\" gender marker, forcing transgender people to apply for travel documents with markers that don't match their identities.",
      "Mr. Trump said he would address these issues during his campaign last year, and his actions could prove widely divisive.",

About half of voters, 52%, were opposed, but 47% said they were in favor.",
      "Mr. Trump's voters were much more likely to support bans on transgender care: About 6 in 10 Trump voters favored such laws.",
      "\"It's very clear that this order, in combination with the other orders that we've seen over the past week, are meant to not protect anyone in this country, but rather to single-mindedly drive out transgender people of all ages from all walks of civic life,\" said Harper Seldin, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBTQ & HIV Project.",

    "summary": "Posts by President Trump and Elon Musk roiled the space community, raising the prospect of an earlier-than-planned return for the Starliner crew.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump blamed the Biden administration Tuesday for \"abandoning\" two astronauts who have been stuck aboard the International Space Station in the wake of problems last summer with their Boeing Starliner capsule.",
      "In a post to his Truth Social platform, the president said he has asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration. They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!\"",
      "For his part, Musk had written in an earlier post on his own social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding that \"we will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's post made it sound like Musk himself would be going to space, adding to widespread confusion about what was being planned, in part because the astronauts in question, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, are not \"stranded\" in any conventional sense, and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "They could return to Earth anytime NASA so decides, riding down in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that carried two station crew members to orbit last September with two empty seats specifically for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "They blasted off aboard the Starliner capsule last June 5 for a presumed eight-to-10-day mission. It was the first piloted flight of a Starliner, a key step toward beginning service as an operational alternative to SpaceX's Crew Dragon.",
      "But the flight was marred by propellant leaks and pressurization problems with the Starliner's propulsion system.",
      "After multiple extensions to carry out tests and analyses, NASA managers decided on Aug. 24 to leave Wilmore and Williams aboard the station for an extended stay, bringing the Starliner down under remote control, without its crew, on Sept. 7. There were no major problems.",
      "The decision to keep Wilmore and Williams aloft on the station was made by NASA management based on a risk assessment and a desire to minimize long-range disruption to the carefully choreographed schedule of crew rotation and cargo delivery missions.",
      "In any case, in the wake of NASA's decision, SpaceX launched a four-seat Crew Dragon spacecraft to the space station on Sept. 28 with just two crew members aboard \u2014 NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 leaving two seats available for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "NASA opted to carry out a normal long-duration stay by Hague and Gorbunov, who launched with an expectation of returning to Earth at the end of February with Wilmore and Williams. All of that was known last September.",
      "The return flight was later delayed an additional month or so to give SpaceX more time to ready a new Crew Dragon capsule for launch on its maiden flight to ferry a replacement crew \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to the station.",
      "As it now stands, Crew 9 commander Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams are expecting to return to Earth at the end of March. By that point, the two Starliner astronauts will have logged around 300 days in space. Both astronauts have said they understood NASA's decision to extend their mission.",
      "As the founder of SpaceX, Musk was certainly aware of those decisions when they were made and the rationale behind them. There have been no reports of any direct involvement of the Biden administration in the decisions to extend the Starliner crew's stay in space, and Musk offered no criticisms of NASA's decision at the time.",
      "As for what returning the Starliner crew to Earth \"as soon as possible\" might mean, the only obvious answer would be to bring Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams down ahead of schedule. They would not need anyone to come get them.",
      "But an early departure would leave a single U.S. astronaut behind on the space station: Don Pettit, who launched to the lab last year aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "NASA would then have just one astronaut on board the station to operate the multi-module U.S. segment of the lab, likely halting research in its tracks until Crew 10 could arrive aboard the next Crew Dragon.",
      "Rumors indicate the Crew 10 Dragon could be facing additional delays. NASA could opt to move the next station crew to a Crew Dragon earmarked for a commercial trip to the station carrying a crew sponsored by Houston-based Axiom Space. That might move the Crew 9 return up a few days, but not by any significant amount.",
      "A Crew Dragon that will be used for a commercial space tourism flight around Earth's poles this spring is not believed to be an option because it is not equipped with a space station docking mechanism.",

    "summary": "Approximately 60 senior staff within USAID have been suspended, leaving the agency without clear leadership, five sources familiar with the internal action told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Dozens of senior staff inside the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, have been placed on administrative leave until further notice, and hundreds of contractors have had their employment furloughed or terminated, multiple sources told CBS News. This followed Secretary of State Marco Rubio's order last Friday that placed an immediate halt on virtually all U.S.-funded foreign aid assistance globally.",
      "CBS News spoke to a dozen current and former USAID staff and contractors who were granted anonymity to speak openly.",
      "An email obtained by CBS News and sent from USAID's acting administrator Jason Gray to USAID staff Monday stated that \"a number of USAID employees\" were placed on administrative leave with full pay and benefits until further notice after \"several actions within USAID that appear to be designed to circumvent the President's Executive Orders and the mandate from the American people\" were identified.",
      "Approximately 60 senior staff within USAID have been suspended \u2014 including the assistant administrators and deputy assistant administrators heading up most of its bureaus \u2014 leaving the agency without clear leadership, five sources familiar with the internal action told CBS News. The majority of those placed on leave were career civil servants and foreign service officers. They also included USAID attorneys in the Office of the General Counsel, who are responsible for interpreting the executive orders for implementation.",
      "One source told CBS News the individuals affected were told to \"go home and not communicate with anyone\" at USAID. Two sources told CBS News that some of the individuals in question were physically escorted out of the building.",
      "CBS News has also learned that several hundred contractors at USAID have been furloughed or laid off, according to six sources familiar with the action. Some have been notified they have been terminated immediately without severance pay and that their benefits will expire in just three days, at the end of January, while others who have been furloughed have been told their benefits will remain in effect through the end of February.",
      "Rubio's order is part of an effort by the administration to meet President Trump's campaign promises of shrinking the size of the federal workforce, and looking for places to cut what it sees as wasteful government spending. Mr. Trump has long held that other nations are not contributing enough when it comes to foreign aid, and that the U.S. is bearing the brunt of the burden. But critics say such cuts could undermine America's standing in the world and create an opening for China and other adversaries looking to exert their influence abroad.",
      "In response to Rubio's mandate to halt federal foreign assistance, stop-work orders were issued on Monday and Tuesday to companies that hold contracts with USAID and the State Department.",
      "Termination letters sent to two contractors obtained by CBS News read, \"This letter is to inform you that effective January 28, 2025, your employment with [federal contract holder] will be terminated due to a contract layoff. Unfortunately, [federal contract holder] received a Stop Work Order, and without authority to proceed, we have no work for you to perform.\"",
      "There is language in the termination letters reading, \"We hope this situation is temporary and that you can return to your positions.\" However, the employees' email accounts with USAID and the contracting company were shut off, and the termination letters were sent afterwards to their personal emails, sources said.",
      "One source said that USAID staff had scrambled to put forward applications for waivers for programs once Rubio had sent out the order.",
      "\"Then they physically escorted out USAID leadership. The waiver process was a joke,\" the source said.",
      "\"USAID is absolutely gutted,\" another source in the agency said. \"This is surgical to stop programs. Lives are at stake here. We are jeopardizing lives.\"",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters late Tuesday that \"staff have been given a template for waiver requests.\"",
      "Rubio, later on Tuesday, then issued a waiver to his own foreign assistance pause. In a second memo provided to CBS by a senior administration official, Rubio stated the waiver applies to \"life-saving humanitarian assistance\", which he defined as \"life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance.\"",
      "The memo also stated, \"Implementers of existing life-saving humanitarian assistance programs should continue or resume work if they have stopped.\"",
      "The new waiver does not apply to \"activities that involve abortions, family planning conferences, gender or DEl ideology programs, transgender surgeries, or other non-life saving assistance,\" per the memo.",
      "The State Department has not yet provided clarification on whether some U.S.-funded foreign aid programs are now automatically exempt as a result of Rubio's new waiver, or whether all programs globally must still apply for a waiver in order to opt back into receiving U.S. funding.",
      "It is not immediately clear how this new waiver will impact those whose employment has already been terminated.",
      "In the copy of Rubio's initial order obtained by CBS News last Friday, he told all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts to immediately issue \"stop-work\" orders \"for existing foreign assistance awards,\" pending review by the Secretary of State.",
      "Rubio had also stated in his initial order that \"exceptions\" to the pause approved by the State Department Director of Foreign Assistance Office are also exempt, without further specifying what those exceptions are. CBS News has learned that Pete Marocco, a former deputy assistant secretary of African Affairs at the Pentagon, is now serving in a senior directing role within the State Department's Foreign Assistance Office \u2014 known internally as 'F' \u2014 which oversees foreign assistance programs administered by the State Department and USAID.",
      "\"I'm so devastated [as] to what just took place,\" one impacted USAID source said. \"We enjoyed the work we'd done and how it contributed to helping people all over the world. What took place was not fair at all. This has never taken place in any administration change, ever,\" they said, adding that they had respected the change and had been \"looking forward to building a relationship with the new administration for the better good.\"",
      "Two now-former USAID contractors voiced deep concerns about having life-threatening health conditions, in one case exacerbated by frequent work travel, and suddenly finding themselves without medical insurance after the end of the month on Friday.",
      "\"Our contractor could have paid us for two weeks. Or at least through next week so that we could have health insurance through February,\" says another USAID contractor whose employment was terminated on Tuesday. \"It feels apocalyptic. Every email felt like a threat starting last week and then they followed through.\" The source added that in their office on Monday and Tuesday \"people were in disarray and bawling\u2026People are terrified. Direct hires are feeling intense survivor's guilt and don't know what to do.\"",
      "A number of USAID contractors were also terminated last week without being placed on leave or receiving severance as a result of the executive order targeting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs. This included individuals who were not DEI advisers, or did not have primary job functions related to DEI, but may have contributed to collective workplace efforts focused on inclusivity and accessibility in the Biden administration.",
      "Termination letters sent to those employees last Thursday evening read, \"Effective immediately, USAID no longer requires the services you currently perform on the contract. As of today, USAID is ending funding for this position.\"",
      "Multiple sources also told CBS News that in several Washington, D.C.-based USAID annex office buildings, photographs hanging up of the agencies' programs and beneficiaries have been stripped from the walls. The removal of photographs is \"not normal protocol\" between administrations, one source said.",
      "\"They're physically dismantling things in the building,\" a second source said. \"They're erasing our existence,\" said a third.",
      "Contractors with USAID's Bureau for Global Health \u2014 the department responsible for projects covering HIV/AIDS treatment, maternal and child health, malaria, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases \u2014 were among those who received termination notices on Tuesday. According to two sources, all contractors in the Global Health Bureau, roughly 450 technical experts, were terminated. Those contractors make up about 50% of the entire USAID global health staff, leaving only about 450 direct hires still employed in that bureau.",
      "The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR \u2014 started by the administration of George W. Bush in 2003 \u2014 is among the notable government programs suddenly brought to a halt since Rubio issued the order, potentially interrupting the provision of anti-viral medications (ARVs) for millions of HIV and AIDS patients globally.\u00a0 According to the State department, PEPFAR has saved the lives of 26 million people since it started.",
      "While funding could be turned back on pending the outcome of a 90-day review, there is also growing concern among advocates that congressional support for PEPFAR is in peril due to a revelation earlier this month that groups receiving aid performed abortions, which is a violation of U.S. law. Reuters reported that four nurses in Mozambique had performed 21 abortions since 2021. That revelation may also be part of the upcoming State Department review.",
      "Currently 20.6 million people globally are on life-saving drugs due to PEPFAR, one source told CBS News, so the freeze in U.S. aid funding could lead to \"hundreds of thousands of deaths, particularly for women and children, depending on the length of the freeze.\"",
      "\"This is a crime against humanity,\" the source added.",
      "\"This purge is unprecedented, is a threat to our national security, makes America less safe, and seems [to be] circumventing congressional authority,\" one former USAID employee said.",
      "\"To me, this is an unmitigated hostile takeover of our democracy,\" another source impacted by the federal assistance freeze said. \"USAID is just the first casualty. But more are coming imminently. With the intention to wield power for whatever purposes they feel like.\"",

      "A White House memo ordering a broad freeze on federal grants and loans by 5 p.m. Tuesday has ordinary Americans who depend on such aid, as well as seasoned budget experts, scratching their heads.",
      "The memo suspending the federal funding was vague in its wording, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. Adding to the whiplash, a federal judge on Tuesday\u00a0temporarily blocked the freeze\u00a0as she considers arguments from the U.S. government and the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "\"If this was being undertaken pursuant to the executive orders on [diversity, equity and inclusion], why would the administration issue such broad, unclear and confusing directions?\" Tad DeHaven, a policy analyst focusing on economic and fiscal policy issues at the libertarian Cato Institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I don't really understand it, and I think even people who are in positions of power don't really understand it,\" added Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at Brookings, a liberal-leaning public policy research group.",
      "What programs aren't affected by the funding freeze?",
      "The memo, from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), indicated that Social Security and Medicare programs would be exempt from the suspension in federal funding. Additional guidance released Tuesday further specified that \"any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the updated guidance said.",
      "The memo adds that funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance and other similar programs are also exempt.",
      "But even if the order ends up being more narrowly tailored, it could still have serious financial implications for the millions of Americans who receive federal assistance, experts said.",
      "\"If it's resolved quickly, the aggregate economic effects for the first quarter will be modest, but it will matter a whole lot to people on the other side of these expected payments,\" Edelberg said. \"It could be the difference between having a job and not, getting evicted or affording food \u2014 and the economic numbers won't fully reflect how individuals are going to feel this.\"",
      "Here's what to know about who may be affected by the proposed pause in federal funding.",
      "Will I still get SNAP benefits?",
      "The freeze does not apply to all federal financial assistance, according to an Office of Management and Budget memo on Tuesday. The agency indicates that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, better known as food stamps, are excluded, specifying that \"... any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the memo reads.",
      "SNAP serves roughly 41 million low-income Americans.",
      "Yet while the program appears to be exempt from the freeze, \"You are still going to be really worried in the near term whether the federal government is going to make good on those promises,\" Edelberg said. \"And that kind of uncertainty is not good for the economy.\"",
      "Are meals for seniors affected?",
      "The Older Americans Act Nutrition Program, a federal initiative that supports community-based senior nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels, could be affected by the proposed funding pause.",
      "If the order includes the Older Americans Act, it \"would halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" Meals on Wheels said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lack of clarity is creating chaos for Meals on Wheels providers not knowing whether they should be serving meals today.\"",
      "Is housing assistance at risk?",
      "The OMB memo added that rental assistance and other similar programs will not be paused. Still, the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) expressed concern that Department of Housing and Urban Development programs could be covered by the freeze.",
      "\"Even a short pause in funding could cause significant harm to low-income families and their communities,\" NLIHC Interim President and CEO Renee Willis said in a\u00a0statement. \"The longer the freeze continues, the greater the risk that low-income households receiving federal rental assistance could face eviction, and in the worst cases, homelessness \u2014 homeless shelters may be forced to close their doors, and nonprofit organizations may have to lay off staff.\"",
      "Are student loans affected?",
      "The federal funding freeze does not apply to student loans and Pell grants, according to the Department of Education. The funding pause \"only applies to discretionary grants at the Department of Education,\" DOE spokesperson Madi Biedermann said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, an advocate for students with government loans said they are worried about the impact of the freeze.",
      "\"Any kind of freeze to federal financial aid across the board is incredibly harmful to working families just trying to pay for college,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that \"Lots of questions remain about what the freeze applies to and what programs it does not,\"",
      "Meanwhile, many student borrowers rely on different kinds of government assistance to cover costs beyond tuition, Ba\u00f1ez noted.",
      "\"There are other types of federal work-study grants that go directly to colleges and universities, and supplemental education opportunities that go to some of the lowest-income students. People really rely on federal financial aid, and you could see families having to drop out of college or figure out how they will cover this gap,\" she said.",
      "The OMB memo also indicated that Head Start, a preschool program serving nearly 800,000 low-income children that receives federal health funds, is not impacted by the pause.",
      "But the National Head Start Association (NHSA) said that the OMB memo has already \"created panic among Head Start grant recipients who are currently not able to draw down any funds.\"",
      "\"While we understand that this is an evolving story, this disruption, at best, will slow down Head Start agencies' ability to pay hundreds of thousands of staff, contractors, and small businesses who support Head Start operations in every corner of the country,\" NHSA Executive Director Yasmina Vinci said in a statement. \"At worst, this means that hundreds of thousands of families will not be able to depend on the critical services and likely will not be able to work.\"",

      "The executive order directs the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, to submit a plan to Mr. Trump for how military families can use Defense Department funds to send their kids to the school of their choosing.",
      "More broadly, it directs the Department of Education to prioritize school choice programs through its discretionary grant programs, and orders the Department of Health and Human Services to issue guidance on how states receiving block grants for families and children can use those funds to support private and faith-based institutions.",
      "The president is expected to sign the order Wednesday, according to a senior administration official.",
      "The executive order also directs the Department of Education to issue guidance to states on how to use federal funding formulas \u2014 which determine how much money to allocate to districts and schools \u2014 to support their K-12 scholarship programs.",
      "The interior secretary, when confirmed, must also submit a plan to the president outlining how families with students at Bureau of Indian Education schools can use federal money to send those children to a school of their family's choosing. About 47,000 American Indian and Alaska Native students are enrolled in Bureau of Indian Education schools.",
      "It's not yet clear how much the administration can do without Congress to prioritize money for school choice programs, or to allow military children to go to the school of their parents' choosing.",
      "It's also not yet immediately clear if the Office of Management and Budget's directive to temporarily pause federal assistance would affect educational grant programs. A federal judge has also issued a stay on the order.",
      "Mr. Trump's new executive action comes as the soon-to-be-released National Assessment of Education Progress for 2024 is expected to show that 40% of 4th graders did not meet basic reading levels, the highest percentage ever recorded.",
      "The data will also show 4th and 8th grade average reading scores have continued a downward trend, each down two points from 2022. According to the NAEP, 70% of 8th graders weren't proficient in reading and 72% weren't proficient in math.",
      "The data is set to be released Wednesday at midnight.",
      "\"Every child deserves the best education available, regardless of their zip code,\" the White House document reads. \"However, for generations, our government-assigned education system has failed millions of parents, students and teachers. This executive order begins to rectify that wrong by opening up opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs.\"",
      "Federal funding represents a relatively small portion of funding for most public schools, about 14% of funding for public K-12 schools in the U.S., according to the U.S. Census Bureau. States account for about 44% of funding, and localities about 43%.",

      "A government-wide email President Trump's aides planned to send Tuesday says employees have until Feb. 6 to decide whether to participate in a \"deferred resignation program,\" which would give federal employees the ability to decide now that they will resign in September.",
      "\"If you resign under this program, you will retain all pay and benefits regardless of your daily workload and will be exempted from all applicable in-person work requirements until September 30, 2025 (or earlier if you choose to accelerate your resignation for any reason),\" the email states.",
      "Only about 6% of federal employees work full-time in office, administration officials said. There are about 2 million federal government employees across the country, which means that the administration expects that as many as 200,000 may take the government's offer.",

      "\"Purging the federal government of dedicated career civil servants will have vast, unintended consequences that will cause chaos for the Americans who depend on a functioning federal government,\" said AFGE National President Everett Kelley. \"This offer should not be viewed as voluntary. Between the flurry of anti-worker executive orders and policies, it is clear that the Trump administration's goal is to turn the federal government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if they want to.\"",
      "The voluntary program won't be available to personnel in the military, the U.S. Postal Service, immigration enforcement and national security or any positions specifically excluded by their agency, the email says.",

      "\"The substantial majority of federal employees\" working remotely since the pandemic \"will be required to return to their physical offices five days a week,\" the email says, adding that there were plans for \"meaningful consolidation\" that could result in office relocations for \"a number of federal workers.\"",
      "The message to government workers also said that while some agencies and parts of the military were likely to be expanded, \"the majority of federal agencies are likely to be downsized through restructurings, realignments, and reductions in force.\" As a result, a number of federal employees could be subject to furloughs and reclassification as at-will workers.",
      "OPM told government workers who'd like to remain in their positions, \"At this time, we cannot give you full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency but should your position be eliminated you will be treated with dignity and will be afforded the protections in place for such positions.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. military on Tuesday announced it would allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, to use a base to detain unauthorized immigrants in an area in Colorado expected to be at the center of upcoming immigration arrest operations.",
      "The Department of Defense said it approved a request from ICE for facilities inside the Buckley Space Force Base in Aurora, Colorado, to be converted into temporary staging and detention sites for migrants in the U.S. illegally who are facing deportation.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a Department of Defense spokesperson said the base is expected to house migrants with criminal records arrested during \"an operation taking place in Colorado.\" ICE officials and other law enforcement authorities \u2014 and not military personnel \u2014 will administer the migrant detainee facilities, the spokesperson added.",
      "\"ICE requirements for the facility include a temporary operations center, staging area, and a temporary holding location for the receiving, holding, and processing of illegal aliens,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The move is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to vastly expand the role the military plays in border and immigration enforcement. Through an emergency declaration, President Trump has deployed an additional 1,500 Army soldiers and Marines to the southern border, with instructions to erect barriers and assist Customs and Border Protection officials.",
      "Under federal law dating back to the Reconstruction Era, the military is generally barred from engaging in civilian law enforcement, which would include processing migrants.",
      "The Trump administration has also directed the Pentagon to use military planes to deport migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border unlawfully. On Tuesday, a U.S. military plane deported dozens of migrants to Ecuador. Last week, the U.S. used military aircraft to carry out deportations to Guatemala.",
      "The military's role in Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown could expand further. An internal CBP memo obtained by CBS News indicates the administration has considered sending as many as 10,000 troops to the southern border and using more military installations for migrant detention.",
      "The decision to use a Space Force base in Aurora to hold unauthorized migrants is also noteworthy given the expected ramp-up in ICE activity in and near that Denver suburb.",
      "Two U.S. officials told CBS News Tuesday that the Denver area is among the next targets for the stepped-up immigration arrest operations that ICE has been conducting under the Trump administration.",
      "During Mr. Trump's early days in office, ICE has increased arrest operations across the country, targeting unauthorized immigrants with criminal records and those who had been issued deportation orders. But others in the U.S. illegally have also been swept up in the operations, since Biden-era limits on immigration enforcement have been revoked.",
      "Large ICE operations have already been conducted in Chicago and New York City, and the agency is expected to do the same in the Denver-area communities like Aurora, which the president frequently cited on the campaign trail when vowing to crack down on illegal immigration. The Colorado city gained national attention over concerns about the presence of the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua.",
      "What will happen to Tren de Aragua members who are arrested is unclear, as Venezuela currently rejects U.S. deportations. However, CBS News reported Sunday that the Trump administration is considering an agreement with El Salvador that would allow the U.S. to deport suspected Tren de Aragua gangsters to that small Central American country, which has overseen a mass incarceration effort against gangs.",

      "Inside the ICE field office in Manhattan on Tuesday, the agency's ranks were enlarged by other agencies, including Noem, now ordered by the Trump administration. The plan was to carry out multiple predawn raids targeting undocumented immigrants with criminal records, with charges ranging from murder to theft to kidnapping. The short-term goal is 500 arrests over a weeklong operation in New York.",
      "One of the targets of Tuesday's raids was a Venezuelan national and suspected gang member wanted out of Colorado on multiple felony warrants for kidnapping, burglary and a gun crime, according to authorities.",
      "Around 5:30 a.m., heavily armed agents raided an apartment building in the Bronx and found the suspect and three other male associates. They were all handcuffed without incident. Three children were also found in the apartment, but their immigration status was not immediately known. Authorities will now check to see if they have a caregiver or if Child Protective Services needs to be brought in.",
      "The next stop was a residence less than two miles away. After some negotiation, the officers made their way inside, but came up empty because their targets weren't home.",
      "Federal law enforcement is working with limited help from the New York City Police Department because of the city's laws protecting undocumented immigrants. New York City Mayor Eric Adams, however, has been cooperative with ICE and DHS.",
      "\"I talked to him on the phone probably four or five times last night, and how one of these individuals was so dangerous, and that we needed the backup of the NYPD to be there in case things went south,\" Noem said.",

      "A palm-sized mammal that lives underground in California  has been caught alive on camera for the first time.",
      "Three undergraduate students came up with an idea to capture the elusive Mount Lyell shrew, native to the Eastern Sierra Nevada region, as part of their fall 2024 project. Vishal Subramanyan, Prakrit Jain and Harper Forbes laid out over 100 traps last November and checked them every two hours, for three days and four nights, to photograph the tiny creatures.",
      "\"The hardest part of getting the photos was one, they're incredibly fast cuz they're always running around,\" Subramanyan told CBS News.",
      "Another reason the Mount Lynell shrews had never been captured alive on camera is that they have an incredibly fast metabolism, Subramanyan said. He and Jain were already taking photos of small mammals for their mammalogy class when they learned that this particular animal had never been photographed before, so they devised a plan.",
      "Researchers have set up similar pitfall traps to capture the shrews, but if they're left in the trap for more than two hours, they'll simply starve to death. That's why Subramanyan, Jain and Forbes had to check their traps every two hours.",
      "To take the photos, the students set up a white background on the bottom of a box, using glass on the top so they could photograph through it. They also had a terrarium with soil and mealworms for the shrews.",
      "The tiny mammals are active through day and night because they have to constantly feed on insects and arachnids to survive. Another challenge in getting the photos were cold fingers, Subramanyan said.",
      "Temperatures in the mountain fell to 15 degrees during the expedition funded with the help of Cal Academy. Subramanyan was part of the organization's inaugural California Creators for Nature program that aims to engage people on social media in conversations about nature, climate and environmental justice.",
      "\"There's a fair number of animals in the U.S. that have never had their photos taken, or there are very little or poor quality photos,\" Jain said, adding that he hopes to continue taking photos of wildlife to aid conservation efforts.",
      "In addition to helping raise awareness about the small mammals facing threats from climate change \u2014 with 89% projected loss of its habitat by the 2080s, according to UC Berkeley \u2014 the students said the photos will be entered into scientific databases, and they will help make it easier for researchers to identify species of the shrews.",
      "The shrews are \"highly prolific predators\" that can eat several times their body mass on a daily basis, Jain said. He noted they also serve as an important part in the food chain for other predators such as snakes, owls and wild cats.",

      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, geopolitics and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

      "\"We have confirmed no payments have been affected \u2014 they are still being processed and sent. We expect the portal will be back online shortly,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt   said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",
      "Confusion after Medicaid programs locked out",
      "There was widespread confusion after Medicaid and other programs discovered they were locked out of the federal health payment system. Spokespeople for HHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have not responded to requests for comment, amid the ongoing\u00a0communications \"pause\"\u00a0imposed by the Trump administration at the department.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Association of Medicaid Directors said they had also sought an explanation.",
      "\"My staff has confirmed reports that Medicaid portals are down in all 50 states following last night's federal funding freeze. This is a blatant attempt to rip away health care from millions of Americans overnight and will get people killed,\" Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden\u00a0posted\u00a0on X.",
      "\"Multiple states locked out of Medicaid portal,\" Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii tweeted. \"This is a Trump shutdown, except this time it's unlawful.\"",
      "Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said he was assured Medicaid would not be affected.",
      "\"What the White House has told us just now is that Medicaid is not, categorically not, covered by this,\" Hawley said. \"In other words, there will be no interruption to Medicaid or Medicare or any grant that floats to individuals.\"",
      "Joann Alker of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families had\u00a0called on\u00a0the administration to issue a statement clarifying that\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0should not be affected after its initial memo ordering the spending freeze late Monday, warning it is a\u00a0\"major crisis\"\u00a0as states look to draw down funding for the month.",
      "\"Any pause in federal funding of Medicaid \u2014 the largest source of federal funding received by states \u2014 would be disastrous for states as they need to draw down federal funds to meet their financial obligations to the health care providers and health plans serving Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries,\" Alker said.",
      "Health centers warn of \"irreversible\" consequences",
      "Even as the payment systems come back online, those who rely on the grants say they worry that new \"delays\" on payments imposed by the Trump administration could inflict permanent damage on stretched-thin healthcare systems.",
      "The HHS website currently warns that due \"to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "In a statement ahead of the lockout, HHS\u00a0announced\u00a0it would be reevaluating \"all programs, regulations, and guidance to ensure Federal taxpayer dollars are not being used to pay for or promote elective abortion\" following a previous\u00a0executive order.",
      "\"Even with the best of intentions, these types of funding freezes can do tremendous harm. And could be irreversible to some communities. What we're really talking about is a health center's ability to pay salaries,\" said Amanda Pears Kelly, CEO of the group Advocates for Community Health.",
      "The group lobbies on behalf of community health centers, which are subsidized by the federal government to offer health care to low-income communities.",
      "Pears Kelly said that health centers often rely on being able to request money every-other-week through the system, drawing down their grant to pay bills and make payroll for their staff. Without the money, she warned many health centers facing already slim margins could be forced to trim staff or close their doors.",
      "\"When the system's down, and there's no one to talk to to understand what they need to do, and then on top of that there's an uncertain time to the delay, it's paralyzing,\" said Pears Kelly.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association warned that health centers could face \"significant disruption\" to operations even with a \"temporary funding pause.\"",
      "\"For many patients, Title X-funded health centers serve as their sole source of health care. The Title X family planning program is already chronically underfunded, and this executive action risks destabilizing a health provider network that is already operating under immense strain,\" said Clare Coleman, president and CEO of the association.",
      "School lunches, other programs worry about impact",
      "The implications of the federal grant pause go beyond HHS, but the full effects are still unknown.",
      "It's unclear whether the National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools and school districts each month for the meals they serve children, will still receive funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture if the freeze takes effect. The program feeds about 28 million American schoolchildren each month.",
      "Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations at the School Nutrition Association, said her organization is asking the USDA for more information.",
      "\"We're urging Congress to increase reimbursements for school meals given the financial crisis facing meal programs today, so certainly there's just no room in the budget for missed reimbursements,\" she said.",
      "Meals on Wheels, a nonprofit organization that delivers about 250 million meals each year to more than 2 million seniors, receives federal grant funding. They're not sure what's next either.",
      "\"If in fact this order includes the Older Americans Act, this would presumably halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" a Meals on Wheels spokesperson said. \"And the lack of clarity and uncertainty right now is creating chaos for local Meals on Wheels providers not knowing for sure whether they should be serving meals today, which unfortunately means seniors will panic not knowing where their next meals will come from.\"",
      "They added that since the program is already underfunded, local providers generally \"don't have the ability to absorb a blow like this, especially if it persists for any extended period.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:41:02 -0500",
    "summary": "The Fed is expected to hold off on another rate cut at its Jan. 29 meeting. Here's what it means for your finances.",
    "story": [
      "Borrowers hoping for more financial relief from the Federal Reserve may have a wait on their hands, as the central bank is expected to hit the pause button on additional rate cuts at its Jan. 29 meeting.",
      "The Fed is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady on Wednesday at its current range between 4.25% to 4.5%, according to more than 9 in 10 economists polled by financial data site FactSet. Most economists also predict the Fed will hold off on cutting at its March 19 meeting, which means the next rate cut might not occur until the central bank's May 7 meeting, FactSet data shows.",
      "A January pause would mark an end, at least temporarily, to the Fed's flurry of rate cuts that started in September 2024 which have pushed down the federal funds rate by one percentage point. That's helped trim borrowing costs for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other debt, providing some respite to inflation-pinched consumers and businesses.",
      "But in December, the Fed signaled that it expects fewer cuts\u00a0in 2025 than it had earlier projected, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointing to inflation that remains above the central bank's goal of an annual 2% rate. On top of that, economists say it's likely the Fed wants to take a wait-and-see approach to the Trump administration's policies such as adding new tariffs and widespread deportations of immigrants, which could both prove inflationary.",
      "\"The reason why the Fed isn't jumping the gun at lowering the rates faster and further is that, on one hand, inflation is not gone. They looked carefully at the data, and it is still stubbornly above target, so there is concern if you lower rates further, inflation would tick up again,\" Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Secondly, he added, \"Tariffs or mass deportations are expected to be inflationary. For that reason, the Fed is also right to be careful about lowering rates.\"",
      "Here's what to know about a rate pause by the fed.",
      "When does the Fed make its next rate decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will announce its rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Jan. 29, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. EST.",
      "How will a pause on rate cuts impact my money?",
      "The Fed cut its benchmark rate three times last year, kicking off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September. That was followed by two consecutive\u00a00.25 percentage point cuts: one at its November meeting and a second at its December meeting.",
      "But a pause in early 2025 means that consumers can't expect additional near-term relief on borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"Anyone hoping for the Fed to ride in as the cavalry and rescue you from high interest rates anytime soon is going to be really disappointed,\" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, in an email. \"That's true whether you're talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards or most anything else.\"",
      "Because credit card rates and other borrowing costs aren't likely to change, consumers should work on getting their higher-interest debt under control, Schulz added. Turning to a 0% balance transfer credit card or consolidating credit card debt with a personal loan can prove helpful with lowering interest payments, he noted.",
      "If there's a bright side, it's for savers, given that they should still be able to find solid rates on high-yield savings accounts, even though they've declined since the Fed began trimming its benchmark rate last year, Schulz said. Some savings accounts are still paying above 4%, down from about 5% a year ago.",
      "\"Returns on high-yield savings accounts have fallen from their record levels as the Fed has moved to lower rates. However, as the Fed pauses, that decline should slow as well,\" he said.",
      "When will mortgage rates come down?",
      "One of the disappointments for house hunters, as well as homeowners who want to refinance into lower rates, has been stubbornly high mortgage rates. Despite the Fed's three rate cuts last year, the average 30-year home loan remains near 7%, near 25-year highs.",
      "Mortgage rates haven't declined despite the Fed's cuts because home loans are based on a number of factors besides the federal funds rate, including broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "Given concerns from economists that President Trump's plans could prove inflationary, mortgage rates might not come down anytime soon, experts said.",
      "\"The general consensus is that rates will likely remain unchanged until the market has more clarity around potential policy impacts as it relates to immigration, taxes and tariffs,\" noted Austin Walker, CEO of A. Walker & Co., a housing finance company.",
      "Will interest rates go down under President Trump?",
      "Last week at the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would \"demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world.\"",
      "It's unlikely that Mr. Trump could influence the Fed to lower rates, as the central bank is an independent institution that bases its decisions on economic data, rather than orders from elected officials, experts say.",
      "Rates are set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which consists of 12 members \u2014 seven members come from the Fed's Board of Governors; four stem from the eleven Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis, and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Powell, meanwhile, has said he won't step down if Mr. Trump, who has previously criticized Powell's performance, asks him to resign, adding that the president doesn't have the power to fire or demote the Fed chair. His term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "At the same time, economists are forecasting more rate cuts in 2025, but not until May or even later, according to FactSet polling. But one wild card is whether inflation could tick higher in early 2025 due to the Trump administration's policies.",
      "\"Importantly, the outlook is clouded by heightened policy uncertainty as a new administration takes office,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in an email. Daco added he is forecasting three 0.25 percentage point cuts this year \u2014 in March, June and September. \"This year, we expect the Fed will tread carefully.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:28:23 -0500",
    "summary": "A different strain of H5N9 has shown up in U.S. birds before.",
    "story": [
      "A California duck farm made headlines this week after the World Organization of Animal Health published a report by U.S. authorities that a strain of bird flu that scientists call H5N9 had been found among sick birds in the flock.",
      "This is far from the first time that H5N9 has been found in birds around the country. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was the first time that H5N9 had been found in American poultry sick with \"highly pathogenic avian influenza,\" meaning it caused severe disease.",
      "\"Clinical signs included increased mortality. State officials have quarantined the affected premises,\" the USDA said of the flock.",
      "What is H5N9 and how is it different from H5N1?",
      "Scientists classify bird flu viruses by which kind of two key proteins are inside of them: the hemagglutinin, like H5 or H3, and the neuraminidase, like N1 or N9.",
      "Different blends of those two proteins alongside many other mutations elsewhere in the virus can affect how sick people and animals get and how it spreads.",
      "H5N1 has been the dominant grouping of strains fueling this past year's outbreaks in the U.S., with different variants of that virus spreading in wild birds, poultry flocks, dairy cattle, pets and into at least 67 confirmed human cases.",
      "A spokesperson for the department said that scientists believe the H5N9 was the result of a \"reassortment,\" where H5N1 was able to\u00a0genetically mix\u00a0with other influenza viruses inside of a duck.",
      "\"The finding was not unexpected, as it is not uncommon to see reassortments and ducks are reservoir hosts for influenza A viruses,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Both H5N9 and H5N1 were found to be infecting ducks at the farm, the USDA said.",
      "\"The H5N1 virus is widely circulating across North America, and these viruses can reassort in species that are susceptible to influenza viruses,\" said S. Mark Tompkins, director of the Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research at the University of Georgia. He agreed that it would not be \"terribly surprising\" to see a reassortment emerge to infect poultry.",
      "\"H5N1 reassorts with other avian influenza viruses quite frequently and even the current H5 HA protein that is infecting dairy cows and commercial poultry farms in the US has been shown to reassort,\"\u00a0Andy Pekosz, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an email.",
      "Has H5N9 been seen in the U.S. before?",
      "H5N9 has been seen before in U.S. birds, but often it results in less severe symptoms, called \"low pathogenic avian influenza\" by veterinarians.",
      "\"H5N9 viruses have been detected in North American wild birds in 2023 and 2024, and before the current outbreak,\" said Tompkins.",
      "Some of the\u00a0earliest records\u00a0of H5N9 around the world date back to turkeys infected in Wisconsin in the 1960s, which U.S. officials\u00a0reported had\u00a0\"mild respiratory symptoms and a severe drop in egg production.\"",
      "The California duck farm's strain of H5N9 is different from those earlier cases because this time it is closely related to a newer variant of the H5N1 virus. That variant is called H5N1 D1.1, the USDA spokesperson said, which has emerged over the past year to dominate U.S. cases in wild birds and poultry.",
      "\"The combination H5N9 is not new and other versions, like H5N5 also exist. Just because this was now detected, doesn't mean trouble necessarily,\" said virologist Florian Krammer, professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in an email.",
      "Krammer pointed to recent detections of the H5N5\u00a0strain spreading from Europe, and then jumping from birds to be able to infect mammals across Canada as prompting more worry for him.",
      "\"It's not really surprising, because we have a history of three years of H5N1 undergoing reassortments that would typically burn out and not emerge as a major one,\" said David Swayne, a private veterinarian and former director of the USDA's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory.",
      "Swayne said that past H5N9 outbreaks have been dead ends, in the handful of times they have been found to be causing severe disease in ducks.",
      "\"So far, I have not heard of any evidence to say this H5N9 has some kind of fitness that is better than the H5N1. If it doesn't have that, it can't outcompete,\" said Swayne.",
      "Is H5N9 a bigger risk to humans than H5N1?",
      "As with H5N1, H5N9 in birds would still need to achieve some key mutations before it is able to spread efficiently among humans.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the U.S. to date. Most cases were blamed on direct contact with sick animals, except for three that have befuddled investigators who failed to identify a likely source.",
      "It is unclear whether authorities followed up with workers at the Merced County farm about potential human infections. A spokesperson for the county did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "If H5N9 gains a foothold in humans, people may possibly have less immunity to the virus than they do to H5N1.",
      "\"The seasonal, human H1N1 virus has an NA protein that is related, but different from the bovine H5N1 NA protein. There is some cross-recognition of avian H5N1 NA in the human population because of this,\" said Pekosz.",
      "Where was the California H5N9 outbreak?",
      "The USDA said the virus was detected at a \"commercial duck meat\" farm in California's Merced County, in an outbreak that started on Nov. 23, 2024.",
      "A total of 118,954 birds were culled at the duck farm by Dec. 2 to stamp out the virus, in an effort to curb the risk of further bird flu spread.",
      "More than 3 million birds have been culled at farms in this California county over the past year due to bird flu outbreaks, the most of any county in the state. California has been hit hard by this past year's bird flu outbreaks, which have resulted in record cullings across the egg industry.",
      "Scientists say ducks are especially susceptible to harboring influenza viruses without being sick, making them common mixing vessels for bird flu strains.",
      "\"Unless you have very tight biosecurity, it is very hard to raise ducks without many low path influenza viruses,\" said Swayne.",
      "Swayne said ducks often need the lowest dose of virus to be infected with bird flu viruses, compared to other poultry, like chickens. One way the virus can spread onto farms is when they are raised outside, mixing with wild ducks.",
      "\"If you look at the natural history, wild ducks are the reservoir of genes for all influenza virus. There's probably an adaptation with the virus. These viruses infect without showing overt clinical disease, they spread very rapidly between the adults to the juveniles,\" said Swayne.",

      "Though Democrats have criticized the court for attempting to punish Israeli officials, those opposed to the bill have argued that the measure is too broad and could lead to consequences penalizing those it does not intend to target, such as U.S. technology companies who provide services to the ICC but have no role in making\u00a0investigative or prosecutorial decisions.",

      "In the letter to committee leaders, the former ambassador to Australia urged senators to reject his nomination as health and human services secretary, alleging that he \"preys on the desperation of parents and sick children,\" as well as his own family members.",
      "\"It's no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator,\" the two-page letter said. \"His basement, his garage, and his dorm room were the centers of the action where drugs were available, and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks. It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence.\"",

    "story": [
      "A civilian jet broke the sound barrier for the first time Tuesday while making a historic test flight over the Mojave Desert.",
      "The XB-1 aircraft, manufactured by Boom Supersonic, was piloted by Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg, the company said in a news release. The plane, nicknamed \"Baby Boom,\" took off from Mojave Air and Space Port and reached an altitude of 35,290 feet before accelerating to Mach 1.122, the company said. That speed is equivalent to 750 miles per hour.",
      "It marks the first time an independently developed jet has broken the sound barrier, Boom Supersonic said, and the plane is the \"first supersonic jet made in America.\" The sound barrier was broken for the first time in 1947, when Air Force pilot Capt. Chuck Yeager flew a rocket-propelled experimental aircraft across the Mojave Desert -- taking off from the Mojave Air and Space Port just as the XB-1 did.",
      "Before today's sound barrier-breaking flight, the XB-1 underwent 11 test flights. The aircraft includes features like an augmented reality system to make takeoff and landing easier and has a long nose that makes it easier for pilots to see the runway during those stages. The jet's aerodynamics are based off thousands of simulations, the company said, creating a design that it says \"combines safe and stable operation at takeoff and landing with efficiency at supersonic speeds.\" The jet is also made almost entirely from carbon fiber composite materials, which create a \"strong, lightweight structure.\"",
      "The company will next focus its attention on Overture, a supersonic airliner that will ultimately \"bring the benefits of supersonic flight to everyone,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a statement. The XB-1 jet will be the foundation for Overture, Boom Supersonic said, and many features present on the jet will also be incorporated into the supersonic airliner. The airliner will also use Boom Supersonic's bespoke propulsion system, Symphony, to run on \"up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel.\"",
      "The company said the goal for the plane is for it to be able to carry between 64 and 80 passengers at Mach 1.7, or about 1,295 miles per hour. Existing subsonic airliners fly at between 550 and 600 miles per hour, according to charter company Bitlux.",
      "\"It has been a privilege and a highlight of my career to be a part of the team that achieved this milestone,\" Pilot Brandenburg said on Tuesday.",
      "About 130 Overture planes have been pre-ordered, the company said. Airlines including American Airlines, United Airlines and Japan Airlines have placed pre-orders. The company finished building a \"superfactory\" in North Carolina in 2024, and will eventually produce 66 planes per year.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Justice Department lawyers and defense attorneys for the three men accused of planning the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks squared off before a federal appeals court Tuesday in a court fight over whether plea agreements reached with the defendants last summer can go forward.",
      "A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is considering whether former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin exceeded his authority when he revoked the pretrial agreements that military prosecutors reached with the defendants, including alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.",
      "The deals with Mohammed and two alleged accomplices, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak bin 'Attash and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi, were agreed to in late July following more than two years of negotiations. The agreements were approved by a senior Pentagon official who oversees the military court at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Brigadier General Susan Escallier, who Austin designated as convening authority for military commissions in 2023.",
      "Under the terms that have been released publicly, the men would plead guilty to eight charges arising from their alleged roles in the 9/11 terror attacks and in exchange, avoid the death penalty. The full parameters of the deals remain under seal.",
      "But shortly after the agreement was announced, Austin said he was rescinding them, writing in a memo that \"in light of the significance\" of the pretrial deals, \"responsibility for such a decision should rest with me.\"",
      "The case arrived before the D.C. Circuit after a military commission judge in Guantanamo Bay, who has been overseeing the case, ruled in November that Austin's nullification was unlawful, rendering the agreements valid and enforceable.",
      "A military appeals court last month declined to let Austin rescind the pretrial agreements because the defendants had begun performing a promise contained in them.",
      "The U.S. government then asked the D.C. Circuit to step in and sought to stop the military tribunal in Guantanamo Bay from accepting the agreements, as well as pause proceedings. The appeals court earlier this month agreed to put the plea hearing on hold and set arguments in the case on an expedited basis.",
      "The Justice Department is asking the D.C. Circuit to find that Austin validly withdrew from the pretrial agreements and bar the military commission from conducting plea hearings, during which the defendants would enter guilty pleas.",
      "\"We think this is the circumstance to issue the writ and effectuate and allow the secretary of defense's determinations to govern the course of the prosecutions of the alleged mastermind of 9/11 and the two alleged co-conspirators,\" Melissa Patterson, a Justice Department lawyer, told the three-judge panel.",
      "Judges Patricia Millett, Robert Wilkins and Neomi Rao heard nearly four hours of arguments over Austin's decision to unwind the deals.",
      "Patterson revealed to the judges that as proceedings were getting underway, the military judge in Guantanamo Bay said he would begin taking the pleas from the three defendants Thursday morning if the D.C. Circuit denied relief to the government.",
      "She asked the court to leave its earlier order pausing proceedings in place if it sides with the 9/11 defendants to allow the Justice Department time to evaluate whether it should seek further review.",
      "Across the arguments, the judges peppered Patterson with questions as to why Austin waited until two days after the plea deals were reached to withdraw Escallier's authority to enter into the agreements and assume that power for himself.",
      "Austin could have placed limits on Escallier's ability to enter the pleas from the beginning, Rao, appointed by President Trump during his first term, said. She later acknowledged that the circumstances of the case and the government's interest are \"extraordinary.\"",
      "The judge said the executive branch had \"every opportunity\" and the power to take actions to exercise control over Escallier, the convening authority, before the agreements were reached.",
      "Millett, named to the D.C. Circuit by former President Barack Obama, said Austin's revocation of the deals two days after the offers were signed put \"all these courts into knots\" trying to figure out the next steps.",
      "The judges also weighed whether Austin missed his window to rescind the agreements altogether, as the rules governing military commissions allow the convening authority \u2014 defined as the secretary of defense or an official designed by the secretary \u2014 to withdraw from a deal at any time before a defendant begins performance of promises contained in them.",
      "\"It undermines the force and plausibility of your argument that the secretary was being prudent by waiting,\" Wilkins said, noting that there are events that could take place that would take away his authority to withdraw the deals.",
      "Michel Paradis, who is representing Mohammed in the case, said it is \"not appropriate\" for the government to ask the D.C. Circuit to \"save itself\" from a pretrial agreement that it entered into, and the defendants began to perform.",
      "The defense secretary, he said, had plenty of opportunities over a span of several years to know about and prevent the deals, but chose not to exercise his authority over the convening authority until two days after the offers were signed.",
      "It's unclear how soon the D.C. Circuit will issue its decision.",

We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,\" wrote Google in a social media post Monday.

      "Google noted that a location's name may appear differently depending on where Maps users are. When a place's title varies between countries, users will see the official name used by the country where they're accessing Maps. Everyone elsewhere in the world sees both names.",

      "Although the federal government will formally reference both the Gulf and the mountain by their new names \u2014 in government documents and official U.S. maps, for example \u2014 other nations are not required recognize them. The Associated Press, whose style guidance many news organizations typically follow, said it will call the Gulf of Mexico by its original name while acknowledging the name Gulf of America. The AP will also refer to Denali as Mount McKinley, since Mr. Trump's position gives him authority to alter geographical names of places inside the country.",
      "The Gulf of Mexico first appeared on a world map roughly 400 years ago, as Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum pointed out during a briefing earlier this month where she derided what was at the time Mr. Trump's proposal to rename the ocean basin that shares near-equal lengths of coastline with her country and the U.S. Citing one of Mexico's founding documents that dates to the early 1800s and preceded the nation's constitution, Sheinbaum sarcastically suggested renaming North America \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" which translates to \"Mexican America.\"",
      "Denali's name comes from the Koyukon Indigenous residents of Alaska who are native to area around the mountain. Subject to dispute over the decades, the U.S. designated it Mount McKinley in the early 1900s to commemorate a slain president.

      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The directive to the CDC to halt communications with the World Health Organization was imposed to comply with President Trump's executive order.",
    "story": [
      "Staff across the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were ordered Monday to cut off all communications with the World Health Organization, multiple federal health officials confirmed to CBS News, to comply with President Trump's executive order last week.",
      "Beyond calling for the U.S. to begin the yearlong process to formally withdraw from funding the U.N. health agency, Mr. Trump's executive order had also instructed federal agencies to \"recall and reassign\" any U.S. government personnel from working with the WHO.",
      "The sweeping directive to implement the order was issued by the CDC's Deputy Director for Global Health John Nkengasong in an email Monday, one official said, pending further guidance for when and how exceptions might be carved out.",
      "CDC staff assigned to work for the WHO are also being told not to come into the office, the email said, pending further guidance from leadership.",
      "Mr. Trump has long been critical of the WHO, blaming the organization for mishandling COVID-19 and saying it gets too much money from the U.S., which donates the most of any country.",
      "At an event in Las Vegas on Jan. 25, he said the WHO had offered to cut the U.S. funding commitment down to around the amount given by China.",
      "\"Maybe we would consider doing it again. I don't know. Maybe we would. They have to clean it up a little bit,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Former health officials tell CBS News they worry the U.S. withdrawal from the WHO could endanger efforts to respond to diseases, both undermining the U.N. agency and also making it harder for American officials to prepare.",
      "The first way U.S. officials would sometimes hear about worrying outbreaks was through the WHO, especially in countries wary of working with American authorities. The WHO also relies on disease experts dispatched by the U.S. and other countries to fill its ranks.",
      "\"As has been repeated many times, infectious diseases know no boundaries and in today's world of rapid travel, an outbreak anywhere is a threat everywhere,\" said James LeDuc, an adjunct professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch.",
      "Between working for the U.S. Army's medical research and heading the Galveston National Laboratory, LeDuc worked for CDC as a WHO medical officer and later one of the agency's top-ranking global health officials.",
      "\"The fact is that there is no alternative to WHO. WHO has the global mandate that allows health issues to be addressed on a global scale in a coordinated manner,\" LeDuc said.",
      "A World Health Organization spokesperson declined to comment on the move. The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Preparing for seasonal and pandemic influenza",
      "The gag order comes ahead of a key committee meeting next month, where CDC officials were scheduled to help the WHO pick out strains for next winter's influenza vaccine.",
      "Influenza vaccine manufacturers and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rely on the data and findings by that panel to decide on the shots used every fall around the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "The CDC also plays a key role as a WHO \"collaborating center\" for flu, serving as one of the world's one of the world's top laboratories for testing and studying the virus.",
      "Many countries send samples of worrying influenza cases to the CDC's Atlanta laboratory for scrutiny of mutations that might pose a pandemic threat, like after deaths from bird flu or swine flu.",
      "Responding to viruses like polio and Marburg",
      "CDC staff assigned to work for the WHO often serve as liaisons with the agency's disease experts, offering insights into worrying new germs the WHO is responding to around the world.",
      "Others work with other countries to stomp out lingering diseases, like the Global Polio Eradication Initiative backed by both agencies.",
      "The WHO also plays a key role in issuing licenses and coordinating trials that allow for the use of medicines to respond to diseases, especially for smaller countries facing outbreaks of new diseases.",
      "Multiple former federal health officials said the WHO also played a key role in facilitating the response and rollout of a U.S. vaccine to respond to an outbreak of Marburg, an Ebola-like disease, in Rwanda last year.",
      "Authorities are closely watching another outbreak of Marburg this year in Tanzania, which the WHO announced confirming last week.",
      "Replacing U.S. expertise at the WHO",
      "\"The expertise provided by CDC and other U.S. government agencies is absolutely essential to the success of WHO activities and to the well-being of the United States,\" said LeDuc.",
      "LeDuc recalled that U.S. staff were once proud to don WHO uniforms, working steps away from scientists from former Cold War adversaries to stem emerging disease threats out of the international organization's Geneva office.",
      "\"I don't think we want, particularly as public health experts, to feel like they can only wave the U.S. flag in those positions. The reason why it worked is because we were able to be American and also to be global citizens,\" said Loyce Pace, director of global affairs for HHS under the Biden administration.",
      "Pace said there are hundreds of American health agency officials who work with the WHO. She said it is likely other countries will likely try to step to fill the void left by American public health officials.",
      "Another former federal official said China has been seeking to fill more posts within the U.N. agency, worrying some U.S. officials about how they may seek to use their positions.",
      "\"My hope is that there's a part of us that will continue to work to see that not as a weakness but as a strength, to distinguish us from other actors who don't have that approach and, frankly, have not been as effective in building partnerships to protect the world,\" said Pace.",

      "The decades-old international symbol, described by the University of Chicago-based nonprofit the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists as a metaphor that shows how close the planet is to reaching \"human extinction,\" is set every year. In January 2024, the clock was set at 90 seconds to midnight, the same as it was in 2023. This is the first time the clock has moved forward since 2023.",
      "The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists tracks man-made threats and focuses on three main hazard areas \u2014 nuclear risk, climate change and disruptive technologies \u2014 to determine the clock's placement. The clock's position this year was set based on \"nuclear weapons threats, the climate crisis, biological threats, and disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence,\" according to a press release from the Bulletin.",
      "\"We set the clock closer to midnight because we do not see sufficient positive progress on the global challenges we face, including nuclear risk, climate change, biological threats and advances in disruptive technologies,\" said Daniel Holz, the chair of the Bulletin's Science and Security Board, which sets the clock, in a news conference Thursday.",
      "Special guest Juan Manuel Santos, former president of Colombia and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, emphasized that the clock's forward movement could be stopped, but only if world leaders worked together. He highlighted President Trump's vow to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and the World Health Organization as steps in the wrong direction.",
      "\"We can only succeed if we act as one,\" Santos said.",
      "Other board members pointed to growing nuclear capabilities, proposals to integrate artificial intelligence into military functions, and disinformation online as major man-made threats.",
      "\"The 2025 Clock time signals that the world is on a course of unprecedented risk, and that continuing on the current path is a form of madness,\" the Bulletin said. \"The United States, China, and Russia have the prime responsibility to pull the world back from the brink. The world depends on immediate action.\"",
      "The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists was founded in 1945 by Albert Einstein, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and University of Chicago scientists who helped develop the first atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project. The Bulletin created the Doomsday Clock two years later to convey man-made threats to human existence and the planet. The Clock has become a universally recognized indicator of the world's vulnerability to global catastrophe.",
      "The Science and Security Board, made up of scientists, nuclear technology and climate science experts, and members of organization's sponsoring board, meets twice a year to \"discuss world events and reset the clock as necessary,\"\u00a0according to its website.",
      "The Doomsday clock was established in 1947, according to the Bulletin's website, by scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project. Then, the rise of nuclear weapons technology was believed to be the world's greatest threat, with early versions of the clock warning of the risk of the arms race between the U.S. and Soviet Union. Since 2007, climate change has been a leading concern that determines the placement of the clock.",
      "The clock was initially set at seven minutes to midnight and has moved 25 times since then. It can move backwards and forwards, with movement away from midnight showing that people can make positive change. The hands were furthest from midnight in 1991, following the end of the Cold War, according to the Bulletin.",

    "story": [
      "The United Nations estimates that about 200,000 displaced Palestinians have returned to the shattered northern part of the Gaza Strip since Israel authorized their movement on Monday. CBS News' team in Gaza followed one man among the masses making the trek back home, to see what was left of his life before the war.",
      "Men, women, children and even entire families set off as soon as the Israeli military pulled its troops out and opened the road stretching from north to south along Gaza's Mediterranean coast for the first time in more than a year.",
      "Since Monday, the coast road has been a slow-flowing river of people on the move, most of them unsure what 15 months of bombing and warfare has left of their neighborhoods.",
      "As the displaced make their way back north, carrying what few belongings they can, Hamas fighters have kept watch, and they've been on a charm offensive.",
      "It was their brutal Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel that sparked the devastating war. But their visible presence throughout Gaza also makes the point that, despite Israel's stated goal of destroying the group with its counterattack, Hamas remains not only there, but in charge.",
      "Among the thousands walking up the dusty coast road on Monday was Monzer al-Sharafi, who had spent months in a tent with many members of his family.",
      "\"Life in the tent is unbearable. It is painful and saddening,\" he told CBS News as his daughter helped him gather a few belongings for the long walk back north. \"In the summer, we are baked like in an oven, and in winter, we feel like we are in a freezer.\"",
      "Still, as he left his loved ones behind, al-Sharafi was apprehensive.",
      "\"I will check what is going on and come back,\" he said, kissing his daughter. \"Inshallah, everything will be alright.\"",
      "\"It is mixed feelings,\" he said, \"but I am dancing with joy. I wonder if my house is still standing or not. I am going to meet my parents there. I haven't seen them for 15 months. I've been in the south and they've been in the north. I am excited, but I still have mixed feelings... it's the sadness we've endured, and it's the joy of meeting our loved ones and stopping the bloodbath in Gaza.\"",
      "He met some old friends along the way, and they all seemed amazed and overjoyed to find themselves and each other alive.",
      "But the joy of the three-hour homeward walk was tempered by the destruction all around al-Sharafi along the coast road. It did nothing to ease the anxiety over what was waiting at the end of the journey.",
      "\"What is all this destruction? Our beautiful Gaza is no longer pretty. The IDF destroyed everything\u2026 They destroyed the trees, the buildings, and the human beings,\" he told CBS News. \"I see destruction everywhere I look. I can't recognize the streets and my way in Gaza. I feel like I am a foreigner. It feels like I left Gaza for 15 years, not 15 months.\"",
      "At last, he reached his old neighborhood in the city of Jabalia. He bent down to kiss the ground, but al-Sharafi said he couldn't believe his eyes at the level of destruction.",
      "He did, however, find his parents, alive and as well as could be expected. It was his father who delivered the gut-punch, when al-Sharafi said he wanted to go and find his apartment building.",
      "\"It is completely flattened, to the ground now,\" his father told him.",
      "\"It doesn't matter, you are safe!\" consoled his mother.",
      "\"This is my where I spent my childhood, and my life,\" he told CBS News, looking at the spot where home had been. There was almost nothing left.",
      "\"This is my mattress and this is my sweater. This is my children's bag,\" he said, picking through the rubble.",
      "\"This is my daughter's teddy bear,\" he said, breaking down in tears. \"I lost all my memories. My home is gone, my family photos are gone. We don't have a home anymore.\"",

      "U.S. allies balk as Trump suggests relocating Palestinians from Gaza",
      "Like hundreds of thousands of other returnees in Gaza, the future for al-Sharafi, even if the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas does hold, is entirely uncertain. But he said he was determined to rebuild his life, with his family, in the place they have always called home.",
      "\"I left my family in the tent because I was certain the journey from the south to the north would be painful,\" he explained. \"I'd hoped to at least find a room still standing. Sadly, they are in a tent there, and I will bring them here to another tent. I will bring them from one hard place to another. I will take my daughter Lulu's teddy bear. This is the only thing left, and I will take it to our tent in the south.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2025 20:09:20 -0500",
    "summary": "The FBI and NCIS say \"virtual espionage\" by China is ensnaring American troops in growing numbers.",
    "story": [
      "The Chinese intelligence officer who convinced Thomas Zhao to hand over sensitive information about the U.S. military seemed to know the 24-year-old U.S. Navy petty officer had a passion for the stock market.",
      "The agent approached Zhao in a stock trading chat group on the Chinese-owned social media network WeChat, CBS News learned in interviews with people involved in the case. But chats about investment strategies soon veered into sensitive areas, including questions about Naval exercises in the Pacific and designs for radar installations.",
      "The Zhao case represents a new dimension to Chinese covert activities that counterintelligence officials are calling \"virtual espionage.\" The practice, in which Chinese intelligence officers target members of the military and others of high interest on social media, draw them into correspondence, and extract sensitive information from them, is a rising threat, officials told CBS News.",
      "\"They will turn over every stone to try and collect what they can,\" Kevin Vorndran, who leads the FBI's counterintelligence division, told CBS News in a rare television interview. \"They are certainly endeavoring to target as many people as they can.\"",
      "Over the course of two years, a Chinese intelligence officer paid Zhao, a U.S. citizen and Navy engineer, about $15,000 to take photographs and videos of restricted areas at the Southern California base where he worked, court records revealed.",
      "With his relatively low rank, as well as a low-level security clearance, Zhao may have seemed like an unlikely target. Yet Vorndran and other U.S. officials told CBS News that intelligence officers working for the Chinese government are trolling professional networking sites, including LinkedIn, to seduce an array of American service members and others who hold U.S. government security clearances into turning over sensitive information.",
      "\"On professional networking sites, members of the military, former members of the military, list their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s,\" Vorndran said. \"It exposes their expertise. And through that, it makes targeting by an intelligence service simple to accomplish.\"",
      "A LinkedIn spokesperson did not respond to a question about whether Chinese intelligence officers were using the platform to identify potential targets, but did say in a statement that fraudulent accounts violate the company's terms of service.",
      "\"Our teams use a variety of automated technologies, combined with a team of trained investigation experts and member reporting, to help stop bad actors and to keep experiences on LinkedIn professional,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The tactic is low risk and high reward \u2014 a hallmark of the kind of \"virtual espionage\" China began leaning on when COVID made it more difficult for spies to travel abroad, according to counterintelligence officials.",
      "\"The intelligence officer can sit behind their desk back in China and reach out to numerous individuals all at once,\" said Ryan Norris, a special agent with the Navy's Criminal Investigative Service. \"They are reaching out to as many people as possible and hoping to get some response.\"",
      "In the last two years, federal law enforcement has identified a dozen such cases and brought charges against four service members recruited by suspected undercover agents of China. Vorndran said given the difficulty in policing this kind of outreach, he's concerned the number could be far higher.",
      "\"We investigate everyone we can identify and predicate an investigation on,\" said Vorndran. \"The ones that we don't know are the ones that concern me and keep me up.\"",
      "A spokesperson for China's embassy denied knowledge of the Zhao case, and did not address a question about whether its intelligence officers were contacting U.S. servicemembers online and soliciting sensitive information.",
      "\"China hopes that the United States will stop hyping up the so-called 'Chinese espionage' risk and stop exaggerating the 'China threat theory,' and inject more stability into Sino-US relations instead of setting up obstacles,\" the embassy spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Easy money",
      "In August 2023, agents with the FBI and NCIS descended on the Ventura County Naval Base, apprehended Zhao, and took him into a small room for questioning. A video of the interrogation, obtained by CBS News, shows Zhao admitting he sent sensitive military information to an individual he met online.",
      "While Zhao said the individual seemed \"fishy,\" it does not appear he knew he was dealing with a Chinese intelligence officer. And while he considered passing along photographs of what he was working on as an easy way to make money, he stopped short of sending any classified information.",
      "\"When I tried to cut off the relationship with him, it's already kinda late,\" Zhao said in the interrogation, telling the federal agents he felt \"trapped.\"",
      "Following the interrogation, Zhao was arrested. He later pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges, and is currently serving a 27-month federal sentence. Prosecutors determined his actions did not rise to the level of espionage. Still, Norris said he believes Zhao's actions amount to a betrayal.",
      "\"He absolutely betrayed his country,\" said Norris, who questioned Zhao during the interrogation. \"I think over the past two years he'd had a relationship that he knew was nefarious, and I think he was finally caught in what he was doing.\"",
      "Tarek Shawky, Zhao's attorney, said his client was also to some degree a victim of a scam. He said their social media conversations revealed the Chinese intelligence officer sought to build up a level of trust before asking for sensitive information.",
      "\"At a certain point, I think the human condition is that you want to suspend a little bit of your better judgment because of that human connection,\" Shawky said. \"That's what makes it so dangerous.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Zhao's wife Jianyu Ren said her husband acknowledged making a mistake, but she denied he would ever willfully sell out his country.",
      "\"That's not him,\" Ren said. \"If he had known this person was working for the Chinese government or anybody in China, he wouldn't have done that.\"",

    "summary": "The biggest iceberg on Earth is heading toward a remote island, creating a potential threat to penguins and seals inhabiting the area.",
    "story": [
      "The world's biggest iceberg\u00a0-- three time the size of New York City -- could drift towards a remote island where a scientist warns it risks disrupting feeding for baby penguins and seals.",
      "The gigantic wall of ice is moving slowly from Antarctica on a potential collision course with South Georgia, a crucial wildlife breeding ground in the South Atlantic.",
      "Satellite imagery suggested that unlike previous \"megabergs,\" this rogue was not crumbling into smaller chunks as it plodded through the Southern Ocean, Andrew Meijers, a physical oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, told AFP on Friday.",
      "He said predicting its exact course was difficult but prevailing currents suggested the colossus would reach the shallow continental shelf around South Georgia in two to four weeks.",
      "But what might happen next is anyone's guess, he said.",
      "It could avoid the shelf and get carried into open water beyond South Georgia, a British overseas territory some 870 miles east of the Falkland Islands.",
      "Or it could strike the sloping bottom and get stuck for months or break up into pieces.",
      "Meijers said this scenario could seriously impede seals and penguins trying to feed and raise their young on the island. The island hosts 1.3 million pairs of Chinstrap penguins \u2014 one of the world's largest colonies \u2014 about 5 million seals, and 65 million breeding birds.",
      "\"Icebergs have grounded there in the past and that has caused significant mortality to penguin chicks and seal pups,\" he said.",
      "Roughly 1,550 square miles across, the world's biggest and oldest iceberg, known as A23a, calved from the Antarctic shelf in 1986. Before its calving in 1986, the colossal iceberg hosted a Soviet research station. falley",
      "It remained stuck for over 30 years before finally breaking free in 2020, its lumbering journey north sometimes delayed by ocean forces that kept it spinning in place. In 2023, the British Antarctic Survey posted a time-lapse of satellite imagery, showing the iceberg's movement.",
      "\"Game of Thrones-esque\" iceberg",
      "Meijers -- who encountered the iceberg face to face while leading a scientific mission in late 2023 -- described \"a huge white cliff, 40 or 50 meters high, that stretches from horizon to horizon\".",
      "\"It's just like this white wall. It's very sort of Game of Thrones-esque, actually,\" he said, referring to the dark fantasy series.",
      "A23a has followed roughly the same path as previous massive icebergs, passing the east side of the Antarctica Peninsula through the Weddell Sea along a route called \"iceberg alley.\" That is the same current of water that famed explorer Ernest Shackleton used in 1916 to make his storied escape from Antarctica after losing his ship, the Endurance. The legendary\u00a0shipwreck was discovered\u00a0off the coast of Antarctica in 2022.",
      "Weighing a little under a trillion tons, this monster block of freshwater was being whisked along by the world's most powerful ocean \"jet stream\" -- the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.",
      "Raul Cordero from Chile's University of Santiago, who is also part of the National Antarctic Research Committee, said he was confident the iceberg would sidestep South Georgia.",
      "\"The island acts as an obstacle for ocean currents and therefore usually diverts the water long before it reaches the island,\" he said.",
      "\"The iceberg is moved by that water flow, so the chances of it hitting are not that high,\" though chunks could, he said.",
      "Another scientist, glaciologist Soledad Tiranti currently on an Argentinian exploration voyage in the Antarctic, said that icebergs such as A23a \"are so deep that before reaching an island or mainland they generally get stuck\" on the seabed.",
      "It is summer in South Georgia and resident penguins and seals along its southern coastline are foraging in the frosty waters to bring back food to fatten their young.",
      "\"If the iceberg parks there, it'll either block physically where they feed from, or they'll have to go around it,\" said Meijers.",
      "\"That burns a huge amount of extra energy for them, so that's less energy for the pups and chicks, which causes increased mortality.\"",
      "The seal and penguin populations on South Georgia have already been having a \"bad season\" with an outbreak of bird flu \"and that (iceberg) would make it significantly worse,\" he said.",
      "As A23a ultimately melted it could seed the water with nutrients that encourage phytoplankton growth, feeding whales and other species, and allowing scientists to study how such blooms absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",
      "While icebergs are natural phenomena, Meijers said the rate at which they were being lost from Antarctica was increasing, likely due to human induced climate change.",

    "story": [
      "Three young African brothers drowned making the perilous central Mediterranean crossing with their parents, a German humanitarian group said Monday, after rescuing 17 people in a chaotic scene that saw survivors drifting away.",
      "Two toddler brothers died when the smugglers' boat sank, while survivors reported that a third child had drowned earlier in their journey from Libya aboard an unseaworthy fiberglass-bottom boat, said Stephen Schrenzenmeier, head of operations aboard the Sea Punk 1.",
      "\"At around 7 AM this morning, the crew of Sea Punk I heard cries for help nearby,\" the group said in a social media post, along with several images showing people in the water. \"Right in front of the bow, several people were in the water, scattered into different groups.\"",
      "The body of a 3-year-old was plucked from the sea during the rescue on Sunday, while a 2-year-old died on board the rescue vessel while medical personnel attempted life-saving measures, said the group's spokesman Gerson Reschke. Survivors reported that several more people, including the boys' brother, died during the voyage.",
      "People were drifting in the water on both sides of the boat when the rescue vessel arrived in response to an emergency call. Survivors were screaming and drifting away from each other, while rescuers got into a small boat and picked people up one by one, Schrezenmeier told The Associated Press.",
      "A family of three survived the ordeal, including a pregnant woman who was airlifted to Malta for treatment, while the husband and child have been taken to Italy, Schrezenmeier said. \"We really hope they will be reunited very soon,'' he said.",
      "Maltese authorities also airlifted a man who had difficulty breathing after swallowing seawater and had severe hypothermia.",
      "All of the people on board were from sub-Saharan Africa, Schrezenmeier said.",
      "The rescue happened in a part of the Malta search-and-rescue zone that is closer to Italy's southernmost island of Lampedusa than the tiny EU island nation. Schrezenmeier praised both the Maltese and Italian authorities for a quick response to their calls for aid.",
      "Sea Punks 1 transferred 15 survivors and the two bodies to an Italian coast guard vessel, which brought them to Lampedusa. Many showed signs of severe hypothermia, the group said.",
      "\"Our thoughts are with the relatives who lost people they loved today,\" the group said on social media.",
      "Triggerwarnung: Tod durch Ertrinken:\n\nHilferufe ganz in der N\u00e4he der Sea Punk I, die h\u00f6rte unsere Crew gegen 7 Uhr heute...",
      "Italy's coast guard also picked up some 38 people who were rescued by fishermen, Schrenzenmeier said.",
      "Last month, a different rescue group said more than 40 migrants were feared dead off Lampedusa after a lone 11-year-old survivor said the boat she was on capsized.",
      "The U.N. Missing Migrant Project puts the number of the dead and missing in the perilous Central Mediterranean at over 24,506 from 2014-2024, many of whom were lost at sea. The project says that number may be greater, as many deaths go unrecorded, with the sightings of so-called ghost ships with no one aboard and remains of people washing ashore in Libya not associated with any known shipwreck.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 13:47:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Actress Tracey Gold, who starred as Carol Seaver on &quot;Growing Pains,&quot; talks about her extreme eating disorder accelerated by fat jokes made on the show, and how her TV mom advocated for her health.",
    "story": [
      "One of them is really disgusting",
      "As her character Carol Seaver on television's, \"Growing Pains\" dealt with the perils of adolescence, actress Tracey Gold struggled with her own problem: a debilitating eating disorder.",
      "The studio's actions - which included asking her to lose weight and subsequently gain some back, as well as writing jokes about her weight into the show - made it difficult for Gold to separate herself from her character. However, in the same way art influenced reality, Gold says it was her TV mother, Joanna Kerns, who would ultimately look out for her, pressuring the crew to help get her healthy.",
      "After three seasons, Gold noticed the writing on the show \"became a little edgier,\" as the program angled to \"be funnier\" and \"stay on top.\"",

      "Joanna Kerns, left, and Tracey Gold starred as Maggie and Carol Seaver on \"Growing Pains.\" (ABC Photo Archives/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images)",
      "\"Unfortunately, I think in that time it became at my expense, and it became because they started to have Mike Seaver make fat jokes about Carol Seaver,\" she said of Kirk Cameron's character, who played Gold's older brother on the show, during an episode of the late Shannen Doherty's podcast, \"Let's Be Clear.\"",
      "A member of the cast, but only a child, Gold said she felt she did not have much say in the direction of her character. \"One thing you have to know about being a child actor. I always say this when I talk to kids who want to be child actors, I'm like, you have to be the best person on that set. You watch the adults messing up. You watch the adults, you know, laughing, forgetting their lines. They are allowed to do that. You, as a child actor, you need to get there. You need to know your lines. You shut your mouth and you do your job,\" she explained.",
      "Tracey Gold said that her character Carol started being the butt of Kirk Cameron's jokes, who played her older brother Mike. (ABC Photo Archives/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images)",
      "\"The ambiance on a set is that way. So when these jokes would come in, I really had no voice, so I would sort of just be like, I don't think I'm allowed to say anything. But I had power, a little bit, because Carol Seaver was all of a sudden, she was mine and I had created her and I was known for her, so all of a sudden I also felt protective of her a little bit.\"",
      "Gold said at the time, she was not hyper-fixated on her weight, so jokes were easier to accept, although after going on hiatus one summer, things changed. \"I came [back with] the freshman 15 basically, and then the jokes accelerated when I came back and became meaner,\" she recalled. \"It was out of my character to speak up, but it was hurting me, and I was sensitive to it. And I knew I had gained a little bit of weight, and I had never had that problem before.\"",

      "Although she had struggled in the past with disordered eating, the catalyst then had been different. \"It was about staying childlike, you know, scared of hitting puberty.\"",
      "Gold found herself negotiating with the crew, many of whom were men. \"Whether I like it or not. The set did have an element of misogyny to it because they're always bringing in the beautiful actress of the week \u2026 a few years older than me and coming in and, you know, dolling them up and sexualizing that and all of those things,\" she said. \"It was a boys club. It really was a boys club.\"",
      "\"They would say, you don't have any brothers, so you don't know what this is like. This is what brothers and sisters do to each other,\" said Gold, who grew up with four sisters. Although the jokes continued to hurt, \"It'd be like a joke like, \u2018Here comes wide load.\u2019 And you're not talking just about Carol anymore. You're talking about me, Tracey Gold. And now I have to be in front of an audience that's laughing at me and my body and my weight.\"",
      "Tracey Gold says the show asked her to first lose weight and then gain it. (ABC Photo Archives/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images)",
      "The studio eventually called Gold's father, who was her agent, and requested she lose weight.",
      "\"That was a blow,\" Gold said, who would end up on a 500 calorie diet. \"So within a month I had lost 20 pounds. Easily,\" she said. \"I did it and I did it quietly, and I didn't tell anyone I was doing it. I just went and did it. And all of a sudden, everybody's coming up to me on the set, you know, everywhere, kind of going, \u2018Oh my god, you look so good, you look so beautiful, you look so amazing.\u2019\"",
      "\"At that time, I think everybody \u2026 meant well, but in my view of it, it was like, was I that embarrassing before? Was I absolutely kidding myself that I could go on National TV, be Carol Seaver, and I really was that person they were saying those jokes about?\"",
      "Tracey Gold would go days without eating while filming \"Growing Pains.\" (ABC Photo Archives/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images)",
      "Things then shifted - for the worse. \"Something hit me, and I'm like, 'I will not be the butt of anybody's joke again,'\" she said.",
      "The actress would go days without eating.",
      "\"I would make negotiations with myself. But as I'm doing this, I'm getting lower and lower and lower and lower in weight. But you know, you're in Hollywood, and everybody just kept giving me compliments. And it was making [my then-boyfriend] furious that everybody was complimenting me because he knew I was sick,\" she said of her husband Roby Marshall, whom she was introduced to by Kerns. The couple married in 1994, two years after the show ended.",
      "Her weight influenced the show. \"And then all of a sudden, the jokes came about Carol's working out. Carol becomes homecoming queen.\"",

      "\"It reinforces\u2026.that like having like 10, 15 extra pounds on you when you're 18 and figuring it out is really just bad. And it put me into a tailspin that I just found I couldn't get out of. You know, people asked me, did I think it was a cry for help? No, I don't. I think it was a really internal thing. I don't think I wanted help at that point. I wanted to keep myself safe and protected. It was a self-coping mechanism to keep myself safe,\" she explained.",
      "\"I became very, very, very self-protective of myself and I kept continuing to lose weight. And I remember - and it was the irony of all ironies - they basically said to me, they called my dad once again, this is a few months later, and they say, 'We need Tracey to gain weight. She's getting too thin on camera. She's looking not healthy.'\"",
      "Tracey Gold met her husband Roby while filming the show. He quickly learned of her eating disorder and took matters into his own hands. (ABC Photo Archives/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images)",
      "Although she tried to get healthy, Gold said it was too late.",
      "\"I had taken to throwing up and stuff,\" she admitted. \"I remember [Marshall] came one day to my dressing room and he nailed the bathroom door shut. He went to the prop department \u2026 He's like, \u2018I need a nail and hammer' \u2026 And they're like, \u2018Why?\u2019 And he's like, \u2018I'm gonna nail Tracey\u2019s bathroom shut.' And they're like, \u2018Thank you. Thank you for looking after her. We're so worried about her.'\"",
      "At one point, Gold went on vacation with Marshall to Florida, and the expectation on set was she would return healthier. \"He thought he could take me out of California or Los Angeles and I could suddenly eat. But I couldn't,\" she said. Unfortunately, she contracted bronchitis and lost even more weight. A doctor ended up coming to the set and sending her home.",
      "\"I'm like, OK, that's fine, I'm sick. I don't feel like being there anyway,\" she said of being sent home. \"And they're like, she needs to go somewhere before she comes back on the set. And I didn't know, till years later, but it was Joanna Kerns, god bless her\u2026she called the studio and she said, this girl's gonna die on your watch if you don't step in and do something. And something was done.\"",

      "Kerns did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment.",
      "Gold said - without any help from the show - she found an in-patient program that was all about \"tough love,\" although she would sign herself out against doctor's advice days later. \"I took a cab home, against anybody's advice. The only person that would speak to me from a pay phone was my husband. Everybody else would hang up on me because they were told to hang up. I mean they thought they were doing the right thing. And I took a week to find the right doctor. And I go to doctors, I tell them what I was going through and, because it was so public, it was like living in a fishbowl. And it broke the news and everything like that,\" she said of her health becoming tabloid fodder.",
      "Eventually, she found UCLA's Eating Disorder Institute, where she was able to receive out-patient treatment. \"I started to find my voice, and that is such a powerful thing as a woman, as a child actress, as an actress.\"",

I always say no, because I was the one that was very susceptible to it. I think if I had been on the cheerleading team and a cheerleading coach had said the same thing to me, I think that would happen to me, I would have gone down a road of restriction. And you know, was it magnified because I was on TV? Possibly. I'll never know.\"",
      "\"Growing Pains\" aired for seven seasons between 1985 and 1992.",

      "ADHD NOW AFFECTS 15.5 MILLION US ADULTS, SAYS NEW CDC REPORT",

      "KELLY RIPA SAYS QUITTING ALCOHOL HAD A SURPRISING EFFECT ON HER WEIGHT",
      "In analyzing a study from 2004, the team found that carbonated water may support weight loss by converting to HCO3 \u2013 a byproduct of metabolism \u2013 in red blood cells and increasing energy production.",
      "Carbonated water that is high in sodium has also been shown to lower blood glucose levels, the report noted. (iStock)",
      "But the effect of this is \"so small,\" the researchers concluded, that it is \"difficult to expect weight loss effects solely from the CO2 in carbonated water.\"",
      "Therefore, the researchers noted that sparkling water should not be used on its own as a weight-loss solution, and should instead be \"integrated into a broader strategy of healthy living.\"",
      "\u2018Unlikely\u2019 to do it alone",
      "Study researcher Dr. Akira Takahashi, head of medicine at Tesseikai Neurosurgical Hospital in Osaka, Japan, conducted the original research 20 years ago.",

      "While bubbles in carbonated water can create a full feeling, there are also consequences of overindulging, according to DeCicco.",

      "Montgomery said Looney\u2019s kidney function is \"absolutely normal.\" She has been staying in New York temporarily so she can receive post-transplant checkups, but doctors hope she can return to her home in Gadsden, Alabama, in about a month.",
      "\"We\u2019re quite optimistic that this is going to continue to work and work well for, you know, a significant period of time,\" Montgomery said.",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs, so their organs are more human-like to support a severe shortage of human organs that can be used for transplants.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list. Most of these individuals need a kidney, and thousands die waiting.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration only allows pig organ transplants in special circumstances for people who have run out of other alternatives.",
      "Dr. Tatsuo Kawai of Massachusetts General Hospital, who led the world\u2019s first pig kidney transplant last year and works with another pig developer, eGenesis, said how well Looney does is a \"very precious experience.\"",
      "Towana Looney sits for an NYU Langone Health press conference on Tuesday, December 17, 2024. (Fox News)",
      "Looney was far healthier than previous pig organ recipients, according to Kawai, who said her progress will help inform doctors about future attempts.",
      "\"We have to learn from each other,\" he said.",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999 and later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed, a rare circumstance among living donors.",
      "She spent eight years on dialysis before doctors determined she was unlikely to receive a donated organ, as she had developed very high levels of antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney.",
      "Looney, seeking an alternative, wanted to try out the pig organ experiment. Nobody knew how it would work in someone \"highly sensitized\" with the overactive antibodies.",
      "Montgomery\u2019s team has closely tracked Looney's recovery through blood tests and other measurements since the Nov. 25 surgery. About three weeks after the transplant, subtle signs were detected that rejection was beginning. They knew to look for these signs because of a 2023 experiment when a pig kidney worked for 61 days inside a deceased man whose body was donated for research.",

      "Montgomery said his team successfully treated Looney and there have not been signs of rejection since.",
      "It is impossible to predict how long Looney\u2019s new kidney will work. But if it were to fail, she could receive dialysis again.",
      "\"The truth is we don\u2019t really know what the next hurdles are because this is the first time we\u2019ve gotten this far,\" Montgomery said. \"We\u2019ll have to continue to really keep a close eye on her.\"",

      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Use\u00a02FA for your accounts whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of protection by requiring two forms of verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if some details are compromised.",
      "5) Be wary of urgency in messages:\u00a0Scammers often create a sense of urgency, claiming immediate action is required to avoid penalties. Take a moment to assess the situation and verify the legitimacy of the message through official channels.",
      "6) Report suspicious messages:\u00a0If you suspect a phishing attempt, report it to the Federal Trade Commission or the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. Include details like the sender\u2019s phone number and any links in the message. Additionally, inform your mobile carrier to help block similar scams.",
      "7) Use a personal data removal service: Employ a reputable data removal service to reduce your online footprint and minimize the risk of scammers obtaining your personal information. These services can help remove your data from various data broker sites, making it harder for scammers to target you with personalized scams. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Did you know that identity theft happens every 22 seconds? This means that, by the time you finish reading this sentence, someone has likely had their identity stolen. At best, identity theft will steal away your time and patience. But more often, identity theft leads to severe consequences, like losing control over your financial accounts, having your credit score affected or even losing lifelong savings.",
      "However, you don't have to be a statistic. By understanding how identity thieves operate and implementing smart protection strategies, you can make your personal data a fortress that's too challenging for cybercriminals to breach. Drawing from the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) latest Identity Theft Awareness Week insights, I'll walk you through expert-backed strategies to shield your most valuable asset: your identity.",

      "Lesson 1: Identity theft is more common than you think",
      "With so much of our lives having moved online, identity thieves are having an easier time than ever. Your most important accounts \u2013 banking, credit, Social Security \u2013 are all digital. Thieves don\u2019t need to know much about you to steal your identity, just a few pieces of personal information can be enough. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics,\u00a024 million Americans reported identity theft in the past 12 months. In their lifetime,\u00a01 in 3 Americans (more than 110 million people) have experienced identity theft. Here\u2019s the part many people don\u2019t realize: You might have already been a target. Maybe your identity was stolen, and the thieves failed, or maybe your good online habits saved you without you even knowing, which brings us to the next lesson: prevention.",

      "Lesson 2: You can protect yourself from identity theft",
      "You don\u2019t need to spend a fortune to guard against identity theft. While professional services can be helpful, most of what you need comes down to better habits and awareness. Here are some simple steps you can take today:",
      "1) Check your accounts regularly:\u00a0Review your bank, credit card and Social Security accounts for transactions you didn\u2019t make,\u00a0failed login attempts and password reset requests you didn\u2019t initiate.",
      "2) Keep an eye on your mail:\u00a0Look for letters regarding accounts you didn\u2019t open, notices of data breaches and transaction summaries that don\u2019t match your records.",
      "3) Monitor your email inbox:\u00a0Be alert for password reset emails you didn\u2019t request, confirmation of new accounts you didn\u2019t open, receipts for purchases you didn\u2019t make.",
      "4) Use two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a02FA adds extra layers of security to your accounts. Even if a thief has your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without a second step, like a code sent via text message or app-based verification. While logging in might take an extra moment, it\u2019s worth it; 2FA dramatically increases account security.",
      "5) Check your credit report annually: Visit AnnualCreditReport.com to get your free credit report once a year. Use it to spot suspicious activity early. If you see something unusual, take action right away.",
      "6) Use strong passwords: Use complex passwords and a\u00a0password manager to secure your online accounts. Strong passwords are your first line of defense against cyber threats.",
      "7) Stop oversharing: Limit the personal information you share on social media and other platforms. It\u2019s a treasure trove for cybercriminals who use it to craft convincing fraud campaigns targeted specifically at you.",

      "1) Contact the affected institution: Contact the company immediately if you notice something unusual, like a suspicious charge or an unfamiliar account. They\u2019ll guide you through securing your account.",
      "2) Change your passwords: Update the password for the affected account and any others using the same credentials. Use strong, unique passwords for each account to avoid further risks.",
      "3) Report the theft to the FTC: Visit\u00a0IdentityTheft.gov to report identity theft and get personalized recovery steps.",
      "4) Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "Bonus tip: Invest in personal data removal services",
      "Data breaches often start with personal information that\u2019s readily available online. People search sites and data brokers collect and sell this information, including your name, address, phone number and more. Can you get your data removed? Yes, but it\u2019s tricky. These companies don\u2019t make it easy, and managing removal requests for hundreds of sites can be overwhelming.",
      "Instead, consider using a personal data removal service.

      "Credit card fraud is way too common",
      "A report from Security.org reveals that\u00a052 million Americans experienced credit card fraud in 2023, a figure even higher than the\u00a0one reported by the FTC. With four out of five American adults owning at least one credit card, the report found that three in five cardholders have faced unauthorized charges \u2014 an estimated 128 million victims. Even more concerning, 75% of these victims reported having their credit card information stolen more than once.",
      "The typical unauthorized transaction is around $100, which adds up to approximately $5 billion in criminal purchases each year. Interestingly, most unauthorized transactions involve credit cards that weren\u2019t physically lost or stolen, highlighting the growing risks of online fraud and data breaches.",

      "Data breaches are one of the main ways credit card fraud happens. Hackers often get unauthorized access to sensitive information stored by businesses or institutions. When a retailer, financial institution or online store experiences a data breach, the hackers usually go after the payment systems where customer credit card details are kept.",
      "If these systems aren\u2019t properly secured, hackers can grab things like credit card numbers, expiration dates and sometimes even security codes. Once they have that info, they can either use it themselves or sell it to others.",
      "But it\u2019s not just credit card information at risk.\u00a0Data breaches can also expose personal details like names, email addresses and phone numbers. Scammers can then use this stolen info to launch phishing attacks, pretending to be trusted companies and tricking you into giving away more sensitive information.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "This is why identity theft monitoring is so important. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "10 ways to protect yourself from credit card fraud",
      "1. Notify your credit card issuer immediately: If you notice fraudulent charges on your credit card, start by calling the number on the back of your credit card. From there, you should get more detailed information on what to do next.",
      "2. Monitor your statements regularly: One of the best ways to catch credit card fraud early is to keep an eye on your statements. Review your transactions regularly to spot any unfamiliar charges. The sooner you notice something suspicious, the quicker you can report it to your credit card company and prevent further damage.",
      "3. Regularly check your credit report: In addition to monitoring your credit card statements, periodically review your credit report to catch any unauthorized accounts opened in your name.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords: Always use strong, unique passwords for your online accounts, especially those that store payment details. Avoid using easily guessable information, and consider using a\u00a0password manager to store and generate secure passwords. This reduces the chances of fraudsters accessing your accounts.",
      "5. Use credit card alerts:\u00a0Set up transaction alerts with your credit card company. This way, you\u2019ll receive a notification via email or text for every transaction made with your card. If you receive an alert for a purchase you didn\u2019t make, you can take immediate action to report it and prevent further charges.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Be Cautious with public Wi-Fi:\u00a0Avoid making purchases or entering sensitive information when connected to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks because they\u2019re often not secure. If you need to make an online purchase while on the go, consider using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to encrypt your connection and keep your credit card details safe from hackers.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Don't store credit card info on browsers and websites:\u00a0Storing your credit card information on browsers or websites can make it convenient, but it also exposes you to a higher risk of fraud. If your browser or the website\u2019s security gets compromised, hackers could gain access to your saved card details. To stay safe, avoid saving your credit card information and manually enter it each time you make a purchase. If a site offers to save your details for future use, think twice before accepting. It's better to take the extra step to enter your information each time, ensuring your data stays secure.",
      "8. Use EMV chip technology: When making in-person purchases, always use the chip reader instead of swiping your card. Chip technology provides an extra layer of security against fraud.",
      "9. Be wary of phishing attempts and have strong antivirus software: Be cautious of unsolicited emails, texts or phone calls asking for your credit card information. Legitimate companies typically don't request sensitive information through these channels. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "10. Keep your card in sight:\u00a0When using your card in restaurants or stores, try to keep it within view. This reduces the risk of someone copying your card details.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It's clear that credit card fraud is more prevalent than ever, affecting millions of Americans each year. The good news is that there are effective steps to protect yourself from becoming a victim. By staying vigilant and employing best practices \u2014 like monitoring your statements and using strong passwords \u2014 you can significantly reduce your risk.

      "It's easier than you think to check for tracking software on your device. Tech expert Kurt Knutsson offers you some tips to help stay secure.",
      "Nowadays, almost every app you download asks for location permissions, meaning it wants to track where you are and your movements. For an app like Google Maps, requesting location access makes perfect sense. It's also reasonable for apps like Uber or DoorDash, which rely on location for their services.",
      "However, many apps that have nothing to do with location still ask for it, and we often grant these permissions without thinking twice. When you give an app access to your location, that data is stored and, in some cases, might even be sold. According to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, this practice is not uncommon.",

The data was gathered through secretly embedded software in mobile apps, such as Life360.\u00a0\"Allstate and other insurers then used the covertly obtained data to justify raising Texans\u2019 insurance rates,\" the press release stated.",
      "The insurance provider allegedly collected trillions of miles' worth of location data from more than 45 million Americans nationwide. The data was reportedly used to build the \"world\u2019s largest driving behavior database.\" When customers sought a quote or renewed their coverage, Allstate and other insurance companies allegedly used the database to justify raising car insurance premiums.",

      "5 ways to stay safe from unwanted tracking",
      "1. Avoid installing the insurance company\u2019s app:\u00a0Many insurance companies encourage users to download their apps to \"simplify\" claims, payments or policy management. However, these apps often collect and track your location data under the guise of improving their services. If the app is not absolutely essential, manage your account through the company\u2019s website or contact customer service directly instead.",
      "2. Don\u2019t give location permissions unnecessarily:\u00a0When an app requests location access, ask yourself whether it genuinely needs this information to function. For example, a weather app may need approximate location data, but a flashlight app does not.\u00a0 Always choose \"Deny\" or \"Allow only while using the app\" unless absolutely necessary. Most modern devices also allow you to provide an approximate location rather than a precise one, which is a safer option when location access is unavoidable.",
      "3. Review and manage app permissions regularly:\u00a0Over time, you may forget which apps have been granted permissions. Regularly go through your device\u2019s app settings to check and adjust permissions. On most devices, you can access this under\u00a0settings >\u00a0privacy >\u00a0app permissions (specific steps vary by operating system). Revoke access for any apps that don\u2019t need it or seem suspicious.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Turn off location services when not in use:\u00a0Keep location services off when you don\u2019t need them. This reduces the chances of apps or devices tracking you passively in the background. For tasks like mapping or food delivery, turn location services on temporarily, then turn them off when you\u2019re done. For added security, avoid connecting to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks, which can also be used to track your location indirectly.",
      "5. Use privacy-focused tools and apps: Invest in tools designed to safeguard your privacy. Virtual private networks (VPNs) can mask your location online and prevent unwanted tracking while browsing.\u00a0 VPNs will also protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFS AS THE LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If Allstate is indeed unlawfully collecting and selling people\u2019s location data, Attorney General Paxton is right to hold them accountable by filing a lawsuit. In an era where cybercriminals exploit every opportunity to scam individuals, companies that fail to protect customer data are unacceptable and should face consequences. Data has become the new oil, and everyone seems eager to exploit it \u2014 often at the expense of ordinary people. Businesses that prioritize profits over privacy erode trust and put consumers at risk, making it crucial to enforce strict accountability for such practices.",

    "summary": "Here are five easy smartphone rules from the National Security Agency that you can follow to better protect your mobile device from hackers and scammers.",
    "story": [

      "Can\u2019t remember the last time you turned your phone off? Is Bluetooth always on? Do you plug into any charger you can find?",
      "Win a pair of $329 Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\u00a0Enter here, no purchase necessary!",
      "If you answered yes to any of these questions, the NSA says you\u2019re playing a crapshoot with your privacy. The National Security Agency\u2019s purpose is to listen and collect communications from satellites, cellphones and anywhere else, really.",
      "THESE MISTAKES COULD TANK YOUR CREDIT SCORE",
      "Let\u2019s take a deeper look at five smartphone rules they use that you can, too.",
      "1. Restart your phone once a week",
      "It\u2019s dead simple and absolutely worth doing. Turn off your phone, wait 10 seconds, then turn it back on. This works to combat zero-click exploits where a hacker can get in simply by sending you the right code.",
      "Heads up: A restart won\u2019t work for other types of malware. If your phone becomes infected,\u00a0you\u2019ll need to do a full factory reset.",
      "2. Disable Bluetooth when you don\u2019t need it",
      "Bluetooth works similarly to Wi-Fi and cellular networks but performs simpler tasks at shorter ranges. You don\u2019t need a cellular signal or network connection to use Bluetooth, and it doesn\u2019t use data. And like any other connection, it\u2019s not 100% safe.",
      "A driver is pictured holding an iced coffee and a mobile phone while in the car. (iStock)",
      "Hackers and scammers must be close to you to use Bluetooth to hijack your phone. But in just about any public space, you\u2019re arm\u2019s length from strangers.",
      "The NSA\u2019s advice: Turn off Bluetooth when you\u2019re not using it. It\u2019ll help battery life, too.",
      "On an iPhone, go to Settings > Bluetooth and switch it off. You can also swipe down from the top right of your screen to open the Control Center and tap the Bluetooth icon.The same steps work for Android phones. Go to Settings > Connected Devices > Connection Preferences > Bluetooth and switch it off. (Note: Steps may vary based on your phone\u2019s model. Look or search for Bluetooth if these steps don\u2019t match your phone.)",
      "On an iPhone, go to Settings > Bluetooth and switch it off. You can also swipe down from the top right of your screen to open the Control Center and tap the Bluetooth icon.",

      "Airplane mode also disables Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, among other things, so it works in a pinch \u2014 but you won\u2019t receive calls or texts.",
      "THE STEP I TAKE TO CLEAR MY INBOX EVERY JANUARY",
      "3. Skip public USB ports",
      "In spaces like the airport or coffee shop, hackers can use them to install malware or steal your data. Now, actual cases of juice jacking are rare in the U.S. but it\u2019s still a real threat. They happen through USB connections, so if a kiosk has actual power outlets to charge your phone using your own adapter, you\u2019re good to go.",
      "Stay away from USB ports of any size, especially when traveling overseas. USB standards are international, and foreign hackers can target USB ports in hotels or rentals to steal your data, even if you\u2019re not using a kiosk.",
      "More and more public kiosks have wireless charging pads instead of USBs. This method doesn\u2019t exchange data directly with your phone, so it\u2019s virus-free by default.",
      "If you\u2019re desperate for juice, you can use a USB connection safely \u2026 with the right cable. Pack a\u00a0charge-only cable for your trip. They\u2019re cheap and compact, and they don\u2019t allow for data transfers.",
      "A business person is seen working on a laptop. (iStock)",
      "4. Don\u2019t use public Wi-Fi",
      "It's a playground for snoopers. Public Wi-Fi is open to everyone, and every device is susceptible, whether it\u2019s your smartphone, laptop or tablet.",
      "Just because a public Wi-Fi network pops up and asks if you want to join doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s legitimate. If you\u2019re at a coffee shop or hotel, ask an employee for the specific name of their Wi-Fi network. Scammers will sometimes create networks called \"Coffee Shop\" or \"Hotel Guest\" to make you believe you\u2019re connecting to the real thing when, actually, you\u2019re not.",
      "Here\u2019s a good rule of thumb: If it requires a username and password to log in, you should only access that site from your own private network. If you do need to access sensitive sites or info on a public network, don\u2019t do it without a VPN enabled.",
      "AI ISN\u2019T GOING ANYWHERE: PROMPTS TO MAKE LIFE EASIER",
      "5. Cover your mic and camera",
      "The NSA says it\u2019s best to use a protective case that drowns out your microphone and covers your camera when you\u2019re not using it.",
      "In \"hot-miking\" attacks, hackers activate your microphone without you knowing it so they can listen into your conversations. It happens when your device has been compromised in some way, usually through malware or an app that\u2019s exploiting permissions you granted. Most folks aren\u2019t targets for attacks like this, but I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry.",

Remove your personal data from data brokers\u2019 databases: Either by searching for your name on people search sites and requesting removals, one by one, or by using a data removal service. Data removal services automate data removal for you and let you track where exactly your data has been found and whether it was removed, not only on people search sites, which are public data brokers, but also on hidden, private databases where you can\u2019t look yourself up (and these are the worst).",
      "Once your data is removed, data removal services monitor data brokers for your data and remove it again as needed (because it has a tendency to be re-listed after a while). This way, you prevent data broker companies from compiling a full profile on you and selling it to the first bidder, whether that\u2019s a hacker, a marketing agency or an insurance company.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "5. Use a VPN (virtual private network) when browsing: Encrypt your online activities and mask your digital location to add an extra layer of anonymity and protection. A reliable\u00a0VPN can help shield your personal information from potential interceptors and data miners.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

While you can\u2019t prevent breaches from happening, you can take steps to minimize the risks and protect your personal information. Think of it as adding locks to your digital doors: set your social media to private, use a VPN and clean up unused apps.

      "French President Emmanuel Macron announced Tuesday that the \"Mona Lisa\" will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum under a major renovation and expansion of the Paris landmark that will take up to a decade.",
      "The renovation project, branded \"Louvre New Renaissance,\" will include a wide new entrance near the Seine River, to be opened by 2031, Macron said in a speech from the room where Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece is displayed.",
      "PURPORTED EARLIER VERSION OF DA VINCI'S 'MONA LISA' WOWS ART LOVERS AFTER GOING ON DISPLAY",
      "Macron didn't disclose an exact amount budgeted for the project to modernize the world's most visited museum, which is plagued with overcrowding and outdated facilities. But it's estimated to reach up to 800 million euros ($834 million).",

      "A look at what's at stake:",
      "Move designed to make Louvre experience easier",
      "Macron said the expansion of the museum will allow the \"Mona Lisa\" to be moved to a new, dedicated room accessible to visitors through a special ticket. That will make the visit simpler for those who want to see the painting and ease the experience of other visitors in the rest of the museum, he said.",

      "Leonardo's masterpiece is now being shown behind protective glass in the museum\u2019s largest room, overcrowded with long, noisy lines of visitors eager to take a selfie with the groundbreaking portrait of the woman with the enigmatic smile. That makes some other paintings in the room by Venetian painters like Titian and Veronese go unnoticed by many.",
      "The museum\u2019s big renovation in the 1980s was designed to receive 4 million annual visitors.",
      "Last year, the Louvre received 8.7 million visitors, more than 75% being foreigners mostly from the United States, China and neighboring countries Italy, the U.K., Germany and Spain.",
      "Costly and complex overhaul",
      "Macron said that a new entrance for the Louvre will be created near the Seine by 2031, to be financed by ticket sales, patronage and licensing money from the museum's Abu Dhabi branch.",
      "A design competition will be staged in the coming months, he said. In addition, some new underground rooms will be created to expand the museum.",
      "A French top official said that the cost of the renovation is estimated at 700 to 800 million euros ($730 to 834 million) over the next decade, including half for the creation of the new entrance. The official couldn't be named in line with the French presidency\u2019s customary practices.",
      "Macron said that ticket prices would be raised for foreign visitors from outside the European Union, up from 22 euros ($23) now. He promised the museum would be safer and more comfortable for both the public and employees.",
      "Comparing the project to Notre Dame's recent reopening, Macron said that \"the redesigned Louvre, restored and expanded, will become the epicenter of art history for our country and beyond.\"",
      "Half the Louvre's budget is being financed by the French government, including the wages of the 2,200 employees.",
      "The other half is provided by private funds including ticket sales, earnings from restaurants, shops and bookings for special events, as well as patrons and other partners.",

      "Israel\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, has formally notified U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres of Israel\u2019s demand for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to cease its operations in Jerusalem and evacuate its premises by January 30, 2025.",
      "The directive follows recent legislation passed by the Israeli Knesset, terminating Israel\u2019s agreements with UNRWA and citing national security concerns.",
      "In a letter addressed to Guterres, Danon outlined the rationale behind the decision, emphasizing \"the acute national security risks posed by the widespread infiltration of UNRWA\u2019s ranks by Hamas and other terrorist organizations.\" He also accused the agency of failing to address Israel\u2019s long-standing concerns and of compromising its \"fundamental obligation to impartiality and neutrality beyond repair.\"",

      "\u201cThe number of civil servants hasn\u2019t meaningfully changed since 1970, but there are more Americans than ever who rely on government services,\" Kelley said. \"Purging the federal government of dedicated career civil servants will have vast, unintended consequences that will cause chaos for the Americans who depend on a functioning federal government.\"",

      "How Americans\u2019 views on immigration have shifted since Trump\u2019s first term",
      "Just like he did eight years ago, Donald Trump has come to the presidency with vows to take a hard line on immigration issues. But this time around, he\u2019s doing it in a political atmosphere far more conducive to his posture.",
      "Americans are now likelier\u00a0to cite immigration as a top issue facing the country and are deeply supportive of efforts to deport immigrants who have committed crimes. While those attitudes do come with some nuance (opposition to policies that would separate families remains strong, for instance), the overall change is unmistakable.",
      "For decades, the Gallup Poll has monitored public sentiment on immigration. Its most recent survey, taken last summer during the campaign, found that the share of Americans who want to curtail immigration has nearly doubled since Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "The 55% of Americans who said immigration levels should be decreased is the highest figure measured in any Gallup Poll in 24 years, since the immediate wake of the 9/11 attack in 2001.",
      "And while a solid majority of Americans continues to believe immigration is a net positive, that view has also weakened in recent years.",
      "Moreover, the country is now almost perfectly divided over whether those here illegally, whether they\u2019ve committed crimes or not, should be subject to deportation.",
      "That\u2019s a 20-point net shift from 2019, when the first Trump administration\u2019s detainment policies were the source of national controversy. The trend extends to other questions, too. The public still largely backs a path to citizenship for those here illegally, but opposition has doubled since Trump first took office, from 15% to 30%. And support for a significantly expanded border wall has reached majority status, a jump of 12 percentage points since Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "An Ipsos/Reuters poll released as Trump took office last week found that a plurality of Americans, 47%, now approve of his approach to immigration. It\u2019s not exactly an overwhelming endorsement, but it\u2019s better than he tended to fare in his first go-round. And given the rightward trajectory of public opinion on the subject, it may represent more of a floor than a ceiling.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 00:13:23 GMT",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump signed a broad executive order targeting transition-related medical care for minors on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump signed a broad executive order targeting transition-related medical care for minors Tuesday.",
      "The order, titled \u201cProtecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\u201d intends to restrict access to gender-affirming medical care \u2014 including puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery \u2014 for minors, which it defines as those younger than 19.",
      "It prohibits federal funding from covering such care for minors, restricts research and education grants to medical schools and hospitals, and directs the secretary of Health and Human Services to issue regulations to end such care for minors.",
      "The order also directs all federal agencies to rescind guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, or WPATH, a nonprofit association dedicated to transgender medical care that issues guidance that is widely used by health care professionals.",
      "\u201cAcross the country today, medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child\u2019s sex through a series of irreversible medical interventions,\u201d the executive order states, using inflammatory language to describe transition-related medical care.",
      "The order states that more children will come to regret receiving such care and that they are \u201coften trapped with lifelong medical complications\u201d and sterilization.",
      "\u201cAccordingly, it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called \u2018transition\u2019 of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\u201d the order states.",
      "Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ legal advocacy group, promised to fight the executive order in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThis broadside condemns transgender youth to extreme and unnecessary pain and suffering, and their parents to agonized futility in caring for their child \u2014 all while denying them access to the same medically recommended health care that is readily available to their cisgender peers,\u201d said Lambda Legal attorney Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, alluding to the fact that the order does not appear to bar puberty blockers, hormone therapy or similar surgeries for minors who are not transgender.",
      "Transition-related care for minors has dominated headlines in recent years, with 26 states passing laws restricting such care. However, recent research has shown that a small number of minors actually access this type of care. A study published in JAMA Pediatrics in January found that less than 0.1% of adolescents with private insurance in the U.S. are transgender or gender-diverse and are prescribed puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones.",
      "Trans minors are treated on a case-by-case basis and are legally required to receive their parents\u2019 or guardian\u2019s consent to receive any medical intervention. Before a child starts puberty, medical standards developed by WPATH and other medical organizations recommend that a child receive therapy and social transition, or changing their hairstyle, clothing, name and pronouns.",
      "Once a child begins puberty, they may start puberty blockers if they have persistent gender dysphoria, which is the medical term for the severe emotional distress caused by the misalignment between one\u2019s gender identity and birth sex. Teenagers might start hormone therapy, and, in rare cases, some older teens may receive a double mastectomy, where both breasts are removed.",
      "Most major medical associations, such as the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association, support access to transition care for minors and oppose restrictions on it.",
      "One section of Trump\u2019s executive order, \u201cEnding Reliance on Junk Science,\u201d specifically takes aim at WPATH, arguing that it \u201clacks scientific integrity,\u201d and directs the secretary of HHS to \u201cpublish a review of the existing literature on best practices for promoting the health of children who assert gender dysphoria, rapid-onset gender dysphoria, or other identity-based confusion.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Secretary of HHS, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall use all available methods to increase the quality of data to guide practices for improving the health of minors with gender dysphoria, rapid-onset gender dysphoria, or other identity-based confusion, or who otherwise seek chemical or surgical mutilation,\u201d the order states.",
      "WPATH did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Half a dozen studies in recent years have found that transition-related care improves minors\u2019 mental health and reduces suicide rates. However, in December, the United Kingdom indefinitely banned new prescriptions of puberty blockers to treat minors for gender dysphoria. The ban followed an independent study commissioned by England\u2019s National Health Service that found that medical evidence for transition-related care for minors was \u201cremarkably weak.\u201d The study has faced criticism from some researchers and activists."

Kennedy Jr. is confirmed as health and human services secretary, it could undermine years of progress in unlinking autism and vaccines, while potentially diverting precious research dollars to a theory already discredited by hundreds of studies worldwide. They warn he would wield vast influence over who sits on committees and steer policy.",
      "And some condemned Kennedy\u2019s past rhetoric around the disability, calling it stigmatizing and insulting.",
      "Alison Singer, founder of the Autism Science Foundation, said she welcomes an examination into potential causes of autism, but focusing on vaccines could be dangerous for children.",
      "\u201cA new crop of parents will be afraid, who may believe that vaccines could harm their children, potentially cause autism, and those parents might withhold life saving vaccines from their children,\u201d Singer said.",
      "She said the concern is that \u201cfunds are spent re-examining what we know does not cause autism, and are directed away from looking in new potential areas of what\u2019s causing autism. There\u2019s so much that we need to fund when it comes to autism research.\u201d",
      "Kennedy is scheduled to begin his Senate confirmation hearings on Wednesday. He\u2019s expected to face tough questions about the misinformation he has promoted around public health over the years, including his claims about vaccines.",
      "Kennedy, who founded an anti-vaccine nonprofit and grew into one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world \u2014 a crusade from which he and associated groups have made millions of dollars \u2014 has prominently advanced a false contention that vaccines cause autism.",
      "\u201cI do believe that autism comes from vaccines,\u201d Kennedy asserted to Fox News in 2023.",
      "He went on to say that his position was misunderstood; he just wants to test the science behind them. But it\u2019s Kennedy who rejects the science in front of him, critics say.",
      "\u201cAre we [also] reviewing the question about whether the Earth is flat? This is settled science,\u201d\u00a0said Rep. Kim Schrier, D-Wash., who previously worked as a pediatrician. \u201cWe already looked into vaccines. They don\u2019t cause autism, but let\u2019s look elsewhere. And elsewhere might be genetics. It might be the fact that now we\u2019re putting a lot more kids under the umbrella of autism who never would have fallen under that umbrella before. \u2026 It could be a lot of things, but bringing up settled science is only going to undermine confidence in vaccines, decrease immunization rates and put the entire population at risk.\u201d",
      "As the head of HHS, Kennedy would hold massive sway on the direction of health policy in the United States. He would alead a number of agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the CDC, former Rep. David Weldon of Florida, is further fueling fears because of his own statements doubting vaccine safety.",
      "Colliding with history",
      "Kennedy often begins his argument that vaccines cause autism by spinning a narrative that he didn\u2019t know severely autistic children when he was growing up, and he doesn\u2019t know any at his age now. The increased incidence, he concludes, coincides with the prevalence of childhood vaccinations.",
      "\u201cI bet you\u2019ve never met anybody with full-blown autism your age,\u201d Kennedy told podcaster Joe Rogan in 2023, launching into a script he often uses in public appearances. \u201cYou know, head-banging, football helmet on, nontoilet trained, nonverbal. I mean, I\u2019ve never met anybody like that at my age, but in my kids\u2019 age now, one in every 34 kids has autism. And half of those are full blown.\u201d",
      "However, people with developmental disabilities were for decades institutionalized \u2014 and, in Nazi Germany, worse \u2014 or otherwise kept out of the public eye, a far cry from the integrated schools many public systems attempt to achieve today.",
      "The practice of institutionalizing children with disabilities was particularly prevalent in post-war America, and often in facilities with poor conditions.",
      "One example of the gap between public understanding of kids with disabilities came in 1965, when Kennedy was about 11 years old. His father, then a U.S. senator from New York, denounced the treacherous conditions at Willowbrook State School. In one of the most shameful expos\u00e9s in U.S. history, disabled children were found to be living in filth, amid abuse and overall horrific conditions, sparking nationwide outrage.",
      "\u201cI think all of us are at fault and I think it\u2019s just long overdue that something be done about it,\u201d Robert F. Kennedy Sr. said at the time of Willowbrook.",
      "Zoe Gross, director of advocacy with the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network, noted that the autism diagnosis was still evolving in the \u201860s. She held up Willowbrook as an example of how those with developmental and other types of disabilities were once hidden from society.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the video of the conditions that the people in Willowbrook were in, you\u2019ll see the people that RFK Jr. describes as having been missing through his childhood. And you\u2019ll see where they went, where they were forced to go,\u201d Gross said.",
      "Ignoring science",
      "Autism diagnoses have risen from about 1 in 150 children in 2000, to 1 in 36 today. In that period, the definition of who is autistic broadened considerably, capturing a dramatic span of abilities. It now ranges from people who live independent lives to people who are nonspeaking or who face serious medical challenges like seizures.",
      "Researchers point to a strong genetic link to the complex disorder and have said there\u2019s much more research needed to determine what, if any, environmental factors play into it. Autism Speaks, one of the nation\u2019s largest autism research organizations, is one group that has called for more research into the role that factors like exposure to chemicals and parental age potentially play.",
      "\u201cWe know autism is highly heritable, so the most needed research is on how genes and the environment interact. Genetic variations may lead to changes in underlying biology, making those individuals more resistant or susceptible to different exposures,\u201d said Singer, of the Autism Science Foundation. Those exposures could include toxicants, like insecticides or plasticizers; pharmacological, like medications; and possibly sociological, such as low socioeconomic status or not receiving adequate medical care, Singer suggested.",
      "\u201cGenetics research is far ahead of environmental research mostly because we don\u2019t have good ways of measuring what we are exposed to in the environment,\u201d she added. \u201cThat needs to improve. We also need to understand how environmental factors affect DNA structure and DNA expression.\u201d",
      "In Kennedy\u2019s conversation with Rogan in 2023, he contended that it was others who ignored scientific studies in the field.",
      "\u201cAnd everybody will say, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s no study that shows autism and vaccines are connected.\u2019 That\u2019s just crazy. You know, that\u2019s people who are not looking at science,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Others say that a refocus on vaccines as a cause for autism could divert funding from needed areas of research. Because of the last vaccine scare, some facets of autism research are behind, including how to help autistic people who have sleeping complications, gastrointestinal issues, bathrooming delays or seizures or whether there\u2019s a link between autism diagnoses and the development of Parkinson\u2019s later in life, Gross said.",
      "\u201cOur concern is, it\u2019s already so difficult to direct funding to these understudied topics,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see vaccines become a stranglehold on funding and choke off this very limited funding that these really critical questions are already getting.\u201d",
      "Parental concerns about a tie between vaccines and autism spiked after a 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield deeming a link between the MMR shot and autism. It was later found to be fraudulent and retracted years later. Among the issues, Wakefield failed to disclose financial conflicts of interest in the study.",
      "In the intervening years, fears swept through the world of intellectual disabilities, not just prompting vaccine hesitancy but steering research dollars toward potential links between vaccines and autism. That put the community behind on research-based treatments for autism and interventions, advocates say.",
      "Hundreds of studies done across decades and around the world have found vaccines to be safe.",
      "These studies followed fluctuating theories about what in the vaccines may be potentially unsafe. The predominant hypotheses shifted from blaming the Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine to homing in on the preservative thimerosal that is used in some vaccines to looking at the volume of vaccines children are given at one time. Each of the theories was tested and dismissed in scientific studies, which included research comparing the incidence of autism among vaccinated children to those who had not received certain vaccines.",
      "Despite those findings, Kennedy supports the theory that ingredients in vaccines or the battery of vaccination schedules have triggered the rise.",
      "In a 2023 podcast interview, Kennedy was asked if he thought any vaccine was effective. His response: \u201c\u200b\u200bI think some of the live virus vaccines are probably averting more problems than they\u2019re causing. He then added: \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Stigmatizing language",
      "Trump himself suggested late last year on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that in choosing Kennedy to lead HHS, he wanted him to look at the discredited link between vaccines and autism. Trump previously told Fox News \u2014 more than once \u2014 that he personally knew a family who \u201chad a beautiful child\u201d before receiving a \u201cmonster shot\u201d of vaccinations then \u201cgot very, very sick, now is autistic.\u201d",
      "Among the concerns in the autism community is that the kind of language both Trump and Kennedy use to describe the complex neurological condition is disparaging.",
      "\u201cHe uses this belief that vaccines cause autism to spread a very stigmatizing and negative image of autism, where he says, for example, someone has a vaccine and their \u2018brain is gone,\u2019\u201d Gross said of Kennedy. \u201cAnd by saying their brain is gone, he means they\u2019re autistic.\u201d",
      "Gross, who is autistic, was referencing a 2015 remark by Kennedy in which he compared vaccinating children to the Holocaust. He later apologized for his remarks.",
      "\u201cThey get the shot, that night they have a fever of 103 [degrees], they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,\u201d Kennedy said then. \u201cThis is a Holocaust, what this is doing to our country.\u201d",
      "Gross called it \u201cfearmongering,\u201d saying: \u201cThe idea behind making this link is that it\u2019s better to die of pertussis as a baby than to live as an autistic person.\u201d"

    "title": "Why DeepSeek is different, in three charts",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 20:46:21 GMT",
    "summary": "DeepSeek has made itself the talk of the tech industry after it rolled out a series of large language models that outshone many of the world\u2019s top AI developers.",
    "story": [
      "DeepSeek, until recently a little-known Chinese artificial intelligence company, has made itself the talk of the tech industry after it rolled out a series of large language models that outshone many of the world\u2019s top AI developers.",
      "DeepSeek released its buzziest large language model, R1, on Jan. 20. The AI assistant hit No. 1 on the Apple App Store in recent days, bumping OpenAI\u2019s long-dominant ChatGPT down to No. 2.",
      "Its sudden dominance \u2014 and its ability to outperform top U.S. models across a variety of benchmarks \u2014 have both sent Silicon Valley into a frenzy, especially as the Chinese company touts that its model was developed at a fraction of the cost.",
      "The shock within U.S. tech circles has ignited a reckoning in the industry, showing that perhaps AI developers don\u2019t need exorbitant amounts of money and resources in order to improve their models. Instead, researchers are realizing, it may be possible to make these processes efficient, both in terms of cost and energy consumption, without compromising ability.",
      "R1 came on the heels of its previous model V3, which launched in late December. But Monday, DeepSeek released yet another high-performing AI model, Janus-Pro-7B, which is multimodal in that it can process various types of media.",
      "Here are some features that make DeepSeek\u2019s large language models appear so unique.",
      "Size",
      "Despite being developed by a smaller team with drastically less funding than the top American tech giants, DeepSeek is punching above its weight with a large, powerful model that runs just as well on fewer resources.",
      "That\u2019s because the AI assistant relies on a \u201cmixture-of-experts\u201d system to divide its large model into numerous small submodels, or \u201cexperts,\u201d with each one specializing in handling a specific type of task or data. In contrast to the traditional approach,\u00a0which uses every part of the model for every input, each submodel is activated only when its particular knowledge is relevant.",
      "So even though V3 has a total of 671 billion parameters, or settings inside the AI model that it adjusts as it learns, it is actually only using 37 billion at a time, according to a technical report its developers published.",
      "The company also developed a unique load-bearing strategy to ensure that no one expert is being overloaded or underloaded with work, by using more dynamic adjustments rather than a traditional penalty-based approach that can lead to worsened performance.",
      "All these enable DeepSeek to employ a robust team of \u201cexperts\u201d and to keep adding more, without slowing down the whole model.",
      "It also uses a technique called inference-time compute scaling, which allows the model to adjust its computational effort up or down depending on the task at hand, rather than always running at full power. A straightforward question, for example, might only require a few metaphorical gears to turn, whereas asking for a more complex analysis might make use of the full model.",
      "Together, these techniques make it easier to use such a large model in a much more efficient way than before.",
      "Training cost",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s design also makes its models cheaper and faster to train than those of its competitors.",
      "Even as leading tech companies in the United States continue to spend billions of dollars a year on AI, DeepSeek claims that V3 \u2014\u00a0which served as a foundation for the development of R1 \u2014\u00a0took less than $6 million and only two months to build. And due to U.S. export restrictions that limited access to the best AI computing chips, namely Nvidia\u2019s H100s, DeepSeek was forced to build its models with Nvidia\u2019s less-powerful H800s.",
      "One of the company\u2019s biggest breakthroughs is its development of a \u201cmixed precision\u201d framework, which uses a combination of full-precision 32-bit floating point numbers (FP32) and low-precision 8-bit numbers (FP8). The latter uses up less memory and is faster to process, but can also be less accurate.",
      "Rather than relying only on one or the other, DeepSeek saves memory, time and money by using FP8 for most calculations, and switching to FP32 for a few key operations in which accuracy is paramount.",
      "Some in the field have noted that the limited resources are perhaps what forced DeepSeek to innovate, paving a path that potentially proves AI developers could be doing more with less.",
      "Performance",
      "Despite its relatively modest means, DeepSeek\u2019s scores on benchmarks keep pace with the latest cutting-edge models from top AI developers in the United States.",
      "R1 is nearly neck and neck with OpenAI\u2019s o1 model in the artificial analysis quality index, an independent AI analysis ranking. R1 is already beating a range of other models including Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 Flash, Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Meta\u2019s Llama 3.3-70B and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o.",
      "One of its core features is its ability to explain its thinking through chain-of-thought reasoning, which is intended to break complex tasks into smaller steps. This method enables the model to backtrack and revise earlier steps \u2014 mimicking human thinking \u2014 while allowing users to also follow its rationale.",
      "V3 was also performing on par with Claude 3.5 Sonnet upon its release last month. The model, which preceded R1, had outscored GPT-4o, Llama 3.3-70B and Alibaba\u2019s Qwen2.5-72B, China\u2019s previous leading AI model.",
      "Meanwhile, DeepSeek claims its newest Janus-Pro-7B surpassed OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E and Stable Diffusion\u2019s 3 Medium in multiple benchmarks."

      "The Year of the Snake has started, and the vibes are all about renewal and regeneration.",
      "Lunar New Year \u2014 which includes Chinese New Year, Seollal in Korea, Tet in Vietnam and more \u2014 begins on Jan. 29, kicking off more than two weeks of parties, customs and copious feasts.",
      "The holiday, also known as the Spring Festival, celebrates the arrival of spring and the start of a fresh year based on the Chinese lunisolar calendar.",
      "Though the snake may get a bad rap across many Western cultures, the animal is actually a celebrated and revered sign across the Eastern hemisphere. And its year is expected to be one of positive transformation as people slither into new beginnings \u2014 if they\u2019re willing to move on.",
      "It\u2019s all about \u201cshedding toxicity in personality, in character traits,\u201d said Jonathan H. X. Lee, an Asian and Asian American studies professor at San Francisco State University whose research focuses in part on Chinese folklore.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s shedding the ego, letting go of the past, letting go of anger, letting go of love lost,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThis is the year where that kind of growth \u2014 personal and macro, internal and external \u2014 is very much possible.\u201d",
      "Lee said that the snake is an auspicious sign for inner work, whether it\u2019s releasing unrealistic expectations of loved ones or getting rid of bad habits.",
      "The snake, which matches up with the years of people born in 1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001, 2013 and 2025, is most commonly associated with intelligence, resilience and love, Lee said. And people born in those years are thought to do \u201cwhatever it takes to accomplish a goal.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are known to have this innate potential to be really successful, because they can think outside the box, and they will endure and they will persevere,\u201d Lee said.",
      "More\u00a0specifically, this year is that of the wood snake, with the wood element holding profound meaning across the three major organized Chinese religions. In Daoism, the wood is a sign of returning to one\u2019s natural state or true nature, while in Confucianism it symbolizes becoming a more polished person. In Buddhism, it\u2019s associated with letting go for growth.",
      "The positive qualities attached to the snake are anchored in two folklore tales, Lee explained. In the story of the creation of the Chinese zodiac, the snake was once a four-legged, happy creature who became angry after other animals isolated him because of his appearance. Blaming the Jade Emperor for creating him that way, the snake\u2019s anger morphed into physiological changes, like growing fangs, and prompted him to snap at the other creatures.",
      "Word reached the Jade Emperor, who punished him by taking away his legs. The heavenly ruler promised that if the snake won a race competition against the other animals, which would eventually dictate the order of the zodiac, the snake could win a prize and potentially get his legs back.",
      "Though the snake didn\u2019t win, he placed sixth, impressing the emperor with his perseverance and dedication. The ruler made him one of the 12 animals of the zodiac. The race changed the snake\u2019s path in other ways, too.",
      "\u201cHe learned how to control that anger. But because that anger was a part of him for so long, he had the yearning to go out and harm and bite,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWhen that happened, he would stay isolated and \u2026 he would grow out of his old skin in order to let go of that past.\u201d",
      "The snake is also associated with love.",
      "In one retelling of the \u201cLegend of the White Snake,\u201d one of China\u2019s four main great folktales, an immortal white snake, disguised as a maiden, falls in love with a man. The man dies upon discovering her true identity, which prompts her to steal from the tree of immortality in an attempt to revive him. But when she is caught in the act by an emperor who guarded the mystical tree, she explains that her love for the man spans thousands of years because he had saved her life in the past.",
      "\u201cThey had this cosmic connection lifetime after lifetime,\u201d Lee said.",
      "The emperor was so moved by the love story that he encouraged her to go save her husband.",
      "\u201cFor people that grow up in this kind of cultural landscape with these types of stories and folklore, the snake is a representation of love,\u201d Lee said."

    "summary": "High-voltage power lines saw a temporary surge in electrical current in the area where the deadly Eaton Fire is believed to have started, Southern California Edison said.",
    "story": [
      "High-voltage power lines saw a temporary surge in electrical current in the area where the deadly Eaton Fire is believed to have started following a \"fault\" on a line elsewhere in the region's transmission network, Southern California Edison said Monday.",
      "While the fault, or disturbance, occurred several miles away on a power line that does not traverse Eaton Canyon, it was detected at 6:11 p.m. on Jan. 7, the utility said in a filing with state public utilities regulators. That was only minutes before authorities received initial reports of a wind-fueled fire originating in the canyon at 6:18 p.m.",
      "\"The fault on this geographically distant line caused a momentary and expected increase in current on SCE's transmission system, including on the four energized lines\" in Eaton Canyon, the utility said, adding, \"The current increase remained within the design limits and operating criteria for these circuits and, as intended, did not trigger system protection on these lines.\"",
      "The cause of the Eaton Fire, which raced down the canyon and ravaged the foothill communities of Altadena and Pasadena, remains under investigation. Southern California Edison is at the center of a wave of negligence and wrongful death lawsuits after videos taken by residents showed the flames illuminating the base of one of the utility's electrical towers clustered on a hillside, just as hurricane-force Santa Ana winds tore through the region.",
      "While the utility said it did de-energize power distribution lines that serve homes in the area about two hours before the Eaton Fire started, the transmission lines in Eaton Canyon were not shut off because those towers are stronger and can operate at heavier winds.",
      "New video also emerged over the weekend taken from a nearby gas station security camera around the time of the fire and obtained by Edelson PC, a law firm suing Southern California Edison. The video purports to show electrical arcs and sparking from a transmission tower in Eaton Canyon, and the orange glow of flames appearing about 10 minutes later.",
      "In its filing Monday, the utility told state regulators it is reviewing the video to assess any connection.",
      "\"While our preliminary investigation uncovered no obvious damage to SCE's facilities, based in part upon this new video and statements made by plaintiffs' counsel claiming damage, we continue to assess the condition of our equipment in Eaton Canyon,\" the utility added.",
      "Utility officials also said they are preserving materials at the scene of the towers as requested by the various lawsuits, and some plaintiffs \"have requested that the transmission lines attached to the transmission towers be lowered for further visual inspection and remain de-energized until that can be accomplished.\"",
      "\"This is a complex request due to the challenging terrain and lack of accessibility in this area,\" the utility said, adding that it is still working to return power to homes in Altadena.",
      "A judge ordered materials to be preserved after Altadena resident Evangeline Iglesias, a plaintiff in a lawsuit, accused the utility of planning to discard damaged distribution equipment that may hold clues to the fire's origin.",
      "\"It's only by sheer luck this footage exists,\" Jay Edelson, founder of Edelson PC, which is representing Iglesias, said in a statement about the gas station security video.\u00a0He added that there will be evidence at trial that \"we believe will prove why this arcing occurred.\"",
      "The utility has said that it will review the complaints and that \u201cour hearts remain with our communities during the devastating fires in Southern California, and we remain committed to supporting them through this difficult time.\u201d Utility spokesman David Eisenhauer said Tuesday that the gas station video will require \u201cvery careful analysis\u201d and that the company's investigation will continue with transparency.",
      "At least 29 people have died in the multiple wildfires that erupted this month in the Los Angeles area, destroying thousands of homes and causing billions of dollars in damage. The Eaton Fire, which burned through more than 14,000 acres, was 99% contained as of Tuesday, fire officials said."

      "O.J. Simpson\u2019s son Justin Simpson is accused of improperly claiming his late father\u2019s Las Vegas home, according to a lawsuit.",
      "Malcolm\u00a0LaVergne,\u00a0the special administrator of O.J. Simpson\u2019s estate, sued Justin Simpson\u2019s company, Primary Holdings LLC, on Jan. 6.",
      "The suit alleges that Justin Simpson moved into the Arbour Garden Avenue property after his father died from cancer on April 10. Primary Holdings, which is solely owned by Justin Simpson, is accused of refusing to repay the estate the money O.J. Simpson invested in the property.",
      "Justin Simpson could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday.",
      "The suit says Primary Holdings purchased the home in August 2022 under \u201can agreement between Justin and decedent to protect decedent\u2019s financial interests while shielding the Arbour Garden Property from creditor claims.\u201d",
      "O.J. Simpson owed money to the IRS and the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman when he died. He was famously acquitted of their murders in 1995 but was found liable in a separate civil trial for their deaths and ordered to pay $33.5 million.",
      "The lawsuit says that \u201cit was understood by Justin, Primary Holdings, and decedent that decedent was intended to be the de facto owner of the Arbour Garden Property, and that Primary Holdings was the owner in name only.\u201d But Justin used his knowledge as a real estate agent to \u201cconvince his ailing father to have the Arbour Garden Property placed in an entity under Justin\u2019s exclusive control,\u201d the suit says.",
      "Although Primary Holdings had purchased the property, the lawsuit says, O.J. Simpson continued to make payments associated with it, including paying the mortgage, utilities and other costs, up until his death.",
      "LaVergne told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that Justin\u2019s actions are \u201cvery selfish.\u201d",
      "\u201cEither Justin writes me a check for what was put down for the property and the increase in the value, the equity of it, which is probably now roughly about a quarter of a million dollars,\u201d LaVergne told the newspaper, \u201cor he can title the property to me and let me figure out what to do with the property.\u201d"

    "title": "Autism community fears RFK Jr. would set back decades of progress",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 03:42:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Advocates worry that as HHS secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could undermine years of work to unlink autism and vaccines.",
    "story": [
      "For decades, the scientific community has worked to dispel a thoroughly debunked theory that vaccines cause autism and finally shift its focus to find true potential causes.",
      "But now, autism advocates say they are fearful that if Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is confirmed as health and human services secretary, it could undermine years of progress in unlinking autism and vaccines, while potentially diverting precious research dollars to a theory already discredited by hundreds of studies worldwide. They warn he would wield vast influence over who sits on committees and steer policy.",
      "And some condemned Kennedy\u2019s past rhetoric around the disability, calling it stigmatizing and insulting.",
      "Alison Singer, founder of the Autism Science Foundation, said she welcomes an examination into potential causes of autism, but focusing on vaccines could be dangerous for children.",
      "\u201cA new crop of parents will be afraid, who may believe that vaccines could harm their children, potentially cause autism, and those parents might withhold life saving vaccines from their children,\u201d Singer said.",
      "She said the concern is that \u201cfunds are spent re-examining what we know does not cause autism, and are directed away from looking in new potential areas of what\u2019s causing autism. There\u2019s so much that we need to fund when it comes to autism research.\u201d",
      "Kennedy is scheduled to begin his Senate confirmation hearings on Wednesday. He\u2019s expected to face tough questions about the misinformation he has promoted around public health over the years, including his claims about vaccines.",
      "Kennedy, who founded an anti-vaccine nonprofit and grew into one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world \u2014 a crusade from which he and associated groups have made millions of dollars \u2014 has prominently advanced a false contention that vaccines cause autism.",
      "\u201cI do believe that autism comes from vaccines,\u201d Kennedy asserted to Fox News in 2023.",
      "He went on to say that his position was misunderstood; he just wants to test the science behind them. But it\u2019s Kennedy who rejects the science in front of him, critics say.",
      "\u201cAre we [also] reviewing the question about whether the Earth is flat? This is settled science,\u201d\u00a0said Rep. Kim Schrier, D-Wash., who previously worked as a pediatrician. \u201cWe already looked into vaccines. They don\u2019t cause autism, but let\u2019s look elsewhere. And elsewhere might be genetics. It might be the fact that now we\u2019re putting a lot more kids under the umbrella of autism who never would have fallen under that umbrella before. \u2026 It could be a lot of things, but bringing up settled science is only going to undermine confidence in vaccines, decrease immunization rates and put the entire population at risk.\u201d",
      "As the head of HHS, Kennedy would hold massive sway on the direction of health policy in the United States. He would alead a number of agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for the CDC, former Rep. David Weldon of Florida, is further fueling fears because of his own statements doubting vaccine safety.",
      "Colliding with history",
      "Kennedy often begins his argument that vaccines cause autism by spinning a narrative that he didn\u2019t know severely autistic children when he was growing up, and he doesn\u2019t know any at his age now. The increased incidence, he concludes, coincides with the prevalence of childhood vaccinations.",
      "\u201cI bet you\u2019ve never met anybody with full-blown autism your age,\u201d Kennedy told podcaster Joe Rogan in 2023, launching into a script he often uses in public appearances. \u201cYou know, head-banging, football helmet on, nontoilet trained, nonverbal. I mean, I\u2019ve never met anybody like that at my age, but in my kids\u2019 age now, one in every 34 kids has autism. And half of those are full blown.\u201d",
      "However, people with developmental disabilities were for decades institutionalized \u2014 and, in Nazi Germany, worse \u2014 or otherwise kept out of the public eye, a far cry from the integrated schools many public systems attempt to achieve today.",
      "The practice of institutionalizing children with disabilities was particularly prevalent in post-war America, and often in facilities with poor conditions.",
      "One example of the gap between public understanding of kids with disabilities came in 1965, when Kennedy was about 11 years old. His father, then a U.S. senator from New York, denounced the treacherous conditions at Willowbrook State School. In one of the most shameful expos\u00e9s in U.S. history, disabled children were found to be living in filth, amid abuse and overall horrific conditions, sparking nationwide outrage.",
      "\u201cI think all of us are at fault and I think it\u2019s just long overdue that something be done about it,\u201d Robert F. Kennedy Sr. said at the time of Willowbrook.",
      "Zoe Gross, director of advocacy with the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network, noted that the autism diagnosis was still evolving in the \u201860s. She held up Willowbrook as an example of how those with developmental and other types of disabilities were once hidden from society.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the video of the conditions that the people in Willowbrook were in, you\u2019ll see the people that RFK Jr. describes as having been missing through his childhood. And you\u2019ll see where they went, where they were forced to go,\u201d Gross said.",
      "Ignoring science",
      "Autism diagnoses have risen from about 1 in 150 children in 2000, to 1 in 36 today. In that period, the definition of who is autistic broadened considerably, capturing a dramatic span of abilities. It now ranges from people who live independent lives to people who are nonspeaking or who face serious medical challenges like seizures.",
      "Researchers point to a strong genetic link to the complex disorder and have said there\u2019s much more research needed to determine what, if any, environmental factors play into it. Autism Speaks, one of the nation\u2019s largest autism research organizations, is one group that has called for more research into the role that factors like exposure to chemicals and parental age potentially play.",
      "\u201cWe know autism is highly heritable, so the most needed research is on how genes and the environment interact. Genetic variations may lead to changes in underlying biology, making those individuals more resistant or susceptible to different exposures,\u201d said Singer, of the Autism Science Foundation. Those exposures could include toxicants, like insecticides or plasticizers; pharmacological, like medications; and possibly sociological, such as low socioeconomic status or not receiving adequate medical care, Singer suggested.",
      "\u201cGenetics research is far ahead of environmental research mostly because we don\u2019t have good ways of measuring what we are exposed to in the environment,\u201d she added. \u201cThat needs to improve. We also need to understand how environmental factors affect DNA structure and DNA expression.\u201d",
      "In Kennedy\u2019s conversation with Rogan in 2023, he contended that it was others who ignored scientific studies in the field.",
      "\u201cAnd everybody will say, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s no study that shows autism and vaccines are connected.\u2019 That\u2019s just crazy. You know, that\u2019s people who are not looking at science,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Others say that a refocus on vaccines as a cause for autism could divert funding from needed areas of research. Because of the last vaccine scare, some facets of autism research are behind, including how to help autistic people who have sleeping complications, gastrointestinal issues, bathrooming delays or seizures or whether there\u2019s a link between autism diagnoses and the development of Parkinson\u2019s later in life, Gross said.",
      "\u201cOur concern is, it\u2019s already so difficult to direct funding to these understudied topics,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see vaccines become a stranglehold on funding and choke off this very limited funding that these really critical questions are already getting.\u201d",
      "Parental concerns about a tie between vaccines and autism spiked after a 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield deeming a link between the MMR shot and autism. It was later found to be fraudulent and retracted years later. Among the issues, Wakefield failed to disclose financial conflicts of interest in the study.",
      "In the intervening years, fears swept through the world of intellectual disabilities, not just prompting vaccine hesitancy but steering research dollars toward potential links between vaccines and autism. That put the community behind on research-based treatments for autism and interventions, advocates say.",
      "Hundreds of studies done across decades and around the world have found vaccines to be safe.",
      "These studies followed fluctuating theories about what in the vaccines may be potentially unsafe. The predominant hypotheses shifted from blaming the Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine to homing in on the preservative thimerosal that is used in some vaccines to looking at the volume of vaccines children are given at one time. Each of the theories was tested and dismissed in scientific studies, which included research comparing the incidence of autism among vaccinated children to those who had not received certain vaccines.",
      "Despite those findings, Kennedy supports the theory that ingredients in vaccines or the battery of vaccination schedules have triggered the rise.",
      "In a 2023 podcast interview, Kennedy was asked if he thought any vaccine was effective. His response: \u201c\u200b\u200bI think some of the live virus vaccines are probably averting more problems than they\u2019re causing. He then added: \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Stigmatizing language",
      "Trump himself suggested late last year on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that in choosing Kennedy to lead HHS, he wanted him to look at the discredited link between vaccines and autism. Trump previously told Fox News \u2014 more than once \u2014 that he personally knew a family who \u201chad a beautiful child\u201d before receiving a \u201cmonster shot\u201d of vaccinations then \u201cgot very, very sick, now is autistic.\u201d",
      "Among the concerns in the autism community is that the kind of language both Trump and Kennedy use to describe the complex neurological condition is disparaging.",
      "\u201cHe uses this belief that vaccines cause autism to spread a very stigmatizing and negative image of autism, where he says, for example, someone has a vaccine and their \u2018brain is gone,\u2019\u201d Gross said of Kennedy. \u201cAnd by saying their brain is gone, he means they\u2019re autistic.\u201d",
      "Gross, who is autistic, was referencing a 2015 remark by Kennedy in which he compared vaccinating children to the Holocaust. He later apologized for his remarks.",
      "\u201cThey get the shot, that night they have a fever of 103 [degrees], they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,\u201d Kennedy said then. \u201cThis is a Holocaust, what this is doing to our country.\u201d",
      "Gross called it \u201cfearmongering,\u201d saying: \u201cThe idea behind making this link is that it\u2019s better to die of pertussis as a baby than to live as an autistic person.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "DORAL, Fla. \u2014 Ebullient House Republicans gathered here this week at President Donald Trump\u2019s eponymous golf club in sunny South Florida to toast the president, Vice President JD Vance and the party's takeover of the federal government.",
      "But it's a question of when \u2014 not whether \u2014 the honeymoon will end.",
      "During a three-day policy retreat at Trump National Doral Miami, Trump, Vance, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and other top Republican leaders largely avoided getting into the weeds of how they plan to pass a sweeping package that will be the centerpiece of Trump's legislative agenda or how to pay for it.",
      "Instead, the focus was on party unity one week into their control of Washington. The conference was filled with sunshine, palm trees and pool time, with ample opportunity for lawmakers to spend time together in a casual setting, rather than in contentious debates over government spending and legislative procedure.",
      "Vance\u2019s message to rank-and-file Republicans during a roughly hourlong visit was \u201cLet\u2019s work together to get much needed work done. Let\u2019s solve disagreements together as part of a team,\u201d said Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who attended the closed-door meeting.",

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is confirmed as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations \u2014 the Republicans will have zero margin for error as they run a gauntlet of tricky issues: raising the debt ceiling, averting a government shutdown in March and passing a reconciliation package that includes renewing multitrillion-dollar Trump tax cuts, boosting energy and tougher border provisions.",
      "When lawmakers return to Washington next week, Johnson said, the House Budget Committee will mark up a new budget resolution that will jump-start the reconciliation process, which would allow the GOP to try to pass its agenda without any Democrats. Once that\u2019s passed by the House, committees of jurisdiction would begin drafting pieces of legislation for the broader package.",
      "\"Stay tuned on the specifics,\" Johnson told reporters Tuesday.",
      "But the intraparty GOP fights seem to be bubbling just below the surface.",
      "\u201cBetween the Senate, the House and the White House, there\u2019s a large list of wants. Not everything is going to make it into the final package, and now we\u2019re in the winnowing process,\u201d said Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., an ally of the speaker who is chairman of the Main Street Caucus, whose members call themselves \u201cpragmatists.\u201d",
      "In addition, fiscal conservatives are demanding that deep spending cuts be included to help offset the ballooning cost of the package. But that could alienate some centrist Republicans like Bacon who face tough re-election races in 2026 \u2014 a midterm election year that isn\u2019t expected to be favorable to Republicans given that they control the White House.",
      "On top of that, Trump told lawmakers here that he doesn\u2019t want them cutting two of the biggest entitlement programs, Medicare and Social Security, leaving Republicans fewer options to find ways to pay for their plans.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to pay for it. In reconciliation, you can\u2019t increase the deficit. It\u2019s got to be paid for. The tax cuts, you know, that\u2019s got a price tag. I think we will be paying for that,\u201d said Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus.",
      "\u201cLook, we\u2019re dealing with reality, not just emotions,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cAnd so I\u2019m excited about the next two weeks.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think what we need to address is the fraud in there if we\u2019re going to ever attempt to do anything,\u201d Burchett said.",
      "One way Republicans could pay for their proposals would be by restarting federal student loan repayments after President Joe Biden froze them for millions of borrowers, said Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., one of the leaders of the Main Street Caucus.",
      "\u201cGetting these loans paid back is one of the easier pay-fors, because we\u2019ve been talking about it for a long time,\u201d Flood told reporters. He added that some of the tougher pay-fors would include proposed cuts to nutrition programs and Medicaid.",
      "\u201cIt will be interesting to see how far the membership wants to go as they explore that,\u201d he said.",
      "Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, a former chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, laid out the stakes of failure for the Republican Party.",
      "\"It is absolutely essential that we pass this reconciliation package that deals with the border, defense and then the tax cut extenders. If we fail to do that, we fail as a Congress,\" McCaul told reporters.",
      "\"I mean, the American people gave us a gift. They gave us a trifecta,\" he said. \"If we don\u2019t deliver back home, there will be consequences, and I think every member here needs to understand that the president\u2019s made it clear that we need to deliver on this.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 01:06:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The executive branch is allowed to move money appropriated by Congress from one agency to another within a department, and this Trump administration would not be the first to do so in order to make up for an ICE budget shortfall.",
    "story": [
      "Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, the principal agency tasked with carrying out President Donald Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations, faces a budget shortfall, and Trump administration officials are considering pulling funding from the Transportation Security Administration to make up for it, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.",
      "The administration is also looking at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Coast Guard as possible areas from which to take money to give ICE.",
      "The executive branch is allowed to move money appropriated by Congress from one agency to another within a department, and the Trump administration would not be the first to do so to make up for an ICE budget shortfall.",
      "Spokespeople for the Department of Homeland Security, ICE and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "ICE was facing a $230 million budget shortfall even before Trump took office and ramped up deportations, when it averaged around 282 arrests per day. On Sunday, ICE arrested more than 1,200 people, according to a senior DHS official, and senior leaders at ICE have been told the agency must continue to arrest 1,200 to 1,500 people per day.",
      "A former and a current DHS official told NBC News that during the Biden administration the average cost to ICE to deport a single person was about $10,500, starting with the arrest through the person\u2019s time in detention and onto a flight back to the person\u2019s home country.",
      "A Government Accountability Office report in May found that from 2014 to 2023, DHS \u2014 under which ICE, the TSA, CISA and the Coast Guard all fall \u2014 had notified Congress that it planned to move a total of $1.8 billion to help parts of ICE that needed more money. Some of that came from other parts of ICE, but most came from other agencies, including the TSA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Coast Guard.",
      "Cuts to TSA could be met with backlash if they led to longer lines at airports and impact travelers.\u00a0Trump has publicly criticized the other agencies apparently contemplated as funding sources. He has gone after CISA\u00a0for weighing in on what it deemed to be misinformation surrounding the 2020 presidential election. He also abruptly fired the commandant of the Coast Guard upon taking office.",
      "Congress must be notified of such transfers, and there are limits on how much can be transferred. For example,\u00a0according to a 2023 Congressional Research Service report, in fiscal year 2023, up to 5% of any DHS appropriation could be moved elsewhere within DHS, so long as the recipient\u2019s budget as originally set by Congress didn\u2019t increase by more than 10%.",
      "In his inaugural address, Trump promised his administration would deport \u201cmillions and millions.\u201d If the average cost to deport one person remains the same as during the previous administration, the Trump administration would be looking at spending $10.5 billion to deport just 1 million migrants.",
      "The average operating budget for all of ICE, which is also responsible for other issues, including customs violations, money laundering, drug trafficking investigations, stopping child exploitation and more, is about $9 billion, the former and current DHS officials said.",
      "In fiscal year 2023, during the Biden administration, DHS moved about $400 million to ICE from other parts of DHS. That money would cover the deportations of fewer than 40,000 people.",
      "To make up for staffing shortages at ICE, the Trump administration is also leaning on other law enforcement agencies to help ICE agents arrest migrants, including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "Former acting ICE Director P.J. Lechleitner said Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a part of ICE responsible for investigating human trafficking, drug trafficking and other international crimes with U.S. nexuses, may be strained in an effort to pull HSI agents into arresting and deporting migrants.",
      "\u201cHSI will have to refocus their invested equities and pull resources off some of their other core areas,\u201d Lechleitner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a zero-sum game.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump signed a broad executive order targeting transition-related medical care for minors Tuesday.",
      "The order, titled \u201cProtecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\u201d intends to restrict access to gender-affirming medical care \u2014 including puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery \u2014 for minors, which it defines as those younger than 19.",
      "It prohibits federal funding from covering such care for minors, restricts research and education grants to medical schools and hospitals, and directs the secretary of Health and Human Services to issue regulations to end such care for minors.",
      "The order also directs all federal agencies to rescind guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, or WPATH, a nonprofit association dedicated to transgender medical care that issues guidance that is widely used by health care professionals.",
      "\u201cAcross the country today, medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child\u2019s sex through a series of irreversible medical interventions,\u201d the executive order states, using inflammatory language to describe transition-related medical care.",
      "The order states that more children will come to regret receiving such care and that they are \u201coften trapped with lifelong medical complications\u201d and sterilization.",
      "\u201cAccordingly, it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called \u2018transition\u2019 of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\u201d the order states.",
      "Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ legal advocacy group, promised to fight the executive order in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThis broadside condemns transgender youth to extreme and unnecessary pain and suffering, and their parents to agonized futility in caring for their child \u2014 all while denying them access to the same medically recommended health care that is readily available to their cisgender peers,\u201d said Lambda Legal attorney Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, alluding to the fact that the order does not appear to bar puberty blockers, hormone therapy or similar surgeries for minors who are not transgender.",
      "Transition-related care for minors has dominated headlines in recent years, with 26 states passing laws restricting such care. However, recent research has shown that a small number of minors actually access this type of care. A study published in JAMA Pediatrics in January found that less than 0.1% of adolescents with private insurance in the U.S. are transgender or gender-diverse and are prescribed puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones.",
      "Trans minors are treated on a case-by-case basis and are legally required to receive their parents\u2019 or guardian\u2019s consent to receive any medical intervention. Before a child starts puberty, medical standards developed by WPATH and other medical organizations recommend that a child receive therapy and social transition, or changing their hairstyle, clothing, name and pronouns.",
      "Once a child begins puberty, they may start puberty blockers if they have persistent gender dysphoria, which is the medical term for the severe emotional distress caused by the misalignment between one\u2019s gender identity and birth sex. Teenagers might start hormone therapy, and, in rare cases, some older teens may receive a double mastectomy, where both breasts are removed.",
      "Most major medical associations, such as the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association, support access to transition care for minors and oppose restrictions on it.",
      "One section of Trump\u2019s executive order, \u201cEnding Reliance on Junk Science,\u201d specifically takes aim at WPATH, arguing that it \u201clacks scientific integrity,\u201d and directs the secretary of HHS to \u201cpublish a review of the existing literature on best practices for promoting the health of children who assert gender dysphoria, rapid-onset gender dysphoria, or other identity-based confusion.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Secretary of HHS, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall use all available methods to increase the quality of data to guide practices for improving the health of minors with gender dysphoria, rapid-onset gender dysphoria, or other identity-based confusion, or who otherwise seek chemical or surgical mutilation,\u201d the order states.",
      "WPATH did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Half a dozen studies in recent years have found that transition-related care improves minors\u2019 mental health and reduces suicide rates. However, in December, the United Kingdom indefinitely banned new prescriptions of puberty blockers to treat minors for gender dysphoria. The ban followed an independent study commissioned by England\u2019s National Health Service that found that medical evidence for transition-related care for minors was \u201cremarkably weak.\u201d The study has faced criticism from some researchers and activists."

    "summary": "Is Oprah Winfrey taking Ozempic? The talk show host says she's using a weight-loss drug after appearing much slimmer at \"The Color Purple\" premiere.",
    "story": [
      "Oprah Winfrey is sharing new details on her weight loss in recent years, including the kind of weight loss drug she took.",
      "In a recent episode of \"The Oprah Podcast\", she said that she took a GLP-1 agonist, which is a specific type of weight-loss medication. Some brand name GLP-1s include Ozempic and Trulicity \u2014\u00a0though Winfrey hasn't revealed a specific brand.",
      "\"One of the things that I realized the very first time I took a GLP-1 was that all these years I thought that thin people just had more willpower, they ate better foods, they were able to stick to it longer, they never had a potato chip, and then I realized the very first time I took the GLP-1 that, 'Oh, they're not even thinking about it. They're only eating when they're hungry, and they're stopping when they're full,\" she said on the podcast.",
      "The media mogul's weight loss first caught the public's attention when she walked the red carpet at the premiere for the remake of \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d in December 2023.",
      "The same month, she confirmed to People magazine that she was taking a weight loss drug, though she didn't share which type at the time.",
      "Winfrey told the outlet that she once though taking a weight-loss drug would be \u201cthe easy way out.\u201d",
      "But she later realized \"the fact that there\u2019s a medically approved prescription for managing weight and staying healthier, in my lifetime, feels like relief, like redemption, like a gift, and not something to hide behind and once again be ridiculed for,\" she said. \"I\u2019m absolutely done with the shaming from other people and particularly myself.\u201d",
      "What weight-loss drug did Oprah take?",
      "Winfrey said on an episode of \"The Oprah Podcast\" that she took a \"GLP-1,\" formally known as a GLP-1 agonist, a class of weight loss medications. It works by mimicking the hormone GLP-1, which the body releases after eating, helping people feel full and slowing stomach emptying.",
      "She first confirmed that she is taking a weight-loss drug in an interview with People published in December 2023, but did not confirm which medication she was taking. Many have speculated it's Ozempic, a brand name GLP-1 agonist that's been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat Type 2 diabetes. Weight loss is a famous side effect.",
      "\"I now use it as I feel I need it, as a tool to manage not yo-yoing,\u201d she told People at the time. \"It quiets the food noise.\"",
      "But the decision to try a weight loss drug was not an easy one for her.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a part of me that feels \u2026 I\u2019ve got to do it the hard way. I\u2019ve got to keep climbing the mountains. I've got to keep suffering. I\u2019ve got to do that because otherwise I somehow cheated myself,\u201d Winfrey said in September 2023 during a panel on Oprah Daily, called \u201cThe State of Weight.\u201d",
      "It was after that discussion that she changed her mind about using a weight-loss drug, Winfrey told People, calling it her \"biggest aha\" moment: \u201cI realized I\u2019d been blaming myself all these years for being overweight, and I have a predisposition that no amount of willpower is going to control.\u201d",
      "Frustration with her weight has \u201coccupied five decades of space\" in her brain, she noted.",
      "She shared a similar sentiment in a March 2024 interview on CNN's \"King Charles.\"",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t work out anymore. I can\u2019t climb any faster or run any faster. I was down to eating one meal a day. There\u2019s nothing else I can do,\u201d Oprah recalled of deciding to get some extra help with managing her weight.",
      "\u201cWhen I tell you how many times I have blamed myself because you think, \u2018I\u2019m smart enough to figure this out,\u2019 and then to hear all along, it\u2019s you fighting your brain,\" she added. \u201cThe one thing I hope people come away with is knowing that (obesity is) a disease and it\u2019s in the brain.\"",
      "How did Oprah lose weight?",
      "Winfrey has lost her latest weight using a weight-loss drug and with a healthy diet and exercising. She told People the weight-loss medication is just part of her regimen for maintaining a healthy weight.",
      "\u201cI know everybody thought I was on it, but I worked so damn hard. I know that if I\u2019m not also working out and vigilant about all the other things, it doesn\u2019t work for me,\u201d she said.",
      "The talk show host added that she eats her last meal at 4 p.m., drinks a gallon of water a day and uses the WeightWatchers principles of counting points.",
      "She's also been hiking 3 to 5 miles every day and doing a 10-mile hike on weekends, noting that she's been feeling \"stronger, more fit and more alive\" than she\u2019s felt in years.",
      "When asked about her transformation at the \"The Color Purple\" event, Winfrey didn\u2019t even mention a weight-loss drug.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s everything,\u201d she told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cI intend to keep it that way. \u2026 I was on that treadmill today.\u201d",
      "Studies show that weight-loss drugs need to be part of a holistic approach, with some of the strongest results in patients who are also eating a healthy diet and exercising.",
      "Oprah's weight loss history",
      "Winfrey has struggled with her weight for decades, famously losing 67 pounds with a liquid diet in 1988 then regaining the weight as soon as she \u201creturned to real food,\u201d she recalled on Oprah.com.",
      "In the March 18 special, she said that she essentially \"starved\" herself for five months before gaining it all back.",
      "In 1992, Winfrey reached 237 pounds, the most she ever weighed, she said during the \u201cThe State of Weight\u201d panel discussion. She recalled feeling frustrated that no matter what she did, her body always wanted to go back to a certain weight.",
      "In 2019, Winfrey revealed she was diagnosed with pre-diabetes before doing WW. She then lost 42 pounds with the program, getting her blood sugar and blood pressure back into normal ranges.",
      "Her goal weight now is 160 pounds, though she told People it\u2019s \u201cnot about the number\u201d but about living \u201ca more vital and vibrant life.\u201d",
      "As she approached her 70th birthday, her No. 1 concern was her health, Winfrey said, noting she doesn\u2019t live with a fear of death, but with \u201ca conscious acknowledgment that it\u2019s possible at any time.\u201d",
      "\u201c(I) recognize what an absolute miracle it is that 70 years on, that heart\u2019s still pumping,\u201d she added.",
      "How do weight-loss drugs work?",
      "Ozempic and similar drugs work by mimicking the hormones the body releases when a person eats food, as TODAY.com previously reported. People have reduced appetite, and when they do eat, they feel full sooner.",
      "Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, targets one hormone, known as GLP-1. Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound, targets two different hormones, GIP and GLP-1, which can lead to even greater weight loss, research shows.",
      "Wegovy and Zepbound are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for people with obesity or those who have complications from being overweight. Ozempic and Mounjaro are approved to treat Type 2 diabetes.",
      "The most common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain and constipation. People self-inject the drugs once a week and have to keep taking them to maintain weight loss.",
      "Patients can expect to lose 15% to 20% of their body weight, says Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist and obesity medicine specialist who runs a weight-loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina.",
      "Using a weight-loss medication is \u201cin no way the easy way out,\u201d he notes.",
      "\u201cYou still have to improve your nutrition. You still have to stay active. You really have to stay quite consistent over time to achieve the results that are seen in the clinical studies,\u201d McGowan tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cThe reason these new medications are such game changers is they really are effective, and it\u2019s quite remarkable to help someone who\u2019s tried oftentimes for years, decades, maybe their entire adult life, to lose weight.\u201d"

      "Gaga added that she wanted her fans to know, \u201cThat I\u2019m just, like, so happy. I\u2019m healthy. I feel like the last time they heard from me \u2014 in this way \u2014 was \u2018Chromatica,\u2019 and that album was about an absolutely horrible time for me with my mental health.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was in a really dark place. I struggled for, like, many years before that. But everything started to change. Because I had a real friend who saw the ways in which I was unhappy and why,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd he wasn\u2019t afraid to truly hold my hand. And get to know me. On a very deep level.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "SIXTEEN YEARS AGO, Parvati Shallow was one of the leaders of an all-female alliance on \"Survivor: Micronesia,\" Season 16 of the reality competition show.",
      "\"It's like, the Black Widow Brigade. All the girls are coming together, and we're spinning the guys around as much as we can, just spinning them and spinning them until they don't know which way's up,\" Shallow said in a confessional during the season, which aired in 2008. \"And then we're devouring them.\"",
      "Responsible for some of the most famous blindsides in the game's history \u2014 including convincing one player to give up his individual immunity necklace \u2014 the Black Widow Brigade comprised the final four of \"Survivor: Micronesia.\"",
      "Shallow ended up on top, winning the season, its $1 million prize and a moniker that has lasted to this day: the Black Widow.",
      "After winning \u201cSurvivor\u2019s\u201d 16th season, she went on to place second in the all-returners season \u201cHeroes vs. Villains.\u201d She played again a decade later on Season 40, \u201cWinners at War,\u201d and solidified her status as reality TV royalty in recent years with appearances on \u201cThe Traitors\u201d and now, \u201cDeal or No Deal Island.\u201d",
      "Some of the archetypes that have been ascribed to her throughout her time on TV, which started when she was just 23 on \"Survivor: Cook Islands,\" include: the flirt, a villain, a manipulator and more.",
      "\"I think the Black Widow has served me very well. It's like a persona of its own,\" Shallow, now 42, tells TODAY.com. \"People see me as the Black Widow, and I think it helps people to characterize me. To kind of lock in and understand me, quote unquote, in a way that simplifies me for people and lets them feel like they know me.\"",
      "But, she adds, \"It's not all of me.\"",
      "\"SURVIVOR: MICRONESIA\" ALSO HAPPENS to be the last time Shallow played a reality TV game with newbies to the genre.",
      "Shallow is currently starring in Season 2 of \"Deal or No Deal Island,\" a tropical twist on the classic \"suitcase game,\" as Shallow calls it.",
      "The game involves contestants living on a remote destination known simply as the \"Banker's Island.\" Through a series of challenges, contestants hunt for cases. Having the highest value cases lets that person pick who has to face the Banker in a traditional game of \"Deal or No Deal.\" If that person makes an unfavorable deal, they are eliminated. If they make a good deal, they pick who goes home next.",
      "If it sounds confusing, you're not alone. Shallow describes it as a \"game show within a game show\" \u2014 only with the \"goofiest name.\"",
      "\"Once you get past how silly the name of the show sounds, and you invest yourself in watching it, it's really fun,\" she says. \"It's different to anything I've ever done, and I've done a lot of these games.\"",
      "On the show, she's competing against 11 reality TV newcomers, plus two veterans: David Genat of \"Australian Survivor\" and Will Kirby of \"Big Brother.\"",
      "Shallow describes Genat as her \"male foil,\" citing their similar gameplay and an \"instant connection and respect for each other.\" In essence, she and Genat are playing their own game, from opposite ends of the \"Deal or No Deal Island\" beach.",
      "She's also formed connections with newbies like Phillip Solomon and Dickson Wong. Unlike past shows, Shallow says she's functioning like a coach.",
      "\"Like, 'Let's work together. Let me support you. I'm going to help you see what you're not seeing and just make some moves that might be harder for you to make emotionally,'\" she says. \"I have that experience of doing that, and I can see this as a game rather than as like, real life.",
      "\"Phillip was like, 'People's families. I'm thinking about their families.' I\u2019m like, \u2018No, we\u2019re not doing that right now. Set that aside,'\" Shallow adds. \"We have 10 minutes to get our hair done and makeup done and come up with a strategy to get someone out of this game who's not going to take you out or me out.\"",
      "SHALLOW COMES BY HER ADVICE honestly. Not only is she a life coach by trade, she had a similar experience after her first few bouts on \"Survivor\" in her 20s.",
      "\"There's like a pre-show Parvati, a naive Parvati that played the first few seasons of 'Survivor' when I was very young,\" she says. \"Then I had a good chunk of time, maybe a solid decade, where I stepped out of reality television, and I had a whole life.\"",
      "She got married, welcomed a daughter, Ama, in 2018, got divorced, and in between, essentially figured out \"how to make life work for me,\" she says.",
      "Before that, she says got \"sucked in.\"",
      "\"This label that I got as the Black Widow, this man eater... this person who was willing to betray her friends \u2014\u00a0that stuck with me for a long time and really informed the choices that I made, and I made a big mess of my life from that,\" she says.",
      "That experience, and how she \"climbed out of it,\" is documented in her upcoming memoir, \"Nice Girls Don\u2019t Win: How I Burned It All Down to Claim My Power,\" which publishes July 8.",
      "Shallow says the book's alternate title was \"Torched,\" a play on the \"Survivor\" torches which, if snuffed, mark elimination from the game. Her editors thought it might be too much. But according to Shallow herself, \"the book is intense,\" starting from the story of her childhood.",
      "\"I grew up in a new age, sort of spiritual commune that was run a powerful and controlling guru,\" Shallow says. \"That's why I have a Hindu name, because she was naming the kids.\"",
      "From there, it chronicles her reality TV debut and her experience learning to reject expectations.",
      "\"The book is really a journey of claiming my power, going from being a people-pleaser, wanting to be liked, adapting myself to whatever I thought other people wanted me to be, to then burning all of that down, all of the ways I was trying to fit into society's expectations of me as a woman, as a girl, as a wife, as a mother,\" she says. \"I was like, 'I don't need to do that anymore.'\"",
      "She cites using different \"healing modalities\" over a period of about four years, including about two-and-a-half years of writing the memoir.",
      "\"I was like, 'I need to find a way to make healthy choices because I want to have healthy relationships. I want to build a life that I love that works for me,'\" she says.",
      "Coming out on the other side, she's \"saying yes to these big adventures,\" including more reality TV appearances. She says her season of \"The Traitors,\" which aired in 2024, was a \"test,\" to see if she could truly step back into a game setting and not lose herself in the process.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be the Black Widow when it serves me to be the Black Widow ... and then I'll also be like a really caretaking mom when it serves me to be that.\"",
      "Parvati Shallow",
      "\"It was a risk,\" she says. \"But when I came home, I was like, 'Oh, yeah. I can do it. I'm OK.'\"",
      "Now, she says the Black Widow role is less of an identity and more of a costume.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be the Black Widow when it serves me to be the Black Widow. I\u2019ll be the villain when it serves me to be the villain.\"",
      "\"I can step into it,\" she says. \"Just like putting on a pearly headband. I now have that power to put on the costume and take off the costume, whereas in the past, people just put it on me, and I didn't have any control over that.\"",
      "\"I'll be the Black Widow when it serves me to be the Black Widow. I'll be the villain when it serves me to be the villain,\" she adds. \"And then I'll also be like a really caretaking mom when it serves me to be that.\"",
      "IF \"THE TRAITORS\" WAS THE TEST, \"Deal or No Deal Island\" and her upcoming appearance on \"Australian Survivor\" are the rewards.",
      "In addition to Season 2 of the Peacock show, she's set to appear on \"Australian Survivor\" in a special edition of the show titled, \"Survivor: Australia v. The World,\" premiering in 2025.",
      "She filmed the two shows back-to-back, starting with \"Deal.\" Then, she had about one month off before heading out to play \"Survivor\" for the fifth \u2014 and allegedly final \u2014 time.",
      "\"That's it for me. This book is closed on 'Survivor,'\" she says. \"So if people want to see me play 'Survivor,' this is your last opportunity.\"",
      "She adds that she \"wouldn't do 'Survivor 50,'\" the upcoming landmark 50th season of the show. The milestone season will reportedly feature returning cast members and start filming in the spring of 2025.",
      "\"40 ('Winners at War') was not the best experience for me as far as like making alliances and being able to play,\" Shallow says. \"I don't think the new era of 'Survivor' players wants to play with me. So I'm like, 'I can't play a game if no one wants to play with me.' I just don't even want to put myself in that situation.\"",
      "Playing 'Deal or No Deal,' playing 'Australian Survivor,' I wasn't worried. I just came out fully, 'This is a game. I'm going to play it to win.'\"",
      "Parvati Shallow",
      "Joining Shallow on \"Australian Survivor\" are fellow legends Cirie Fields and the first two-time male winner, Tony Vlachos. Shallow and Fields' reunion is especially sweet.",
      "Fields was also a member of the Black Widow Brigade and came in third after a last-second twist.",
      "\"(Cirie) and I were in this tightest alliance in that game. And then there was this twist where we got surprised by it being a final two rather than a final three,\" Shallow says. \"So it was really interesting to see her there. I was like, 'Are we going to have the same dynamic as we had in 'Micronesia,' or is it going to be different?'\"",
      "\"It was really fun playing with her,\" Shallow says.",
      "With \"Deal or No Deal Island\" and \"Australian Survivor\" having already been filmed, now, Shallow gets to watch the final cuts, a process she says is \"more fun\" compared to the beginning of her reality TV career.",
      "\"I have less attachment to how I'm perceived,\" Shallow says.",
      "New episodes of \"Deal or No Deal Island\" air Tuesdays at 9 p.m ET on NBC. Episodes stream the next day on Peacock. (Peacock and TODAY.com are owned by the same parent company, NBCUniversal.)"

I mean, everything that he does is like a lesson to me as an actor and a performer. And as a writer myself, he takes folks on a journey.

      "\u201cThe first season kind of highlighted money, and then the second season is sex,\u201d White said in an\u00a0interview with HBO\u00a0that aired right after the Season Two finale. \u201cI think the third season would be maybe a satirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality. It feels like it could be a rich tapestry to do another round at White Lotus.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe kind of mythology of Sicily, at least from the point of view of Americans, is the archetypal sexual politics and role play that you associate with, like, opera and the mafia and Italian romance.

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 14:58:14 GMT",
    "summary": "Will Ferrell has a lot of fun with his wife, Viveca Paulin, and their three sons: Magnus, 20, Mattias, 18, and Axel, 15. Here are 9 stories about his parenting.",
    "story": [
      "In his latest movie, \u201cYou\u2019re Cordially Invited\u201d with Reese Witherspoon, comedian and actor Will Ferrell plays an overly involved father of the bride. In real life, he is the father of three sons.",
      "In both instances, he has more than a few dad jokes up his sleeve.",
      "Ferrell seems to greatly enjoy tormenting his wife, Viveca Paulin, and their three sons: Magnus, 20, Mattias, 18, and Axel, 15. And they don't seem to mind ... or at least they've grown accustomed to it over the years.",
      "Recently, Ferrell dressed up as a disgruntled Buddy the Elf for a Philadelphia Flyers-Los Angeles Kings hockey game.",
      "Or perhaps you've seen the indelible image of Ferrell dressed as a medieval lord to upstage his son for prom photos.",
      "There was that time Ferrell showed up at a fraternity party at the University of Southern California (where his son was a sophomore at the time) as the guest DJ, clapping along to the \u201cRocky III\u201d classic \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d by Survivor and songs by Jay-Z and Ye.",
      "And of course, Ferrell perfected work-life balance way back in 2013 when he brought his ... ahem ... casually dressed kids on stage to announce some of the biggest Emmy Award winners of the night.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith dropped out at the last second and they called me literally 45 minutes ago and I couldn\u2019t find child care, OK?\u201d Ferrell told the audience at the time. \u201cWe had a soccer game, there was a neighbor\u2019s birthday party, a nut allergy, I didn\u2019t have time to do my hair. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s great to be here.\u201d",
      "Here are more of Ferrell's thoughts on the parenting journey.",
      "1. Will Ferrell on discipline",
      "While visiting \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d in 2015, Ferrell, dressed as Little Debbie of snack cake fame, told Jimmy Fallon that he only disciplines his sons as Little Debbie.",
      "\u201cSo if I come around the corner dressed like this, they know it\u2019s business,\u201d Ferrell said. \u201cMy wife will say, \u2018Don\u2019t make Dad change into Little Debbie!\u2019\u201d",
      "2. Will Ferrell on gentle parenting",
      "\"As a parent of three boys, it's a lot of chaos. And all parenting rules go completely out the window,\" Ferrell told Jennifer Anniston during a 2020 interview for \"The Ellen Show.\"",
      "He joked that within five minutes, he went from saying, \"'I'm sorry your feelings are hurt'\" to \"'Get upstairs now and brush your teeth! Shut up! I don't care. Why? Because I said so!'\"",
      "Ferrell added that parenting boys is \"like running a small correctional facility.\"",
      "3. Will Ferrell on encouraging humor",
      "In a 2018 interview with Parade, Ferrell said that his kids are each \"funny in their own ways.\"",
      "For example, when he was a freshman in high school, Magnus borrowed a friend's glasses and put on a serious look for his yearbook photo. He was worried that he would get in trouble, but Ferrell said, \"\u2018No, you\u2019ve got to do it every year! Fantastic!\u2019\"",
      "Ferrell added, \"It\u2019s fun to see them make their friends laugh. Very similar to me, they\u2019re good kids at school and yet they like to try to be funny.\"",
      "4. Will Ferrell on connection",
      "As a father, Ferrell values quality, not quantity.",
      "Back in 2008, he told People, \u201cFor me, talk to your children, at least once a week. If you\u2019ve got time, do it two or three times a week, but otherwise, I find the times where I let weeks and weeks go by without talking to my children. That adds up.\u201d",
      "Ferrell has seemingly kept that distance from his children through the years.",
      "While promoting their 2017 movie, \"The House,\" Ferrell sat down with co-star Amy Poehler to talk about parenting. Poehler asked why parents have to be their kids' best friend these days.",
      "Ferrell deadpanned, \"I know I'm not my kids' best friend. Not by a long shot.\"",
      "5. Will Ferrell on playdates",
      "When visiting \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\" in 2018, Ferrell schooled Corden and a very pregnant Eva Longoria about the long-term effect of boys' bathroom habits.",
      "\"It continues on, the issue,\" he said. \"Peeing ... in a stranger way.\"",
      "Because his wife is Swedish, Ferrell and his family visit the Swedish countryside every summer. When they are outside playing soccer, there's no bathroom nearby, so the boys \"pee out in nature.\"",
      "Unfortunately, though, that habit has continued at the Ferrell home back in the U.S.",
      "\"There's been many a playdate where the scared mother who's visiting us with their child leave immediately because our children just decided to pee in the backyard \u2014 and have convinced them to pee in the backyard.\"",
      "6. Will Farrell on coaching",
      "Ferrell's boys played with the American Youth Soccer Organization, which requires parents to earn \"volunteer points\" by refereeing, Ferrell said on \"The Ellen Show\" in 2020.",
      "He generally makes it through half of the game before one of the kids on the opposing team asks if he's \"Buddy the Elf,\" his character in the hit holiday movie \"Elf.\" Ferrell then uses the distraction to give his kids a leg up on the competition.",
      "But that isn't the only mark Ferrell has made on youth soccer.",
      "According to The Hollywood Reporter, visual effects artist Justin\u00a0Blaustein, whose son played with Ferrell's son, said that the comedian \"often showed up for practice in crazy Hawaiian print shirts, long shorts, black socks and a 10-gallon cowboy hat.\"",
      "7. Will Farrell on holidays",
      "Ferrell's son Magnus has said that Easter in their household has been ... interesting.",
      "On the \"Lightweights Podcast with Joe Vulpis,\" Magnus shared a story about his mother waking him up to look in the backyard where there was \"a guy in an Easter Bunny costume, and he's just kind of trotting around, kind of bizarre, and he's making this weird face and he's singing this Easter Bunny song.\"",
      "Magnus added that his father \"is someone who has no shame. No shame. It feels like social anxiety is afraid of him.\"",
      "At Christmas, Ferrell plays the Swedish Santa, Tomten, for their annual Christmas party. He gives a present to each child ... but only if they earn it. If the kids are too nervous to perform, Tomten makes them do five push-ups.",
      "And at Halloween, the Ferrell family has a standing tradition: Ferrell will wear whatever costume his family chooses for him, according to People.",
      "One year, he was a poop emoji.",
      "8. Will Ferrell on supporting his kids",
      "Ferrell is always there for his kids with more cowbell.",
      "9. Will Ferrell on the biggest lesson he's learned as a parent",
      "In a video interview from 2023, the Wall Street Journal asked Ferrell a question we all want to know the answer to: \"What's the one lesson you've learned as a parent?\"",
      "\"Being a parent is a huge responsibility,\" Ferrell began. \"You learn a lot of lessons, but the overriding lesson I've learned is that I hate children.\""

Vilifying the women who put so much of their heart and soul into making this film because they believe so strongly in its message seems counterproductive and detracts from what this film is about. It is, in fact, the opposite of the point.\u201d",

      "The complaint stated that Baldoni allegedly improvised physical intimacy that had not been previously rehearsed or discussed, including improvising kisses during one scene.",
      "The complaint also alleged Baldoni and producer Jamey Heath pressured Lively to \u201csimulate full nudity\u201d during a scene in which her character is giving birth.",

      "\u201cIt is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to \u2018fix\u2019 her negative reputation which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions. These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloane with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",

      "\"In this vicious smear campaign fully orchestrated by Blake Lively and her team, the New York Times cowered to the wants and whims of two powerful 'untouchable' Hollywood elites, disregarding journalistic practices and ethics once befitting of the revered publication by using doctored and manipulated texts and intentionally omitting texts which dispute their chosen PR narrative.",
      "\"In doing so, they pre-determined the outcome of their story, and aided and abetted their own devastating PR smear campaign designed to revitalize Lively\u2019s self-induced floundering public image and counter the organic groundswell of criticism amongst the online public. The irony is rich.",
      "\"Make no mistake however, as we all unite to take down The NY Times by no longer allowing them to deceive the public, we will continue this campaign of authenticity by also suing those individuals who have abused their power to try and destroy the lives of my clients. While their side embraces partial truths, we embrace the full truth \u2014 and have all of the communications to back it. The public will decide for themselves as they did when this first began.\"",

Unfortunately, Ms. Lively\u2019s decision to speak out has resulted in further retaliation and attacks. As alleged in Ms. Lively\u2019s federal Complaint, Wayfarer and its associates have violated federal and California state law by retaliating against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns.",
      "\"Now, the defendants will answer for their conduct in federal court. Ms. Lively has brought this litigation in New York, where much of the relevant activities described in the Complaint took place, but we reserve the right to pursue further action in other venues and jurisdictions as appropriate under the law.\"",

No woman should have to take defensive measures to avoid being touched by their employer without their consent,\u201d the statement continued. Attorneys for Lively said that the video being released to the media instead of being used as evidence in court was \u201canother example of an unethical attempt to manipulate the public\u201d and was \u201ca continuation of their harassment and retaliatory campaign.\u201d",
      "Additionally,\u00a0Baldoni\u2019s attorney, Freeman, told NBC in a statement shared Jan. 25: \u201cThe irony is not lost on anyone that Ms. Lively is so petrified of the truth that she has moved to gag it.\u201d",
      "Freeman added in part, \u201cWhen you accuse innocent individuals of something so disturbing as sexual harassment without thinking of the destruction it would cause to not only them, but the entire domestic violence community, this is where accountability for such mean spirited actions must be taken.\u201d",
      "Freeman added that he and his team will always respect the court. \u201cHowever, we will never be bullied by those suggesting we cannot defend our clients with pure, unedited facts. All we want is for people to see the actual text messages that directly contradict her allegations, video footage that clearly shows there was no sexual harassment and all the other powerful evidence that directly contradicts any false allegations of sexual harassment and subsequent smear campaign. It seems that in a time of universal deceit,\u00a0telling the truth is a revolutionary act.\u201d",
      "In December, Lively, who co-starred and was a producer on \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d filed a\u00a0sexual harassment complaint\u00a0against Baldoni. Baldoni directed the movie and portrayed Lively\u2019s character\u2019s love interest, as well. Weeks later, Lively filed a\u00a0lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, Baldoni\u2019s publicist Jennifer Abel, crisis publicist Melissa Nathan and others connected to Baldoni and the film alleging\u00a0sexual harassment and\u00a0a smear campaign against her, according to court documents obtained by NBC News.",
      "Baldoni, on his end, sued Lively, her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and other defendants for $400 million. The \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d star accused them of defamation and other contractual claims, according to court documents obtained by NBC News."

    "story": [
      "After two decades of releasing chart-topping hits, Miranda Lambert has certainly earned the right to be called a country superstar. Now, her icon status has officially been solidified.",
      "At the\u00a02024 People\u2019s Choice Country Awards, the singer received the Country Icon Award, an accolade that came hot on the heels of the release of her 10th studio album.",
      "Aptly named \"Postcards from Texas,\" it's the first album Lambert has made in Texas since she was 18 years old.",

      "Before appearing on TODAY's fourth hour at that time, Lambert sat down with TODAY.com to answer eight questions before 8 a.m. in\u00a0our original video series \u201c8 Before 8.\u201d",
      "From personal to professional questions, Lambert didn't hold back in her responses. She dished on country icons who inspire her, her favorite tattoo and her new album. Plus, she assessed husband Brendan McLoughlin's songwriting abilities.",
      "How did you come up with the name of your album 'Postcards from Texas'?",
      "The name \"Postcards from Texas\" kind of felt right for the record because there are so many influences on this record that have sort of made me who I am as an artist musically. And I felt like each was a little snapshot of the last 20 years of inspiration.",
      "What was the inspiration for your new song 'Wranglers'?",
      "My new song \"Wranglers\" was written by my good friend Audra Mae, and I think the inspiration was just life and girl talk. We were talking about experiences we had had, and we were writing songs and drinking tequila.",
      "And then a month later she sent me \"Wranglers,\" and she was like, \"I took our stories and I wrote them. Hope you don\u2019t mind.\" So I just love it. It\u2019s like \u2014 it really reminds me of something I would've put on some of my earlier records.",
      "What music icons have inspired you over the years?",
      "So many people have inspired me, but country, specifically. The obvious ones: Dolly (Parton) and Reba (McEntire) because they are our queens, Loretta Lynn. But on this record, specifically, I feel like George Strait had a lot of influence for me. We call him the king in Texas for a reason.",
      "\u2018Wranglers\u2019 is a total revenge anthem. What\u2019s the wildest thing you\u2019ve done to get revenge on an ex?",

      "Describe the process of writing 'Dammit Randy' with your husband.",
      "I did write a song with my husband called \"Dammit Randy\" on this record. I had my husband writing songs here in 2020 when we were all home and bored, and he actually turned out to be pretty good. He is a retired NYPD officer, so songwriting is not his (thing). Now, he has it on his resume because he\u2019s really proud.",
      "We were kind of wrapping up songs for this record, and my friend Jon Randall picked up a guitar and that usually means we\u2019re going to write a song. And Brendan was watching football and kind of kept popping lines in. And so I was like, \"If you\u2019re going to do this, we\u2019re not going to watch the game and write songs. You got to pick a side.\" And so, he ended up writing some of my favorite lines in the song.",
      "You got married after 3 months of dating. How did you know your husband was the one?",
      "You know, my husband\u2019s my person, and it\u2019s taken a journey to get there and figure that out. But I\u2019m also a person that really believes in love and taking a risk. And if you don\u2019t, you know, I know that loving big can also mean hurting big. But to me, it\u2019s definitely worth it.",
      "This is your 10th studio album. What are 10 things you can\u2019t live without?",
      "Ten things I can\u2019t live without: Dogs, dogs, country music, my husband. Not in that order. I should have probably put him before the dogs, but he would expect nothing less. Tito's and Cheetos and girl time. Can\u2019t live without girl time. And cowboy boots and Texas Longhorns.",
      "Rapid-fire round:",
      "Probably my favorite tattoo is my guns and wings on my left arm. It\u2019s my logo, and it was my first big tattoo, and I got it when my record \"Kerosene\" went gold. So it definitely means something to me.",
      "My favorite recipe from my cookbook is probably my mom\u2019s meatloaf because it\u2019s famous. Well, she calls it famous, so, so do we.",
      "Hmm, I loved the (Las) Vegas residency so much. It was such a different way of doing what I do versus being on the road for 20 years. But it did make me miss the road. So I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know, I think having a balance of a residency and the road was kind of the perfect storm.",
      "Oh, man, I can\u2019t choose between horses or dogs. It\u2019s just impossible. I\u2019ll have to take a shot.",

      "Oh God, \"Love Is Blind.\" I just binge it for sure.",
      "I collect salt-and-pepper shakers. I know it\u2019s very Memaw of me, but I\u2019m owning it.",

      "For many, the journey home after 15 months of Israeli bombardment brought tears as they held onto their loved ones and clutched their belongings tightly.",
      "Others traveled in cars, trucks and rickshaws lined up along the highway, carrying tents and mattresses after seeking shelter in the central and southern parts of the enclave.",
      "Under the terms of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, residents of northern Gaza were slated to return over the weekend before Israel closed the crossings after it said Hamas had breached the deal by failing to release Arbel Yehud, a 29-year-old Israeli civilian hostage.",
      "The hold-up came as President Donald Trump\u00a0said Saturday that Palestinians should leave the Gaza Strip to \u201cclean out\u201d the enclave, adding that he had asked the king of Jordan to take them in.",
      "News that Israel would reopen the first checkpoint in central Gaza at 7 a.m. local time (midnight ET) came Sunday after Qatari mediators announced that Hamas had agreed to hand over Yehud along with two other hostages.",
      "For many displaced residents, the thought of reuniting with family  brought a renewed sense of hope and jubilation. The violence drove some 90% of the enclave's residents from their homes, with many living for months in squalid tent camps.",
      "Palestinians who had been waiting at the roadblocks for two days burst into cheers as Israeli troops monitored from the sidelines.",
      "Sanaa Al-Qassab, 45, told NBC News that she hadn't expected to return to her home in northern Gaza, as she held her young daughter's hand while walking along the sandy strip with heavy bags slung over her shoulder.",

    "summary": "Multiple defectors from North Korea spoke to NBC News about the mindset of soldiers sent to fight for Russia in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Few people understand what may be going through the minds of North Korean soldiers fighting and dying for Russia in the war against Ukraine. But Lee Chul Eun is one of them.",
      "Lee, 38, a North Korean defector and former soldier now living in South Korea, said it is \u201cdevastating\u201d to see troops from the reclusive, communist-ruled North being sent abroad by leader Kim Jong Un, \u201conly to then give up their youth for a land that is not even theirs but the foreign land of Russia.\u201d",
      "He is one of multiple defectors who spoke to NBC News about the training, conditions and mindset of North Korean soldiers, including their willingness to take their own lives if necessary.",
      "Lee said his former colleagues \u201care essentially just sent out to be cannon fodder on the front lines.\u201d",
      "For the first time since they arrived in Russia in the fall, North Korean soldiers have been captured alive by Ukrainian forces, with video and photos showing one man with bandages around his jawline and another with bandaged hands.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who announced the prisoners\u2019 apprehension earlier this month, said they were living proof that North Korea had entered the war, in a major escalation of the yearslong conflict.",
      "The U.S. and allies say there are more than 11,000 North Korean troops fighting in the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion in August. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has confirmed the reports.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it is not easy to capture a North Korean soldier,\u201d Ryu Sung Hyu said in an interview in the South Korean capital, Seoul.",
      "All North Korean recruits are taught a song that includes a verse about saving their last bullet for themselves to avoid capture, said Ryu, who served in the North Korean military until 2019, when he escaped to freedom in South Korea.",
      "According to South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, there was at least one recent incident in which a North Korean soldier, faced with possible capture by Ukrainian forces, tried to detonate a grenade while shouting Kim\u2019s name but was killed before he could succeed.",
      "The South Korean military said last week that North Korea is preparing to send additional troops to Russia after about 300 of its soldiers were killed and 2,700 others were injured. The high casualty rate was due to the soldiers\u2019 poor understanding of modern warfare, as well as the way they were being deployed by Russia, South Korean lawmakers said.",
      "Their willingness to fight and die for Russia could be a major factor in determining the course of the Ukraine war, as well as the level of American military aid to Ukraine under President Donald Trump, who has expressed skepticism over continued U.S. support.Kim is thought to be providing Russian President Vladimir Putin with troops and weapons in hope of receiving technical assistance with his nuclear and ballistic missile programs. His flurry of weapons testing has continued with three launches already this year, including multiple short-range ballistic missiles, a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile and strategic cruise missiles.",
      "Trump drew ire from South Korea on Tuesday after he described the reclusive regime as a \u201cnuclear power,\u201d a phrase that U.S. officials have long refrained from using, as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.",
      "Kim is sending troops to Russia for two reasons, \u201cboth of which are driven by desperation,\u201d said Ahn Chan Il, who served in the North Korean military for over a decade and defected to South Korea in 1979. The first is to earn foreign currency, which is in short supply in North Korea under United Nations sanctions imposed over its weapons programs.The deployment also provides valuable experience for the North Korean military, which has not been deployed overseas since the Vietnam War.",
      "Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council this month that fighting alongside Russia makes North Korea \u201cmore capable of waging war against its neighbors.\u201d",
      "Lee, who spent five years in the North Korean military, said the troops had been sent to Russia as mercenaries rather than soldiers, noting that they weren\u2019t wearing their uniforms. South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service has said they were given Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, along with forged identification documents.",
      "\u201cEven if they die there it does not matter, because North Korea sent them out without officially recognizing them,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey were sent there not to bring honor to the country, but to give up their lives and bring back lots of money.\u201d",
      "'No longer a part of the society'",
      "Military service is compulsory in North Korea, which has one of the world\u2019s largest standing armies. Soldiers undergo three months of basic training before being assigned to a unit, said Lee, who came to South Korea in 2016 after swimming for six hours from the North.",
      "\u201cAs soldiers,\u201d Lee said, \u201cthey are told they are individuals who are now no longer a part of the society and their families, and must follow the orders of the supreme leader,\u201d meaning Kim.",
      "They have no trouble believing this, having been indoctrinated by North Korean propaganda from childhood, said Lee.",
      "North Korean soldiers spend most of their time not actually being soldiers but working on farms and construction projects, Lee and others said.",
      "\u201cI think I only fired three bullets per year,\u201d said Lee Hyun-seung, who served in the North Korean military for more than three years. When he moved to a more elite unit, he said, \u201cwe had more like 20 bullets.\u201dAsked whether he thought the North Korean troops could help Russia win the war, Lee \u2014 whose family defected in 2014 and who now lives in the U.S. \u2014 was skeptical.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not that sure,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I know their training and I know they are not well trained.\u201d",
      "For North Korean soldiers, who receive food and clothing but are otherwise essentially unpaid, the main enemy is hunger.",
      "North Korea struggles with food shortages as Kim devotes the majority of resources to his weapons programs, meaning that, like most of the broader population, soldiers suffer from malnutrition and can even starve to death.",
      "Meals are made up mainly of plain rice, corn or potatoes, sometimes mixed with grass or even tree bark, said Lee Chun Eul.",
      "He said his feelings about North Korea changed gradually, largely due to his exposure to foreign media that finds its way into the country despite tight government controls \u2014 \u201cJames Bond\u201d was a favorite of his growing up in the 1990s. More recently, the North Korean government has been alarmed by the popularity of South Korean TV dramas, sentencing two teenagers to 12 years of hard labor for watching them.",
      "\u201cWhen I look at North Korean mercenaries sent to Russia, I wonder if they would still have joined if they had watched as much foreign media as I did in North Korea,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI also wonder if the North Korean regime and Kim Jong Un\u2019s dictatorship would still be in place.\u201d",
      "The defectors say they hope the North Korean troops fighting in Russia will take the opportunity to leave like they did.",
      "\u201cWhen North Korean workers, who have lived their entire lives trapped in a restrictive system, experience life abroad, they come to see North Korea as nothing short of a prison,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cOnce they realize what freedom could mean, it\u2019s hard to imagine they wouldn\u2019t consider breaking free to live a freer life.\u201dIn addition to finding freedom, they could provide the U.S. and others with valuable intelligence regarding the North Korean military\u2019s strategies and capabilities, which are often exaggerated by the North Korean government.",
      "Ahn and other North Koreans who defected as soldiers have offered Ukraine their assistance against the North Korean troops.",
      "\u201cHowever, rather than directly participating in the war, our focus is on psychological warfare to change the mindset of North Korean soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough platforms like YouTube or leaflets, we aim to deliver messages to the North Korean troops, urging them not to die meaningless deaths and instead seek freedom.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, they watch with heavy hearts as casualties mount among North Korean soldiers whose experiences they know only too well.",
      "\u201cThese young people did not go knowing they were going to die,\u201d Lee said, \u201cbut died because they did not know.",

      "Inside the Auschwitz concentration camp complex, the soldiers liberated roughly 7,000 prisoners who had been brutalized by a Nazi regime hell-bent on exterminating the Jewish people. The horrors there defied comprehension.",
      "Eighty years later, some former prisoners returned to mark the 80th anniversary of their deliverance \u2014 a date that is known as International Holocaust Remembrance Day.",
      "In the eyes of so many around the world, the survivors\u2019 very existence is a resounding act of defiance against the world-historic cruelty and vast injustice of Adolf Hitler\u2019s reign of terror. Their stories of survival are also implicit pleas to the world: Never forget humanity\u2019s capacity to commit unthinkable crimes.",
      "Hitler\u2019s regime systematically murdered 6 million Jews during World War II, including roughly 1 million people at Auschwitz. The Nazis also persecuted other peoples, including Poles, the Romani, Soviet prisoners, gay men and mentally and physically disabled people.",
      "The Nazis tried to hide evidence of the genocide they perpetrated, including burning the remains of roughly 900,000 Auschwitz victims who were killed in the gas chambers.",
      "Eva Umlauf was only 2 when she and her mother were liberated from the camp \u2014 too young to remember the actual day. But the Holocaust is etched onto her skin \u2014 A-26,959 tattooed on her left forearm, marking her for life, along with some other Auschwitz survivors.",
      "\u201cYou are just a number,\u201d Umlauf, 82, a pediatrician from Munich, told NBC News, explaining how this number will forever make her feel. \u201cBut this number is not only on the skin. This is deeper.\u201d",
      "For Umlauf, who traveled for the ceremony along with her sister, her son and one of her grandchildren, this was more than a personal journey of memory and reflection. It was a moral responsibility.",
      "\u201cThey have to know that it\u2019s true. You know, because it\u2019s so, so unbelievable, unbelievable that nobody can believe this,\u201d she said.",
      "But even given what has been established about the Third Reich\u2019s crimes against humanity, some of the most vital information has still not been uncovered. Notably, the names of more than a million Jews slaughtered by the Nazis are still unknown, according to Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s official Holocaust memorial center.",
      "Alexander Avram leads a team at Yad Vashem that has amassed more than 2 million \u201cPages of Testimony\u201d and historical documents to verify more identities. The project is known as the Hall of Names.",
      "\u201cThere are no cemeteries, there are no tombstones \u2026 for most of the Holocaust victims,\u201d Avram told NBC News. \u201cEach additional name that we can recover is, for us, another victory against the Nazis, because the Nazis didn\u2019t [only] want to \u2026 exterminate the Jews physically. They wanted to obliterate even their memory.\u201d",
      "Avram said researchers have started experimenting with artificial intelligence to scour testimonial documents in hope of finding names that might have been overlooked. But that technology is useless without firsthand accounts provided by the shrinking pool of survivors.",
      "The Claims Conference estimates that only 1,000 survivors of Auschwitz are still alive. In that regard, Avram\u2019s team is \u201cin a rush against time,\u201d he said.",
      "The anniversary comes at a troubling and unsettled time. Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack on Israel, Israel\u2019s ensuing war in Gaza and the proliferation of hate speech on social media have fueled a worldwide spike in antisemitism.",
      "In some countries, basic knowledge of the Holocaust is eroding.",
      "The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, a nonprofit organization that helps Holocaust victims seek compensation, released an eight-country survey last week showing that 46% of adults ages 18-29 in France, for example, \u201chad not heard or weren\u2019t sure if they had heard of the Holocaust prior to taking the survey.\u201d",
      "Nearly half of Americans surveyed were unable to name a single Nazi camp, according to the Claims Conference\u2019s findings, and more than a quarter (26%) of Americans ages 18-29 disagreed with the following statement: \u201cThe Holocaust happened, and the number of Jews who were killed during the Holocaust has been accurately and fairly described.\u201d",
      "World leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, flew in for Monday\u2019s commemoration. Top dignitaries, including Britain's King Charles III, attended, as well.",

      "\u201cThe Europeans are taking this very seriously,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe between 2014 and late 2017.",
      "In particular, countries in Eastern Europe nearer the Russian border \u201cknow that this is for real, because they live there,\u201d Hodges added. \u201cIt\u2019s only those people who live in Western Europe or the U.S., far away from the Bear, who say: \u2018Come on, this is not going to happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "The core tenet of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is that allies will defend any fellow member under attack. The only time this \u201cArticle 5\u201d promise has been triggered was after 9/11, when Europe helped the United States patrol its skies in an act of solidarity. The main message of that stipulation is that if a country attacks Europe, it will also be at war with Washington, and its intended audience is Russia.",
      "But Trump has repeatedly suggested he would ignore Europe\u2019s distress call.",
      "Plenty of those in Europe\u2019s corridors of power agree that a complacent continent has for too long relied on Washington\u2019s protection. French President Emmanuel Macron, a longtime proponent of European self-reliance,\u00a0said Monday that Trump\u2019s second term should serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the continent.",
      "In comments made at a defense conference on Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, agreed with Trump\u2019s assessment of European spending, saying that \u201cRussia poses an existential threat to our security today, tomorrow and for as long as we underinvest in our defense.\u201d",
      "Many of these critics remain nonetheless alarmed.",
      "\u201cWhile every president has complained that European countries don\u2019t do enough, there never was a question about American commitment,\u201d said Hodges. \u201cThis causes a lot of anxiety.\u201d",
      "In the short term, Trump and key members of his incoming administration have vowed to quickly end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, likely impossible without huge territorial concessions from Kyiv. Effectively giving Russia a win would be a signal to the Kremlin that aggression is rewarded and the West has no appetite to intervene, critics say.",
      "\u201cRussia is preparing for a war with the West,\u201d German foreign intelligence chief Bruno Kahl said in a November speech.",
      "For years, experts and government officials have accused Moscow of spreading disinformation, launching cyberattacks and using any other means necessary to meddle in the elections of democratic countries.",
      "Though Moscow denies it. Western officials and experts are near united in agreeing that this campaign only seems to be expanding.",
      "Last month, Finnish authorities seized an oil tanker they suspected of having severed undersea power and internet cables. That was among a spate of incidents that prompted NATO to launch operation \u201cBaltic Sentry,\u201d stepping up maritime patrols.",
      "Meanwhile, Western officials said Russia was responsible for sending two incendiary devices to DHL logistics hubs in Germany and the United Kingdom in July as part of a wider sabotage campaign to possibly start fires aboard North America-bound aircraft.",
      "In response, Europe has reversed decades of military underfunding, with most of its big powers now hitting the NATO guideline of 2% of GDP spent on defense. Spending started to increase in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea, although Trump is widely credited for accelerating it.",
      "On Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s defense commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, announced that Lithuania intends to spend between 5% and 6% of its GDP on defense in the coming years.",
      "Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has focused minds further.",
      "In March, the European Union allocated 500 million euros (around $515 million) to double shell ammunition production to 2 million units per year. And 22 countries have now joined the European Sky Shield Initiative, a continentwide missile defense system designed to protect against Russian attacks.",
      "\u201cEurope must be prepared for the most extreme military contingencies,\u201d a spokesperson for the bloc told NBC News in an email when asked whether the continent was preparing for a worst-case scenario of war with Russia. \u201cPut simply: to prevent war we need to spend more. If we wait more, it\u2019ll cost us more.\u201d",
      "Asked if that change was prompted by Trump\u2019s suggestion he may not defend Europe as well as Putin, the spokesperson referred only to the Russian president, whose war in Ukraine they said \u201cchallenges the international rules-based order itself.\u201d",
      "For its part, Ukraine\u2019s reaction to the re-election and inauguration of Trump has been assiduously diplomatic. On Inauguration Day, Zelenskyy said in a post on X that Trump \u201cis always decisive\u201d and that his second term was an opportunity to \u201cachieve a long-term and just peace.\u201d",
      "Whatever the impetus, \u201cthe mindset has changed big time,\u201d said Vytis Jurkonis, who leads the Lithuanian office of Freedom House, an international pro-democracy group.",
      "\u201cWe need to make it very clear to the Kremlin that any attack against a NATO member is going to cost and have consequences,\u201d said Jurkonis, who also teaches politics at Lithuania\u2019s Vilnius University.",
      "The Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are particularly vulnerable, perched on the Baltic Sea between mainland Russia and the heavily militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.",
      "For decades occupied by the Soviet Union, these now-Westernized states are only now constructing \u201cthe Baltic Defense Line,\u201d a frontier hundreds of miles long dotted with anti-tank trenches and pillboxes. Lithuania has already purchased warehouses full of \u201cdragon\u2019s teeth\u201d \u2014 concrete pyramids designed to stop tanks \u2014 and plans to mine its bridges to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, its defense ministry told NBC News.",
      "Lithuania recently said it would raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, the highest in NATO and far more, proportionally, than Washington\u2019s 3.4%. That\u2019s still lower than Russia, with the Kremlin effectively reordering its economy along a war footing and committing at least 6.2% of its inflation-hit finances to its military.",
      "In western Scandinavia, meanwhile, Norway has updated its emergency preparedness booklet that it hands out to all citizens, telling them how much water, food and other supplies to stockpile in case of \u201cacts of war.\u201d The 20-page document has historically focused on extreme weather and accidents, but its most recent version notes that \u201cwe live in an increasingly turbulent world\u201d and warns that \u201cin the event of an act of war, you may be notified that you should seek shelter.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Swedish church authorities \u2014 on guidance from Sweden\u2019s armed forces \u2014 have begun looking for extra cemetery space should such a conflict reach their shores. And Germany committed around 100 million euros to reinstate public sirens that were removed when the Iron Curtain fell.",
      "And yet there are plenty of observers who believe that Europe is not doing nearly enough.",
      "Western European countries such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom have only committed \u201csmall percentage uplifts to defense budgets, which is nothing like the transformative investment\u201d in Eastern Europe, said Keir Giles, a leading defense analyst at London\u2019s Chatham House think tank.",
      "For Giles, author of \u201cWho Will Defend Europe? An Awakened Russia and a Sleeping Continent,\u201d the problem is that \u201ccountries further away are still pretending that war is something that happens to other people.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s more, efforts are further complicated by the political situation. Europe\u2019s mainstream parties are being challenged by populists, who often mix their vehement opposition to immigration with a softer \u2014 and sometimes even friendly \u2014 stance toward Russia.",
      "That\u2019s a problem for those who argue Russia\u2019s war on Europe has already begun.",
      "\u201cAnybody who isn\u2019t worried hasn\u2019t been paying attention,\u201d said Giles."

      "BEIJING \u2014 For women in China, it may feel as if there is little to laugh about these days.",
      "The world\u2019s second-largest economy is struggling to recover from the pandemic, and the government is cracking down on feminist activism as it encourages women to embrace \u201ctraditional\u201d female roles as wives and mothers.",
      "But women were laughing nonetheless, as amateur performers told jokes about office and family life to a small but engaged audience of about 20 people, mostly young women, at a Western restaurant in Beijing on a recent winter evening.",
      "Alex Wang, the only female performer out of about half a dozen that night, said she felt \u201cempowered\u201d when she first got on stage a few years ago.",
      "Though \u201cbeing funny is the most important thing,\u201d she said in an interview after her performance, \u201cI want to grow not just as a comedian but as a woman finding her voice in this space.\u201d",
      "The growing role of women in China\u2019s stand-up scene, along with the recent success of funny female-oriented films, reflect one way feminism is breaking into the Chinese mainstream: through comedy.",
      "The feminist movement is facing strong resistance in China, even as women attain new educational heights and make strides in the workplace.",
      "For the first time in decades, there is not a single woman among the 24 members of the Politburo, the senior leadership of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.\u00a0President Xi Jinping has personally called on women to embrace a \u201cchildbearing culture\u201d as the world\u2019s once-most-populous country struggles with low birth rates.",
      "The government has made no secret of its crackdown on feminist activity. In June, Chinese journalist and #MeToo activist Huang Xueqin was sentenced to five years in prison for subversion.",
      "But even Chinese state media had praise for \u201cHer Story,\u201d a feminist comedy directed by and starring women that was a box-office hit in China late last year. The state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily lauded the film\u2019s portrayal of the \u201chumorous and absurd\u201d aspects of daily life.",
      "The film has been described as China\u2019s answer to the 2023 hit \u201cBarbie,\u201d openly calling out stereotypes about women, sexuality, single parenting and divorce \u2014 all issues that can be sensitive here.",
      "\u201cHer Story\u201d may be able to get around that in part because its social critique is couched in comedy, said Feng Yuan, the founding director of Beijing Equality, a women\u2019s rights and gender equality nongovernment organization.",
      "In addition to helping evade censors, comedy is a \u201chandy tool to speak out your anger,\u201d she said.",
      "The film tells the story of Wang Tiemei, a newly unemployed single mother of a 9-year-old daughter, and their young female neighbor Xiao Ye in Shanghai. Despite their different personalities, the two women form a strong bond as they navigate personal challenges, including Wang\u2019s abusive ex-husband.",
      "Its frank tone has also inspired discussions about female sexuality akin to those set off by recent U.S. films such as the Nicole Kidman-starring erotic thriller \u201cBabygirl.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare to see stories about single moms or just women\u2019s lives in general,\u201d Zhang Tong, 25, said at a Beijing theater last month after seeing \u201cHer Story,\u201d which she called \u201cquite moving.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will help more women, especially young women, understand themselves better and feel empowered to live for themselves,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHer Story\u201d has made 720 million yuan ($99 million) since its release on Nov. 22, according to the Chinese box office site Maoyan, and has a score of 9.1 out of 10 on Douban, a Chinese film rating site.",
      "Though the film did not crack China\u2019s top 10 highest-grossing films last year, another movie directed by and starring women, \u201cYolo,\u201d topped the list at 3.4 billion yuan ($470 million). Its director, Chinese comedian Jia Ling, also directed the 2021 female-oriented comedy \u201cHi, Mom,\u201d which grossed more than 5.4 billion yuan ($742 million), making her the world\u2019s top-grossing female filmmaker until Greta Gerwig with \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "The success of these films marks a shift in the Chinese box office, the second-largest in the world after the United States, where the biggest movies have typically been male-dominated, patriotism-themed blockbusters.",
      "\u201cMy movie delivers something different from others, showing some novelty, so people like it,\u201d Shao Yihui, the director of \u201cHer Story,\u201d told state-run broadcaster CCTV.",
      "Women who perform stand-up comedy in China say they are also offering something different in an industry that only a few years ago was a sea of men.",
      "Wang said her jokes are informed partly by her experience as a woman.",
      "\u201cFor example, earlier I had a bit where I made fun of those awful guys who think everyone in the world is into them,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve also done material on topics like period stigma.\u201d",
      "She cited the influence of Yang Li, who is perhaps the most recognizable female figure in Chinese stand-up comedy. At her peak, she performed in front of millions of viewers on national television, delivering punchlines on the male psyche.",
      "\u201cI think what she and other everyday female comedians talk about, especially from a female perspective, really reflects the current state of society,\u201d Wang said. \u201cTheir material brings attention to issues women face, and you can clearly see how those jokes resonate with people.\u201d",
      "But they don\u2019t resonate with everyone.",
      "In October, Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com ended a promotional campaign featuring Yang after men offended by her ribbing flooded social media with complaints and accused of her of provoking \u201cgender antagonism,\u201d a term also used by Chinese state media to criticize feminism.",
      "As feminists have raised their voices in China, so have those with misogynist views, Feng said, and Yang made for a clear target.",
      "\u201cThey are always looking for some outlet to release their anger,\u201d she said.",
      "Chinese comedians say they have to be mindful of censors as well as fragile egos and cultural sensitivities. In 2023, a Chinese entertainment firm representing a stand-up comic was fined almost $2 million after he was accused of insulting the People\u2019s Liberation Army during a Beijing performance. The entire industry went to ground for more than a year, with stand-up comedy not returning to Chinese television until last fall.",
      "\u201cFor a Chinese audience, a lot of topics, it is kind of like we are not sure if we can laugh at that,\u201d said Nico Toomuch, 34, a stand-up comedian in Beijing.",
      "That hasn\u2019t stopped Toomuch, who has been performing since 2016, from joking about everything from marriage to menstruation and depression \u2014 drawing in part on her strengths as a woman.",
      "\u201cWe are more sensitive, emotional, and we are better at observing things,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we can take a joke, so we can deliver one.\u201d"

      "So how did a little-known startup become a global AI sensation?",
      "Based in the Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou, DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, who is also the founder of a hedge fund called High-Flyer that uses AI-driven trading strategies.",

      "\u201cOur core technical roles are mostly filled by fresh graduates or those with just a year or two of work experience,\u201d he told the Chinese media outlet 36Kr in May 2023, adding that the company was looking for \u201cdown-to-earth individuals with curiosity.\u201d",
      "By 2022, High-Flyer had acquired 10,000 of Nvidia\u2019s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips, according to a post that July on the Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. imposed restrictions on sales of those chips to China later that year.",
      "Liang told 36Kr that he acquired the chips mostly because of \u201ccuriosity about the boundaries of AI capabilities\u201d and that he had no particular commercial goal in mind.",
      "The stock market rout took place a week after DeepSeek\u2019s Jan. 20 release of an open-source language model called R1, which met with widespread acclaim in what venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called \u201cAI\u2019s Sputnik moment.\u201d",
      "Investors and the U.S. tech industry were further unnerved later in the week when DeepSeek published a technical report that said the model took only two months and less than $6 million to build, compared with the billions spent by leading U.S. tech companies.",
      "The surge in interest sent DeepSeek\u2019s recently released app to the top of Apple\u2019s App Store on Monday. The company later said that it was temporarily limiting user registrations \u201cdue to large-scale malicious attacks\u201d on its services, CNBC reported.",
      "New users were quick to note that R1 appeared subject to censorship around topics deemed sensitive in China, avoiding answering questions about the self-ruled democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims is part of its territory, or the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown or echoing Chinese government language. The model appears to operate without such restrictions, however, if it is used not through the DeepSeek website but on servers that host it outside mainland China.",

      "Former USAID official Jeremy Konyndyk said the decision by the Trump administration was a fundamental misread of what career staff exist to do.",

    "story": [
      "The smiling face of\u00a0President Alexander Lukashenko\u00a0gazed out from campaign posters across Belarus on Sunday as the country held an orchestrated election virtually guaranteed to give the\u00a070-year-old autocrat\u00a0yet another term on top of his three decades in power.",
      "\u201cNeeded!\u201d the posters proclaim beneath a photo of Lukashenko, his hands clasped together. The phrase is what groups of voters responded in campaign videos after supposedly being asked if they wanted him to serve again.",
      "But his opponents, many of whom are imprisoned or exiled abroad by his unrelenting crackdown on dissent and free speech, would disagree. They call the election a sham \u2014 much like the last one in 2020 that triggered months of protests that were unprecedented in the history of the country of 9 million people.",
      "The crackdown saw more than 65,000 arrests, with thousands beaten, bringing\u00a0condemnation and sanctions\u00a0from the West.",
      "His iron-fisted rule since 1994 \u2014 Lukashenko took office two years after the demise of the Soviet Union \u2014 earned him the nickname of \u201cEurope\u2019s Last Dictator,\u201d relying on subsidies and political support from close ally Russia.",
      "He let Moscow use his territory to invade Ukraine in 2022, and even hosts some of Russia\u2019s tactical nuclear weapons, but he still campaigned with the slogan \u201cPeace and security,\u201d arguing he has saved Belarus from being drawn into war.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s better to have a dictatorship like in Belarus than a democracy like Ukraine,\u201d Lukashenko said in his characteristic bluntness.",
      "Fearing a repeat of election unrest",
      "His reliance on support from Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 himself in office for a quarter-century \u2014 helped him survive the 2020 protests.",
      "Observers believe Lukashenko feared a repeat of those mass demonstrations amid economic troubles and the fighting in Ukraine, and so\u00a0scheduled the vote in January, when few would want to fill the streets again, rather than in August. He faces only token opposition.",
      "\u201cThe trauma of the 2020 protests was so deep that Lukashenko this time decided not to take risks and opted for the most reliable option when balloting looks more like a special operation to retain power than an election,\u201d Belarusian political analyst Valery Karbalevich said.",
      "Lukashenko repeatedly declared that he wasn\u2019t clinging to power and would \u201cquietly and calmly hand it over to the new generation.\u201d",
      "His 20-year-old son, Nikolai, traveled the country, giving interviews, signing autographs and playing piano at campaign events. His father hasn\u2019t mentioned his own health, even though he was seen having difficulty walking and occasionally spoke in a hoarse voice.",
      "\u201cThe successor issue only becomes relevant when a leader prepares to step down. But Lukashenko isn\u2019t going to leave,\u201d Karbalevich said.",
      "Top political opponents imprisoned or exiled",
      "Leading opponents have fled abroad or were thrown in prison. The country holds nearly 1,300 political prisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate\u00a0Ales Bialiatski, founder of the Viasna Human Rights Center.",
      "Since July, Lukashenko has pardoned more than 250 people. At the same time, authorities have sought to uproot dissent by arresting hundreds more in raids targeting relatives and friends of political prisoners.",
      "Authorities detained 188 people last month alone, Viasna said. Activists and those who donated money to opposition groups have been summoned by police and forced to sign papers saying they were warned against participating in unsanctioned demonstrations, rights advocates said.",
      "Lukashenko\u2019s four challengers on the ballot are all loyal to him.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m entering the race not against, but together with Lukashenko, and I\u2019m ready to serve as his vanguard,\u201d said Communist Party candidate Sergei Syrankov, who favors criminalizing LGBTQ+ activities and rebuilding monuments to Soviet leader Josef Stalin.",
      "Candidate Alexander Khizhnyak, head of the Republican Party of Labor and Justice, led a voting precinct in Minsk in 2020 and vowed to prevent a \u201crepeat of disturbances.\u201d",
      "Oleg Gaidukevich, head of the Liberal Democratic Party, supported Lukashenko in 2020 and urged fellow candidates to \u201cmake Lukashenko\u2019s enemies nauseous.\u201d",
      "The fourth challenger, Hanna Kanapatskaya, managed 1.7% of the vote in 2020 and says she\u2019s the \u201conly democratic alternative to Lukashenko,\u201d promising to lobby for freeing political prisoners but warning supporters against \u201cexcessive initiative.\u201d",
      "Opposition leader calls election \u2018a senseless farce\u2019",
      "Opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled Belarus under government pressure after challenging the president in 2020, told The Associated Press that Sunday\u2019s election was \u201ca senseless farce, a Lukashenko ritual.\u201d",
      "Voters should cross off everyone on the ballot, she said, and world leaders shouldn\u2019t recognize the result from a country \u201cwhere all independent media and opposition parties have been destroyed and prisons are filled by political prisoners.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe repressions have become even more brutal as this vote without choice has approached, but Lukashenko acts as though hundreds of thousands of people are still standing outside his palace,\u201d she said.",
      "The European Union\u00a0rejected the election\u00a0in Belarus on Sunday as illegitimate and threatened\u00a0new sanctions.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s sham election in Belarus has been neither free, nor fair,\u201d EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and EU enlargement commissioner Marta Kos said in a joint statement.",
      "Shortly after voting in Minsk on Sunday, accompanied by his white Pomeranian dog, Lukashenko told journalists that he did not seek recognition or approval from the EU.",
      "\u201cThe main thing for me is that Belarusians recognize these elections and that they end peacefully, as they began,\u201d he said.",
      "Speaking at an hourslong news conference, Lukashenko said that he didn\u2019t rule out running for the top job again in 2030.",
      "Media freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders filed a complaint against Lukashenko with the International Criminal Court over his crackdown on free speech that saw 397 journalists arrested since 2020. It said that 43 are in prison.",
      "Fears of vote-rigging",
      "According to the Central Election Commission, there are 6.8 million eligible voters. However, about 500,000 people have left Belarus and aren\u2019t able to vote.",
      "Two hours before polls closed at 8 p.m. local time (1700 GMT), the commission said that turnout stood at 81.85%, but a dearth of independent monitoring made that figure near-impossible to verify.",
      "At home, early voting that began Tuesday has created fertile ground for irregularities with ballot boxes unguarded until election day, the opposition said. A record 41.81% of voters cast ballots in five days of early voting. Meanwhile, Viasna activists reported internet issues across the country, and alleged Lukashenko\u2019s government was blocking access to VPN services commonly used to evade censorship.",
      "Polling stations have removed the curtains covering ballot boxes, and voters are forbidden from photographing their ballots \u2014 a response to the opposition\u2019s call in 2020 for voters to take pictures to make it more difficult for authorities to rig the vote.",
      "Police conducted large-scale drills before the election. An Interior Ministry video showed helmeted riot police beating their shields with truncheons as a way to prepare for protest dispersals. Another featured an officer arresting a man posing as a voter, twisting his arm next to a ballot box.",
      "Belarus initially refused to allow observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored previous elections. It changed course this month and invited the OSCE \u2014 when it was already too late to organize a monitoring mission.",
      "Increasing dependence on Russia",
      "Lukashenko\u2019s support for the war in Ukraine has led to the rupture of Belarus\u2019 ties with the U.S. and the EU, ending his gamesmanship of using the West to try to win more subsidies from the Kremlin.",
      "He spoke of Russian nuclear weapons deployed in Belarus as a guarantee of peace, and said he would pick Moscow as his first official visit if he\u2019s reelected.",
      "\u201cUntil 2020, Lukashenko could maneuver and play Russia against the West, but now when Belarus\u2019 status is close to that of Russia\u2019s satellite, this North Korea-style election ties the Belarusian leader to the Kremlin even stronger, shortening the leash,\u201d said Artyom Shraybman, a Belarus expert with the Carnegie Russia and Eurasia Center.",
      "After the election, Lukashenko could try to ease his total dependence on Russia by again seeking to reach out to the West, he predicted.",
      "\u201cLukashenko\u2019s interim goal is to use the election to confirm his legitimacy and try to overcome his isolation in order to at least start a conversation with the West about easing sanctions,\u201d Shraybman said.",
      "American woman released from detention",
      "An early sign of Minsk\u2019s desire to reengage with the West came on Sunday, as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on X that Belarus had \u201cunilaterally\u201d released a U.S. citizen, Anastassia Nuhfer.",
      "It took the public and even Belarusian rights activists by surprise \u2014 her name hadn\u2019t been publicly released, and hadn\u2019t featured on lists of political prisoners."

      "Israel said Friday it would keep troops in the south beyond the Sunday deadline set out in a U.S.-brokered ceasefire that halted last year\u2019s war with Hezbollah, saying Lebanon had not yet fully enforced terms requiring south Lebanon to be free of Hezbollah arms and the Lebanese army to be deployed.",

      "Lebanon\u2019s health ministry said 15 people were killed and another 83 wounded in numerous locations in the south as a result of what it described as Israeli attacks on citizens while they were trying to enter their still-occupied towns.",

      "Hezbollah\u2019s al-Manar television, broadcasting from several locations in the south, showed footage of residents moving towards villages early on Sunday, some holding the group\u2019s flag and images of Hezbollah fighters killed in the war.",
      "An Israeli military spokesperson, addressing the people of south Lebanon in a post on X, accused Hezbollah of trying to \u201cheat up the situation\u201d and said the Israeli army would \u201cin the near future\u201d inform them of places to which they can return.",
      "Hezbollah has put the onus on the Lebanese state to ensure Israel\u2019s withdrawal.",
      "Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah said Lebanon is committed to the ceasefire deal but that Israel had turned against it with U.S. support. The White House said on Friday that a short, temporary ceasefire extension was urgently needed.",
      "\u201cWhat is happening in the border villages is a liberation by the power of the people, and our people will not be broken by the Israeli army,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cWe want the state to play its full role, and the army to be deployed in the villages.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe cooperate with it to facilitate its mission.\u201d",
      "The top U.N. official in Lebanon and the head of the U.N. peacekeepers in the south said conditions were \u201cnot yet in place\u201d for the safe return of Lebanese citizens to villages near the border. \u201cThe fact is that the timelines envisaged\u201d in the ceasefire \u201chave not been met\u201d, they said in a statement.",
      "The agreement set out a 60-day timeline for implementation.",
      "President Joseph Aoun, Lebanon\u2019s army commander until parliament elected him head of state on Jan. 9, called on the people of the south to exercise self-restraint and trust in the Lebanese military.",
      "\u201c\u200eLebanon\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable, and I am following up on this issue at the highest levels to ensure your rights and dignity,\u201d he said in a statement.",
