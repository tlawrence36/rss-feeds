      "LOS ANGELES -- A woman charged with selling Matthew Perry the dose of ketamine that killed him is headed for a September trial.",
      "Jasveen Sangha's trial \u2014 the only one forthcoming in the death of the \u201cFriends\u201d star after four other defendants reached plea agreements with prosecutors \u2014 is now set to begin Sept. 23 after an order Tuesday from a federal judge in Los Angeles.",
      "The 42-year-old Sangha, who prosecutors say was known to her customers as \u201cThe Ketamine Queen,\u201d is charged with five counts of ketamine distribution, including one count of distribution resulting in death. She has pleaded not guilty and has been held in federal custody since her arrest last year.",
      "Her trial had been scheduled to start Aug. 19, but the judge postponed it for the fourth time since her April 2024 indictment after both sides agreed it should be moved.",
      "Sangha's lawyers said they needed the time to go through the huge amount of evidence they have received from the prosecution and to finish their own investigation.",

Perry's personal assistant, his friend and another doctor also entered guilty pleas and are cooperating with prosecutors. All are awaiting sentencing.",
      "Perry, who was found dead at age 54 at his home on Oct. 23, 2023, had been getting ketamine from his regular doctor for treatment of depression, an increasingly common off-label use for the surgical anesthetic.",
      "But prosecutors say when the doctor wouldn't give Perry as much as he wanted, he illegally sought more from Plasencia, then still more from Sangha, who they say presented herself as \"a celebrity drug dealer with high quality goods.\u201d",
      "Perry's assistant and friend said in their plea agreements that they acted as middlemen to buy large amounts of ketamine for Perry from Sangha, including 25 vials for $6,000 in cash a few days before his death. Prosecutors allege that included the doses that killed Perry.",

      "A guitar once played by two members of the Rolling Stones is at the center of a dispute between the band\u2019s former guitarist Mick Taylor and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",
      "The 1959 Gibson Les Paul was donated to the Met as part of what the New York museum calls \u201ca landmark gift of more than 500 of the finest guitars from the golden age of American guitar making.\u201d The donor is Dirk Ziff, a billionaire investor and guitar collector.",
      "When the Met announced the gift in May, Taylor thought he recognized the guitar, with its distinctive \u201cstarburst\u201d finish, as an instrument he last saw in 1971, when the Stones were recording the album \u201cExile on Main St.\u201d at Keith Richards\u2019 rented villa in the south of France.",
      "In the haze of drugs and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll that pervaded the sessions, a number of instruments went missing, believed stolen.",
      "Now, Taylor and his team believe it has reappeared. The Met says provenance records show no evidence the guitar ever belonged to Taylor.",
      "\u201cThis guitar has a long and well-documented history of ownership,\u201d museum spokesperson Ann Bailis said.",
      "Taylor\u2019s partner and business manager, Marlies Damming, said the Met should make the guitar \u201cavailable for inspection.\u201d",
      "\u201cAn independent guitar expert should be able to ascertain the guitar\u2019s provenance one way or the other,\u201d she said in a statement Tuesday to The Associated Press.",
      "While its ownership is contested, there\u2019s no disputing the instrument\u2019s starring role in rock history. It was owned in the early 1960s by Keith Richards, who played it during the Rolling Stones\u2019 first appearance on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d in 1964. The Met says that performance \u201cignited interest in this legendary model.\u201d",
      "The guitar \u2013 nicknamed the \u201cKeithburst\u201d \u2013 was also played by guitar legends Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page. Taylor says he got it from Richards in 1967, two years before he joined the Stones, replacing original member Brian Jones. Jones died in 1969.",

      "It was put up for auction by Christie\u2019s in 2004, when it failed to sell. Ziff bought it in 2016, and loaned it to the Met in 2019 for an exhibition titled \u201cPlay it Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- His is a Cinderella story.",
      "Before the big tours and country music award nominations, Bailey Zimmerman was growing up in the small town of Louisville, Illinois, working at the local meat processing plant and laying gas pipeline. Then, in 2020, he decided to upload videos of himself singing to social media \u2014 Black Stone Cherry's \u201cStay,\u201d and, later, an original.",
      "He quickly garnered a fan base on TikTok. It wasn't overnight, but it was fast. Soon, he inked a deal with Warner Music Nashville and released his debut full-length, 2023's \u201cReligiously. The Album.\u201d It peaked at No. 7 on the all-genre Billboard 200 chart and was certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Now comes Friday, when he follows it up with a sophomore offering, \u201cDifferent Night Same Rodeo.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't know what I'm doing,\u201d Zimmerman, 25, tells The Associated Press through a smile. \u201cI randomly got into music in 2020, 2021, and I\u2019d never sang before. I\u2019d never wrote songs before.\u201d",
      "After \u201cReligiously. The Album.\u201d did well \u2014 something he didn't see coming \u2014 Zimmerman found himself trying to recreate it while writing for his second album. \u201cIt just didn't work,\u201d he says. \u201cI just found myself not really writing that great of songs because I\u2019m trying to write other songs that have already been written.\u201d",
      "So, he took a step back, and asked himself: \u201cWhat am I trying to do with my music? And what is the whole goal of this next album?\u201d The answer was simple: He wanted to tell stories from his life.",
      "\u201cYou didn't know what you were doing the first time. And you don't know what you're doing now,\u201d he told himself. \u201cSo just write songs that you love and try to write songs that you feel like people can relate to, you know, stories from things I\u2019ve been through.\u201d",

      "Her publicist, Don Murry Grubbs, said she died Friday after succumbing to complications from an intestinal infection.",
      "Known as \u201cMiss Country Soul\u201d for her unique vocal style, Seely was a trailblazer for women in country music, celebrated for her spirited nonconformity and for a string of undeniable hits in the \u201860s and \u201970s.",
      "Her second husband, Gene Ward, died in December. In May, Seely revealed that she was in recovery after undergoing multiple back surgeries, two emergency procedures and spending 11 days in the ICU. She also suffered a bout of pneumonia.",
      "\u201cRehab is pretty tough, but each day is looking brighter and last night, I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. And it was neon, so I knew it was mine!\u201d she said in a statement at the time. \u201cThe unsinkable Seely is working her way back.\u201d",
      "Seely was born in July 1940, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, about two hours north of Pittsburgh and raised in nearby Townville. Her love of country music was instant; her mother sang, and her father played the banjo. When she was a child, she sang on local radio programs and performed on local television. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \u201cDon\u2019t Touch Me,\u201d the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",
      "Cochran and Seely were married in 1969 and divorced in 1979.",

      "Seely broke boundaries in her career \u2014 at a time when country music expected a kind of subservience from its women performers, Seely was a bit of a rebel, known for wearing a miniskirt on the Grand Ole Opry stage when it was still taboo.",
      "And she had a number of country hits in the \u201860s and \u201970s, including three Top 10 hits on what is now known as Billboard's hot country songs chart: \u201cDon't Touch Me,\u201d 1967's \u201cI'll Love You More (Than You Need)\u201d and 1973's \u201cCan I Sleep In Your Arms?\u201d, adapted from the folk song \u201cCan I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight Mister?\u201d",
      "In the years since, Seely continued to release albums, perform, and host, regularly appearing on country music programming. Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones, and Little Jimmy Dickens.",
      "And Seely never stopped working in country music. Since 2018, she's hosted the weekly \u201cSunday\u2019s with Seely\u201d on Willie Nelson's Willie\u2019s Roadhouse SiriusXM channel. That same year, she was inducted into the Music City Walk of Fame.",
      "She appeared nearly 5,400 times at the Grand Ole Opry, which she has been a member of since 1967. Grubbs said Saturday's Grand Ole Opry show would be dedicated to Seely.",
      "She released her latest song in July 2024, a cover of Dottie West's \u201cSuffertime,\u201d recorded at the world-renowned RCA Studio B. She performed it at the Opry the year before.",

      "Harrington Street, which is one block long, will also be called \u201cJerry Garcia Street.\" He died in 1995, but the band's popularity has only grown as younger generations discover the Dead's improvisational music, which blended rock, blues, folk and other styles.",

      "The World Health Organization has closed in on its bold goal of eradicating polio several times, but the paralytic virus is entrenched in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan",
      "KARACHI, Pakistan -- For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern Pakistan, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated against polio as part of a global campaign to wipe out the paralytic disease. She hears their demands and fears. Some are practical \u2013 families need basics like food and water more than vaccines. Others are simply unfounded \u2013 the oral doses are meant to sterilize their kids.",
      "Amid rampant misinformation and immense pressure for the campaign to succeed, Ayaz said, some managers have instructed workers to falsely mark children as immunized. And the vaccines, which must be kept cold, aren\u2019t always stored correctly, she added.",
      "\u201cIn many places, our work is not done with honesty,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "The World Health Organization and partners embarked on their polio campaign in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication \u2014 a feat seen only once for human diseases, with smallpox in 1980. They came close several times, including in 2021, when just five cases of the natural virus were reported in Pakistanand Afghanistan. But since then, cases rebounded, hitting 99 last year, and officials have missed at least six self-imposed eradication deadlines.",
      "Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio \u2014 which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours -- has never been interrupted. The worldwide campaign has focused most of its attention and funding there for the past decade.",
      "But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic oral vaccine, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the oral vaccinesparking outbreaks, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI \u2013 one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved.",
      "In Afghanistan and Pakistan \u2013 which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure \u2013 local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. But those issues, along with concerns by staffers and outside health officials, have long gone unaddressed, insiders say.",
      "Officials tout the successes \u2013 3 billion children vaccinated, an estimated 20 million people who would have been paralyzed spared \u2013 while acknowledging challenges in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Remote villages are hard to reach, some cultural and religious authorities instruct against vaccination, and hundreds of polio workers and security staff have been killed because of their alignment with a Western-led initiative.",
      "Dr. Jamal Ahmed, WHO\u2019s polio director, defended progress in those two countries, citing workers\u2019 tailored response in resistant pockets.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many children being protected today because of the work that was done over the past 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Its latest goal for eradication is 2029. The campaign says about 45 million children in Pakistan and 11 million in Afghanistan must be vaccinated this year. Children typically need four doses of two drops each to be considered fully immunized.",
      "Dr. Zulfiqar Bhutta, who has served on advisory groups for WHO, the Gates Foundation and others, said campaign officials should listen to the criticism of its tactics.",
      "\u201cContinuing blindly with the same strategies that we have relied on since eradication began is unlikely to lead to a different result,\u201d he said.",
      "Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade \u2013 given to AP by current and former staffers \u2013 show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers.",
      "The documents flagged multiple cases of falsified vaccination records, health workers being replaced by untrained relatives and workers improperly administering vaccines.",
      "On numerous occasions, WHO officials noted, \u201cvaccinators did not know about vaccine management,\u201d citing failure to keep doses properly cold. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting \u201cmore used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.\u201d",
      "According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, \u201cresulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.\u201d",
      "Vaccination teams worked \u201cin a hurried manner,\u201d reports said, with \u201cno plan for monitoring or supervision.\u201d A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Village elders said no one visited for at least two years.",
      "Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it\u2019s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. Door-to-door efforts are stymied by cultural barriers, unfounded stories about vaccines, and the region\u2019s poverty and transience.",
      "\u201cMost of the time when we go to vaccinate and knock on the door, the head of the house or the man is not at home,\u201d said one worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to talk to the press. \u201cMany people find it offensive that a stranger knocks on the door and talks to a woman.\u201d",
      "Some workers find families have moved. Occasionally, they say, the encounter abuse.",
      "\u201cWe have shared these problems with our senior officials,\u201d the worker told AP. \u201cThey know about it.\u201d",
      "In an email response to AP\u2019s questions about officials\u2019 knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted \u201coperational challenges\u201d in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has \u201crobust monitoring and evaluation processes.\u201d",
      "Worker Ayaz described \u201cfake finger marking\u201d \u2014 placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given.",
      "\u201cThere is so much pressure,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease \u2014 spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles \u2014 was among the world\u2019s most feared, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. People avoided crowded places during epidemics, and hospital wards filled with children encased in iron lungs after the virus immobilized their breathing muscles.",
      "Polio is mainly spread when people are exposed to water infected with the virus. In countries with poor sanitation, children often become infected when they come into contact with contaminated waste.",

But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine.",
      "In even rarer instances, the live virus can mutate into a form capable of starting new outbreaks among unimmunized people where vaccination rates are low.",
      "Worldwide, several hundred vaccine-derived cases have been reported annually since at least 2021, with at least 98 this year.",
      "Most public health experts agree the oral vaccine should be pulled as soon as possible. But they acknowledge there simply isn\u2019t enough injectable vaccine \u2014 which uses no live virus and doesn\u2019t come with the risks of the oral vaccine \u2014 to wipe out polio alone. The injectable vaccine also is more expensive and requires more training to administer.",
      "More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven\u2019t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign\u2019s problems.",
      "Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who sits on an independent board reviewing polio eradication, said it would be impossible to eliminate polio without the oral vaccine. But he\u2019s urged authorities to find ways to adapt, such as adopting new methods to identify polio cases more quickly. Since 2011, he and colleagues have issued regular reports about overall program failures.",

      "\u201cWHO is persisting with polio control and creating polio with one hand and attempting to control it by the other,\u201d John wrote.",
      "In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a \u201ccore pillar\u201d of eradication strategy and that \u201calmost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to step back and really care for the people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.\u201d",
      "Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. In the four years before polio was wiped out there, health workers delivered about 1 billion doses of the oral vaccine to more than 170 million children.",
      "Today, nearly all of the world\u2019s polio cases -- mostly in Africa and the Middle East -- are mutated viruses from the oral vaccine, except for Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong \u2013 particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. They miscalculated, leading to outbreaks in more than 40 countries that paralyzed more than 3,000 children, according to an expert report commissioned by WHO. Last year, a mutated virus traced to that effort paralyzed a baby in Gaza.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a public inquiry where all the evidence comes out and WHO makes serious changes, it will be very hard to trust them,\u201d he said.",
      "With an annual budget of about $1 billion, the polio initiative is among the most expensive in all of public health. This year, the U.S. withdrew from WHO, and President Donald Trump has cut foreign aid. WHO officials have privately admitted that sustaining funding would be difficult without success.",
      "Some say the money would be better spent on other health needs.",
      "\u201cWe have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn\u2019t buy us any progress,\u201d said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. \u201cIf this was a private company, we would demand results.\u201d",

Workers are accompanied by armed guards; Pakistani authorities say more than 200 workers and police assigned to protect them have been killed since the 1990s, mostly by militants.",
      "The campaign also is up against a wave of misinformation, including that the vaccine is made from pig urine or will make children reach puberty early. Some blame an anti-vaccine sentiment growing in the U.S. and other countries that have largely funded eradication efforts and say it\u2019s reaching even remote areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "In suburban southwest Pakistan, Saleem Khan, 58, said two grandchildren under 5 were vaccinated over his family\u2019s objections.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency plans to relax rules aimed at reducing auto tailpipe emissions",
      "DETROIT -- The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s plan this week to relax rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions is the latest Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric.",
      "As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA on Tuesday said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. That would cripple the legal basis for limiting emissions from things like power plants and motor vehicles.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.",
      "The tax law approved in early July also includes another provision that will hit Tesla and other EV makers in the pocketbook \u2014 repealing fines for automakers that don\u2019t meet federal fuel economy standards.",
      "Automakers can buy credits under a trading program if they don\u2019t meet the mileage standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don\u2019t rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers. The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.",
      "That is all set to go away under the new law.",
      "Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California\u2019s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales.",
      "It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles. And that's significant because transportation \u2014 which also includes ships, trains and planes \u2014 is the sector that contributes the most to planet-warming emissions in the U.S.",
      "Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation\u2019s vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. EVs do not use gasoline or emit greenhouse gases.",
      "The Trump administration and the auto industry have said both rules were unreasonable for manufacturers.",
      "Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 \u2014 they're currently at about 8% \u2014 along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon.",
      "The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035.",
      "But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden\u2019s inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. NHTSA will likely reset or significantly weaken them.",
      "Then there are the fines that automakers will no longer face for falling short on the fuel economy rules.",
      "\u201cWith the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, new penalties for automakers not complying with an illegal fuel economy standard designed to push EVs will be zero,\u201d NHTSA spokesman Sean Rushton said in a statement.",
      "Some legacy automakers have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties for not meeting them. Just last year, Jeep-maker Stellantis paid $190.7 million for model years 2019 and 2020, and General Motors paid $128.2 million for the 2016 and 2017 model years.",

      "The agency wrote to carmakers earlier this month informing them the penalties wouldn\u2019t be issued from the model year 2022 onward. Some automakers confirmed receiving the letter but declined to comment further.",
      "Experts say without them, the law \u201cinvites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a \u201cstunning decision\u201d for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. She said it amounted to a windfall for companies that chose to pay penalties rather than produce more efficient cars.",
      "Carlson said backing away from future fines also \u201cposes a dilemma for auto manufacturers who may feel bound to comply with the law, even if there is not a financial consequence for failing to do so.\u201d",
      "It takes a while for carmakers to shift their product lines, and experts say automakers might be locked into their technology and manufacturing decisions for the next few model years. But changes could come for model year 2027 and beyond, they said.",
      "EVs aren't as profitable as gas-engine cars, so automakers may make fewer of them if they no longer have to offset emissions from their gasoline models. Already, some automakers have pulled back on their ambitions to go all-electric with a slower pace of EV sales growth.",
      "\u201cAutomakers also know every presidential administration eventually comes to an end, so they won\u2019t abandon their EV development efforts,\" said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com. \"But they will reduce their near-term efforts in this area.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. kindergarten vaccination rates inched down again last year and the share of children with exemptions rose to an all-time high, according to federal data posted Thursday.",
      "The fraction of kids exempted from vaccine requirements rose to 4.1%, up from 3.7% the year before. It's the third record-breaking year in a row for the exemption rate, and the vast majority are parents withholding shots for nonmedical reasons.",
      "Meanwhile, 92.5% of 2024-25 kindergartners got their required measles-mumps-rubella shots, down slightly from the previous year. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccination rate was 95% \u2014 the level that makes it unlikely that a single infection will spark a disease cluster or outbreak.",
      "The vaccination numbers were posted as the U.S. experiences its worst year for measles spread in more than three decades, with more than 1,300 cases so far.",
      "\u201cThe concern, of course, is that with a further dip in the (vaccination) coverage, we\u2019re going to see even more measles in the coming months,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "It's possible that this year's outbreaks may spur more parents to get their children vaccinated before they go to school, said O'Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist.",
      "But Dr. Philip Huang isn't optimistic. Texas was particularly hard hits by measles this year, with more than half of the cases reported nationally. Despite that, the state passed a law making it easier for parents to get school vaccine exemptions for their kids.",
      "\u201cIt's crazy,\u201d said Huang, Dallas County's health director.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traditionally releases the vaccination coverage data in its flagship publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. CDC officials usually speak to the trends and possible explanations, and stress the importance of vaccinations. This year, the agency quietly posted the data online and \u2014 when asked about it \u2014 emailed a statement.",
      "\u201cThe decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Parents should consult their health care providers on options for their families,\u201d the statement said, adding; \u201cVaccination remains the most effective way to protect children from serious diseases like measles and whooping cough, which can lead to hospitalization and long-term health complications.\u201d",
      "The wording is more ambivalent about the importance of vaccinations than in the past. That is in keeping with communications from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before President Donald Trump put him in charge of federal health agencies.",
      "O'Leary noted the changes in the CDC messaging, which places personal choice before community protection.",

      "\u201cTo sort of weaken the language or weaken the messaging that they're sending is very concerning, because what they say does matter,\u201d he said.",
      "Public health officials focus on vaccination rates for kindergartners because schools can be cauldrons for germs and launching pads for community outbreaks.",
      "For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to school attendance mandates that required key vaccinations. All U.S. states and territories require that children attending child care centers and schools be vaccinated against a number of diseases, including, measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, whooping cough and chickenpox.",
      "All states allow exemptions for children with medical conditions that prevent them from receiving certain vaccines. And most also permit exemptions for religious or other nonmedical reasons.",
      "In the last decade, the percentage of kindergartners with medical exemptions has held steady, at about 0.2%. But the percentage with nonmedical exemptions has risen.",
      "The rates can be influenced by policies that make it harder or easier to obtain exemptions, and by local attitudes among families and doctors about the need to get children vaccinated. Online misinformation and the political divide that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines have led more parents to question routine childhood vaccinations, experts say.",
      "According to the CDC data, 15.4% of kindergartners had an exemption to one or more vaccines in Idaho in the last school year. But fewer than 0.5% did in Connecticut.",
      "It\u2019s good news that the vast majority of parents continue to get their kids vaccinated, O\u2019Leary said. And it\u2019s noteworthy that there is a gap between the percentage vaccinated and the percentage who are exempted \u2014 meaning there likely are unmet access issues, he added.",

      "A bipartisan program in Michigan aims to address the high costs of parenting by giving mothers thousands of dollars in cash with no strings attached",
      "FLINT, Mich. -- A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played.",
      "It was called a \u201cbaby parade.\u201d",
      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\u201d said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don\u2019t have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies\u2019 lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breast feeding supplies and baby clothes but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She\u2019s heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade Friday.",
      "\u201cFor so long moms have been vilified and not supported,\u201d Hanna said.",
      "Friends told Angela Sintery, 44, about Rx Kids when she found out she was pregnant with her second child. She's a preschool teacher who spread the word to other parents.",
      "Sintery had her first daughter 19 years before her second and had to buy all new baby supplies.",
      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",
      "\u201cSo this time around, I didn\u2019t have to stress about anything. I just had to worry about my baby,\u201d she said.",

      "The program relies heavily on philanthropic donations but Hanna\u2019s long-term goal is for the government to be the main provider.",
      "\u201cI see philanthropy as the doula of this program, they are helping birth it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are helping us prove that this is possible.\u201d",
      "Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. But with a divided Legislature only able to pass six bills total this year, it's unlikely the program will yet expand statewide soon.",
      "Even Damoose, among the program's top backers, said he doesn't think Michigan can afford statewide expansion yet. But the lawmaker who represents parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan does want to keep growing it.",
      "For fellow Republicans who oppose abortion as he does, the approach is a \u201cno brainer\u201d way to help pregnant women, Damoose said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been accused for years and years, and not without cause, of being pro-birth, but not pro-life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.\u201d",

      "The bill will also create a new children\u2019s saving program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "That\u2019s not available until children grow up and is more focused on building wealth rather than immediate relief, Hanna said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have that social infrastructure to invest in our families,\u201d Hanna said. \u201cNo wonder people aren\u2019t having children and our birth rates are going down.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has also toyed with the idea of giving families one-time $5,000 \u201cbaby bonuses,\u201d a policy similar to Rx Kids.",
      "Critics have rightly pointed out that doesn't come close to covering the cost of child care or other expenses. Defenders of a cash-in-hand approach, though, say any amount can help in those critical early months.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s part of a new narrative or the rekindling of an old narrative where we start to celebrate children and families,\u201d said Damoose.",

      "It's not a network glitch but a deliberate, multipronged and long-term effort by authorities to bring the internet under the Kremlin's full control. Authorities adopted restrictive laws and banned websites and platforms that won't comply. Technology has been perfected to monitor and manipulate online traffic.",
      "While it's still possible to circumvent restrictions by using virtual private network apps, those are routinely blocked, too.",
      "Authorities further restricted internet access this summer with widespread shutdowns of cellphone internet connections and adopting a law punishing users for searching for content they deem illicit.",

      "Experts and rights advocates told The Associated Press that the scale and effectiveness of the restrictions are alarming. Authorities seem more adept at it now, compared with previous, largely futile efforts to restrict online activities, and they're edging closer to isolating the internet in Russia.",
      "Human Rights Watch researcher Anastasiia Kruope describes Moscow\u2019s approach to reining in the internet as \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts.\"",
      "\"Bit by bit, you\u2019re trying to come to a point where everything is controlled.\u201d",
      "Kremlin efforts to control what Russians do, read or say online dates to 2011-12, when the internet was used to challenge authority. Independent media outlets bloomed, and anti-government demonstrations that were coordinated online erupted after disputed parliamentary elections and Putin\u2019s decision to run again for president.",
      "Russia began adopting regulations tightening internet controls. Some blocked websites; others required providers to store call records and messages, sharing it with security services if needed, and install equipment allowing authorities to control and cut off traffic.",
      "Companies like Google or Facebook were pressured to store user data on Russian servers, to no avail, and plans were announced for a \u201csovereign internet\u201d that could be cut off from the rest of the world.",
      "Russia\u2019s popular Facebook-like social media platform VK, founded by Pavel Durov long before he launched the Telegram messaging app, came under the control of Kremlin-friendly companies. Russia tried to block Telegram between 2018-20 but failed.",
      "Prosecutions for social media posts and comments became common, showing that authorities were closely watching the online space.",
      "Still, experts had dismissed Kremlin efforts to rein in the internet as futile, arguing Russia was far from building something akin to China\u2019s \u201cGreat Firewall,\u201d which Beijing uses to block foreign websites.",
      "After Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the government blocked major social media like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, as well as Signal and a few other messaging apps. VPNs also were targeted, making it harder to reach restricted websites.",
      "YouTube access was disrupted last summer in what experts called deliberate throttling by authorities. The Kremlin blamed YouTube owner Google for not maintaining its hardware in Russia. The platform has been wildly popular in Russia, both for entertainment and for voices critical of the Kremlin, like the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny.",

      "MAX, promoted as a one-stop shop for messaging, online government services, making payments and more, was rolled out for beta tests but has yet to attract a wide following. Over 2 million people registered by July, the Tass news agency reported.",

      "HERMOSILLO, Mexico -- The United States\u2019 suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Mart\u00edn Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border.",
      "Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. His family has faced punishing droughts before but has never before had to contend with the economic hit of a new scourge: the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite.",
      "U.S. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July \u2013 the third suspension of the past eight months \u2014 due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north.",
      "The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of any warm-blooded animal, including humans. The parasite enters animals\u2019 skin, causing severe damage and lesions that can be fatal. Infected animals are a serious threat to herds.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture calls it a \"devastating pest\" and said in June that it poses a threat to \u201cour livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.\u201d It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago.",
      "As part of its strategy the U.S. is preparing to breed billions of sterile flies and release them in Mexico and southern Texas. The aim is for the sterile males to mate with females in the wild who then produce no offspring.",
      "The U.S. ban on live cattle also applies to horses and bison imports. It hit a ranching sector already weakened by drought and specifically a cattle export business that generated $1.2 billion for Mexico last year. This year, Mexican ranchers have exported fewer than 200,000 head of cattle, which is less than half what they historically send in the same period.",
      "For Ibarra Vargas, considered a comparatively small rancher by Sonora\u2019s beef-centric standards, the inability to send his calves across the border has made him rethink everything.",
      "The repeated bans on Mexican cows by U.S. authorities has pushed his family to branch into beekeeping, raising sheep and selling cow's milk. What he earns is just a fraction of what he earned by exporting live cattle, but he is trying to hold on through the lean times.",
      "\u201cTiempos de vacas flacas\" \u2014 times of the lean cows \u2014 as he calls them.",
      "\u201cAt least it lets us continue\u201d ranching, the 57-year-old said with a white cowboy hat perched on his head.",

    "story": [
      "Last month, floods along the Nepal-China border that killed nine people also destroyed important infrastructure, washing out the primary bridge connecting the two nations and halting trade",
      "KATHMANDU, Nepal -- Floods that damaged hydropower dams in Nepal and destroyed the main bridge connecting the country to China show the vulnerability of infrastructure and need for smart rebuilding in a region bearing the brunt of a warming planet, experts say.",
      "The flooding of the Bhotekoshi River on July 8 also killed nine people and damaged an inland container depot that was being built to support increasing trade between the two countries. The 10 damaged hydropower facilities, including three under construction, have a combined capacity that could power 600,000 South Asian homes.",
      "Another smaller flood in the area on July 30 damaged roads and structures, but caused less overall destruction. Elsewhere in the Himalayas, flash floods swept away roads, homes and hotels on Tuesday in northern India, killing at least four people and leaving many others trapped under debris, officials said.",
      "The Himalayan region, which crosses Nepal and several nearby countries including India, is especially vulnerable to heavy rains, floods and landslides because the area is warming up faster than the rest of the world due to human-caused climate change. Climate experts say the increasing frequency of extreme weather has changed the playbook for assessing infrastructure risks while also increasing the need for smart rebuilding plans.",
      "\u201cThe statistics of the past no longer apply for the future,\u201d said John Pomeroy, a hydrologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. \u201cThe risk that goes into building a bridge or other infrastructure is generally based on historical observations of past risk, but this is no longer useful because future risk is different and often much higher.\u201d",
      "While damage estimates from the July floods in the Rasuwa region are still being calculated, past construction costs give a sense of the financial toll. The Sino-Nepal Friendship Bridge alone, for example, took $68 million to rebuild after it was destroyed by a 2015 earthquake that ravaged Nepal.",
      "The latest disaster has also stoked fears of long-lasting economic damage in a region north of the capital city Kathmandu that spent years rebuilding after the 2015 quake. Nepali government officials estimate that $724 million worth of trade with China is conducted over the bridge each year, and that has come to a standstill.",
      "\u201cThank God there wasn\u2019t much damage to local villages, but the container depot and bridges have been completely destroyed. This has severely affected workers, hotel operators, laborers, and truck drivers who rely on cross-border trade for their livelihoods,\u201d said Kaami Tsering, a local government official, in a phone interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Among those affected is Urken Tamang, a 50-year-old parking attendant at the depot who has been out of work for several weeks. A small tea shop he runs nearby with his family has also suffered.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been unlucky,\u201d said Tamang, a former farmer who sold his land and changed jobs when work on the depot began. He added: \u201cThe whole area was severely damaged by the 2015 earthquake, and just when life was slowly returning to normal, this devastating flood struck.\"",
      "The Nepal floods are the latest in a series of disasters in South Asia during this year\u2019s monsoon season. Research has shown that extreme weather has become more frequent in the region including heat waves, heavy rains and melting glaciers.",
      "Climate experts said smart planning and rebuilding in climate-vulnerable regions must include accounting for multiple risks, installing early warning systems, preparing local communities for disasters and, when needed, relocating infrastructure.",
      "\u201cWhat we have to avoid is the insanity of rebuilding after a natural disaster in the same place where it occurred and where we know it will occur again at even higher probability,\" said Pomeroy, the Canadian hydrologist. \"That\u2019s a very poor decision. Unfortunately, that\u2019s what most countries do.\u201d",
      "Before rebuilding in Rasuwa, Nepal government officials need to assess overall risks, including those due to extreme weather and climate change, said Bipin Dulal, an analyst at Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development.",
      "The bridge connecting the two countries was rebuilt to better withstand earthquakes after it was destroyed in 2015, but it appears that officials didn't properly account for the risk of flooding as intense as what occurred in early July, Dulal said.",
      "\u201cWe have to see what the extreme risk scenarios can be and we should rebuild in a way in which the infrastructure can handle those extremes,\u201d said Dulal.",

These led to losses of over $32 billion, the researchers found.",
      "\u201cThese disasters are all wake-up calls. These risks are real,\u201d said Ramesh Subramaniam, global director of programs and strategy at the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.",
      "A CDRI analysis found that $124 billion worth of Nepal's infrastructure is vulnerable to the impacts of climate-driven disasters, creating the potential for hundreds of millions of dollars in annual losses if the country doesn't invest in resiliency.",
      "\u201cInvesting a relatively smaller figure now would prevent the loss of these enormous sums of damages,\u201d said Subramaniam.",
      "Subramaniam said that most climate investments are directed towards mitigation, such as building clean energy projects and trying to reduce the amount of planet-heating gases being released. But given extreme weather damage already occurring, investing in adapting to global warming is also equally important, he said.",
      "\u201cI think countries are learning and adaptation is becoming a standard feature in their annual planning,\u201d he said.",
      "Global efforts to prepare for and deal with such losses include a climate loss and damage fund set up by the United Nations in 2023. The fund currently has $348 million available, which the U.N. warns is only a fraction of the yearly need for economic damage related to human-caused climate change. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank have also provided loans or grants to build climate-resilient projects.",
      "In Nepal\u2019s recently flood-ravaged region, Tsering, the local government official, said the repeated disasters have taken more than a financial toll on residents.",
      "\u201cEven though the river has now returned to a normal flow, the fear remains,\" he said. \"People will always worry that something like this could happen again.\u201d",

      "MOSCOW -- Russia has declared that it no longer considers itself bound by a self-imposed moratorium on the deployment of nuclear-capable intermediate range missiles, a warning that potentially sets the stage for a new arms race as tensions between Moscow and Washington rise again over Ukraine.",
      "In a statement Monday, the Russian Foreign Ministry linked the decision to efforts by the U.S. and its allies to develop intermediate range weapons and preparations for their deployment in Europe and other parts of the world. It specifically cited U.S. plans to deploy Typhoon and Dark Eagle missiles in Germany starting next year.",
      "The ministry noted that such actions by the U.S. and its allies create \u201cdestabilizing missile potentials\" near Russia, creating a \"direct threat to the security of our country\u201d and carry \u201csignificant harmful consequences for regional and global stability, including a dangerous escalation of tensions between nuclear powers.\u201d",
      "It didn't say what specific moves the Kremlin might take, but President Vladimir Putin has previously announced that Moscow was planning to deploy its new Oreshnik missiles on the territory of its neighbor and ally Belarus later this year.",
      "Asked where and when Russia could potentially deploy intermediate-range weapons, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that it's not something to be announced in advance.",
      "\u201cRussia no longer has any limitations, Russia no longer considers itself to be constrained by anything,\u201d Peskov told reporters. \u201cTherefore Russia believes it has the right to take respective steps if necessary.\u201d",
      "\u201cDecisions on specific parameters of response measures will be made by the leadership of the Russian Federation based on an interdepartmental analysis of the scale of deployment of American and other Western land-based intermediate-range missiles, as well as the development of the overall situation in the area of international security and strategic stability,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "The Russian statement follows President Donald Trump's announcement Friday that he\u2019s ordering the repositioning of two U.S. nuclear submarines \u201cbased on the highly provocative statements\u201d of Dmitry Medvedev, who was president in 2008-12 to allow Putin, bound by term limits, to later return to the office. Trump's statement came as his deadline for the Kremlin to reach a peace deal in Ukraine approaches later this week.",
      "Trump said he was alarmed by Medvedev\u2019s attitude. Medvedev, who serves as deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council chaired by Putin, has apparently sought to curry favor with his mentor by making provocative statements and frequently lobbing nuclear threats. Last week. he responded to Trump's deadline for Russia to accept a peace deal in Ukraine or face sanctions by warning him against \u201cplaying the ultimatum game with Russia\u201d and declaring that \u201ceach new ultimatum is a threat and a step toward war.\u201d",
      "Medvedev also commented on the Foreign Ministry\u2019s statement, describing Moscow's withdrawal from the moratorium as \u201cthe result of NATO countries\u2019 anti-Russian policy.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a new reality all our opponents will have to reckon with,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cExpect further steps.\u201d",

      "Mitsubishi\u2019s win was a boon for Japan\u2019s defense industry, which has not built naval vessels abroad before. Japan, whose only treaty ally is the United States, considers Australia a semi-ally and has increasingly sought to deepen bilateral military cooperation amid ongoing regional tensions in the disputed South China Sea.",

      "Nations have started a crucial meeting to finalize a treaty to tackle the global plastic pollution crisis",
      "Nations kicked off a meeting on Tuesday to try to complete a landmark treaty aimed at ending the plastic pollution crisis that affects every ecosystem and person on the planet.",
      "It\u2019s the sixth time negotiators are meeting and they hope the last. A key split is whether the treaty should require cutting plastic production, with powerful oil-producing nations opposed; most plastic is made from fossil fuels. They say redesign, recycling and reuse can solve the problem, while other countries and some major companies say that\u2019s not enough.",
      "Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the chair of the negotiating committee that aims to develop a legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, said: \u201cWe are pretty sure nobody wants plastic pollution. Still, we have not been able to find a systematic and an effective way to stop it.\u201d",
      "Valdivieso believes the 10-day gathering in Geneva can be groundbreaking.",
      "\u201cFor the first time in history, the world is within our reach of a legally binding international instrument to end plastic pollution,\u201d said Valdivieso, who is also Ecuador's ambassador to Britain. \u201cWe are facing a global crisis. Plastic pollution is damaging ecosystems, polluting our oceans and rivers, threatening biodiversity, harming human health and unfairly impacting the most vulnerable. The urgency is real.\u201d",
      "Only a treaty can mobilize the necessary global action, said Angelique Pouponneau, lead ocean negotiator for 39 small island and low-lying coastal developing states. At home in the Seychelles, Pouponneau said, plastic contaminates the fish they eat, piles up on beaches and chokes the ocean to undermine tourism and their way of life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the world\u2019s final opportunity to get this done and to get it done right,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be a tragedy if we didn\u2019t live up to our mandate.\"",
      "United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said the issues are complex, but the crisis is \u201creally spiraling\u201d and there's a narrow pathway to a treaty. She said many countries agree on redesigning plastic products to be recycled and improving waste management, for example.",
      "\u201cWe need to get a solution to this problem. Everybody wants it. I\u2019ve yet to meet somebody who is in favor of plastic pollution,\u201d Andersen said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- When the coronavirus surged during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, he called for a simple fix: Limit the amount of testing so the deadly outbreak looked less severe. When he lost the 2020 election, he had a ready-made reason: The vote count was fraudulent.",
      "And on Friday, when the July jobs report revisions showed a distressed economy, Trump had an answer: He fired the official in charge of the data and called the report of a sharp slowdown in hiring \u201cphony.\u201d",

      "\u201cOur democratic system and the strength of our private economy depend on the honest flow of information about our economy, our government and our society,\u201d said Douglas Elmendorf, a Harvard University professor who was formerly director of the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cThe Trump administration is trying to suppress honest analysis.\u201d",

His denouncements threaten to lower trust in government and erode public accountability, and any manipulation of federal data could result in policy choices made on faulty numbers, causing larger problems for both the president and the country.",
      "The White House disputes any claims that Trump wants to hide numbers that undermine his preferred narratives. It emphasized that Goldman Sachs found that the two-month revisions on the jobs report were the largest since 1968, outside of a recession, and that should be a source of concern regarding the integrity of the data. Trump's aides say their fundamental focus is ensuring that any data gives an accurate view of reality.",
      "Trump has a long history of dismissing data when it reflects poorly on him and extolling or even fabricating more favorable numbers, a pattern that includes his net worth, his family business, election results and government figures:",
      "\u2014 Judge Arthur Engoron ruled in a lawsuit brought by the state of New York that Trump and his company deceived banks, insurers and others by massively overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork used in making deals and securing loans.",
      "\u2014 Trump has claimed that the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections were each rigged. Trump won the 2016 presidential election by clinching the Electoral College, but he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, a sore spot that led him to falsely claim that millions of immigrants living in the country illegally had cast ballots. He lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden but falsely claimed he had won it, despite multiple lawsuits failing to prove his case.",
      "\u2014 In 2019, as Hurricane Dorian neared the East Coast, Trump warned Alabama that the storm was coming its way. Forecasters pushed back, saying Alabama was not at risk. Trump later displayed a map in the Oval Office that had been altered with a black Sharpie \u2014 his signature pen \u2014 to include Alabama in the potential path of the storm.",

So I said to my people, \u2018Slow the testing down, please.\u2019\u201d",
      "While Trump's actions have drawn outcry from economists, scientists and public interest groups, Elmendorf noted that Trump's actions regarding economic data could be tempered by Congress, which could put limits on Trump by whom he chooses to lead federal agencies, for example.",
      "\u201cOutside observers can only do so much,\" Elmendorf said. \u201cThe power to push back against the president rests with the Congress. They have not exercised that power, but they could.\u201d",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, took aim at the size of the downward revisions in the jobs report (a combined 258,000 reduction in May and June) to suggest that the report had credibility issues. He said Trump is focused on getting dependable numbers, despite the president linking the issue to politics by claiming the revisions were meant to make Republicans look bad.",

      "The unprecedented early closure of the fishery follows a report by The Associated Press last week detailing a record surge in the krill catch after a longstanding conservation framework was allowed to lapse with no plan in place to handle growing pressures in the world's southernmost fishery.",
      "The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, the international organization that manages the fishery, declined to comment but confirmed the closure earlier this month of the 2024-25 season, which should have extended until December, after fishing hit the 620,000 metric ton limit.",
      "The U.S., Russia, China and two dozen other governments last year failed to approve a new management plan that would have mandated spreading out the area in which krill can be caught and create a California-sized reserve along the environmentally sensitive Antarctic Peninsula.",
      "In the absence of a deal, industrial trawlers were allowed this season to essentially fish anywhere at any time, including in smaller habitats preferred by whales, penguins and seals. In one hot spot, the catch through June 30 was nearly 60% higher than all of last season\u2019s haul, according to an internal CCAMLR report obtained by the AP.",
      "Krill is one of the most abundant marine species in the world, with an estimated biomass of 63 million metric tons. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill\u2019s Omega-3 rich oil \u2013 for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements \u2014 have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill \u2014 until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973.",

      "European allies and Canada are buying most of the equipment they plan to send from the United States, which has greater stocks of ready military materiel, as well as more effective weapons. The Trump administration is not giving any arms to Ukraine.",

      "A new federal rule would make it easier for companies to use drones over longer distances out of sight of the operator without having to go through a cumbersome waiver process",
      "A new federal rule proposed Tuesday would make it easier for companies to use drones over longer distances out of the operator's sight without having to go through a cumbersome waiver process.",
      "The federal government had already approved 657 waivers to allow companies such as Amazon and major utilities to do this in certain circumstances, but the waiver process made it difficult. The rule would establish a clear process for drone operators to seek approval for using drones this way.",
      "The industry has long pressed for the rule because being able to operate drones out of sight opens up a multitude of possibilities for their use. Being able to do this enables more use of drones for deliveries, inspecting infrastructure like bridges and power lines and other uses in agriculture like spraying fertilizer over thousands of acres on large farms.",
      "\u201cThis draft rule is a critical step toward enabling drone operations that will enhance safety, transform commercial services, and strengthen public safety with drones as a force multiplier,\" Michael Robbins, president & CEO of the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International trade group, said in a statement.",
      "The rule spells out the circumstances drones can be used. These out of sight flights will only be allowed under 400 feet, and there are precautions to ensure they don't disrupt aviation and cause problems around airports, Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford said. The drones will be required to have collision-avoidance technology to keep them away from planes and other drones. And the rule will only allow drones up to 1,320 pounds \u2014 including their payloads.",
      "\u201cThe issue hasn\u2019t been that America just can\u2019t innovate, America can\u2019t create, America can\u2019t build amazing drone technology. It\u2019s that we\u2019ve had a bureaucracy in place that makes it incredibly incredibly difficult for innovators to actually innovate,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said.",
      "The rules are designed to address the way modern drones are being used today.",
      "\u201cWhile the technology has rapidly advanced over the last decade, our regulatory framework in the United States has failed to keep pace,\u201d said Lisa Ellman, CEO of the Commercial Drone Alliance group. \u201cDrone operators must navigate a labyrinth of ill-suited regulations designed for crewed aircraft.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump issued executive orders in June directing the Transportation Department to quickly get this rule out. The orders also included restrictions meant to help protect against terrorism, espionage and public safety threats.",
      "Drones are already used in a variety of ways, including bolstering search and rescue operations, applying fertilizer, inspecting power lines and railroad bridges, and even delivering packages.",
      "Amazon is one of the companies that received a waiver allowing it to use drones this way for some of its deliveries in College Station, Texas, as it develops the technology. This rule should make it easier for Amazon and other companies to get approval to use drones this way in more communities.",
      "Flytrex, a Tel Aviv-based drone delivery company that has operations in Texas and North Carolina, said it was excited to see the proposed rule take shape. Flytrex co-founder and CEO Yariv Bash called the proposed rule \u201ca foundational milestone that paves the way for drone delivery to scale across more communities in the U.S.\u201d",

And White House officials said drones are being used to smuggle drugs over the border, and there are concerns about the potential for a disastrous collision between a drone and an airliner around an airport.",
      "The rule won't allow drone flights over large open-air gatherings like concerts or sporting events or crowded parks.",
      "The FAA consulted with the Department of Homeland Security as it developed this rule to make sure security concerns are addressed. The government will accept comments on the new rule over the next 60 days before finalizing the rule likely sometime later this year. Drone operators will have to go through background checks and be certified to operate drones out of their sight.",
      "Duffy and Bedford said they hope having regulations in place can help prevent problems like earlier this year when a small drone collided with a \u201cSuper Scooper\u201d plane that was fighting wildfires raging through Southern California. The drone punched a hole in the plane\u2019s left wing, causing enough damage that officials grounded the aircraft for several days to make repairs.",
      "Authorities tracked down the 56-year-old drone operator, who pleaded guilty to a federal charge of recklessly flying his aircraft. The man admitted he launched his DJI quadcopter to observe fire damage over the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, despite the FAA having restricted drone flying in the area, according to court records. The operator lost sight of the drone after it flew about 1.5 miles from where he had launched it. And that\u2019s when it struck the \u201cSuper Scooper.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,\" Bessent said.",
      "On Thursday, he called the Chinese \u201ctough\u201d negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. \u201cI believe that we have the makings of a deal,\u201d Bessent told CNBC.",
      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Donald Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \u201cRealizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\u201d for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",

      "\u201cIf the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China\u2019s consistent official stance,\u201d said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \u201cthe one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Trump has made it clear he wants a \u201cheadline-grabbing deal\u201d with Xi, \u201cso rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \u201cstrategic solidarity\u201d with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\u201cBeijing simply can\u2019t afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\u201d",

      "A new poll finds the vast majority of U.S. adults are feeling some stress about the cost of groceries, as prices continue to rise and concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs remain widespread",
      "NEW YORK -- The vast majority of U.S. adults are at least somewhat stressed about the cost of groceries, a new poll finds, as prices continue to rise and concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs remain widespread.",
      "About half of all Americans say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress in their life right now, while 33% say it's a \u201cminor\u201d source of stress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only 14% say it's not a source of stress, underscoring the pervasive anxiety most Americans continue to feel about the cost of everyday essentials.",
      "Other financial stressors \u2014 like the cost of housing or the amount of money in their bank accounts \u2014 are also broadly felt, but they weigh more heavily on younger Americans, who are less likely than older adults to have significant savings or own property.",
      "The survey also found that about 4 in 10 Americans under age 45 say they've used what are known as \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d services when spending on entertainment or restaurant meals or when paying for essentials like groceries or medical care.",
      "Adam Bush, 19, based in Portland, New York, is one of those younger Americans who has used pay-later services for things like groceries or entertainment. Bush works as a welder, fabricating parts for trucks for Toyota, and makes under $50,000 per year.",
      "\u201cI just keep watching the prices go up, so I\u2019m looking for the cheapest possible stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cHot pockets and TV dinners.\u201d",
      "Groceries are one of the most far-reaching financial stressors, affecting the young and old alike, the poll finds. While Americans over age 60 are less likely than younger people to feel major financial anxiety about housing, their savings, child care, or credit card debt, they are just as worried about the cost of groceries.",
      "Esther Bland, 78, who lives in Buckley, Washington, said groceries are a \u201cminor\u201d source of stress \u2014 but only because her local food banks fill the gap. Bland relies on her Social Security and disability payments each month to cover her rent and other expenses \u2014 such as veterinary care for her dogs \u2014 in retirement, after decades working in an office processing product orders.",
      "\u201cI have no savings,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm not sure what's going on politically when it comes to the food banks, but if I lost that, groceries would absolutely be a major source of stress.\u201d",
      "Bland's monthly income mainly goes toward her electric, water and cable bills, she said, as well as care of her dogs and other household needs.",
      "\u201cSoap, paper towels, toilet paper. I buy gas at Costco, but we haven't seen $3 a gallon here in a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cI stay home a lot. I only put about 50 miles on my car a week.\u201d",
      "According to the poll, 64% of the lowest-income Americans \u2014 those who have a household income of less than $30,000 a year \u2014 say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d stressor. That's compared with about 4 in 10 Americans who have a household income of $100,000 or more.",
      "But even within that higher-income group, only about 2 in 10 say grocery costs aren't a worry at all.",
      "Housing is another substantial source of worry for U.S. adults \u2014 along with their savings, their income and the cost of health care. About half of U.S. adults say housing is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, according to the poll, while about 4 in 10 say that about the amount of money they get paid, the amount of money they have saved and the cost of health care.",
      "About 3 in 10 say credit card debt is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, while about 2 in 10 say that about the cost of child care and student debt.",
      "But some groups are feeling much more anxiety about their finances than others. Women, for instance, are more likely than men to report high levels of stress about their income, savings, the cost of groceries and the cost of health care. Hispanic adults are also particularly concerned about housing costs and both credit card and student debt. About two-thirds of Hispanic adults say the cost of housing is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, compared with about half of Black adults and about 4 in 10 white adults.",

    "story": [
      "The Culinary Workers Union representing 60,000 hospitality workers in Nevada has achieved a historic victory on the Las Vegas Strip",
      "LAS VEGAS -- When Susana Pacheco accepted a housekeeping job at a casino on the Las Vegas Strip 16 years ago, she believed it was a step toward stability for her and her 2-year-old daughter.",
      "But the single mom found herself exhausted, falling behind on bills and without access to stable health insurance, caught in a cycle of low pay and little support. For years, she said, there was no safety net in sight \u2014 until now.",
      "For 25 years, her employer, the Venetian, had resisted organizing efforts as one of the last holdouts on the Strip, locked in a prolonged standoff with the Culinary Workers Union. But a recent change in ownership opened the Venetian\u2019s doors to union representation just as the Strip\u2019s newest casino, the Fontainebleau, was also inking its first labor contract.",
      "The historic deals finalized late last year mark a major turning point: For the first time in the Culinary Union's 90-year history, all major casinos on the Strip are unionized. Backed by 60,000 members, most of them in Las Vegas, it is the largest labor union in Nevada. Experts say the Culinary Union\u2019s success is a notable exception in a national landscape where union membership overall is declining.",
      "\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve shown that change can be a positive force, and I\u2019m confident that this partnership will continue to benefit us all in the years to come,\" Patrick Nichols, president and CEO of the Venetian, said shortly after workers approved the deal.",
      "Pacheco says their new contract has already reshaped her day-to-day life. The housekeeper no longer races against the clock to clean an unmanageable number of hotel suites, and she\u2019s spending more quality time with her children because of the better pay and guaranteed days off.",
      "\u201cNow with the union, we have a voice,\u201d Pacheco said.",
      "These gains come at a time when union membership nationally is at an all-time low, and despite Republican-led efforts over the years to curb union power. About 10% of U.S. workers belonged to a union in 2024, down from 20% in 1983, the first year for which data is available, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics.",
      "President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order seeking to end collective bargaining for certain federal employees that led to union leaders suing the administration. Nevada and more than two dozen other states now have so-called \u201cright to work\u201d laws that let workers opt out of union membership and dues. GOP lawmakers have also supported changes to the National Labor Relations Board and other regulatory bodies, seeking to reduce what they view as overly burdensome rules on businesses.",
      "Ruben Garcia, professor and director of the workplace program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas law school, said the Culinary Union's resilience stems from its deep roots in Las Vegas, its ability to adapt to the growth and corporatization of the casino industry, and its long history of navigating complex power dynamics with casino owners and operators.",
      "He said the consolidation of casinos on the Las Vegas Strip mirrors the dominance of the Big Three automakers in Detroit. A few powerful companies \u2014 MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts \u2014 now control most of the dozens of casinos along Las Vegas Boulevard.",
      "\u201cThat consolidation can make things harder for workers in some ways, but it also gives unions one large target,\" Garcia said.",

      "That dynamic worked in the union's favor in 2023, when the threat of a major strike by 35,000 hospitality workers with expired contracts loomed over the Strip. But a last-minute deal with Caesars narrowly averted the walkout, and it triggered a domino effect across the Strip, with the union quickly finalizing similar deals for workers at MGM Resorts and Wynn properties.",
      "The latest contracts secured a historic 32% bump in pay over the life of the five-year contract. Union casino workers will earn an average $35 hourly, including benefits, by the end of it.",
      "The union's influence also extends far beyond the casino floor. With its ability to mobilize thousands of its members for canvassing and voter outreach, the union's endorsements are highly coveted, particularly among Democrats, and can signal who has the best shot at winning working-class votes.",
      "The union's path hasn't always been smooth though. Michael Green, a history professor at UNLV, noted the Culinary Union has long faced resistance.",
      "\u201cHistorically, there have always been people who are anti-union,\u201d Green said.",
      "Earlier this year, two food service workers in Las Vegas filed federal complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the union of deducting dues despite their objections to union membership. It varies at each casino, but between 95 to 98% of workers opt in to union membership, according to the union.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Culinary Union bosses deserve my support,\u201d said one of the workers, Renee Guerrero, who works at T-Mobile Arena on the Strip. \u201cTheir actions since I attempted to exercise my right to stop dues payments only confirms my decision.\u201d",
      "But longtime union members like Paul Anthony see things differently. Anthony, a food server at the Bellagio and a Culinary member for nearly 40 years, said his union benefits \u2014 free family health insurance, reliable pay raises, job security and a pension \u2014 helped him to build a lasting career in the hospitality industry.",
      "\u201cA lot of times it is an industry that doesn't have longevity,\" he said. But on the Strip, it's a job that people can do for \u201c20 years, 30 years, 40 years.\u201d",
      "Ted Pappageorge, the union's secretary-treasurer and lead negotiator, said the union calls this the \u201cLas Vegas dream.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been our goal to make sure that this town is a union town,\" he said.",

      "Somalia is seeing quiet agricultural revolution centered around camels",
      "MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Camels have long been the backbone of Somalia 's pastoralist culture, feeding families, transporting goods and standing tall in local folklore. But on the dusty outskirts of the capital, the camel now finds itself at the center of an agricultural revolution that could redefine Somali farming.",
      "On a breezy Wednesday morning in mid-June, The Associated Press visited Beder Camel Farm \u2014 one of a new generation of camel dairies springing up around Mogadishu.",
      "Dozens of camels sauntered around sandy paddocks while others nibbled on fresh fodder under the watchful eyes of herders. In a nearby shed, workers carefully milked the animals and collected the frothy yield in sanitized containers.",
      "Demand for camel milk is growing, buoyed by a wave of local entrepreneurs who see untapped potential in a traditional resource.",
      "Somalia is home to over 7 million camels \u2014 more than any other country on Earth \u2014 but only a fraction of that milk has ever reached urban grocery shelves, according to industry estimates.",
      "At the heart of the shift toward a modern approach to camel milk production is Dr. Abdirisak Mire Hashi, a veterinarian and the farm\u2019s manager. For Hashi, it's not only about profit \u2014 it's about preserving heritage while embracing progress.",
      "\u201cSomalis take pride in their heritage of raising camels. However, the way camels are raised has changed significantly over time,\" Hashi told The Associated Press as he inspected a milking herd.",
      "Each camel at Beder now produces up to 10 liters (2.6 gallons) of milk daily \u2014 double what traditional herders typically yield. The increase is attributed to new investments in veterinary care, better feed, and modern milking practices. The camels are routinely checked by vets, given nutritional supplements, and grazed on scientifically blended fodder, a far cry from the roaming nomadic herds of decades gone by.",
      "\u201cWe were among the first to establish this kind of farm back in 2006, when very few people even knew about commercial camel milk production,\u201d said Jama Omar, CEO of Beder Camel Farm. \u201cOther farms have entered the market since then, but we currently hold around 40% of the market share.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe employ nearly 200 full-time staff,\u201d he added. \u201cIn addition, we bring in seasonal workers during key periods such as planting and harvest.\u201d",
      "The farm\u2019s biggest leap may be its yogurt factory \u2014 the first in Somalia dedicated to processing camel milk into yogurt.",
      "Inside the factory, workers in white coats oversee stainless steel vats as fresh milk is cultured and packed. The final product is sold under the Beder brand which now retails in urban supermarkets across Mogadishu.",
      "Nelson Njoki Githu, a Kenyan-born food engineer overseeing the production line, says camel milk yogurt isn\u2019t just a novelty \u2014 it fills an important nutritional gap for local consumers.",
      "\u201cThe number one benefit compared to cow milk is that camel milk has lower levels of lactose,\u201d Githu explained. \u201cPeople with lactose intolerance can consume this milk without any issue. Again, the vitamin levels are higher, especially vitamin C, iron and zinc, compared to cow milk.\u201d",

      "Such benefits have helped Beder\u2019s yogurt stand out in Mogadishu\u2019s increasingly competitive dairy market.",
      "Hashi said the next step is scaling up the business. He hopes to expand Beder\u2019s network of collection points beyond Mogadishu and plans to train pastoralists in remote areas on modern milking and hygiene practices so that more milk can be safely processed and sold.",
      "\u201cIf we can modernize how we raise camels and handle the milk, we can create jobs, improve nutrition, and build pride in our own local products,\u201d Hashi said.",
      "The Somali government is encouraging more investment in the industry.",
      "\u201cThe benefits of camel milk are countless,\u201d said Dr. Kasim Abdi Moalim, Director of Animal Health at Somalia\u2019s Ministry of Livestock. \u201cIn countries like the UAE, camel milk is also used for cosmetics. Somalia must catch up and develop the full value chain.\u201d",

      "\u201cFirst Steps\u201d is the last major blockbuster of the summer. It added nearly $40 million internationally in its second weekend, bringing thefilm's global total to $369 million. The movie's box office drop off was surprising given its strong reviews, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore.",
      "Though the movie\u2019s debut weekend may have given box office results a strong push toward the $4 billion summer benchmark, August is off to a slow start, he said.",

      "Newcomer comedy \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d earned second place at the box office this weekend, with $22 million from 3,852 North American theaters.

      "NEW DELHI -- The men shared bear hugs, showered praise on each other and made appearances side by side at stadium rallies \u2014 a big optics boost for two populist leaders with ideological similarities. Each called the other a good friend.",
      "In India, the bonhomie between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump was seen as a relationship like no other. That is, until a series of events gummed up the works.",
      "From Trump\u2019s tariffs and India\u2019s purchase of oil from Russia to a U.S. tilt toward Pakistan, friction between New Delhi and Washington has been hard to miss. And much of it has happened far from the corridors of power and, unsurprisingly, through Trump\u2019s posts on social media.",
      "It has left policy experts wondering whether the camaraderie the two leaders shared may be a thing of the past, even though Trump has stopped short of referring to Modi directly on social media. The dip in rapport, some say, puts a strategic bilateral relationship built over decades at risk.",
      "\u201cThis is a testing time for the relationship,\u201d said Ashok Malik, a former policy adviser in India\u2019s Foreign Ministry.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "The latest hiccup between India and the U.S. emerged last week when Trump announced that he was slapping 25% tariffs on India as well as an unspecified penalty because of India\u2019s purchasing of Russian oil. For New Delhi, such a move from its largest trading partner is expected to be felt across sectors, but it also led to a sense of unease in India \u2014 even more so when Trump, on social media, called India\u2019s economy \u201cdead.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s recent statements reflect his frustration with the pace of trade talks with India, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal administration thinking. The Republican president has not been pursuing any strategic realignment with Pakistan, according to the official, but is instead trying to play hardball in negotiations.",
      "Trump doubled down on the pressure Monday with a fresh post on Truth Social, in which he accused India of buying \u201cmassive amounts\u201d of oil from Russia and then \u201cselling it on the Open Market for big profits.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine. Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA,\u201d he said.",
      "The messaging appears to have stung Modi\u2019s administration, which has been hard-selling negotiations with Trump\u2019s team over a trade deal by balancing between India\u2019s protectionist system while also opening up the country\u2019s market to more American goods.",
      "\u201cStrenuous, uninterrupted and bipartisan efforts in both capitals over the past 25 years are being put at risk by not just the tariffs but by fast and loose statements and social media posts,\u201d said Malik, who now heads the India chapter of The Asia Group, a U.S. advisory firm .",
      "Malik also said the trade deal the Indian side has offered to the U.S. is the \u201cmost expansive in this country\u2019s history,\u201d referring to reports that India was willing to open up to some American agricultural products. That is a politically sensitive issue for Modi, who faced a yearlong farmers\u2019 protest a few years ago.",
      "The unraveling may have gained momentum over tariffs, but the tensions have been palpable for a while. Much of it has to do with Trump growing closer to Pakistan, India\u2019s nuclear rival in the neighborhood.",
      "In May, India and Pakistan traded a series of military strikes over a gun massacre in disputed Kashmir that New Delhi blamed Islamabad for. Pakistan denied the accusations. The four-day conflict made the possibility of a nuclear conflagration between the two sides seem real and the fighting only stopped when global powers intervened.",
      "But it was Trump\u2019s claims of mediation and an offer to work to provide a \u201csolution\u201d regarding the dispute over Kashmir that made Modi\u2019s administration uneasy. Since then, Trump has repeated nearly two dozen times that he brokered peace between India and Pakistan.",
      "For Modi, that is a risky \u2014 even nervy \u2014 territory. Domestically, he has positioned himself as a leader who is tough on Pakistan. Internationally, he has made huge diplomatic efforts to isolate the country. So Trump\u2019s claims cut a deep wound, prompting a sense in India that the U.S. may no longer be its strategic partner.",

      "Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, an expert at New Delhi\u2019s Jindal School of International Affairs, said Trump\u2019s sudden admiration for Pakistan as a great partner in counterterrorism has \u201cdefinitely soured\u201d the mood in India.",
      "Chaulia said \u201cthe best-case scenario is that this is just a passing Trump whim,\u201d but he also warned that \u201cif financial and energy deals are indeed being struck between the U.S. and Pakistan, it will dent the U.S.-India strategic partnership and lead to loss of confidence in the U.S. in Indian eyes.\u201d",
      "The strain in relations has also to do with oil.",
      "India had faced strong pressure from the Biden administration to cut back its oil purchases from Moscow during the early months of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Instead, India bought more, making it the second-biggest buyer of Russian oil after China. That pressure sputtered over time and the U.S. focused more on building strategic ties with India, which is seen as a bulwark against a rising China.",
      "Trump\u2019s threat to penalize India over oil, however, brought back those issues.",
      "On Sunday, the Trump administration made its frustrations over ties between India and Russia ever more public. Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff at the White House, accused India of financing Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine by purchasing oil from Moscow, saying it was \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d",
      "Miller's remarks were followed by another Trump social media post on Monday in which he again threatened to raise tariffs on goods from India over its Russian oil purchases.",
      "\u201cIndia is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits. They don\u2019t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Some experts, though, suspect Trump's remarks are mere pressure tactics. \u201cGiven the wild fluctuations in Trump\u2019s policies,\u201d Chaulia said, \u201cit may return to high fives and hugs again.\u201d",
      "Many expected India to react strongly over Trump's tariff threats considering Modi\u2019s carefully crafted reputation of strength. Instead, the announcement prompted a rather careful response from India\u2019s commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, who said the two countries are working toward a \u201cfair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement.\u201d",
      "Initially, India\u2019s Foreign Ministry also played down suggestions of any strain. But in a statement late Monday, it called Trump\u2019s criticism \u201cunjustified and unreasonable\u201d and said it will take \u201call necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.\u201d",
      "It said India began importing oil from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, calling it a \u201cnecessity compelled by global market situation.\u201d",
      "The statement also noted U.S. trade with Russia.",
      "\u201cIt is revealing that the very nations criticizing India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia,\u201d the statement said.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump may have gotten his way with tariffs on some countries, but his overhaul of American trade policy has not gone unchallenged",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has been getting his way on trade, strong-arming the European Union, Japan and other partners to accept once unthinkably high taxes on their exports to the United States.",
      "But his radical overhaul of American trade policy, in which he's bypassed Congress to slam big tariffs on most of the world's economies, has not gone unchallenged. He's facing at least seven lawsuits charging that he's overstepped his authority. The plaintiffs want his biggest, boldest tariffs thrown out.",
      "And they won Round One.",
      "In May, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade, a specialized federal court in New York, ruled that Trump exceeded his powers when he declared a national emergency to plaster taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on imports from almost every country in the world. In reaching its decision, the court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.",
      "Now it goes on to Round Two.",
      "On Thursday, the 11 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which typically specializes in patent law, are scheduled to hear oral arguments from the Trump administration and from the states and businesses that want his sweeping import taxes struck down.",
      "That court earlier allowed the federal government to continue collecting Trump\u2019s tariffs as the case works its way through the judicial system.",
      "The issues are so weighty \u2014 involving the president\u2019s power to bypass Congress and impose taxes with huge economic consequences in the United States and abroad \u2014 that the case is widely expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, regardless of what the appeals court decides.",
      "Trump is an unabashed fan of tariffs. He sees the import taxes as an all-purpose economic tool that can bring manufacturing back to the United States, protect American industries, raise revenue to pay for the massive tax cuts in his \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill,\u2019\u2019 pressure countries into bending to his will, even end wars.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives the power to impose taxes \u2014 including tariffs \u2014 to Congress. But lawmakers have gradually relinquished power over trade policy to the White House. And Trump has made the most of the power vacuum, raising the average U.S. tariff to more than 18%, highest since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.",
      "At issue in the pending court case is Trump\u2019s use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs without seeking congressional approval or conducting investigations first. Instead, he asserted the authority to declare a national emergency that justified his import taxes.",

The emergency he cited was America's long-running trade deficit.",
      "Trump later suspended the reciprocal tariffs, but they remain a threat: They could be imposed again Friday on countries that do not pre-empt them by reaching trade agreements with the United States or that receive letters from Trump setting their tariff rates himself.",
      "The plaintiffs argue that the emergency power laws does not authorize the use of tariffs. They also note that the trade deficit hardly meets the definition of an \u201cunusual and extraordinary\u2019\u2019 threat that would justify declaring an emergency under the law. The United States, after all, has run trade deficits \u2014 in which it buys more from foreign countries than it sells them \u2014 for 49 straight years and in good times and bad.",
      "The Trump administration argues that courts approved President Richard Nixon\u2019s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language used in IEEPA.",
      "In May, the trade court rejected the argument, ruling that Trump\u2019s Liberation Day tariffs \u201cexceed any authority granted to the President\u2019\u2019 under the emergency powers law.",
      "\u201cThe president doesn\u2019t get to use open-ended grants of authority to do what he wants,\u2019\u2019 said Reilly Stephens, senior counsel at the Liberty Justice Center, a libertarian legal group that is representing businesses suing the Trump administration over the tariffs.",

      "The court challenge does not cover other Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos that the president imposed after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.",

The promotion helped draw a sellout crowd of 41,944 fans, with nearly all of them sticking around to watch the postgame event.",
      "Other clubs noticed, too.",
      "\u201cI thought it was a great idea and applaud them,\u201d Arizona Diamondbacks president and CEO Derrick Hall said. \u201cI believe all of us will be considering something similar.\u201d",
      "Brewers manager Pat Murphy is among those already has been conjuring up ways to expand on this idea.",
      "\u201cI think it just opens the door,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cCan you imagine the Brewers versus the Cubs home run derby \u2014 their three legends versus legends of ours. You know what I mean? Can you imagine that happening around the league?\u201d",
      "The Brewers\u2019 home run derby occurred 11 days after Seattle\u2019s Cal Raleigh won Major League Baseball\u2019s Home Run Derby and 10 days after the All-Star Game was decided on a swing-off. With the game tied 6-6 after nine innings, three batters from each league took three swings and Philadelphia\u2019s Kyle Schwarber homered three times to give the NL a 4-3 victory.",
      "Brewers president of business operations Rick Schlesinger said a half-dozen MLB teams reached out after their alumni home run derby to get information on how well it had worked.",
      "Milwaukee\u2019s promotion was part of a 25th-anniversary celebration of American Family Field. Keon Broxton, who played for the Brewers from 2016-18, won the event and recreated Fielder\u2019s most famous home-run celebration by standing tall at home while the teammates surrounding him fell back like a collection of bowling pins.",
      "\u201cIt was awesome,\u201d Broxton said afterward.",
      "Milwaukee wasn\u2019t the first team to do this kind of promotion. The Houston Astros staged their own alumni home run derby events in 2018 and 2019. The Atlanta Braves had an alumni softball home run derby last year.",
      "The format represents a different way to welcome back former players rather than having the traditional Old Timers\u2019 Day games from yesteryear. The New York Yankees are holding their first Old Timers\u2019 Day game since 2019 on Aug. 9, and the New York Mets are having an alumni game Sept. 13.",

      "The trick in putting together an alumni home-run derby is finding the right participants. They must be old enough to have finished playing but remain young enough to still manage to hit batting-practice pitches out of a major league stadium.",

      "Minnesota remained the No. 1 team in the poll with Atlanta and New York behind the Lynx. Riding a five-game winning streak, Indiana moved up to fourth. Phoenix and Seattle followed the Fever.

      "NFL careers are notoriously short",
      "EAGAN, Minn. -- Harrison Smith, just like anyone approaching middle age, has learned to accept the realities of getting older. The joints, for one, don't quite move as effortlessly as they once did.",
      "So that's where the 14th-year free safety for the Minnesota Vikings has aimed his recent training regimens, customizing resistance exercises to simulate the stress that NFL games can place on critical areas of the body.",
      "Reaching at full extension to make a tackle at full speed puts the arm muscles and tendons in a vulnerable position. The more fluidly the elbow can bend, the better.",
      "\u201cAll the strength work in the world isn\u2019t really going to translate to real strength on the field if your joints don\u2019t have the range they once did, especially range under load,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019ve come up with different ways to work out that aren\u2019t necessarily just the traditional banging weights around. I'm not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with that, but if you don\u2019t have your range ready, it\u2019s kind of almost counterproductive.\u201d",
      "In a sport where less than half the players in the league last season had at least five years of experience, as salary cap constraints perpetually conspire with constant injury risk and overall physical decline, the fountain of youth can seem like a unicorn. Smith\u2019s approach provides some valuable clues for finding the most vital source: wisdom.",
      "\u201cWhen you meet Harrison Smith, right away you understand why he might be the type of person to defy odds, and he\u2019s done nothing short of convincing us that over these few years,\u201d Vikings general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah said.",
      "From a famous quarterback like Aaron Rodgers dropping back in the pocket to a steady six-time Pro Bowl pick like Smith patrolling the secondary, the young man's league still has some space for gray hair. But sticking around takes more than just determination and talent.",
      "\u201cI feel great, actually. I don\u2019t feel like a 37-year-old. Not sure what they're supposed to feel like, but I feel a little younger,\u201d San Francisco 49ers left tackle Trent Williams said at the beginning of training camp. \u201cAs we get older, things start to change. I think you've got to pay a little bit more attention to what you put in your body, how you treat your body. Moreso than just being a football player, it\u2019s just a natural maturation of a human being. When you get older you can\u2019t do the same things you did when you were 22.\u201d",
      "According to an Associated Press review of the 90-man rosters across the league last week, there are 30 players currently with an NFL club who were born in the 1980s. That\u2019s barely 1%. Not only has Generation X been long gone from the game, once Tom Brady retired in 2023, but Millennials are already in the minority.",
      "Rodgers, of course, is the oldest active player at 41, followed by New York Jets kicker Nick Folk (40) and Cleveland Browns quarterback Joe Flacco (40). The sturdy 30 includes six long snappers, two punters and two kickers, plus nine quarterbacks \u2014 the positions that usually produce the longest-lasting players.",
      "\u201cYou have to evolve every single year,\" Kansas City Chiefs tight Travis Kelce said.",
      "The 36-year-old Smith is the lone defensive back. Kelce is the only offensive skill-position player who's not a quarterback. Williams and Arizona Cardinals left tackle Kelvin Beachum, now a backup, are the offensive linemen. Demario Davis of the New Orleans Saints and Nick Bellore of the Washington Commanders, who plays almost exclusively on special teams, are the linebackers. Then there\u2019s a well-decorated group of five defensive linemen: Calais Campbell (Arizona Cardinals), Cameron Heyward (Pittsburgh Steelers), John Jenkins (Baltimore Ravens), Cameron Jordan (New Orleans Saints) and Von Miller (Washington Commanders).",
      "\u201cI still feel great. I feel like I can go out there and dominate,\u201d said Campbell, who returned this year to his original team, the Cardinals. \u201cI wish I had a magic formula. I think I\u2019ve just been blessed. God\u2019s given me a lot of blessings to play this game I love.\u201d",

      "Maybe the two-time AL MVP slugger can help get them back on track.",

      "\u201cJudge tomorrow,\u201d Boone said, without elaborating when asked about his return.",
      "While Boone didn't reveal then what the specific plans were, he had said before the game that Judge would be the designated hitter when he first returned to the lineup.

      "Judge hasn\u2019t played since July 25 because of the elbow strain. An MRI showed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament and he had a platelet-rich injection July 27, when he was placed on the IL in a move retroactive to the previous day.",
      "His .342 batting average was still the best in the majors after Monday\u2019s games. He was fourth with 37 homers and fifth with 85 RBIs.",

Slater, acquired last Wednesday from the Chicago White Sox, exited in the second inning Monday night because of left hamstring tightness after running out a fielder's choice grounder.",

      "Sea stars \u2013 often known as starfish \u2013 typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak\u2019s first five years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite gruesome,\u201d said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \u201cpuffy arms sticking straight out,\u201d she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \u201cthen their arms actually fall off.\u201d",

      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",

He said the detective work by this team was \u201creally smart and significant.\u201d",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \u201clook sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\u201d said Gehman. \u201cThey\u2019re voracious eaters.\u201d",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2013 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",

      "China has been public about its ambition to build its own version of Starlink to meet both domestic national security needs and compete with Starlink in foreign markets. In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X\u2019s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",
      "U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cUkraine was a warning shot for the rest of us,\u201d said Nitin Pai, co-founder and director of the Takshashila Institution, a public policy research center based in Bangalore, India. \u201cFor the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

Meteorologists and scientists had warned of risks to accurate and timely storm tracking without the information when officials made plans to stop providing it beyond the end of this month.",

      "In a notice on Wednesday, officials said there would be no interruption at all.",
      "The Navy said in a statement that its Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center \u201chad planned to phase out the data\u201d as part of modernization efforts. \"But after feedback from government partners, officials found a way to meet modernization goals while keeping the data flowing until the sensor fails or the program formally ends in September 2026.\u201d",

      "The news had initially raised scientific eyebrows amid hurricane season, which usually peaks from mid-August to mid-October. Climate change, worsened by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal, have driven storms to become more frequent, severe and deadly.",
      "\u201cThe last-minute reprieve has hurricane forecasters breathing a sigh of relief,\u201d said Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections. \u201cLoss of the microwave satellite data would have made it far more likely that timely warnings of dangerous and potentially deadly episodes of hurricane rapid intensification events being delayed by up to 12 hours.\u201d",

      "Roscosmos said Bakanov and Duffy discussed \"further work on the International Space Station, cooperation on lunar programs, joint exploration of deep space and continued cooperation on other space projects.\u201d",
      "Once bitter rivals in the space race during the Cold War, Roscosmos and NASA cooperated on the space station and other projects. That relationship was beset with tensions after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in 2022, but Washington and Moscow have continued to work together, with U.S. and Russian crews continuing to fly to the orbiting outpost on each country's spacecraft.",
      "Plans for broader cooperation, including possible Russian involvement in NASA's Artemis program of lunar research, have fallen apart.",
      "As Russia has become increasingly reliant on China for its energy exports and imports of key technology amid Western sanctions, Roscosmos has started cooperation with China on its prospective lunar mission.",
      "Speaking to Russian reporters after the talks with Duffy, Bakanov said that they agreed to keep working on keeping the space station in operation to the end of the decade.",

      "After recording more than 600 audiobooks, Julia Whelan has become a go-to narrator for books by popular authors including Emily Henry and Taylor Jenkins Reid",
      "Chances are, you've heard Julia Whelan's voice. She's the award-winning narrator behind more than 600 audiobooks by a long list of bestselling authors including Taylor Jenkins Reid,Emily Henry, Michael Crichton, V.E. Schwab and Kristin Hannah. She's also narrated long-form articles for The New Yorker, The Atlantic and Vanity Fair.",
      "You may have read her own writing, too. Whelan's first novel, 2018's \u201cMy Oxford Year,\u201d has been adapted to a Netflix film, out Friday, starring Sofia Carson. The story actually began as a screenplay by Allison Burnett and had been gestating in development for years. Whelan was brought in to help with the script because she had studied abroad at Oxford her junior year of college. Producers then asked if she thought it would make a good book.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Nothing has ever wanted to be a book more. Please let me do this,'\u201d she recalls. It ended up an international bestseller. Her second novel, 2022's \u201cThank You For Listening,\u201d was critically praised. (\u201cThank You For Listening\u201d is about a former actor-turned-audiobook narrator who falls in love with another audiobook narrator.)",
      "You may have even seen Whelan on TV \u2014 she began her career as a child actor, with roles in \u201cFifteen and Pregnant\u201d and on the series \u201cOnce and Again.\u201d Despite her various pursuits, though, she has no plans to leave narration behind. \u201cI feel like I was born to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s everything that I love and that I\u2019m good at and everything I want to be doing.\u201d",
      "That's a good thing, because the audiobook industry is growing. Statista projects this year it will reach $9.84 billion because of smartphones, the increased popularity of audio content and people's desire to multitask. Despite the appetite for audiobooks, for narrators, \u201cthe financial aspect makes zero sense,\u201d says Whelan. She's founded her own publishing company, Audiobrary, to help narrators get paid more fairly.",
      "Whelan, who has narrated as many as 70 books in one year, spoke to The Associated Press about the audiobook industry, Audiobrary and her own writing. Answers are edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "WHELAN: The only reason I was doing 70 books a year was because that\u2019s how many books you have to do when you\u2019re first starting out to keep your head above water because the rates are low. It would be OK if there were a kickback for success, but narrators don\u2019t get royalties. As we\u2019ve seen the industry grow and as we\u2019ve seen the cache of certain narrators expand, and we know listeners will seek out audiobooks that their favorite narrators record. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me that we should be cut out of the long-term financial benefit of success. Audiobrary does a profit-share model with writers, who I also feel don\u2019t get enough percentage of the pie, and a royalty share for narrators. We are also a direct-to-consumer retail channel, so when you buy directly from us, you\u2019re not giving 50-75% of that sale to a retailer. You\u2019re giving it directly to the people who made the product.",

You\u2019re messed up for three or four months. Everything just gets delayed, especially when I was doing 70 books a year, there\u2019s no room for error there.",

But I think that audiobook fans \u2014 not your casual audiobook user, but fans \u2014 have favorite narrators and they\u2019re going to look for books by those narrators. So, in stunt-casting situations, sometimes someone is incredible at it, and they are perfect for the book. But sometimes it feels like a very craven, just marketing ploy. I don\u2019t feel infringed upon by them, but I do worry about a future situation where most of the work is going to AI. I don\u2019t lie awake at night worried, but everyone\u2019s threatened right now. It\u2019s very, very hard to even begin to predict what the future could look like.",
      "WHELAN: I think the kids would say that it\u2019s ableist to say that if you didn\u2019t read a book with your eyeballs, then you didn't read it, considering many people have many limitations that would prevent them from physically reading a book. So then are you telling them they\u2019ve never read a book before? Actual data and studies show that listening to a book actually triggers the same response in the brain as reading it, and that the interpretation and understanding of that book is on par with having read it.",
      "WHELAN: There\u2019s been about four ideas that are constantly in rotation, but I think I\u2019ve narrowed it down. I think I\u2019m ready to at least start exploring one of them at the beginning of next year.",
      "WHELAN: I very much think we could. I have said no up to this point because, this time around, I want to be very creatively involved. There\u2019s just too many things about audiobooks that someone could get wrong not knowing anything about the industry. I want be involved so I\u2019m willing to hold onto it until the right situation comes along.",

      "Linda and Tim Pierce have welcomed a baby boy using a 30-year-old embryo",
      "A baby boy born last week to an Ohio couple developed from an embryo that had been frozen for more than 30 years in what is believed to be the longest storage time before a birth.",
      "In what's known as embryo adoption, Linda and Tim Pierce used a handful of embryos donated in 1994 in pursuit of having a child after fighting infertility for years. Their son was born Saturday from an embryo that had been in storage for 11,148 days, which the Pierces\u2019 doctor says sets a record.",
      "It\u2019s a concept that has been around since the 1990s but is gaining attraction as some fertility clinics and advocates, often Christian-centered, oppose discarding leftover embryos because of their belief that life begins at or around conception and that all embryos deserve to be treated like children who need a home.",
      "\u201cI felt all along that these three little hopes, these little embryos, deserved to live just like my daughter did,\u201d said Linda Archerd, 62, who donated her embryos to the Pierces.",
      "Just about 2% of births in the U.S. are the result of in vitro fertilization, and an even smaller fraction involve donated embryos.",
      "However, medical experts estimate about 1.5 million frozen embryos are currently being stored throughout the country, with many of those in limbo as parents wrestle with what to do with their leftover embryos created in IVF labs.",
      "Further complicating the topic is a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that said that frozen embryos have the legal status of children. State leaders have since devised a temporary solution shielding clinics from liability stemming from that ruling, though questions linger about remaining embryos.",
      "Archerd says she turned to IVF in 1994. Back then, the ability to freeze, thaw and transfer embryos was making key progress and opening the door for hopeful parents to create more embryos and increase their chances of a successful transfer.",
      "She wound up with four embryos and initially hoped to use them all. But after the birth of her daughter, Archerd and her husband divorced, disrupting her timeline for having more children.",
      "As the years turned into decades, Archerd said she was wracked with guilt about what to do with the embryos as storage fees continued to rise.",
      "Eventually, she found Snowflakes, a division of Nightlight Christian Adoptions, which offers open adoptions to donors that allows people like Archerd. She was also able to set preferences for what families would adopt her embryos.",

      "The process was tricky, requiring Archerd to contact her initial fertility doctor in Oregon and dig through paper records to get the proper documentation for the donation. The embryos then had to be shipped from Oregon to the Pierces\u2019 doctor in Tennessee. The clinic, Rejoice Fertility in Knoxville, refuses to discard frozen embryos and has become known for handling embryos stored in outdated and older containers.",
      "Of the three donated embryos the Pierces received from Archerd, one didn\u2019t make the thaw. Two were transferred to Lindsey Pierce\u2019s womb, but just one successfully implanted.",
      "According to Dr. John David Gordon, the transfer of the nearly 31-year-old embryo marks the longest-frozen embryo to result in a live birth. He would know, Gordon says his clinic assisted in the previous record, when Lydia and Timothy Ridgeway were born from embryos frozen for 30 years, or 10,905 days.",
      "\u201cI think that these stories catch the imagination,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cBut I think they also provide a little bit of a cautionary tale to say: Why are these embryos sitting in storage? You know, why do we have this problem?\u201d",
      "In a statement, Lindsey and Tim Pierce said the clinic\u2019s support was just what they needed.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t go into this thinking about records \u2014 we just wanted to have a baby,\u201d Lindsey Pierce said.",
      "For Archerd, the donation process has been an emotional roller coaster. Relief that her embryos finally found a home, sadness it couldn\u2019t be with her and a little anxiety about what the future holds next, with possibly meeting the Pierces and the baby in person.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping that they\u2019re going to send pictures,\u201d she said, noting that the parents have already sent several after the birth. \u201cI\u2019d love to meet them some day. That would be a dream come true to meet \u2014 meet them and the baby.\u201d",

      "If you're wondering who's behind a song, try some old-fashioned detective work.",
      "The \u201cmost obvious cues\u201d come from \u201cexternal factors,\u201d said Manuel Mousallam, head of research and development at streaming service Deezer.",
      "Does the band or artist have social media accounts? Lack of a social presence might indicate there's no one there. If they do exist online, examine the kind of content they post, and how long it goes back.",
      "Is there any sign that the artist or band exists in real life? Are there any upcoming concerts and can you buy a ticket for a gig? Is there footage of past concerts on YouTube? Has an established record label released their singles or albums?",
      "Try going to the source. Song creators often \u2014 but not always \u2014 publish their generated tunes on the Suno or Udio platforms, where they can be found by other users.",
      "The catch is that you'll have to sign up for an account to get access. Users can look up songs by track name or the creator's handle, and browse genres and playlists. But it can still be difficult to spot a song, especially if you don't know the name of the song or creator.",

      "I uploaded a few songs I generated to the online detector from IRCAM Amplify, a subsidiary of French music and sound research institute IRCAM. It said the probability that they were AI-generated ranged from 81.8% to 98% and accurately deduced that they were made with Suno.",
      "As a cross-check, I also uploaded some old MP3s from my song library, which got a very low AI probability score.",

      "Casual users, though, might prefer to just let the machine write them. So bad rhyming schemes or repetitive lyrical structures might be a clue that a song is not man-made. But it's subjective.",

    "story": [
      "Texas Democrats prevented their state\u2019s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by President Donald Trump",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The nation's two most populous states \u2014 California and Texas \u2014 grappled for political advantage in advance of 2026 elections that could reorder the balance of power in Washington and threaten President Donald Trump's agenda at the midpoint of his second term.",
      "In Texas, Democrats on Monday prevented their state\u2019s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by Trump to shore up Republicans\u2019 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters.",
      "In California, Democrats encouraged by Gov. Gavin Newsom are considering new political maps that could slash five Republican-held House seats in the liberal-leaning state while bolstering Democratic incumbents in other battleground districts. The move is intended to undercut any GOP gains in Texas, potentially swinging House control and giving Democrats a counterweight to Trump on Capitol Hill.",
      "A draft plan aims to boost the Democratic margin in California to 48 of 52 congressional seats, according to a source familiar with the plan who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. That\u2019s up from the 43 seats the party now holds. It would need approval from lawmakers and voters, who may be skeptical to give it after handing redistricting power to an independent commission years ago.",
      "The rivalry puts a spotlight on two states that for years have dueled over jobs, innovation, prestige \u2014 even sports \u2014 with the backdrop of clashing political visions \u2014 one progressive, one conservative.",
      "After dozens of Democrats left Texas, the Republican-dominated House was unable to establish the quorum of lawmakers required to do business. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has made threats about removing members who are absent from their seats. Democrats counter that Abbott is using \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d to assert legal authority he does not have.",
      "The House quickly issued civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats and Abbott ordered state troopers to help find and arrest them, but lawmakers physically outside Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities.",
      "\u201cIf you continue to go down this road, there will be consequences,\" House Speaker Rep. Dustin Burrows said from the chamber floor, later telling reporters that includes fines.",
      "Democrats' revolt and Abbott's threats intensified a fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but now includes Democratic governors who have pitched redrawing their district maps in retaliation \u2014 even if their options are limited. The dispute also reflects Trump\u2019s aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the longstanding balance of powers between the federal government and individual states.",
      "The impasse centers on Trump\u2019s effort to get five more GOP-leaning congressional seats in Texas, at Democrats' expense, before the midterms. That would bolster his party's chances of preserving its fragile U.S. House majority, something Republicans were unable to do in the 2018 midterms during Trump's first presidency. Republicans currently hold 25 of Texas' 38 seats. That's nearly a 2-to-1 advantage and already a wider partisan gap than the 2024 presidential results: Trump won 56.1% of Texas ballots, while Democrat Kamala Harris received 42.5%.",
      "According to the tentative California proposal, districts now held by Republican Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa would see right-leaning voters shaved and Democratic voters boosted in a shift that would make it likely a left-leaning candidate would prevail in each race.",
      "In battleground districts held by Democratic Reps. Dave Min, Mike Levin and Derek Tran, the party\u2019s edge would be boosted to strengthen their hold on the seats, the source said.",
      "Democratic members of California\u2019s congressional delegation were briefed on the new map on Monday, according to a person familiar with the meeting who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.",
      "The proposal is being circulated at the same time that Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has said he wants to advance partisan redistricting. He says he won\u2019t move ahead if Texas pauses its efforts.",

      "Kennedy's decision to terminate the projects is the latest in a string of decisions that have put the longtime vaccine critic's doubts about shots into full effect at the nation's health department. Kennedy has pulled back recommendations around the COVID-19 shots, fired the panel that makes vaccine recommendations, and refused to offer a vigorous endorsement of vaccinations as a measles outbreak worsened.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A man convicted of killing his girlfriend and her two young daughters in the 1980s said he was \u201churting so bad\u201d while he was given a lethal injection Tuesday in Tennessee, where authorities had refused to deactivate his implanted defibrillator despite claims it might cause unnecessary, painful shocks as the drugs were administered.",
      "Black's attorney said they will review data kept by the device as part of an autopsy.",

      "Asked for any last words, he replied, \u201cNo sir.\u201d",
      "Black looked around the room as the execution started, lifting his head off the gurney multiple times, and could be heard sighing and breathing heavily. All seven media witnesses to the execution agreed he appeared to be in discomfort. Throughout the execution, a spiritual adviser prayed and sang over Black, at one point touching his face.",
      "\u201cOh, it's hurting so bad,\" Black said, as he lay with his hands and chest restrained to the gurney, a sheet covering up past his lower half, and an IV line in his arm.",
      "\u201cI'm so sorry. Just listen to my voice,\u201d the adviser responded.",
      "Black was executed after a back-and-forth in court over whether officials would need to turn off his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or ICD. Black, 69, was in a wheelchair, suffering from dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, congestive heart failure and other conditions, his attorneys have said.",
      "The nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center said it\u2019s unaware of any other cases with similar claims to Black\u2019s about ICDs or pacemakers. Black\u2019s attorneys said they haven\u2019t found a comparable case, either.",
      "Black was convicted in the 1988 shooting deaths of his girlfriend Angela Clay, 29, and her two daughters, Latoya Clay, 9, and Lakeisha Clay, 6. Prosecutors said he was in a jealous rage when he shot the three at their home. At the time, Black was on work-release while serving time for shooting Clay\u2019s estranged husband.",

      "\u201cHis family is now going through the same thing we went through 37 years ago. I can't say I\u2019m sorry because we never got an apology,\" Linette Bell, Angela Clay's sister, said in a statement read by a victim's advocate after the execution.",

      "In mid-July, a trial court judge agreed with Black\u2019s attorneys that officials must have the defibrillator deactivated to avert the risk that it could cause unnecessary pain and prolong the execution. But Tennessee's Supreme Court overturned that decision Thursday, saying the other judge lacked authority to order the change.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The State Department is proposing requiring applicants for business and tourist visas to post a bond of up to $15,000 to enter the United States, a move that may make the process unaffordable for many.",
      "In a notice to be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday, the department said it would start a 12-month pilot program under which people from countries deemed to have high overstay rates and deficient internal document security controls could be required to post bonds of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 when they apply for a visa.",
      "The proposal comes as the Trump administration is tightening requirements for visa applicants. Last week, the State Department announced that many visa renewal applicants would have to submit to an additional in-person interview, something that was not required in the past. In addition, the department is proposing that applicants for the Visa Diversity Lottery program have valid passports from their country of citizenship.",
      "A preview of the bond notice, which was posted on the Federal Register website on Monday, said the pilot program would take effect within 15 days of its formal publication and is necessary to ensure that the U.S. government is not financially liable if a visitor does not comply with the terms of his or her visa.",
      "\u201cAliens applying for visas as temporary visitors for business or pleasure and who are nationals of countries identified by the department as having high visa overstay rates, where screening and vetting information is deemed deficient, or offering citizenship by investment, if the alien obtained citizenship with no residency requirement, may be subject to the pilot program,\u201d the notice said.",
      "The countries affected will be listed once the program takes effect, it said. The bond could be waived depending on an applicant's individual circumstances.",

      "Visa bonds have been proposed in the past but have not been implemented. The State Department has traditionally discouraged the requirement because of the cumbersome process of posting and discharging a bond and because of a possible misperceptions by the public.",
      "However, the department said that previous view \u201cis not supported by any recent examples or evidence, as visa bonds have not generally been required in any recent period.\u201d",

      "Without a deal in hand, Republicans say they may try to change Senate rules when they return in September to speed up the pace of confirmations.

      "\u201cDonald Trump tried to bully us, go around us, threaten us, call us names, but he got nothing,\" Schumer said.",
      "The latest standoff comes as Democrats and Republicans have gradually escalated their obstruction of the other party's executive branch and judicial nominees over the last two decades, and as Senate leaders have incrementally changed Senate rules to speed up confirmations \u2014 and make them less bipartisan.",
      "In 2013, Democrats changed Senate rules for lower court judicial nominees to remove the 60-vote threshold for confirmations as Republicans blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial picks. In 2017, Republicans did the same for Supreme Court nominees as Democrats tried to block Trump\u2019s nomination of Justice Neil Gorsuch.",
      "Trump has been pressuring Senate Republicans for weeks to cancel the August recess and grind through dozens of his nominations as Democrats have slowed the process. But Republicans hoped to make a deal with Democrats instead, and came close several times over the last few days as the two parties and the White House negotiated over moving a large tranche of nominees in exchange for reversing some of the Trump administration's spending cuts on foreign aid, among other issues.",

      "Texas Democrats have left the state in an attempt to prevent the state House from holding a vote Monday on new congressional maps that Republicans hope will net them several additional U.S. House seats in the 2026 midterm elections",
      "A standoff in Texas over redrawn U.S. House maps sought by President Donald Trump sharply escalated Sunday when dozens of Democratic legislators left the state to block a vote, followed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott warning them that he will seek their removal from office if they don\u2019t return.",
      "The revolt by Democrats, and Abbott giving them until Monday to come home or face efforts to strip them of their elected positions, pushed a widening fight over congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections into new territory. At the center of the deepening impasse is Trump\u2019s pursuit of five more winnable congressional seats that will help bolster the GOP\u2019s chances of preserving their slim U.S. House majority.",
      "In response to Texas' rare mid-decade political gerrymander, Democratic governors have floated the possibility of redrawing their own state's maps in retaliation, but their options are limited.",
      "Many of the Texas Democrats were bound for Illinois and a welcoming from Gov. JB Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential contender, who in recent weeks has offered them support.",
      "House Democratic Caucus Chair Rep. Gene Wu declined to say how long lawmakers were prepared to stay out of Texas, and it was unclear whether the gambit would succeed. Four years ago, House Democrats left Texas for 38 days in protest of new voting restrictions that still wound up passing once the holdout ended.",
      "\u201cWe will do whatever it takes. What that looks like, we don\u2019t know,\u201d Wu said at a Sunday night news conference.",
      "Lawmakers can't pass bills in the 150-member Texas House without at least two-thirds of them present. Democrats hold 62 of the seats in the majority-Republican chamber and at least 51 left the state, said Josh Rush Nisenson, spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus. In addition to those in Illinois, delegations of Democratic lawmakers left Texas for Boston and Albany, New York, among other places, Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer said.",
      "Abbott threatened to seek the lawmakers' removal, saying they were not meeting under the state's constitution.",
      "\u201cThis truancy ends now,\u201d Abbott said in a statement released by his office Sunday night. Abbott also suggested the lawmakers may have committed felonies by raising money to help pay for fines they'd face.",
      "Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows said the chamber would still meet as planned on Monday afternoon.",
      "\u201cIf a quorum is not present then, to borrow the recent talking points from some of my Democrat colleagues, all options will be on the table. . .,\u201d he posted on X.",
      "Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, said on X that Democrats who \u201ctry and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately.\u201d",
      "A refusal by Texas lawmakers to show up is a civil violation of legislative rules. The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders had the authority to \u201cphysically compel the attendance\u201d of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served that year. Two years later, Republicans pushed through new rules that allow daily fines of $500 for lawmakers who don't show up for work as punishment.",

      "Pritzker also met privately with Texas Democratic Chair Kendall Scudder in June to begin planning for the possibility that lawmakers would depart for Illinois if they did decide to break quorum to block the map, according to a source with direct knowledge who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.",

      "In a ruling handed down Friday, U.S. District Judge William Smith granted Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha\u2019s motion for summary judgment that dismisses a lawsuit filed by a coalition of gun owners in 2023.",
      "The lawsuit stems from a Rhode Island law dictating how the state issues firearms permits.",
      "According to the statute, local officials are required to issue concealed-carry permits to anyone who meets the specific criteria outlined in the statute. However, it also allows the attorney general\u2019s office to issue open-carry permits \u201cupon a proper showing of need.\u201d Unlike municipalities, the attorney general is not required to issue such permits.",
      "The plaintiffs, largely led by Michael O\u2019Neil, a lobbyist for the Rhode Island 2nd Amendment Coalition and a firearm instructor, said in their initial complaint that the attorney general's office denied all seven of their applications in 2021 for an \u201cunrestricted\u201d firearm permit, allowing both open and concealed carry. Court documents show that the attorney general's office denied their permits because all of them had been granted \u201crestricted\u201d permits, which only allowed concealed carry.",
      "Smith said in his ruling that unrestricted permits \u201care a privilege and there is no constitutionally protected liberty interest in obtaining one.\u201d",
      "The plaintiffs had hoped for a similar ruling handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022, where the justices struck down a New York state law that had restricted who could obtain a permit to carry a gun in public.",

      "Singer Charlie Daniels said on X that Seely was \"a national treasure, and one fine lady.\"",
      "Seely was born in July 1940, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, about two hours north of Pittsburgh and was raised in nearby Townville. Her love of country music was instant; her mother sang, and her father played the banjo. When she was a child, she sang on local radio programs and performed on local television. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job with Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \"Don't Touch Me,\" the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",
      "Cochran and Seely were married in 1969 and divorced in 1979.",
      "Seely broke boundaries in her career \u2014 at a time when country music expected a kind of subservience from its women performers, Seely was a bit of a rebel, known for wearing a miniskirt on the Grand Ole Opry stage when it was still taboo.",
      "And she had a number of country hits in the '60s and '70s, including three Top 10 hits on what is now known as Billboard's hot country songs chart: \"Don't Touch Me,\" 1967's \"I'll Love You More (Than You Need)\" and 1973's \"Can I Sleep In Your Arms?\", adapted from the folk song \"Can I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight Mister?\"",
      "In the years since, Seely continued to release albums, perform and host, regularly appearing on country music programming. Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones and Little Jimmy Dickens.",
      "And Seely never stopped working in country music. Since 2018, she's hosted the weekly \"Sunday's with Seely\" on Willie Nelson's Willie's Roadhouse SiriusXM channel. That same year, she was inducted into the Music City Walk of Fame.",
      "She appeared nearly 5,400 times at the Grand Ole Opry, which she has been a member of since 1967. Grubbs said Saturday's Grand Ole Opry show would be dedicated to Seely.",
      "She released her last song in July 2024, a cover of Dottie West's \"Suffertime,\" recorded at the world-renowned RCA Studio B. She performed it at the Opry the year before.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 15:38:49 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer's love for the Great American Songbook goes far beyond standards written by Gershwin or Porter.",
    "story": [
      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

      "Former Food Network star Paula Deen announced Friday the abrupt closure of the Savannah restaurant that launched her to fame with its menu of fried chicken, banana pudding and other indulgent Southern dishes.",
      "Deen ran The Lady & Sons restaurant with her two sons, Jamie and Bobby Deen, for nearly three decades. Loyal fans visiting Savannah continued to line up for Deen's buffet long after the Food Network canceled her show, \"Paula's Home Cooking,\" in 2013.",
      "But 78-year-old Deen said Friday that The Lady & Sons closed for good along with her second Savannah eatery, The Chicken Box. A statement posted on Deen's website and social media accounts didn't say why the restaurants had shut down.",
      "\"Hey, y'all, my sons and I made the heartfelt decision that Thursday, July 31st, was the last day of service for The Lady & Sons and The Chicken Box,\" Deen's statement said.",
      "\"Thank you for all the great memories and for your loyalty over the past 36 years,\" she said. \"We have endless love and gratitude for every customer who has walked through our doors.\"",
      "Deen said her four restaurants outside Savannah will remain open. They're located in Nashville and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; and Branson, Missouri.",
      "Deen said Friday she and her sons will visit the Branson establishment on Aug. 8, and said the family is \"excited to continue visiting these restaurants regularly.\"",
      "\"Savannah will always be our home, and we'll always be here to support our wonderful community,\" she said in the statement.",
      "Hey, y\u2019all, my sons and I made the heartfelt decision that Thursday, July 31st, was the last day of service for The Lady...",
      "Windows at The Lady & Sons were covered with brown paper on Friday. Signs posted at the front entrance read: \"It is with heavy hearts and tremendous gratitude that we announce that we have retired and closed.\"",
      "Martin Rowe works in a downtown office across the street from Deen's restaurant. He said business seemed to be going strong up until it closed.",
      "\"Nobody knew anything was wrong,\" Rowe said. \"I walk by there two or three times a week at lunch, and it was always packed.\"",
      "Deen was divorced and nearly broke when she moved to Savannah with her boys in 1989 and started a catering business called The Bag Lady. She opened her first restaurant a few years later at a local Best Western hotel, then started The Lady & Sons in downtown Savannah in 1996.",
      "The restaurant soon had lines out the door and served roughly 1,100 diners per day at the height of Deen's popularity. A USA Today food critic awarded The Lady & Sons his \"meal of the year\" in 1999.",
      "Deen moved her Savannah restaurant to a larger building nearby the year after The Food Network debuted \"Paula's Home Cooking\" in 2002. Filmed mostly in her home kitchen, Deen taped more than 200 episodes over the next decade.",
      "The Food Network canceled Deen's show in 2013 amid fallout from a lawsuit by a former employee. A transcript of Deen answering questions under oath in a legal deposition became public, which included Deen's awkward responses to questions about race.",
      "Asked if she had ever used the N-word, Deen said, \"Yes, of course,\" though she added: \"It's been a very long time.\"",
      "Deen returned to television on ABC's \"Dancing With the Stars,\" on chef Gordon Ramsay's Fox show \"MasterChef: Legends,\" and on Fox Nation, which began streaming \"At Home With Paula Deen\" in 2020. She also posts cooking videos to a YouTube channel that has more than 520,000 subscribers.",

      "\"Amy Bradley is Missing,\" directed by Ari Mark and Phil Lott, explores the unsolved case that has puzzled investigators for nearly three decades. Bradley disappeared from her family's cruise, leaving behind numerous theories but few concrete answers.",
      "\"The Amy Bradley story is something if you've been around the genre, you know about it,\" Mark said. \"It's one of the most baffling mysteries of a disappearance case.\"",
      "The case presents multiple scenarios for what may have happened to Bradley.

Investigators have noted that the sliding door to her balcony was found ajar, raising questions about whether she left voluntarily or was taken against her will.",
      "Mark and Lott said they were drawn to the story after learning that existing coverage barely scratched the surface of the case. After meeting with Bradley's parents, Ron and Iva Bradley, in Virginia, the directors realized the family deserved justice.",

      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities\u00a0near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She's heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade on Friday.",
      "\"For so long, moms have been vilified and not supported,\" Hanna said.",
      "Friends told Angela Sintery, 44, about Rx Kids when she found out she was pregnant with her second child. She's a preschool teacher who spread the word to other parents.",
      "Sintery had her first daughter 19 years before her second and had to buy all new baby supplies.",
      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",
      "\"So this time around, I didn't have to stress about anything. I just had to worry about my baby,\" she said.",
      "Celeste Lord-Timlin, a Flint resident and program participant, attended the baby parade with her husband and 13-month-old daughter by her side. She said the deposits helped her pay for graduate school while she was pregnant.",
      "\"It allowed us to really enjoy being new parents,\" she said.",
      "The program relies heavily on philanthropic donations, but Hanna's long-term goal is for the government to be the main provider.",
      "\"I see philanthropy as the doula of this program; they are helping birth it,\" she said. \"They are helping us prove that this is possible.\"",
      "Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. But with a divided Legislature only able to pass six bills total this year, it's unlikely the program will yet expand statewide soon.",
      "Even Damoose, among the program's top backers, said he doesn't think Michigan can afford statewide expansion yet. But the lawmaker who represents parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan does want to keep growing it.",
      "For fellow Republicans who oppose abortion as he does, the approach is a \"no-brainer\" way to help pregnant women, Damoose said.",
      "\"We've been accused for years and years, and not without cause, of being pro-birth, but not pro-life,\" he said. \"And this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.\"",
      "A new movement of pro-natalist political figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and other members of Trump's periphery, have harped on the country's declining birth rate.",
      "But a recent Associated Press-NORC poll found that most Americans want the government to focus on the high costs of child care, not just the number of babies being born here.",
      "Under Trump's tax and spending bill that Congress passed in July, the child tax credit is boosted from $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. But millions of families at lower income levels will not get the full credit.",
      "The bill will also create a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "That's not available until children grow up and is more focused on building wealth rather than immediate relief, Hanna said.",
      "\"We don't have that social infrastructure to invest in our families,\" Hanna said. \"No wonder people aren't having children and our birth rates are going down.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also toyed with the idea of giving families one-time $5,000 \"baby bonuses,\" a policy similar to Rx Kids.",
      "Critics have rightly pointed out that it doesn't come close to covering the cost of child care or other expenses. Defenders of a cash-in-hand approach, though, say any amount can help in those critical early months.",
      "\"I think it's part of a new narrative or the rekindling of an old narrative where we start to celebrate children and families,\" said Damoose.",

    "summary": "U.S. home prices are dropping the most in the South and West, according to a new report from Realtor.com.",
    "story": [
      "The housing market has been in a serious crunch since the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited inventory, elevated home prices and mortgages in the 7% range, continuing to keep many would-be home buyers\u00a0locked out. But even amid such tight constraints, modest declines in home prices can still be found in some regions of the country.",
      "That's according to a new report from Realtor.com, which measures changes in median home prices across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas since 2022, when median home prices hit a\u00a0peak of $443,000 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.",
      "The extent to which home prices are declining varies from region to region according to the Realtor.com report, which is based on the brokerage platform's housing data.",
      "\"The housing market has cooled modestly in 2025,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a statement on the report. \"But the extent and persistence of rebalancing really varies across the country. And regionally, homebuyers and sellers are likely to experience a very different market.\"",
      "Behind those notable price differences is inventory. Right now, the housing market is essentially divided into two camps, with higher inventory in the South and West, where deeper price cuts can be found, and more limited inventory in the Midwest and Northeast, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"It's a supply and demand story,\" Krimmel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you have fewer homes for sale, and if there is still sufficient demand, that's going to maybe put upward pressure on prices or prevent them from falling.\"",
      "Cities where prices are falling",
      "The largest declines in median listing prices in 2025 tend to be concentrated in the South and West, where all 19 of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas with median housing prices below July 2022 levels are located.",
      "\"After years of intense competition, it's starting to feel more balanced \u2014 especially in the South and West,\" Gary Ashton, founder of The Ashton Real Estate Group of RE/MAX Advantage said in a statement on the Realtor.com report. \"It's not a buyer's market yet, but we're headed in that direction.\"",
      "The cities that saw the biggest declines in price were Austin, where median listing prices have fallen nearly 15% over the last three years; and Miami, where prices have dropped around 19%.",
      "According to Krimmel, inventory is rising in these markets due to the fact that homes are staying on the market longer, more home sellers are reducing prices and new listings are climbing.",
      "A boom in building also boosted housing supply in those regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for markets like Austin, Denver and Florida exploded, he added.",
      "Austin, Los Angeles and Miami saw the largest declines in median listing price over the past year, although prices in Los Angeles remain more than 18% above the median listing price in 2022.",
      "Cities where prices are rising",
      "Housing markets in cities in Northeast and Midwest remain squeezed due to \"sticky high\" prices and tight inventory, said Krimmel. Other contributing factors include stricter zoning and land use regulation laws that make building new houses more difficult, he said.",
      "In New York, for example, median listing prices have climbed roughly 16% since 2022, according to the report. Meanwhile, median listing prices in Milwaukee increased 26%.",
      "Furthermore, the number of active listings per month in the Northeast is still 50% below pre-pandemic levels, according to Krimmel. The number of active listings in the Midwest is down 40%, pointing to an inventory shortage in both regions, he said.",
      "While median listing prices have gone down over the last year in northeastern cities like Boston and Philadelphia, which saw 1.4% and 1.2% decreases, respectively, median prices remain at least 10% above those from 2022.",
      "\"To the extent that there are falling prices in the Northeast and the Midwest, for the most part it's pretty modest numbers,\" said Krimmel.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 17:18:28 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said two major banks turned down his business. Here's why conservatives are concerned with so-called debanking.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday claimed that major banks are discriminating against conservatives \u2014 including him \u2014 through the act of debanking, or when financial institutions refuse to work with some individuals or businesses or abruptly close clients' accounts.",
      "Mr. Trump made the comment in an\u00a0interview with CNBC on Tuesday, after he was asked about a report\u00a0by the Wall Street Journal that said he would soon sign an executive order aimed at stamping out debanking. Mr. Trump claimed that JPMorgan Chase gave him 20 days to close his account, although he didn't specify when this occurred or what reason he was given by the bank for doing so. He also claimed that Bank of America refused his business after he left JPMorgan.",
      "The issue of debanking has become a sticking point for some conservatives who claim that they've been unfairly targeted by financial institutions. Debanking can occur for a number of reasons, such as if a financial institution detects potentially fraudulent activity or the account owner is overdrawn, but some conservatives claim they have been rejected due to their political views.",
      "\"They discriminated against many conservatives,\" the president told CNBC.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan rejected such allegations of bias against conservatives, in a recent interview on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that took place ahead of Mr. Trump's comments on CNBC. Moynihan pointed to the nation's second-largest bank's massive customer base as evidence of its diverse clientele. He also emphasized the impact of federal regulations, in addition to concerns over legal and financial risk, on banking decisions.",
      "\"We have 70 million consumers, and we're the biggest small business lender. That's not \u2014 the issue they're focused on is the regulators impact on this industry. And you heard Senator Scott talk about this this week. This reputation, this after the fact, look, that you banked x, and now after the fact, you're gonna say x didn't turn out to be what you thought,\" the CEO told Margaret Brennan. \"So we look at it. We look at it based on risk. People may feel those decisions are made for some other reason, but we always make it on what's best for our company, what's best for our client.\"",
      "At a\u00a0Senate hearing\u00a0in February over the issue, Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, said debanking harms individuals as well as the economy, and violates the principles of fair market access. Debanking has also been highlighted by some crypto investors, such the CEO of crypto platform Anchorage Digital, who\u00a0testified\u00a0in the Senate hearing that his bank had closed his company's account on short notice because they weren't comfortable with crypto transactions.",
      "The White House declined to comment on the EO.",
      "JPMorgan Chase said in a statement that it doesn't close accounts for political reasons, adding that it agrees with Mr. Trump that \"regulatory change is desperately needed.\" It added, \"We're pleased to see the White House is addressing this issue, for which we've been advocating for many years, and look forward to working with them to get this right.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Bank of America said, \"Political beliefs are not a factor in account closure decisions.\" Referring to the reported EO, the bank said in a statement that it welcomes \"regulatory clarity\" from the Trump administration.",
      "Reached for comment on Mr. Trump's recent comments, Bank of America pointed to its earlier statement.",
      "What happens when someone is debanked?",
      "Debanking isn't just happening at banks, said Nicholas Anthony, a policy analyst at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute.",
      "\"This can be something that happens to you at a credit union, at a cryptocurrency exchange or anywhere else really,\" Anthony said. \"It's just having that sudden abrupt closure of your financial account where you've been, and essentially kicked out of the system or cut off from the system.\"",
      "Banks are not required by law to give account owners a reason for why their account is being closed. Under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks are obligated to track their customers' activity and file a so-called suspicious activity report (or SAR) if they notice anything unusual. Banks aren't allowed to disclose to customers if there's a SAR, which can leave some people in the dark if their account is shut for this reason.",
      "\"It's a terrible feeling to suddenly have this relationship cut off, and you really don't know why,\" Anthony said. \"In a lot of cases, it's by federal law that banks can't tell you what happened, and you're kind of left to just spiral there.\"",
      "How many people are impacted by debanking?",
      "More than 8,000 consumers filed complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the last three years related to their financial institutions' \"improperly closing checking, savings or other deposit accounts,\" according to a February analysis from the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.",
      "By comparison, consumers made about 1.3 million complaints about credit reporting in 2023 alone, according to CFPB data.",
      "Why do banks close accounts?",
      "Banks can close accounts if they suspect fraudulent or suspicious behavior, or if a customer violates their terms. In the complaints cited by the Senate banking committee analysis, some consumers said they had faced overdraft fees due to overdrawn funds before their banks shuttered their accounts, for example.",
      "But there's no data that tracks whether people or institutions are debanked due to their political views, although there are anecdotal accounts, experts said.",
      "\"There is no actual data or proof that conservatives are being debanked for their beliefs,\" Jeremy Siegel, senior associate at research firm Pleiades Strategy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In fact, Florida set up a hotline for this very reason, and got zero complaints. A Virginia Credit League Lobbyist said this in his testimony against a similar bill in Virginia.\"",
      "Banks set risk tolerances and conduct their business within those perimeters, added Shayna Olesiuk, director of banking policy at Better Markets, a financial advocacy group.",
      "\"They must always understand and manage any risk that they are accepting in their business activities and decisions; this could include things like financial risk or unlawful or discriminatory activity,\" she added.",
      "What about political views and debanking?",
      "There have been allegations from some conservatives that their political views led to account closures. The attorney general for Kansas, Kris W. Kobach, sent a\u00a0letter to Bank of America last year, alleging discrimination by the bank of religious groups he states had their accounts closed without explanation.",
      "Banking policies appear \"to be systematically punishing religious and political views with which it disagrees,\" the Kobach claimed in the letter.",
      "But some of these organizations had red flags that could have led to the debanking, such running a debt collection business outside of the U.S., Cato's Anthony added.",
      "\"There are anecdotal cases of conservative account holders that have had their accounts closed, but at the same time, we see that with others as well,\" he added. \"There's been a longstanding history of people who are Muslim having their accounts denied, people with Russian last names or Middle Eastern last names for that matter, having their accounts denied.\"",
      "\"It seems to be a widespread issue in the sense that it affects all different sorts of people,\" Anthony said.",

    "summary": "Revisions are a \"feature, not a bug\" of any jobs report, former BLS commissioner told CBS MoneyWatch.",
    "story": [
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics last week issued a\u00a0steep downward revision\u00a0to May and June's hiring numbers, prompting President Trump to call the edits \"miscalculations\" by the department's commissioner, whom he subsequently fired, in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Aug. 1.",
      "While the downward revision of May and June payroll growth by 258,000 marked the largest two-month downward revision to the jobs numbers since 1968, revisions themselves are not uncommon. Revisions are \"a feature, not a bug\" of the agency's reporting process, Erica Groshen, former BLS commissioner under the Obama administration told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Larger revisions have been recorded, but only when the economy has been in a recession, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis of BLS data.",
      "How the BLS processes its reports",
      "The BLS surveys both households and businesses for its monthly jobs report. After releasing an initial report, it's common for the agency to issue revisions to the prior monthly figures, as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "That's because while some survey recipients respond to the agency's surveys immediately, others report data late. In the interest of reporting employment information in a timely manner, though, the BLS initially issues its monthly jobs report based on an incomplete collection of responses.",
      "\"The BLS wants to get the information as accurate as possible, but it doesn't want to wait too long to put out information that's useful,\" Groshen said. \"So it puts out preliminary numbers, saying they are an estimate, then it gathers more information and improves that estimate.\"",
      "\"If you send out a survey to a bunch of people, some will turn it back in on time and some of them won't,\" Michele Evermore, a former Department of Labor employee and senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive, independent think tank told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The faster you make a determination, the more you're going to have to fill in the blanks,\" she said. In the interim, the BLS relies on scientific modeling to paint a more complete picture of the state of the job market. \"You have to fill in the gaps, and the more reports you get back, the more holes you can fill, and the more accurate a report you get.\"",
      "Eventually, the inclusion of late responses to surveys by both employers and workers enables the agency to provide a more accurate picture of the state of hiring and unemployment in the U.S., Evermore explained.",
      "The cuts to the number of jobs that were added in May and June were spread out across both public- and private-sector jobs. The downward revision to public-sector payroll growth \"mostly reflected lower state and local government job gains,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a research note. Private-sector job gains were previously overstated because of incomplete response data, according to the analysts.",
      "Groshen acknowledged that the revisions were \"definitely on the large side,\" but that \"they happen, and are the product of the same monthly process.\"",
      "Cuts pertaining to government jobs were driven primarily by reductions in hiring by state and local education establishments, according to the BLS. Groshen attributes the job cuts to the expiration of pandemic-era government subsidies that are leading to a pullback in hiring.",
      "\"These subsidies were cut, so they are not hiring as many people as they had been in the past, and state and local governments often report late, so that information came in late,\" she said.",
      "Evermore, of The Century Foundation, noted that the BLS revisions only apply to jobs that were added in both May and June, and not to \"the pool of all the jobs in the U.S.\"",
      "\"While it seems like a big revision, percentage-wise, it's floating on top of the entire labor market. So while it's big, it's not as dramatic as some people are acting like it is,\" she said.",
      "Dismissal of BLS commissioner",
      "In his Truth Social post on Friday, Mr. Trump accused BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer of political bias before announcing her dismissal in response to the downward revision of jobs numbers. \"I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes,\" the president\u00a0wrote.",
      "Despite being probed for answers,, the White House has not provided any evidence that the numbers were manipulated for political purposes.",
      "According to Groshen, the drastic revise of the job numbers don't reflect a \"failure\" of the BLS to do its job.",
      "\"It's not a failure and it's not bias. It's not like the commissioner said, 'Oh, I think I'm going to change that numbers.' The commissioner has no power, no ability to do that.\"",
      "Evermore concurred. \"Having worked with BLS for years, it's impossible to cook the books as things stand,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "On Tuesday, California congressman Rep. George Whitesides, a Democrat, introduced a bill that his office said would prevent the president from \"unjustly firing the head of a statistical agency for politically-motivated reasons.\"",
      "Called the Statistical Agency Integrity and Independence Act, it asserts that a President may only dismiss the head of a federal statistical agency for cause, including demonstrated inefficiency.",
      "\"Now more than ever, as our economy reels from the impacts of haphazard tariffs and instability, we need data we can trust,\" Whitesides said in a statement Tuesday. He added that Mr. Trump's decision to fire McEntarfer \"sets a dangerous precedent.\"",
      "Data collection",
      "For years, it's become increasingly difficult to collect complete data based on surveys fielded to hundreds of thousands of employers and individuals, according to Groshen.",
      "\"There is a very long-term term trend of a declining response rate, which is bedeviling the system,\" she said. That's in part because some surveys are fielded over the phone, and American households are increasingly ditching landlines.",
      "Jeff Strohl, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, a research policy institute, echoes others in noting that BLS releases monthly jobs numbers knowing that they'll be revised. But the agency prioritizes timeliness over 100% accuracy because \"the currency of the data is still important,\" he said.",
      "Low response rates \u2014 only about 70% of employers surveyed respond on time \u2014 make revisions inevitable. according to Strohl. \"A month later, the response rate goes up to 90%-95%, so you have 25%, or 150,000, more firms reporting their data,\" he said.",
      "Additionally, weekly shocks to the economy, such as created by tariffs, adds another layer to the challenge of releasing accurate jobs data each month.",
      "\"The U.S. economy is going through a huge number of shocks on a weekly basis,\" Strohl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Tariffs are being threatened and applied, and there is a level of economic uncertainty affecting the job market.\"",
      "For example, he said, some job seekers are having offers rescinded as major universities lose research grants. \"That's stopping hires from working on projects the money was going to feed,\" he said.",

      "\"Remote work has inherently baked in a lot more flexibility, so working mothers may be able to pop out to take their kids to doctors appointments, instead of taking time off,\" McSwigan said.",
      "White-collar firms have also improved benefits related to caregiving, with some even offering workers child care subsidies, allowing mothers to stay in the labor force, according to McSwigan. But women without a college degree are more likely to work in service-sector jobs that aren't as well paid and don't offer the same child care benefits.",
      "\"White collar workplaces are more likely to provide workers with access to paid leave policies, even child care subsidies, and those are not traditionally the same types of benefits you see in more service-sector work that noncollege women are in,\" McSwigan said.",
      "Women in the service-sector may also work variable shifts, and require child care at hours during which day care centers don't typically operate.",
      "\"A lot of day care centers are only open 9 to 5, so they are coming up to other barriers as well, that are inherent to the types of jobs they are working,\" McSwigan said.",
      "Mothers without college sidelined",
      "Working mothers with college degrees notched even greater gains in the work place over the past two decades, with their participation rising by 11 percentage points, from 57% to 68%, according to the report. By contrast, the percentage of noncollege-educated mothers working full-time increased just 0.1% in the last 20 years.",
      "\"We have heard from policymakers that there has been strong labor force bounce back for women and that we are overcoming the 'she-cession' and making progress when it comes to women in workplace,\" McSwigan said. \"But what the data and analysis is showing is these gains can be attributed to college women, and noncollege women are still on workforce sidelines, and it's hard to say we are making progress for working women if only those with college degrees are benefitting.\"",
      "For this reason, McSwigan emphasizes the need for broad-based policy efforts that support \"the different needs that families are facing\" to ensure that all working women receive the same benefits that college-degree holders have.",
      "\"It's not one-size-fits-all approach,\" McSwigan said.",

      "The U.S. job market, already showing the strain from global trade tensions, is showing early signs of another critical issue facing workers today: artificial intelligence.",
      "For the first seven months of 2025, rising adoption of generative AI technology by private employers accounted for more than 10,000 job cuts, according to a report released this week by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers. Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to recent college graduates have declined 15%\u00a0over the past year, according to Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z employees. Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",
      "While AI is already starting to reshape how Americans work, for now other factors are having a more immediate impact on the labor market. More than 292,000 positions have been eliminated this year due to cuts linked to the Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), an initiative to reduce federal spending spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found.",
      "\"We are seeing the federal budget cuts implemented by DOGE impact non-profits and health care in addition to the government,\" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "Layoffs are also accelerating in the vast retail sector as tariffs raise the cost of doing business, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Retailers have announced more than 80,000 cuts through July, up nearly 250% compared to the same period last year, the firm found.",
      "\"Retailers are being impacted by tariffs, inflation and ongoing economic uncertainty causing layoffs and store closures. Further declines in consumer spending could trigger additional losses,\" the group said.",

    "summary": "Friday's unexpectedly weak jobs report signals that some sectors are cutting back on hiring amid economic uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "Friday's disappointing July employment report\u00a0delivered a reality check on the U.S. economy, with the data suggesting the job market is wobbling from the uncertainty of on-again, off-again tariffs.",
      "What was surprising about the Friday report was that employers not only hired fewer people than expected last month, but the government revised its jobs data sharply downward for the prior two months. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June, reflecting \"paltry\" employment growth during those months, according to a research note from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco.",
      "The latest jobs data is shedding new light on the U.S. economy as businesses absorb a multitude of changes \u2014 from President Trump's trade deals and fresh tariffs to the new GOP tax law, which provides tax breaks\u00a0to many Americans but also cuts spending on health care and social programs like food stamps. The jobs data backs up anecdotal evidence from the Federal Reserve's most recent \"beige book\"\u00a0\u2014 a report that compiles comments from local businesses \u2014 that many companies are delaying hiring \"until uncertainty diminished.\"",
      "\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant jobs report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"We know the economy has ups and downs, and we're in a pretty stagnant place right now.\"",
      "In other words, while the labor market isn't seeing massive layoffs, companies also aren't expanding their hiring plans. That can make it difficult for unemployed workers to find new jobs, with the number of people searching for work for more than 27 weeks jumping 11% to 1.8 million last month compared with a year earlier, government data shows.",
      "Pockets of strength",
      "To be sure, there were pockets of strength in the jobs report, with health care and social assistance adding a combined 73,300 jobs last month, the BLS reported. But many major U.S. employment sectors saw little or no hiring, including leisure and hospitality, transportation and construction, while others \u2014 including manufacturing \u2014 saw job losses last month, the July data shows.",
      "President Trump on Friday claimed without evidence that the jobs report was manipulated for \"political purposes,\" and fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.",
      "He also asserted that the downward revisions were \"a major mistake,\" although the BLS revises its data each month to reflect new information, and the numbers frequently move both up and down.",
      "\"The president's belief that the BLS commissioner personally 'produced' the jobs numbers is preposterous and shows a complete misunderstanding of how government statistical agencies operate,\" noted Heidi Shierholz, the president of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute and a former chief economist at the Department of Labor, in a post about McEntarfer's firing.",
      "She added, \"These data are the product of careful work by hundreds of expert economists, statisticians and civil servants following transparent, well-established methodologies.\"",
      "Tariff uncertainty",
      "Businesses have been expressing hesitation given the uncertain impact\u00a0of the Trump's tariffs, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland president Beth Hammack told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "\"I'm hearing that uncertainty has really been weighing on businesses,\" Hammack said of her discussions with business owners in her district, which spans Eastern Kentucky, Ohio, Western Pennsylvania and part of West Virginia.\u00a0 \"They've been having a tough time to decide when to invest, how much to invest. Many of them have scaled back plans for investment.\"",
      "For instance, one franchise owner said that they planned to refurbish their existing locations, rather than open new locations, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs would revive U.S. manufacturing because companies will reshore or open new factories domestically, rather than pay the import duties.",
      "Some Trump officials portrayed the jobs report as a temporary setback as the administration seeks to revive American jobs through its trade policies.",
      "\"Obviously there were elements of [the jobs report] that we didn't love, but the trade deals are now in place that cover \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 almost 60% of the global economy,\" Stephen Miran, head of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, told reporters Friday.",
      "With the setting of new tariff rates on Thursday for dozens of nations, uncertainty has also been resolved, he added. \"There probably were a lot of firms that, you know, sort of sitting there in May and June saying, 'Hey, you know, this tariff stuff's about to be resolved, this bill you know hopefully becomes law within a month or two \u2014 maybe I'm just going to hold off on this investment program.'\"",
      "Also on Friday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt issued a statement describing a flourishing economy under President Trump. \"Inflation has cooled, wages have increased, unemployment is stable, and the private sector is growing. President Trump's America First agenda has ensured new jobs go to American citizens, instead of illegals or foreign-born workers. The tariffs are raking in billions of dollars to make our country wealthy again,\" the statement read in part.",
      "A decline in manufacturing jobs",
      "The U.S. lost 11,000 manufacturing jobs in July, and the revisions for May and June also show that the sector shed workers during those months. That's notable given Mr. Trump's promise to revive manufacturing jobs, which has led to new agreements from the likes of Johnson & Johnson and Apple to build new plants in the U.S.",
      "But the Trump administration's tariffs have added to the challenges facing the manufacturing sector, especially those producing durable goods such as appliances and automobiles, noted Indeed's Ullrich. For instance, tariffs on imported metals such as steel and aluminum are making it pricier for many manufacturers to create their products, putting pressure on their margins and profits.",
      "The downturn in manufacturing jobs \"is hardly surprising,\" said Scott Paul, president of the trade group the Alliance for American Manufacturing, in an email. \"It's another 'treading water' number, which has been the case more often than not for the past few years. But it is concerning that we're now 173,000 jobs below the most recent peak in February 2023,\" when total nonfarm payroll employment rose to 155.4 million.",
      "It's possible that manufacturing jobs could reverse the trend now that the Trump administration's tariffs and tax policies are settled, Paul added.",
      "Progress on the Trump administration's goal of reshoring American manufacturing jobs may take years, given the cost and time required to build new factories, Ullrich noted. \"There are certain products that, even with the tariffs, are still cheaper to make overseas,\" she added.",
      "\"This is not a healthy job market,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"The economy needs certainty soon on tariffs. The longer this tariff whiplash lasts, the more likely this weak hiring environment turns into layoffs.\"",

    "story": [
      "Americans could see inflation tick higher in 2025 as businesses start to pass on the cost of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers through price hikes, Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady in an interview.",
      "So far this year, inflation has remained relatively muted despite President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs, partially because many businesses stockpiled goods and manufacturing parts ahead of the import duties' implementation. Some business facing higher tariffs also chose to hold off on passing cost increases onto consumers as they awaited more clarity around where tariff rates would settle. Additionally, the Trump administration instituted numerous pauses on threatened levies, delaying cost increases for businesses and consumers.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pushing the Fed to cut interest rates, citing subdued inflation numbers and cuts from other major central banks, such as in the U.K. and the European Union. But the Federal Reserve last week maintained its benchmark rate at the same level where it's been parked since December 2024, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell citing the risks of higher inflation due to the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "That's a danger also highlighted by Hammack, who said she believes inflation could reach a 3% annual rate this year, representing a pace that would be 1 percentage point higher than the Fed's goal of a 2% annualized rate.",
      "\"Individual businesses have been trying to hold back on, passing on those [tariff] costs, because they're worried about what it might mean for demand,\" Hammack told O'Grady. \"They've been selling inventory that they'd accumulated early in the year, and so they didn't need to charge for the tariffs on that, but they're coming through those stockpiles.\"",
      "She added, \"They're coming to the point where their margins are getting squeezed and they need to start passing that onto consumers.\"",
      "Many households are still struggling with the cost of living, with half of Americans saying they view grocery prices as a major source of stress in their life right now, outpacing housing cost and health care, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\"Two-speed economy\"",
      "Hammack said the U.S. appears to be in a \"two-speed economy.\"",
      "\"The top part of the income spectrum is doing incredibly well,\" she noted. \"They're feeling a lot of excitement about the stock market, how their 401(k)s are doing, and they're feeling flush with cash.\"",
      "But, she added, low-income households are facing a lot of economic challenges.",
      "\"I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef,\" Hammack said. \"They're buying hot dogs, they're looking at their $400 emergency fund, and it's not able to pay for a new air conditioner or the car repairs that it used to be able to pay for.\"",
      "Price pressures from the Trump administration's tariffs could cause a one-time increase in costs as businesses adjust their prices to cover the import duties, she added. Fed officials are focused on making sure that the price hikes don't become what she calls a \"more persistent inflationary problem.\"",
      "\"What I'm focused on is making sure that we have an economy that's working for all Americans,\" Hammack said. \"Which is why I believe we need to stay really focused on the inflation side of our mandate.\"",
      "At the same time, Friday's disappointing jobs report shows that the labor market is also facing fresh challenges, with employers hiring fewer workers than expected in July. The Fed's mandate is to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with the central bank turning to interest rate hikes to cool inflation or rate cuts to help the job market.",
      "With both inflation on the rise and the job market experiencing some headwinds, the Fed has a delicate balancing act, she noted.",
      "\"This is a really challenging time for monetary policy makers, because both sides of our mandate are being challenged,\" Hammack said. \"And so the decision of which way to go and how quickly to move is a really difficult one right now.",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next decision on interest rates in September, and some analysts are already calling for a rate cut with the US economy seeing three straight months of weak jobs growth. Hammack admits waiting too long to cut rates because of potential inflation is a risk.",
      "\"If we wait too long to cut rates, that could mean that more people are losing their jobs than we'd like to see,\" Hammack said. \"We have to balance those two factors when we're trying to decide what's right to steer the economy forward.",

      "A CBS News investigation has revealed that\u00a0China is still secretly buying Iranian oil and evading U.S. sanctions by using what's known as a \"dark fleet\" to transfer oil from ship to ship in the middle of the sea.",
      "When Mr. Trump unveiled a sweeping plan for tariffs on dozens of countries in April, China was the only country that retaliated. It refused to give in to U.S. pressure.",
      "\"If the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China's consistent official stance,\" said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Mr. Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Mr. Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \"the one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Mr. Trump has made it clear he wants a \"headline-grabbing deal\" with Xi, \"so rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \"strategic solidarity\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\"Beijing simply can't afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \"It's too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\"",
      "A 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that roughly 80% to 90% of the oil exported by Iran went to China. The Chinese economy benefits from the more than 1 million barrels of Iranian oil it imports per day.",
      "After the Iranian parliament floated a plan to shut down the Strait of Hormuz in June following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, China spoke out against closing the critical oil transit route.",
      "China also is an important customer for Russia, but is second to India in buying Russian seaborne crude oil exports. In April, Chinese imports of Russian oil rose 20% over the previous month to more than 1.3 million barrels per day, according to the KSE Institute, an analytical center at the Kyiv School of Economics.",
      "This past week, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India's purchasing of Russian oil. India's Foreign Ministry said Friday its relationship with Russia was \"steady and time-tested.\"",
      "Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and a top policy adviser, said Mr. Trump has been clear that it is \"not acceptable\" for India to continue financing the Ukraine war by purchasing oil from Russia.",
      "\"People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil,\" Miller said on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" He said the U.S. needs \"to get real about dealing with the financing of this war.\"",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, is pushing for sanctions and tariffs on Russia and its financial backers. In April, he introduced a bill that would authorize the president to impose tariffs as high as 500% not only on Russia but on any country that \"knowingly\" buys oil, uranium, natural gas, petroleum products or petrochemical products from Russia.",
      "\"The purpose of this legislation is to break the cycle of China \u2014 a communist dictatorship \u2014 buying oil below market price from Putin's Russia, which empowers his war machine to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians,\" Graham said in a June statement.",
      "The bill has 84 co-sponsors in the 100-seat Senate. A corresponding House version has been introduced, also with bipartisan support.",
      "Republicans say they stand ready to move on the sanctions legislation if Mr. Trump asks them to do so, but the bill is on hold for now.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medicaid-federal-work-requirements-states/",
    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "More than a dozen states are seeking their own versions of Medicaid work requirements. But the incoming new federal standards pose new questions.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump signed a law adding work requirements for some Medicaid recipients, he may have undercut lawmakers in at least 14 states who were designing their own plans, according to health industry observers.",
      "Georgia is the only state with a work requirement in place for Medicaid, but several states have been pursuing such a policy for years, only to be blocked by courts or, most recently, the Biden administration. Some seek state-specific touches to the new rules. Others aim to implement work requirements before the federal law takes effect at the end of 2026.",
      "These states' moves and Mr. Trump's massive tax-and-spending law share one demand: To keep their Medicaid health coverage, adults who can work must prove they're logging a minimum number of hours at a job or school, or else qualify for one of the few exemptions.",
      "But now, states that jumped ahead need to ensure their proposals, which require federal approval, don't stray too far from Mr. Trump's law.",
      "\"The statute sets both the floor and ceiling\" for work requirements, said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor with George Washington University.",
      "South Dakota, for example, announced in July that it would not submit an application for work requirements as previously planned amid concerns that the state's laxer rules would not be allowed under the new federal law. The state's Department of Social Services secretary had warned that working on a state proposal while the federal rules are being hashed out could be \"an exercise in futility.\"",
      "Arkansas' plan, on the other hand, is more stringent than the federal law. There are no exemptions to its work requirements in the application, which is pending with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "Arizona's proposal also includes something that's not in the federal law: a ban on \"able-bodied adults\" receiving Medicaid benefits for longer than five years total in their lives.",
      "Arkansas and Arizona government officials said they were working with federal officials to square their plans with the new standards.",
      "Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the department is analyzing how the new federal standards interact with state waivers.",
      "The federal health department must release rules by next June that outline how states are to implement work requirements, according to Elizabeth Hinton, who has been tracking such waivers as part of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "\"We don't exactly know what that will cover,\" Hinton said.",
      "It's unclear how federal officials will respond to the states' requests, she added, but \"we are aware that some folks think there is no wiggle room here.\"",
      "States can tweak their Medicaid programs through what are known as demonstration waivers, which are subject to federal approval. The waivers are designed to test new ideas in policy gray areas.",
      "The states that have filed or plan to file such applications with work requirements include Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah.",
      "Congressional Republicans who passed the budget reconciliation bill left room for states to use waivers to fast-track the national standards. Tara Sklar, a professor leading the University of Arizona's Health Law & Policy Program, said she expects states seeking certain stricter requirements to have a chance of approval, while more lenient ones may face denials.",
      "Federal officials may look favorably on Arizona's plan, Sklar said, as a five-year lifetime Medicaid limit is different from work requirements. Even if the federal government greenlights stricter work requirements than the federal law calls for, those programs are likely to face legal challenges, she added.",
      "The federal law includes an 80-hour-per-month minimum for work or education, with exemptions for certain adults, including people who are medically frail and parents with young, dependent children.",
      "Montana is the first state to draft a waiver application since Congress finalized national work requirements. State lawmakers first approved work requirements \u2014 called \"community engagement\" standards under the state plan \u2014 in 2019, but the state's application stalled through the end of the first Trump term and the Biden administration.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected again, Montana lawmakers lifted the 2025 expiration date of its Medicaid expansion program, making permanent the program that covered more than 76,000 adults in April, with the expectation that the Trump administration would approve work requirements. In mid-July, state officials released their draft plan to make that a reality \"as soon as is practicable.\"",
      "The Montana plan largely aligns with the federal law, but it would create additional exemptions, including for people who are homeless or fleeing domestic violence.",
      "Republican state Sen. Gayle Lammers said work requirements that also protect such people who need Medicaid were a big part of persuading legislators to keep the expansion program. At the time, officials didn't know where the federal government would land on work requirements. And now, Lammers said, it makes sense for Montana to stick to its plan.",
      "\"The state should have a say,\" Lammers said. \"We're very independent, and everyone is different.\"",
      "In South Carolina, state officials are seeking to roll out work requirements for a limited number of newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. South Carolina is one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, and yet the state submitted a request with the federal government in June for a partial Medicaid expansion that includes a work requirement component that largely reflects the new federal standards.",
      "In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, called South Carolina's proposal \"a state-specific solution.\"",
      "The only state with an active work requirement program now wants to scale it back and awaits federal approval to do so. \"Georgia Pathways to Coverage\" expires at the end of September unless CMS greenlights an extension of the program with a key change: requiring enrollees to document once a year that they're working, not monthly. That's a pivot away from the program's initial design but also differs from the new federal rules, which call for checks every six months.",
      "Fiona Roberts, a spokesperson for Georgia's Medicaid agency, said the state is still waiting to hear whether it needs to alter its plan.",
      "So Georgia is among the states in limbo, awaiting guidance from the federal government.",
      "KFF Health News correspondents Sam Whitehead and Lauren Sausser contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said in an interview that aired Sunday that tariff rates are \"pretty much set\" on more than 60 trading partners after President Trump's executive order last week.",
      "\"So these, these tariff rates are pretty much set,\" Greer said in an interview Friday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan. \"I expect I do have my phone blowing up. There are trade ministers who, who want to talk more and see how they can work in a different way with the United States, but I think that we have, we're seeing truly the contours of the president's tariff plan right now with these rates.\"",
      "Hours ahead of the Trump administration's self-imposed deadline for baseline tariffs on Friday, the White House announced tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. All imports will have a 10% tariff rate as of Aug. 7, according to the executive order.",
      "When asked if Mr. Trump will be negotiating the tariff rate down in coming days, Greer answered, \"I don't think they will be,\" but he added these tariff rates are \"set rates pursuant to deals.\"",
      "\"When the president is looking at this, he looks at potential deals, and we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do,\" Greer said. \"And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then talking to his advisors, he makes a call on this.\"",
      "Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline, the Trump administration touted a number of deals for tariffs, including South Korea, the European Union and Britain. But other major U.S. trading partners did not reach deals, including Canada, which Mr. Trump levied a 35% tariff on goods not subject the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Canada is the U.S.' second-largest trading partner.",
      "\"The President's view with with every country, whether it's Canada or Mexico, and regardless of the kind of trade agreement we have in place, is that the net result of the trading system, whether it's our WTO agreements or our existing trade agreements, the net result has been that a lot of the manufacturing has gone overseas, and when that's the net result, you can't continue with that system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"So you know, I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is the President is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have,\" the trade adviser said.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who Brennan interviewed separately on \"Face the Nation,\" said that Bank of America economists have predicted that while the economy will still continue to grow, they are predicting \"less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that.\"",
      "As for the economic impact that tariffs will have on the economy, Moynihan said \"no one really knows, honestly, because this is a different regime than we've been in before.\"",

    "summary": "Nik and Adinah Johnson, who retired in their forties, are part of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early), a movement that looks at work as a means to an end, and where frugality buys freedom from the rat race.",
    "story": [
      "On a recent Sunday morning, at a Bible camp outside of Gainesville, Florida, Nik Johnson got up to preach, not about hellfire and brimstone, but about a very different fire: Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE). \"Ultimately at the end of the day, financial independence really ain't about us,\" he said. \"It's about people that we love and the causes that we care about.\"",
      "This was Camp FI. Its attendees: retirees and aspiring retirees who looked a little on the young side.",
      "When Johnson met his wife, Adinah, some 30 years ago, she knew right away, he was a saver: \"Our first date, he had a coupon,\" she said.",
      "\"I did use a coupon! And I'm not ashamed about it,\" said Nik. \"I knew that if I presented a coupon and she had an issue with it, she was not my soulmate.\"",
      "Adinah's reaction? \"How many other coupons do you have? What's the best deal? Wait a minute, let's see what we could do here!\"",
      "Nik worked in software, while Adinah was in higher ed. And despite modest starting salaries, they managed to pay off their home and save $1.6 million by consuming less, saving more, and putting 300,000 miles on their beloved minivan, Big Red.",
      "Nik said, \"I shared this with Adinah: I always wanted to be to the point that when I got to 50 I didn't want to have to work. And so honestly, I didn't exactly know how to achieve that.\"",
      "Then, one day during the pandemic, Nik was poking around on the Internet and discovered the FIRE Movement, which led him to Camp FI \u2013 a group of hardcore savers and careful spenders who share tips, tricks and philosophical discourse with basically one goal \u2026 to get out of the rat race.",
      "It's all inspired by Peter Adeney, who blogs under the name Mr. Money Mustache. \"American life is so inefficient,\" he said. \"We're all just kind of following each other, what each other does, and not realizing where all of this time and money is slipping through our hands. So, start doing things that are different from what other people do, would probably be the first piece of advice.\"",
      "Adeney retired at age 30, and turned 50 this year. He said, \"I often think that, because I retired so early, I have lived a lot longer than a normal 50-year-old. Like, I feel like I retired 100 years ago, because I've had so many experiences. It's a great antidote to the usual thing, where people say, 'Life goes by too fast. Then, you miss it.'",
      "\"However, it doesn't solve your happiness problems,\" Adeney said. \"One of my friends who's also a blogger says, like, he still had to confront some demons and some emotional issues. And taking away his job just exposed them more, 'cause he could no longer distract himself from them.\"",
      "The key to saving for retirement, according to Adeney, is to figure out what's important to you \u2013 and trim your spending everywhere else.",
      "Vicki Robin is a sort of mythical figure in the FIRE Movement. She is the co-author (with Joe Dominguez) of the 1992 personal finance book, \"Your Money or Your Life.\" She said, \"As you start to elaborate what's important to you, you realize, like, 'I'm gonna minimize the amount of money I spend, 'cause that's my life energy.' And there's some formula that arises in your mind of, like, 'The less I spend, the more life I have.'\"",
      "Robin's philosophy is less about early retirement and more about asking what is \"enough,\" which differs for everyone. But the consensus of the FIRE Movement is that, to retire, you have to save and invest 25 times your yearly expenses, and then live off of a 4% drawdown each year.",
      "Robin said, \"It's just, 'Okay, how can I have enough for a life that's really happy, but no excess, so that I can liberate my time to do what I find I'm called to do, what I care to do?' And, you know, that evolves over time. I have a little phrase that I've said: I buy my freedom with my frugality every day.\"",
      "A frugality which Nik and Adina Johnson say they are now reaping the rewards of, along with their three children: a life less defined by the \"stuff\" they possess, and more by the freedom they enjoy.",
      "Nik said, \"They're gonna always remember this trip to Disney. But they're not gonna remember, you know, that extra pair of tennis shoes I bought my son. My son's not gonna look at me like, 'Hey Dad, remember that blazer you had on? Man, it was awesome!'\"",
      "Asked what these early retirees' day looks like, Adinah replied, \"Well, I have to pick up the kids, and then I have to take my son to football practice. And then whatever grocery shopping I may have needed to do while I was doing this interview, I need to go ahead and get some of that grocery shopping done.\"",
      "\"Doesn't sound like she needs my help for any of that; I'll probably go play golf,\" Nik laughed.",
      "I observed, \"Seems like one of you is more retired than the other one.\"",

      "President Trump ordered his administration to fire the commissioner of labor statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after the July jobs report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring and a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "\"No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media.",
      "He added, \"She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes.\"",
      "The president described the latest report, which showed employers in July added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, as \"a shock,\" adding that the downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June was a \"major mistake.\"",
      "McEntarfer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Although Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the latest employment report revision for May and June undermines the data's accuracy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics frequently revises its previous job numbers to reflect new information, while past months' numbers are often revised both upwards and downwards. The previous revision was made in the June jobs report, when the BLS revised April and May's numbers higher.",
      "McEntarfer's firing drew criticism from economists and policy experts, who said the move threatens the integrity of economic data from a trusted federal agency",
      "Mr. Trump \"is firing the messenger because he doesn't seem to like jobs numbers that reflect how badly he's damaged the economy,\" Lily Roberts, managing director for Inclusive Growth at the Center for American Progress, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said in a statement.",
      "She added, \"The data he wants to hide is produced by nonpartisan economists who have been doing this work for decades. Politicizing our country's collection of data on what's going on in the economy could shake markets that rely on unbiased information, and it will make it harder to create an economy that makes sure everyone has a good job.\"",
      "Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a social media post that Mr. Trump's dismissal of McEntarfer is \"basically unprecedented and will raise concerns about U.S. data integrity going forward,\" noting that BLS also issues closely watched data on inflation, wages and worker productivity.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers also expressed concern about the firing.",
      "\"The statistics are what they are,\" Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told CBS News. \"It's not the statistician's fault if the numbers are accurate and that they're not what the president had hoped for.\"",
      "In a social media post, Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said she supported the firing, and added that Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as acting commissioner. \"A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,\" she wrote.",
      "McEntarfer was named as the 16th commissioner of Labor Statistics in January 2024, after she was nominated by President Biden in 2023 and confirmed in early 2024 by the Senate. A labor economist, McEntarfer had spent more than 20 years in positions with the federal government, including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Treasury,\u00a0according\u00a0to her bio.",
      "Stagnating job market",

    "summary": "Berkshire Hathaway's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it has to record the current value of its massive investment portfolio.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett's\u00a0company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in\u00a0Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll.",
      "Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year.",
      "Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it must record the current value of its massive investment portfolio, even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprised shareholders by\u00a0selling off\u00a0a huge chunk of its Apple stake, which inflated the investment gains then.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies \u2014 major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses \u2014 generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Trump's tariffs.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that.",
      "Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it has had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products.",
      "This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands.",
      "Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft's core collection of processed foods.",
      "Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands.",
      "Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting when he announced that he plans to\u00a0give up the CEO title\u00a0at the end of the year and hand over operations to\u00a0Vice Chairman Greg Abel, but Buffett will remain Chairman.",
      "Berkshire shareholders might be disappointed that the company didn't repurchase any of its shares this quarter, even though the price has fallen more than 12% since just before Buffett announced his retirement.",
      "Many investors are watching Berkshire's BNSF closely after\u00a0rival Union Pacific announced\u00a0a plan to buy Norfolk Southern earlier this week to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. The speculation is that BNSF needs to pursue a merger with Eastern Rail CSX to be able to compete.",
      "But CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it isn't Buffett's style to jump into a deal just because the market thinks he should. Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation.",
      "\"He wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,\" Seifert said. \"I think one of the reasons why that cash hasn't been deployed is that valuations run through the Berkshire M-and-A model tend to be too rich. But if there's a logical case to be made they'll accept it.\"",
      "And BNSF appears to be doing fine right now on its own. The railroad recorded a 19% jump in its operating profit this quarter at $1.47 billion as it cut costs and delivered about 1% more shipments.",

      "Greer spoke to \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" hours after the monthly jobs report showed a hiring slowdown in July and revised down earlier reports for May and June. Mr. Trump reacted by firing Commissioner of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer, claiming \u2014 without evidence \u2014 Friday's jobs numbers were \"RIGGED.\"",
      "\"You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers, and so it sounds to me like the president has real concerns,\" Greer told CBS News, adding that Mr. Trump's issues with government labor data extend beyond Friday's report.",
      "\"You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways,\" said Greer.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics' reports are based on surveys of households and businesses. It's common for the agency to revise prior months' figures up or down as more data comes in. The May and June revisions \u2014 which cut the number of new jobs by a combined 258,000 \u2014 were the largest downward change in employment figures since 1979, excluding pandemic-era jobs reports, though that doesn't mean the data was manipulated, as Mr. Trump claims.",
      "Greer defended Mr. Trump's right to fire McEntarfer, an economist who was nominated to the post by former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"The President is the President. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "The firing drew staunch criticism, with McEntarfer's predecessor William Beach \u2014 who was first nominated in Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 calling it \"groundless\" and a \"dangerous precedent.\"",
      "\"This rationale for firing Dr. McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers,\" Beach said in a statement.",
      "Friday's report showed the economy added 73,000 jobs in July, below the 115,000 predicted by economists. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, up from 4.1% a month earlier.",
      "Greer predicts \"big increase in manufacturing jobs\"",
      "The jobs report also showed a slight drop in manufacturing jobs last month. Mr. Trump's tariff hikes are intended in part to boost American manufacturing \u2014 though critics warn some U.S.-based factories that rely on foreign-made inputs will be hurt by tariffs.",
      "When asked about July's manufacturing data, Greer \u2014 one of Mr. Trump's trade negotiators \u2014 told CBS News he doesn't \"read tariff policy into that number.\"",
      "Instead, Greer argued that the numbers reflect conditions prior to the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act that passed through Congress last month. He argued businesses were \"waiting to see\" if some of the bill's tax provisions would pass, including parts that GOP lawmakers believe will encourage more business investment.",
      "\"I think that we're going to see a big increase in manufacturing jobs now that we have the 'one big, beautiful bill' passed,\" Greer said. \"And I think that \u2026 our manufacturers know that they have a clear and certain path forward on that now.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order hiking tariffs on U.S. imports could drive up consumer prices and prolong uncertainty for millions of businesses, trade experts said.",
      "Materials issued by the White House on Thursday outline new tariff rates for dozens of countries, but details remain scant on how to implement the trade agreements, said Barry Appleton, co-director of the New York Law School Center for International Law.",
      "\"The last thing businesses want to have are unanswered questions. They were looking for certainty, and what we have instead is a gigantic Rubik's Cube,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone has been waiting for 'Liberation Day' to be finished,\" he added, referring to the country-based tariff announcements Mr. Trump first made in early April. \"Instead, with this announcement, we have another perpetuation of what's going on.\"",
      "Under the Trump administration's new import duties, most countries will face a baseline tariff of at least 15%, although other nations will faces levies of more than 40%. The U.S. effective tariff rate is now 17%, according to Fitch Ratings \u2014 the highest in decades.",
      "That could mean pricier garments from Vietnam, shoes and toys from China, chocolate from Switzerland, and coffee from Brazil, according to economists. As a result, the revised U.S. tariffs could cost Americans an average of $2,048 per year, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the National Taxpayers Union, a nonpartisan advocacy organization.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued his tariff strategy is necessary to correct what he views as unfair trading practices and revive American manufacturing, and points to still-fairly-low inflation rates. But many economists warn\u00a0tariffs can lead\u00a0to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth, and some of the president's early trade moves\u00a0rattled financial markets.",
      "The White House has said that Mr. Trump's trade policies benefit Americans.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "On social media, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the tariffs are \"a knockout win over the distorted global trading order that has disadvantaged American workers, farmers, and manufacturers for decades.\"",
      "He added that Trump's foreign trade policy has achieved \"expansive new market access for U.S. exporters, increased tariffs to defend critical industries, and trillions of new manufacturing investments that will create great American jobs.\"",
      "Which products could get pricier?",
      "In the U.S., the products most commonly imported from abroad \u2014 and therefore most likely to see their prices rise because of sharply higher tariffs \u2014 include household appliances, furniture, cars, clothing, sports equipment, toys and cleaning products, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "The price of such goods rose about 1% in June, or more than double the increase in May, according to the investment research firm's analysis of consumption data, a sign that tariffs are starting to seep into the cost of everyday items.",
      "\"The question is really what's not going to go up in price. The costs were being eaten in the profits of companies, but that's not sustainable,\" Appleton said.",
      "Mr. Trump slapped some of the highest tariffs on key trade partners like Canada, a major provider of lumber to U.S. companies. That could lead to higher housing costs, according to Oxford. Some fruits and vegetables also could get pricier this winter as grocery stores leans on imports to stock store shelves, he said.",
      "U.S. automakers including Ford, GM and Stellantis have recently warned that higher U.S. tariffs will reduce their profits by billion of dollars. That is likely to increase new car prices, said Terence Lau, dean of the Syracuse University College of Law and formerly a government affairs executive at Ford.",
      "\"My advice to consumers back in April was that they should wait to buy cars,\" said Lau, who expects dealer prices for 2026 models to rise between 4% and 6%. \"In August, my advice is to buy now.\"",
      "Although many businesses are still selling inventory they imported earlier this year in a bid to avoid higher tariffs, subsequent imports will likely be subject to the newly announced levies when they arrive at U.S. ports, according to trade experts.",
      "\"A lot of businesses front-loaded goods to get them in the door before tariffs were announced. They'll now have to increase their costs as inventories dwindle and businesses start replenishing them,\" Oxford Economics' senior U.S. economist Matthew Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect cost hikes to peak in the second half of the year,\"",
      "Along with facing potentially higher prices, U.S. consumers could face reduced product choices stemming from supply-chain delays, according to economists. That's largely because companies unable to reshore manufacturing to the U.S. are likely to stop importing low-margin goods as they move to control costs.",
      "\"In many cases, tariffs will be so high that we'll create embargoes,\" Martin said. \"That will make it more difficult for retailers and distributors to get things out to market.\"",
      "Rodney Manzo, a supply-chain expert and senior director at Sage, a business management software company, said higher tariffs often end up affecting businesses and consumers in ways beyond the cash register.",
      "\"For the average shopper, the effects don't always show up as a big price hike on the shelf. Instead, it's subtler \u2014 fewer options, smaller quantities and less generous promotions,\" he said. \"Companies are quietly reducing [their stockpiles], reworking product specs or stripping out expensive components to hit margin targets.\"",

      "\"Sadly, employment appears set for a further summer slowdown as firms, facing renewed cost volatility from escalating trade tensions, remain focused on managing labor costs through reduced hiring, performance-based layoffs, restrained wage growth and lower entry-level wages,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said in a report. \"We anticipate job creation will weaken further, remaining below trend in the coming months, with the unemployment rate likely rising toward 4.8% by early 2026.\"",
      "The health care sector saw the biggest gains in July, adding 55,000 jobs. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 12,000 cuts in July.",
      "What it means",
      "Some market analysts said the subpar job growth in July suggests that stepped-up U.S. tariffs on the country's economic partners are weighing on the labor market. President Trump issued an executive order late Thursday that imposes tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"Today's Jobs report is unambiguously soft and a reflection of the trade and tariff impact on economic growth,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"Both the actual report and the big negative revisions are more evidence that the trade policy will slow growth.\"",
      "Beyond the ups and down of the job market, meanwhile, many Americans are struggling in an economy bifurcated between rich and poor.",
      "\"The top part of the income spectrum is doing incredibly well,\" Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady in an interview. \"At the bottom end of the spectrum, what I hear when I'm out in the district is I hear a lot of struggle. I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef. They're buying hot dogs.\"",
      "The latest job numbers could spur Federal Reserve officials to cut interest rates at their next meeting in September, according to economists. The central bank opted this week to\u00a0hold its benchmark rate steady. President Trump has pushed for a rate cut, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that policymakers remain cautious about lowering rates until the impact of tariffs on the economy is clear.",

The Constitution gives Congress the power to govern the city, but since 1973, the federal government has allowed D.C. residents to elect a mayor and city council that handle most aspects of local government. The city's autonomy is still limited, with Congress maintaining the right to override local laws \u2014 and Congress could choose to repeal the city's 52-year-old self-rule.",

    "story": [
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott filed a lawsuit on Tuesday to remove one of the state's House Democratic leaders, Rep. Gene Wu, calling him \"the ringleader\" of the dozens of Democratic lawmakers who left the state in an effort to block a redistricting vote.",
      "Abbott filed the emergency petition with the Texas Supreme Court to have Wu, who represents Houston and serves as Democratic caucus chair, removed from office. On Sunday, the governor had threatened to seek Democratic lawmakers' removal from office if they did not attend a Monday afternoon House session.",
      "\"They have not returned and have not met the quorum requirements. Representative Wu and the other Texas House Democrats have shown a willful refusal to return, and their absence for an indefinite period of time deprives the House of the quorum needed to meet and conduct business on behalf of Texans,\" Abbott wrote in a statement. \"Texas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans, and there must be consequences.\"",
      "Abbott claims Wu has forfeited his elected position and that his actions, as well as those of other House Democrats who left the state, \"constitute abandonment of their office, justifying their removal.\"",
      "The governor also alleged Wu and other House Democrats \"appear to have solicited and received certain benefits in exchange for skipping a vote, further supporting their removal from office and allegations of bribery.\"",
      "Abbott has argued in the past that Democrats can be legally removed from office if they don't show up. He's cited a non-binding 2021 opinion by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton that said a \"district court may determine that a legislator has forfeited his or her office due to abandonment and can remove the legislator from office, thereby creating a vacancy.\"",
      "But Mark Jones, a Rice University political science professor, has told CBS News the only way to remove a Texas lawmaker \u2014 other than at the ballot box \u2014 is by a two-thirds vote of the legislature.",
      "Texas Democrats break quorum in effort to block redistricting vote",
      "Over the weekend, dozens of Texas Democrats\u00a0fled the state to block a vote\u00a0on a Republican-backed congressional redistricting plan that\u00a0President Trump\u00a0wants before the 2026 midterm elections, escalating a standoff that has stalled the legislative session.",
      "The Democrats' absence meant the Texas House of Representatives did not have enough members present to hold a debate on a bill to redraw the state's congressional districts to add five seats favoring Republicans. That prompted a Republican-backed motion for their civil arrest.",
      "Abbott then ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to \"locate, arrest and return any House member who abandoned their duty to Texans.\" However, Texas DPS has no jurisdiction out of state. A civil arrest could force the lawmakers back to the Capitol.",
      "A refusal by Texas lawmakers to show up is a civil violation of legislative rules. During a previous walkout by Democratic legislators, the Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders had the authority to \"physically compel the attendance\" of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served that year. Two years later, Republicans pushed through new rules that allow daily fines of $500 for lawmakers who don't show up for work as punishment.",
      "Rep. Wu responds to Gov. Abbott's lawsuit",
      "In a statement to CBS Texas, Wu said that \u00a0\"denying the governor a quorum was not an abandonment\" of office, rather it was \"a fulfillment of my oath.\"",
      "\"This office does not belong to Greg Abbott, and it does not belong to me,\" Wu said in his statement. \"It belongs to the people of House District 137, who elected me. I took an oath to the Constitution, not a politician's agenda, and I will not be the one to break that oath.\"",
      "Wu also said that the governor has failed the people of Texas and is \"using the courts to punish those who refused to fail\" with him.",
      "\"When a governor conspires with a disgraced president to ram through a racist gerrymandered map, my constitutional duty is to not be a willing participant,\" Wu's statement reads. \"When that governor holds disaster relief for 137 dead Texans and their families hostage, my moral duty is to sound the alarm \u2014 by any means necessary.\"",
      "Abbott wants the Supreme Court to issue a ruling by 5 p.m. on Thursday.",
      "\"Greg Abbott is attempting to silence House Democratic Caucus leader Rep. Gene Wu by weaponizing the courts,\" Texas Democratic Party Chairman Kendall Scudder said in a statement. \"It is a complete violation of the separation of powers for the governor of this state to think he has the authority to unilaterally remove duly elected officials simply because he disagrees with them using constitutionally protected procedural safeguards.\"",
      "The Texas Solicitor General also said if House Democrats don't return by 1 p.m. Friday, when Speaker Dustin Burrows set the House to hold its next session, the attorney general will pursue all available judicial remedies.",

      "Mr. Trump has insisted they could pick up five more seats in Texas with new districts. Republicans have a razor-thin majority in the U.S. House going into the 2026 midterms, which historically favor the party not in the White House.",

Their options, however, are limited.",
      "At the center of the escalating impasse is Mr. Trump's pursuit of adding five more GOP-leaning congressional seats in Texas before next year that would bolster his party's chances of preserving its slim U.S. House majority.",
      "\"Greg Abbott is trying to silence the voices of Texans and prevent them from picking the elected officials of their choice, and now he's literally saying he's going to remove the representatives that the people have put into office,\" said Democratic State Rep.

      "Four years later, Abbott is taking a far more aggressive stance and swiftly warning Democrats that he will seek to remove them from office if they are not back when the House reconvenes Monday afternoon. He cited a non-binding 2021 legal opinion issued by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, which suggested a court could determine that a legislator had forfeited their office.",

      "\"Jeffrey Epstein is dead. Ghislaine Maxwell is not,\" Maxwell's attorney David Markus wrote in a nine-page filing. \"Whatever interest the public may have in Epstein, that interest cannot justify a broad intrusion into grand jury secrecy in a case where the defendant is alive, her legal options are viable, and her due process rights remain.\"",
      "In her interview with the Justice Department, Maxwell did not implicate President Trump in Jeffrey Epstein's misdeeds and said nothing that would harm the president, according to a source familiar with the contents of the interview. This was first reported by ABC News.",
      "An administration official also confirmed there is an audio recording and transcript of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's conversation with Maxwell, a standard practice for legal interviews.",
      "Maxwell \u2014 who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting, grooming and sexually abusing minors \u2014 is challenging her conviction, arguing she should've been covered by a non-prosecution deal that federal prosecutors in Florida offered to Epstein and any co-conspirators almost two decades ago. The Supreme Court indicated it will consider whether to hear Maxwell's case in September.",
      "Her attorneys also wrote that Maxwell has not been given the opportunity to review the grand jury material to assess the documents.",
      "\"When Epstein died, prosecutors from the Southern District of New York pivoted and made Maxwell the face of his crimes. She became the scapegoat and the only person the government could put on trial. She was convicted in a media firestorm of false reporting and mischaracterization of evidence,\" Markus wrote. \"Now, with her case pending before the Supreme Court, the government seeks to unseal untested, hearsay-laden grand jury transcripts, which contain statements presented in secret and never challenged by the adversarial process.\u00a0 Maxwell has never been allowed to review those transcripts even though the government did not oppose her recent request to do so.\"",
      "In a court filing last week, the Justice Department admitted that the grand jury transcripts that it is attempting to unseal from the investigations into the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell contain testimony from only two law enforcement officers.",
      "The grand juries that indicted Epstein and Maxwell did not hear direct testimony from any alleged victims, Attorney General Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told a judge in the Southern District of New York in their attempts to unseal the testimony.",
      "In a\u00a0filing earlier Tuesday, the Justice Department said that the grand jury transcripts it is hoping are unsealed were mostly already made public during Epstein and Maxwell's court proceedings.",
      "\"The enclosed, annotated transcripts show that much of the information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony\u2014with the exception of the identities of certain victims and witnesses\u2014was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise been publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses,\" the Justice Department wrote.",

      "Epstein accuser Annie Farmer wants grand jury transcripts released",
      "Before a different judge in New York, lawyers for Epstein accuser Annie Farmer asked for the transcripts to be unsealed Tuesday, arguing a public release could help remedy a \"lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and their co-conspirators.\"",
      "\"Given the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell's crimes, unsealing the grand jury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and those who enabled it,\" they wrote in a letter.",
      "The attorneys said victims' names and identifying information should be redacted, but the court shouldn't \"rubber stamp\" redactions about others who might be mentioned in the transcripts.",
      "Earlier this week, two other unnamed Epstein victims also asked for restrictions to be put in place to protect Epstein and Maxwell's victims, but were unopposed to the transcripts being unsealed.",
      "One victim asked for the judge to \"show us all the files with only the necessary redactions!\" and \"be done with it and allow me/us to heal.\"",
      "They asked that their attorney be able to review the suggested redactions \"as they are the ones who also know the victims, their names, their truths and their stories unlike the United States Government who did not and does not even care to know our truth. They would rather ask a convicted imprisoned sex trafficker/ abuser for information,\" referring to the Justice Department's two-day interview last month with Maxwell.",
      "Another victim asked for a third-party review of the files before their release, to \"ensure that NO victims names or likenesses are revealed through this release. It is imperative with the scrutiny over this media frenzy that the victims are completely and entirely protected.\"",
      "Meanwhile, lawyers for Epstein's estate are taking no position on the Justice Department's motion to unseal transcripts, they said in a court filing Tuesday.",
      "Last month, a federal judge in Florida denied the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury material stemming from investigations in 2005 and 2007 into Epstein in the state.

    "story": [
      "The federal government is calling off around $500 million worth of vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Tuesday.",
      "The 22 now-terminated projects were funded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA. Most of the projects that were canceled were for vaccines that fight COVID-19 or the flu, Kennedy\u00a0said.",
      "They include proposals from Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur and other drugmakers that were rejected or canceled, along with a now-shuttered award to Moderna to develop a bird flu vaccine, according to an HHS statement. The projects were reviewed and canceled over the last few weeks, said Kennedy.",
      "A Moderna spokesperson told CBS News that the company's H5N1 (bird flu) contract was canceled in May, and it isn't aware of any new BARDA cancellations.",
      "Kennedy framed the move as part of a step away from research into mRNA vaccines. Those types of vaccines\u00a0use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce antibody production to protect against an infection. The approach has drawn more interest since the COVID-19 pandemic, when mRNA vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna were\u00a0found to be safe and effective against the coronavirus. Public health officials credit the rapid development of the vaccines with saving millions of lives.",
      "Nevertheless, Kennedy said, \"HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses.\"",
      "He argued mRNA-based vaccines can stop working properly if the virus that they target mutates too much, citing\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0as an example. \"A single mutation can make mRNA vaccines ineffective,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Leading infections disease experts criticized the decision and said it will leave Americans vulnerable.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a virologist and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said Kennedy \"has once again made a decision, not based on scientific evidence that puts this country at unnecessary risk.\"",
      "Epidemiologist Dr. Michael Osterholm called it \"one of the worst decisions I've seen in 50 years of public health preparedness work.\"",
      "\"If an influenza pandemic hit us tomorrow, the global flu vaccine manufacturing capacity using the standard method of growing the virus in chicken eggs would only produce enough vaccine in 18 months to vaccinate just one fourth of the world,\" he told CBS News. \"We desperately need a vaccine technology where we could make enough vaccine for the world in a year.\"",
      "Many experts say a major advantage of mRNA vaccines is that they can be developed, manufactured and changed quickly, allowing drugmakers and public health officials to respond rapidly to novel viruses and to constantly mutating viruses like the flu.",
      "In 2020, the first Trump administration funded the development of Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which were developed significantly faster than traditional vaccines.",
      "\"No other nation matched what America achieved during the pandemic,\" Dr. Luciana Borio, former director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council, told CBS News. \"We pioneered and delivered life-saving mRNA vaccines at unprecedented speed. It's a historic accomplishment we should celebrate. Clinging to outdated technologies to counter a future flu pandemic is a grave mistake.",
      "Kennedy has has a\u00a0long history\u00a0of\u00a0raising doubts\u00a0about vaccines. Since he joined the Trump administration, he has fired members of an expert panel that made vaccine recommendations, and announced the removal of a recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still says children may get the vaccine and that it is safe and beneficial for pregnant women.",
      "Kennedy said Tuesday that HHS is moving the now-canceled funding to \"safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the Trump administration's efforts to reallocate more than $4 billion in federal funding geared toward natural disaster mitigation projects, arguing the transfer could lead to \"irreparable harm\" to flood-prone areas.",
      "The injunction by U.S. District Judge Richard G. Stearns in Boston followed a July lawsuit brought by 20 states. They argued that FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program had been unlawfully terminated in April 2025 under the Trump administration, with more than $4 billion in unspent funding that had been allocated by Congress redirected without its authority. Stearns wrote that the court was \"not convinced\" that Congress had intended for the money to be reallocated.",
      "\"The BRIC program is designed to protect against natural disasters and save lives,\" Stearns wrote.",
      "Stearns ruled that government officials were temporarily blocked from repurposing the funds while the court considers the state's objections to the cuts.",
      "The July lawsuit alleged that ending the BRIC program would upend disaster preparedness efforts across the country, leaving communities unable to tap into critical funding for hundreds of already-approved resilience projects. Before it was halted, the BRIC program provided funding for local infrastructure projects such as stormwater management systems and the relocation or elevation of buildings in flood-prone zones.",
      "FEMA officials originally announced in April that they were \"ending\" the BRIC program because it is \"wasteful\" and had become more concerned with \"political agendas than helping Americans recover from natural disasters.\" But in a court filing last week, the disaster response agency walked back those comments, stating that they hadn't cut the program and were still evaluating whether they will end or revise it.",
      "A CBS News investigation\u00a0in June revealed that the recent BRIC funding cuts have disproportionately affected counties that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election, with two-thirds of the counties that lost funding having voted for the president. The elimination of the BRIC program will especially deprive vulnerable communities across the Southeast \u2014 an area prone to natural disasters \u2014 the CBS News data analysis found."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-crime-report-2025/",
    "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 20:43:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Murder, other violent crimes and motor vehicle thefts all declined in 2024, according to the latest report from the FBI.",
    "story": [
      "Crime decreased in every category in 2024, including murder, violent crime and motor vehicle thefts, according to data released by the FBI on Tuesday. It reflects a trend experts have been tracking as reported numbers of violent crimes continue to drop from a spike immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "While the report included good news, a violent crime still occurred on average every 25.9 seconds in the United States last year, according to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, which compiles crime statistics submitted by law enforcement agencies across the country. This year's report used data submitted by 16,675 different agencies, which the FBI said covers a combined population of more than 325 million people, or about 95.6% of U.S. residents.",
      "The FBI's report did not venture to say why the violent crime stats decreased. \"It's difficult if not impossible for us to say why, and each reporting agency would have a different reason why,\" an FBI official said Tuesday in response to a question from CBS News during a briefing.",
      "The FBI did note it has seen an increase in the number of officers shot in the line of duty. \"Between 2021 and 2024, we saw 258 law enforcement officers feloniously killed in the line of duty,\" the FBI official said.",
      "All violent crime decreased last year",
      "Violent crime, which the FBI defines as murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, was down an estimated 4.5% in 2024 compared to 2023, with each subcategory also seeing a decrease.",
      "The murder and nonnegligent manslaughter rate decreased 14.9% year over year. Robbery dropped by 8.9%. Rape saw an estimated 5.2% decrease and aggravated assault was down 3%, the report found",
      "The murder and nonnegligent manslaughter rate dropped for a second straight year, after dropping from 6.5 to 5.7 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2023. In 2024, the rate dropped again, to 5 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. Over the last 20 years, the high mark in the murder rate was recorded in 2020, with 6.7 per 100,000 residents, while the lowest recorded was in 2014, with 4.4 cases per 100,000 people.",
      "Analysis from Jeff Asher, a criminal justice data expert and co-founder of consulting firm AH Datalytics, noted that while murder, rape and robberies have fallen to below pre-COVID levels following a large spike during the pandemic, aggravated assaults, while decreasing, remain \"stubbornly high.\"",
      "In a shift from previous years, both the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office contributed data to the FBI report.",
      "LAPD Chief of Detectives Alan S. Hamilton credited community and violence intervention programs in Los Angeles for contributing to the drop in crime there. \"We made an investment in the future and I think these are the dividends,\" he told CBS News in a phone call Monday night.",
      "Rodney Harrison, former police commissioner of New York's Suffolk County and a CBS News law enforcement contributor, said some of the drops in violent crime could be attributed to criminals shifting their efforts to online crimes like identity theft.",
      "\"If they don't have to go out on the street and run drugs and can make money sitting at the computer, some criminals will do that, which presents a new challenge to police,\" Harrison told CBS News.",
      "Property crime also down",
      "Property crime also saw a considerable decrease of 8.1% in 2024, the FBI report found, following a 2.4% drop in 2023.",
      "Of note, motor vehicle thefts decreased by 18.6% from 2023 to 2024 following several years of increases. It's the largest one-year drop ever recorded in that category, although the overall rate of car thefts is still higher than it was in 2019, according to Asher.",
      "Other subcategories of property crime include burglary, down 8.6%, and larceny-theft, down 5.5%.",
      "The overall property crime rate in 2024 was the lowest recorded since 1961, according to the Council on Criminal Justice.",
      "Hate crimes",
      "The FBI also included data on hate crimes, based on reports from 16,419 law enforcement agencies. In 2024, those departments reported 11,679 criminal incidents and 13,683 related offenses motivated by bias based on race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender or gender identity.",
      "The overall number of such incidents decreased slightly in 2024 compared to 2023, although the FBI noted there can be fluctuations when looking at different groups.",
      "While the FBI report did not give a breakdown of the targets of hate crimes, CBS News has been tracking an increase in reported antisemitic hate crimes in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack in Israel and the subsequent Israeli military operation in Gaza. Anti-Muslim hate crimes have also been on the rise in the same time period.",
      "The Secure Community Network, which helps to track antisemitic incidents across the country, said roughly 69% of the reported religiously motivated incidents in 2024 were antisemitic, targeting Jewish people or institutions.",
      "Downward trend continuing",
      "While the FBI's report is focused on 2024, statistics for the current year are available and show a continuing downward trend, according to analysis from the Council on Criminal Justice.",
      "The homicide rate continued to decline in the first half of 2025, lowering the rate in the U.S. to a level it hasn't seen in a decade, the CCJ said. Although the group noted that while the overall numbers are going down, many cities are still seeing higher homicide rates than they did in the first half of 2019.",
      "\"These numbers are promising but not surprising,\" Ernesto Lopez, senior research specialist at the CCJ, told CBS News. \"After significant increases in violent crime starting in 2020, the decline in all major crime types across all sizes of jurisdictions is promising. These trends are closely aligned with our own findings, which show crime falling last year and continuing to fall in the first six months of 2025.\"",
      "The council also noted the limitations of the FBI's data, which doesn't cover the entire U.S. population and only measures crimes that are reported to law enforcement. Advocates for victims of sexual assault, for example, often note that many rapes go unreported.",
      "\"The police data is critical, but it's also important to remember that most crimes are not reported to police, so the overall volume is much higher than what's represented here,\" the CCJ told CBS News.",
      "Laura  Geller, \n                                                  \n                                  Ash-har  Quraishi and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/border-agents-directed-to-stop-deportations-under-trumps-asylum-ban-after-court-order/",
    "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 20:12:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's ban on asylum claims, lifting a sweeping policy that had effectively closed the U.S. asylum system to many migrants, two officials told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's ban on asylum claims, following a federal court order that said the measure could not be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum-seekers, two Department of Homeland Security officials told CBS News.",
      "The move effectively lifts a sweeping policy that had closed the American asylum system to those entering the U.S. illegally or without proper documents. It's a measure the second Trump administration has credited for a steep drop in illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, where officials last month reported the lowest monthly level of migrant apprehensions on record.",
      "Mr. Trump's asylum crackdown was unprecedented in scope. The proclamation underpinning it, issued just hours after he returned to the White House in January, gave U.S. border officials the power to summarily deport migrants without allowing them to request asylum, a right enshrined in American law for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump said the extraordinary action was necessary due to what he called an \"invasion\" of migrants under the Biden administration, which faced record levels of illegal crossings at the southern border until it too restricted asylum last year.",
      "On Friday, a federal appeals court lifted its pause on a lower judge's ruling that found Mr. Trump's decree violated U.S. asylum laws. While the appellate court narrowed the lower court's order, saying Mr. Trump's proclamation could be used to pause access to the asylum system, it also ruled the U.S. government could not disregard other laws that bar officials from deporting migrants to places where they could be tortured or persecuted.",
      "Those laws require the U.S. to grant legal protections \u2014 known as \"withholding of removal\" and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture \u2014 to migrants who prove they would likely face persecution or torture if deported to their home countries. Unlike asylum, those protections do not allow recipients to get permanent U.S. residency or protect them from being deported to a third party country.",
      "Officials at Customs and Border Protection were instructed this weekend to halt deportations under Mr. Trump's proclamation and to process migrants under U.S. immigration law, which affords foreigners on American soil the right to request humanitarian refuge, the two DHS officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss an internal directive.",
      "CBP officials received instructions to process migrants through different mechanisms, including through a fast-track deportation procedure known as expedited removal, according to the DHS officials. While expedited removal allows for relatively quick deportations, migrants processed under the policy are also allowed to apply for asylum if they convince officials that their fears of being harmed if deported are credible.",
      "For months, U.S. border agents had been using Mr. Trump's asylum ban to swiftly deport those crossing into the country illegally to Mexico, their home countries and, in some cases, third party nations that had agreed to accept them. Internally, officials have dubbed those deportations \"212(f) repatriations,\" in reference to the legal authority Mr. Trump invoked in his proclamation.",
      "While the lifting of Mr. Trump's order may reopen the U.S. asylum system, those caught crossing the southern border illegally will likely remain detained while officials vet their claims. The Trump administration has largely stopped the practice of releasing migrants into the U.S. while they await their court dates, limiting releases to cases involving extraordinary circumstances.",
      "The Justice Department could also try to get Friday's court order suspended by the Supreme Court, in a bid to revive Mr. Trump's asylum ban.",
      "In a statement to CBS News late Monday, CBP said Friday's court order affirmed \"the President's authority to deny asylum to aliens participating in an invasion into the United States.\"",
      "CBP said the Trump administration is \"committed to ensuring that aliens illegally entering the United States face consequences for their criminal actions.\"",
      "\"This includes prosecution to the fullest extent of the law and rapid removal from the United States,\" the agency added. \"CBP will continue to process illegal/inadmissible aliens consistent with law, including mandatory detention and expedited removal.\"",
      "After soaring to record levels in late 2023, illegal border crossings dropped sharply in former President Biden's last year office, following increased efforts by Mexico to interdict U.S.-bound migrants and an order issued by Biden in June 2024 to restrict access to the American asylum system. But they have plunged even further since Mr. Trump took office for a second time.",
      "In July, Border Patrol encountered just 4,600 migrants along the southern border, the lowest monthly tally ever publicly reported by the agency. It's also a figure the Biden administration recorded in 24 hours on many days.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 19:57:13 -0400",
    "summary": "A CBS News review of three of DOGE's largest cuts claimed so far found actual savings of 3% of what was claimed.",
    "story": [
      "The spotlight may have moved off the Department of Government Efficiency since the departure of Elon Musk, but the Trump administration's DOGE continues to post about cost cutting on its so-called \"wall of receipts.\" And once again, some of its claims about savings appear to be significantly overstated, according to a CBS News review.",
      "The review of three of the largest cuts claimed so far indicates the savings from those contracts are less than 3% of what DOGE said they were.",
      "On July 27, DOGE added 705 canceled contracts to the website it uses to track and declare savings from the agency's cost cutting across the federal government, among them three of the largest claimed cuts posted since President Trump launched DOGE in January.",
      "The three contracts \u2014 all from the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 funded COVID-19 testing and treatment for people who were uninsured or underinsured during the pandemic. DOGE claims canceling those contracts saved $6.4 billion.",
      "But CBS News' review of transaction records indicates the actual savings is just a small fraction of that \u2014 around $165 million.",
      "That's about how much in obligated funds were left unspent in the three contracts by the time Mr. Trump took office and DOGE was launched. There was nearly $7 billion that remained, but this figure represented a ceiling that federal contracting experts say is rarely reached.",
      "DOGE adjusted down that total potential value by a combined $6.4 billion \u2014 and then reported it as savings. But with the pandemic long over and the contracts set to expire on May 31 of this year, it is highly unlikely the contractors, which included Walgreens and CVS, would have spent anywhere near that sum on COVID-19 testing and treatment.",
      "The spending \"was never going to reach this number,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, referring to the total potential value. \"You didn't have to terminate this contract, you are the government \u2014 just don't obligate any more money.\"",
      "Since it was launched, multiple news outlets including CBS News have reported that DOGE's \"Wall of Receipts\" has at times vastly overstated the amount of funds cut and discovered numerous errors in the group's accounting.",
      "DOGE now claims it has saved $52.2 billion \u2013 just from contracts canceled. Malkus, who analyzed the actual implications of the cancellations rather than the ceiling values, puts the number closer to $17.8 billion. But that would only be if Congress agreed to rescind the funds that it had already voted to spend.",
      "The DOGE website reports a grand total of $199 \u202fbillion saved, when factoring in real estate lease cancellations and other cuts such as personnel reductions. However, it provides no documentation for roughly half of that amount. According to DOGE, the savings equate to $1,236.02 per person in the U.S.",
      "\"The amount they have per person is fiction,\" Malkus said. \"It's transparency theater.\"",
      "HHS did not respond to a CBS News request for comment about the three contracts. The White House redirected the request to the General Services Administration, which declined to comment.",
      "A substantial portion of those purported savings is a result of cuts to USAID. A recent study in the medical journal The Lancet says those cuts could come with a human toll. By the study's estimates, the loss in humanitarian aid could lead to 14 million deaths in children younger than 5 years of age by 2030.",
      "Malkus told CBS News, \"Their claims are generally to say, 'Hey this is a lot of pain, but it's worth it.'\"",
      "The update is only the second since Musk, who launched DOGE, departed from his role in the White House advising Mr. Trump.",
      "Shortly before Musk's term as a special government employee expired, he told reporters, \"This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning.\"",
      "\"The DOGE team will only grow stronger over time. The DOGE influence will only grow stronger,\" he said from the Oval Office on May 30, adding that he was confident over time DOGE would cull $1 trillion in savings.",
      "It's unclear exactly how DOGE has functioned since then. In late June, The Washington Post reported that federal officials were instructed to stop routing the grant-making process through DOGE, revoking control of the online clearinghouse for all grant opportunities from the group. In DOGE's latest update, only one additional canceled grant was added.",
      "Several DOGE-associated government employees have left in recent weeks, including the Department of the Interior's Tyler Hassen, whose last day was Friday, The New York Times reported. Hassen was originally hired as a DOGE staffer, and then was later tasked with trimming costs at the Interior Department, where he was named principal deputy assistant secretary of the interior.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum had allowed him broad authority to make cuts to budgets and staffing, and under his watch, a DOGE-associated employee made the claim that a single survey costing $1 billion dollars\u00a0had been cut. That claim was repeated by Elon Musk and Burgum, but no evidence was ever supplied to back it up.",

      "Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan on Tuesday met for a third time with President Trump since he took office, relying on her cordial relationship with him to express concern over the impact of tariffs on her state and to ask for a delay in changes to the Medicaid program.",
      "During the meeting, Whitmer asked Mr. Trump for a three-year transition period for changes to the state's Medicaid program in order to develop a \"new, federally compliant structure\" that limits the disruption in care for seniors, people with disabilities and new moms, according to the governor's office.",
      "She also stressed the negative impact of the president's tariff agenda on Michigan's automobile industry, which is particularly vulnerable to extra levies on imports from Mexico and Canada.",
      "The governor's office said Whitmer has encouraged the president to work with her on developing an advanced manufacturing site in Genesee County to create American auto jobs.",
      "The meeting between the governor and Mr. Trump took place as other Democratic governors, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Kathy Hochul of New York, are sheltering Texas Democrats during a showdown with the Lone Star state's GOP-led Legislature over a major redistricting overhaul. The redrawn districts would award five new Republican-leaning seats to Texans in an effort to insulate them from potential losses in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Whitmer has defended her relationship with the White House, arguing bipartisanship has enabled her to secure more investments for Michigan.",
      "\"I've always said that I'll work with anyone to get things done for Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a statement. \"This year alone, we've secured major, bipartisan wins including a new fighter mission at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Macomb County, funding to protect our Great Lakes from invasive carp, and federal disaster support for communities in Northern Michigan impacted by historic ice storms.\"",

      "Whitmer last met with the president in early April, where she hid her face from photographers behind a folder in a now viral post.

      "He is also charged with causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence.

      "President Trump said Tuesday he sees Vice President JD Vance as an early favorite to serve as his successor.",
      "A reporter asked Mr. Trump whether he sees Vance as the \"heir apparent to MAGA.\" The president responded that Vance is \"most likely\" the leading contender.",
      "\"It's too early, obviously, to talk about it. But certainly he's doing a great job, and he would be probably favored at this point,\" the president said during an unrelated executive order-signing ceremony.",
      "Mr. Trump also mentioned Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and suggested he's \"somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form.\" And he said the Republican Party has some other \"incredible people.\"",
      "The president has singled out Rubio and Vance in the past, but has mostly avoided choosing a favorite. He praised both men in a May interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" and said he didn't \"want to get involved\" in picking a leader, though he noted that the vice president would typically \"have an advantage.\"",
      "Vance and Rubio are both seen as possible contenders for the 2028 GOP presidential nomination. The two\u00a0were once vehement Trump critics \u2014 with Rubio running against\u00a0Mr. Trump in the 2016 GOP primaries \u2014 but they have repositioned themselves as allies and defenders of the president since then.",
      "At least publicly, both men have been coy about their political ambitions. Late last month, Rubio downplayed the possibility of a presidential run in an interview\u00a0on Fox News' \"My View with Lara Trump,\" which is hosted by the president's daughter-in-law. Rubio said he thinks Vance \"would be a great nominee if he decides he wants to do that,\" adding that he'd be satisfied if secretary of state ended up being \"the apex of my career.\"",

      "The task force will coordinate federal planning for transportation, security and visa processing for the 2028 games.

    "story": [
      "President Trump fired five of the eight members of Puerto Rico's Financial Oversight Management Board, which oversees the U.S. territory's budget plan. The island has been trying to find its way to fiscal solvency after struggling with its debt for years.",
      "Mr. Trump dismissed the board's chairman Arthur J. Gonzalez, Cameron McKenzie, Betty A. Rosa, Juan A. Sabater, and Luis A. Ubi\u00f1as, leaving only two board members in place, in addition to one appointed by the Puerto Rican governor, CBS News confirmed, according to a White House official. This was first reported by Breitbart.",
      "Four of the fired members were appointed by Democratic presidents, while the fifth, Betty A. Rosa, was nominated by Mr. Trump during his first term and later renominated by President Biden.",
      "One of the remaining board members was nominated by President Barack Obama and reappointed by Mr. Trump, while the other was nominated by Mr. Trump and later renominated by Biden.",
      "Seven members are appointed by the president \u2014 six of whom are selected from lists provided by the majority and minority congressional leaders, and one is chosen at the president's discretion \u2014 and one ex officio member picked by the governor of Puerto Rico, who serves on the board but has no voting rights.",
      "A White House official said the board has been \"run inefficiently and ineffectively by its governing members for far too long, and it's time to restore common sense leadership.\"",
      "The financial oversight board was created by Congress in the last year of the Obama\u00a0 administration by the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, known as PROMESA. It was established to help Puerto Rico address its fiscal crisis and prioritize and expedite badly needed infrastructure projects for the Island.",
      "The oversight board said in a statement it was informed by the White House that the president had terminated the five members and that it would \"continue to work to fulfill the mandate of PROMESA and in the interest of the people of Puerto Rico.\"",
      "Though PROMESA was enacted in 2016, Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority's debt has yet to be negotiated, as bondholders continue to fight for billions that's due to them.",
      "Amid the ongoing legal battle over how much Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority owes its bondholders, Democrats in Congress have also been weighing in. At a hearing in July about the financial board's performance, Democratic Rep. Nydia Velazquez of New York slammed bondholder Golden Tree Asset Management, which is considered the main objector to the Financial Oversight Management Board's proposal to cut the principal payment on PREPA bonds from $8.5 billion to $2.6 billion.",
      "\"They took advantage of a distressed government to buy cheap debt, and now they demand the maximum payment. This isn't longer the story of PREPA's bankruptcy. It's a story of Golden Tree versus the people of Puerto Rico,\" Velazquez said.",
      "\"Calls to eliminate the board now, simply because of its spending on consultants and its refusal to agree to the PREPA bondholders' overreaching demands are premature,\" Jared Huffman, Ranking Member of the House Natural Resources Committee.",
      "According to Puerto Rico's national newspaper El Nuevo Dia, the island's Republican governor, Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, previously said that the financial oversight board needs to leave \"immediately.\"",

      "\"The failure of lawyers and consultants to resolve the bankruptcy of Puerto Rico has left the people of Puerto Rico without power, or a path forward,\" Loomer said.",

    "story": [
      "The Texas Legislature attempted to meet Monday to consider a redistricting plan that would favor Republicans, but Democratic members who left the state over the weekend did not return, denying the quorum needed to convene the session. Gov. Greg Abbott vowed to take steps to remove those lawmakers from their seats, and Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows said he had signed civil arrest warrants for the absent Democrats.",
      "Republicans \"can make idle threats, but as long as they are out of state, there's really nothing that they can do,\" said Mark Jones, a Rice University political science professor.",
      "More than 50 Texas House Democrats left the state on Sunday, leaving the chamber short of the two-thirds quorum needed to bring a vote to the floor. Democrats are protesting the President Trump-led effort by Republicans to redraw the state's U.S. House congressional map, which could net the GOP up to five more seats.",
      "\"We are fighting for representative democracy, and whether or not that will continue, and so we're willing to face whatever consequences may come our way,\" Democratic state Rep. James Talarico told CBS News.",
      "Texas Republicans on Monday and Tuesday returned to the Capitol in Austin but did not have enough members for a quorum, so the session could not be called to order.",
      "How are Texas officials trying to force Democrats back?",
      "Attorney General Ken Paxton on Tuesday said he would ask a judge to declare the seats vacant, after Burrows gave the Democrats until Friday, Aug. 8, to return.",
      "\"This House will not sit quietly while you obstruct the work of the people,\" Burrows said Monday.",
      "To assist Burrows, Abbott said Monday that he had ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to \"locate, arrest, and return to the House chamber any member who has abandoned their duty to Texans.\" But the Texas DPS does not have jurisdiction to arrest them out of state. Within the state, they could be placed under civil arrest, which would compel them to return to the Legislature.",
      "U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican, said Tuesday that he had contracted the FBI to \"to aid in Texas state law enforcement efforts to locate or arrest potential lawbreakers who have fled the state.\"",
      "Rep. Ann Johnson, a Houston Democrat, told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe in an interview Monday that \"a quorum break is written into the Texas Constitution,\" and \"the threat of arrest is something that should be an alarm for a lot of folks.\"",
      "What laws are Abbott and other Republicans alleging are broken?",
      "Abbott claimed Monday on Fox News that the Democrats could face bribery charges if their costs while out of state are being covered by others.",
      "\"I think based upon comments made by legislators themselves, they face a possibility of facing bribery charges, which is a second-degree felony in the state of Texas, there's one way to cure that, and that is if they get back to the state of Texas and make quorum today at a hearing that we have at 3 o'clock, they can cure themselves of any quid pro quo that would subject them to potential bribery charges,\" Abbott said.",
      "But Jones noted that \"Texas, compared to other states, has very loose ethics laws.\"",
      "\"The governor is certainly welcome to make that argument, and theoretically it has a limited level of potential to move forward, but at the end of the day, if you look at Texas ethics law and look at all of the things that are allowed under Texas ethics law \u2026 we would rank receiving money to pay a fine at the lower end at the potential for an ethics violation, let alone things that are illegal,\" Jones said.",
      "Cornyn also noted the bribery claims in his letter to the FBI, writing that he is \"concerned that legislators who solicited or accepted funds to aid in their efforts to avoid their legislative duties may be guilty of bribery or other public corruption offenses.\"",
      "Abbott said Sunday that if members didn't return by 3 p.m. CT Monday, he'd \"invoke Texas Attorney General Opinion No. KP-0382 to remove the missing Democrats from membership in the Texas House.\"",
      "Abbott was citing a 2021 opinion from Texas' Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, which was written after a previous walkout when Democratic lawmakers left the state to protest a change in the voting laws. The opinion, which is nonbinding, says a \"district court may determine that a legislator has forfeited his or her office due to abandonment and can remove the legislator from office, thereby creating a vacancy.\"",
      "But Jones noted that the only legal ways to remove a Texas lawmaker is either for the person to be expelled by a vote of two-thirds of the Legislature \u2014 which happened when legislators voted to expel\u00a0Republican Rep. Byron Slaton\u00a0over misconduct in 2023 \u2014 or by voters at the ballot box.",
      "Republican state Rep. Briscoe Cain\u00a0posted on social media\u00a0Monday that he would file a bill to declare a seat vacant if a legislator missed seven consecutive days of a session. But since there is no quorum, that bill can't receive a vote \u2014 at least for now.",
      "Why did Texas Democrats flee the state?",
      "Abbott called a special session last month to take up the redistricting effort, along with 17 other issues, including relief for Texas flood victims, a review of the flood warning system and emergency preparedness, and a THC ban. Congressional redistricting, however, was to be considered first.",
      "Texas has a part-time legislature which meets for 140 days every other year. The governor has the right to call a 30-day special session to address certain topics. The current special session started on July 21.",
      "Abbott can call as many special sessions as he wants, which means that if Democrats run out the clock on this special session, he could call another one as soon as it ends. After the 2023 legislative session, for example, Abbott called four special sessions, which kept lawmakers in Austin into December. He convened the first one only hours after the legislative session ended.",

    "summary": "The House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas to Bill and Hillary Clinton and former Justice Department officials for testimony about Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas Tuesday to a slew of former attorneys general and FBI directors, as well as former President Bill Clinton, for testimony about the case involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The subpoenas seeking depositions from the former Justice Department officials were issued after Republicans and Democrats on a House Oversight subcommittee approved measures to authorize the demands last month as part of efforts by Congress to obtain more information about Epstein.",
      "House investigators also issued a subpoena to Attorney General Pam Bondi for documents related to the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his associate who is serving a 20-year prison sentence. The department confirmed it received the subpoena but did not comment further.",
      "The committee is seeking testimony from Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as from officials spanning the past four presidential administrations: former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, Bill Barr, Alberto Gonzales, Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder, and former FBI Directors James Comey and Robert Mueller. Sessions and Barr led the Justice Department during President Trump's first term. Lawmakers are seeking information from the Clintons because of the former president's past ties to Epstein and Maxwell in the early 2000s.",
      "Letters to the officials from Kentucky Rep. James Comer, a Republican who leads the Oversight Committee, are all similar. The records from the Justice Department must be turned over by Aug. 19, according to the Oversight committee, and depositions are scheduled for throughout August, September and October.",
      "\"While the Department undertakes efforts to uncover and publicly disclose additional information related to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell's cases, it is imperative that Congress conduct oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell,\" Comer wrote, adding that the Oversight panel \"may use the results of this investigation to inform legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Clinton said in 2019 after Epstein was indicted on federal charges that the former president took four trips on Epstein's plane in 2002 and 2003, traveling to Europe, Asia and Africa. Angel Ure\u00f1a, the spokesperson, said the trips included stops in connection with the Clinton Foundation, and staff, foundation supporters, and Clinton's Secret Service detail were on every leg of every trip. Clinton also had a meeting with Epstein in 2002 and made \"one brief visit\" to Epstein's apartment with a staff member and his secretary detail, Ure\u00f1a said.",
      "\"President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago or those with which he has been recently charged in New York,\" he said, adding that Clinton hadn't spoken to Epstein in more than a decade and had never been to his island, New Mexico ranch or Florida residence.",
      "Former presidents have not successfully been compelled to testify before Congress, but several have voluntarily answered questions from committees, including Presidents Gerald Ford in 1983, Harry Truman in 1955 and William Howard Taft on numerous occasions,\u00a0according to the Senate.",
      "Epstein was charged with federal sex trafficking crimes in 2019 and died by suicide in jail while awaiting trial. He had been investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, though that ended in a federal non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges in 2008.",
      "But Congress has renewed its focus on Epstein after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo\u00a0last month that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" of prominent figures and confirmed he died by suicide. The memo also found that there was no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people. The Justice Department and FBI said they did not plan to release any further information about Epstein's case.",
      "The findings rankled some of Mr. Trump's supporters, who are skeptical that there is nothing else regarding Epstein's case to make public. Amid the backlash, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Maxwell late last month for two days in Tallahassee, where she was serving her sentence before being moved to a minimum-security facility in Texas last week.",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. An appeal of her conviction is currently awaiting action from the Supreme Court. The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Maxwell\u00a0for testimony last month and set a deposition for Aug. 11. But Comer offered to delay the interview while the Supreme Court considers whether to take up her case. The justices are set to weigh her petition at a closed-door conference Sept. 29, but do not have to act on it immediately.",
      "Comer said the committee will \"engage in good faith negotiations\" around the deposition, but would not grant her congressional immunity or send her its questions in advance \u2014 two requests by Maxwell's attorney.",
      "Blanche and Bondi have also asked federal judges in New York to unseal transcripts from the grand jury proceedings in Epstein and Maxwell's cases, though federal rules typically require matters before grand juries to be kept secret.",
      "Beyond the moves by the Justice Department, lawmakers have pushed for files related to Epstein to be released to the public. A clash of House members over the material led the House to scrap votes and leave Washington early for its monthlong summer recess.",
      "House Republicans put forth a non-binding resolution last month to make the files from the federal probe into Epstein public, but Speaker Mike Johnson said the lower chamber would not vote on it until September, when lawmakers return from their break.",
      "Alan  He, \n                                                  \n                      Ellis  Kim and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The State Department is set to roll out a pilot program that may require foreign nationals from certain countries seeking business or tourism visas to post a bond of up to $15,000, according to a public notice set to be published Tuesday.",
      "The notice lays out the details of a 12-month \"visa bond pilot program\" that would allow consular officers to require visa bonds. Under the program, the bonds may be required for travelers from countries that the State Department says have high rates of visa overstays, or where screening and vetting information is considered deficient, according to the document.",
      "The notice does not specify the countries covered by the pilot program, but said the State Department will announce the list at least 15 days before it takes effect. The agency will also provide an explanation of why the bonds are required, according to the listing, which will be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday.",
      "The program will take effect 15 days after the notice is officially published and will run through August 2026, the document states.",
      "The program comes in response to an executive order issued by President Trump on the first day of his second term that sought to stem illegal immigration into the U.S., a major focus of the president's policy agenda. The measure directed the treasury secretary, along with the secretaries of state and homeland security, to take action to implement a visa bond program.",
      "As part of his immigration agenda, the president has sought to roll back humanitarian programs for migrants from certain countries, and signed a proclamation in June banning foreign nationals from a dozen countries from traveling to the U.S. The Trump administration has also targeted immigrants on student visas and taken steps to tighten the rules for visa applicants.",
      "A new tax-and-spending bill signed by Mr. Trump last month also subjects many travelers to the U.S. to a $250 \"visa integrity fee.\"",
      "Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, said the latest measures from the Trump administration will deter travel to the U.S. from foreign countries.",
      "\"Bonds on tourist and business visas will convince most foreigners not to bother coming,\" Nowrasteh said in a statement to CBS News. \"The result will be a decimated tourist industry. Tourists spend over $200 billion annually in the U.S., spending that counts as exports. The administration's proposal will not only undermine much of the tourist industry, but it will counteract the administration's goals to reduce the trade deficit. The Trump administration's talent is proposing and enacting the most punitive, expensive, and unnecessary migration restrictions imaginable.\"",
      "The State Department described the pilot program as a \"tool of diplomacy\" and said it will help inform future decisions regarding the potential use of visa bonds \"to address the national security and foreign policy priorities\" raised in Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "\"The Pilot Program is further designed to serve as a diplomatic tool to encourage foreign governments to take all appropriate actions to ensure robust screening and vetting for all citizens in matters of identity verification and public safety, to create safeguards in [Citizenship by Investment] programs that provide citizenship without any residency in the country, and to encourage specified countries with visa overstays to ensure their nationals timely depart the United States after making temporary visits,\" according to the notice.",
      "Who may be included in the visa bond pilot program?",
      "The State Department did not say which countries with high overstay rates would trigger the visa bond requirement. But an August 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security found that in fiscal year 2023, there were more than 300,000 foreign nationals admitted for business or pleasure who were still in the U.S. after their authorized stay ended.",
      "The pilot program will focus on countries that have high visa overstay rates among those allowed into the U.S. for business or pleasure \u2014 through B-1 or B-2 visas, according to the notice. A B-1 visa is for those temporarily traveling to the U.S. for business activities. A B-2 visa is for foreign nationals who want to come to the U.S. temporarily for tourism or pleasure.",
      "Travelers entering the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program will not have to post a bond, according to the State Department's notice. That program allows residents of more than 40 countries to enter the U.S. for fewer than 90 days without a visa.",
      "While the countries subject to the program will be announced in the future, the list may also be modified on a rolling basis, the State Department said. The countries with the highest overstay rates for people with business and tourism visas in fiscal year 2023 were Chad, Laos, Haiti and Congo, according to the Department of Homeland Security's report.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters Tuesday that beginning Aug. 20, travelers from Malawi and Zambia seeking business and tourist visas will have to post a bond of up to $15,000.",
      "\"This targeted, common-sense measure reinforces the administration's commitment to U.S. immigration law while deterring visa overstays,\" she said.",
      "Only foreign nationals who are applying for B-1 or B-2 nonimmigrant visas, and who are from the countries identified by the State Department, may be required to post a bond of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 as a condition of receiving a visa. The bond can be canceled if the person meets certain criteria, including leaving the U.S. by the date their authorization expires, according to the terms of the program detailed in the notice.",
      "The new requirement for certain foreign nationals seeking to come to the U.S. for business or tourism could have negative consequences for cities that rely on travelers from abroad. A June report from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority found that Sin City experienced an 11% drop in visitation year-over-year, hosting nearly 3.5 million visitors in June 2024 and nearly 3.1 million this June.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Travel Association said the pilot program appears to effect roughly 2,000 applicants, most likely from a few countries with low travel volume to the U.S. But the group is more concerned with the $250 \"Visa Integrity Fee\" included in the tax-and-spending plan, the spokesperson said.",
      "\"If this fee is implemented, the U.S. will have one of, if not the highest, visitor visa fees in the world,\" the spokesperson said. \"If we are to maintain a competitive position in the global travel market, it's critical that U.S. visa policy reflects both national security priorities and the significant economic value of international visitation.\"",
      "David Bier, the Cato Institute's director of immigration studies, called the bond requirement \"draconian.\"",
      "\"Although we can't know for certain the scale of this rule because the administration isn't saying which countries it will apply to, the rule will add what is likely an insurmountable barrier to travel for many applicants who end up being targeted who are often family members of U.S. citizens,\" he said in a statement. \"Its argument that this will pressure governments to somehow force their visa holders to comply with the terms of their visas is incoherent, and it appears to be an admission that it will likely just ban people from coming, not just result in compliance. Most visa overstays leave after some time or end up qualifying for legal status in the United States another way. There is no reason to impose such a draconian rule.\"",

    "summary": "The FAA is currently investigating after an American Airlines flight from Denver to Miami experienced a landing gear issue during takeoff last month.",
    "story": [
      "Following the dramatic video of an American Airlines flight evacuating on a Denver runway last month, Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois is sending a letter to new FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford demanding answers on evacuation safety.",
      "\"The FAA needs an evacuation standard that reflects the reality of flying today,\" Duckworth told CBS News in a statement. \"The American people deserve to know whether the FAA is taking this responsibility seriously and complying with the law to ensure the flying public can be safely evacuated from an aircraft during an emergency.\"",
      "Duckworth, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Aviation Subcommittee, is concerned about the ability to evacuate an airliner in 90 seconds or less.",
      "\"Video showed passengers exiting with carry-on bags and, according to at least one passenger, the process took 10 to 15 minutes \u2014 the latter estimate exceeding FAA's 90 second evacuation standard by 10 times,\" she wrote in her letter to Bedford.",
      "The senator is seeking details about three recent evacuations.",
      "The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are currently investigating after American Airlines Flight 3023, traveling from Denver to Miami, experienced a landing gear issue during takeoff with 173 passengers and six crew members on board. The Boeing 737 Max 8 was going nearly 150 mph when the pilots slammed on the brakes. As passengers used emergency exit slides to evacuate, flames could be seen coming from the landing gear on July 26.",
      "\"We heard a loud boom, and I said 'That's not good,'\" passenger Mark Tsurkis recounted. \"Most of the people evacuated safely, except a few people who decided to take their luggage with them and that kind of, you know, that endangered others and endangered them.\"",
      "In April, a Delta A330 in Orlando experienced an engine fire, prompting passengers to evacuate. Kyle Becker, who was sitting in row 35, said he opened the window as soon as he heard people yell \"fire!\"",
      "\"There was a fire on the engine,\" Becker told CBS News at the time. \"[It] was a little scary\u2026 just never had happened to me before. Start thinking, like, OK, what are the next steps. Trying to remain calm.\"",
      "This incident also prompted an FAA investigation.",
      "And in March, another American Airlines Boeing 737 experienced a fire stemming from an engine issue while it was parked at a gate at Denver International Airport. Passengers filled the wing of the plane trying to escape the smoke.",
      "\"Everyone was screaming, 'There's a fire. There's a fire,'\" Helen Prager, who was on the plane, recalled. \"Literally at the gate and I was screaming, 'Get the doors open.'\"",
      "The FAA and NTSB are looking into the fire.",
      "\"While FAA has yet to disclose how long any of the referenced passenger evacuations took, these incidents once again raise serious questions about FAA's 90 second evacuation standard as well as FAA's assumptions about how evacuations occur in real world conditions (such as the assumption every passenger will comply with instructions to deplane without carry-on bags),\" Duckworth wrote in her letter.",
      "She wants the FAA to disclose how long the evacuations took and how many passengers took their bags with them, as well as how many children, seniors and passengers with disabilities were on board each of the flights.",
      "The senator is also seeking an update on evacuation testing that Congress mandated the FAA complete within one year of the FAA's reauthorization bill passing. That deadline passed in May. The updated testing was to replace a series of tests the FAA conducted in 2019 that did not include any real-world scenarios such as luggage in the cabin and passengers who were children, seniors or not able-bodied.",
      "Last year, Duckworth told CBS News she did not believe she could get off a plane during an emergency in under 90 seconds.",
      "\"Not at all confident, not at all confident. I often fly where I'm not wearing both my artificial legs,\" said Duckworth, who lost both of her legs while serving in the Iraq War. \"I don't think it's realistic anymore. \u2026 Conduct a real test and let's see what the realistic standard is.\"",
      "Duckworth asked the FAA to respond to her letter by Aug. 12.",
      "\"We need answers. Are the current [plane] evacuation standards, are they adequate?\" former NTSB chair and CBS News transportation safety analyst Robert Sumwalt said. \"It's definitely time for the FAA to go back and reassess what standards they're using for evacuations. It's been almost 35 years since those standards were published.\"",
      "The FAA told CBS News it will respond directly to Duckworth.",
      "\"Safety is our top priority,\" the FAA said. \"That's why the FAA's message to passengers is simple: if you have to evacuate, leave your bags behind and follow crew instructions.\"",
      "Earlier on Tuesday, FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford addressed the American Airlines incident in late July.",
      "\"We were all disappointed that many of the passengers on board did not respond to the flight attendant's request to evacuate timely,\" he said at a news conference. \"Grabbing bags, that's just wrong.\"",
      "\"We can't have somebody at the front of the line grabbing their overhead bags and keeping people in the back of the airplane from being able to safely evacuate, so we will be doing some education, to make sure that it's clear that passengers on board not only have an obligation, but it's the right thing to do for everybody on board is to listen to the flight attendants and obey their their instructions,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has suggested in a handful of appearances in recent months and years that he's looking at ways to run again for president, though the Constitution limits any person to being elected to the office twice. But in his latest comments on the issue, the president downplayed talk of a third term.",
      "The president told NBC News in an interview that aired on May 4 that \"I'll be a two-term president.\" And when asked on Aug. 5 whether he'd run again, he said \"no, probably not,\" though he added, \"I'd like to.\"",
      "The comments came after he told NBC in March that he was \"not joking\" about seeking another term in office, after repeatedly publicly musing about the possibility. He also said at the time that despite the constitutional limitations, \"there are methods which you could do it.\"",
      "Trump supporters like former strategist Steve Bannon have called on the president to run again, and Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, introduced a resolution earlier this year to amend the Constitution to allow Mr. Trump to be elected to another term. Senate Majority Leader John Thune also said of Mr. Trump's prospects of serving a third term, \"not without a change in the Constitution.\" He told reporters, \"I think that you guys keep asking the question and \u2026 I think he is having some fun with it, probably messing with you.\"",
      "Experts say changing the Constitution is extremely unlikely. Election law scholars\u00a0raised the possibility that talk of a third term, whatever its likelihood, may function as a show of strength to try to stave off the perception that Mr. Trump is a lame-duck president.",
      "Here's a timeline of Mr. Trump's comments on a third term:",
      "\"We're probably entitled to another four after that\"",
      "Mr. Trump flirted with additional time in office beyond two terms when he sought reelection in 2020. During a rally in Minden, Nevada, the president predicted he would win four more years in the White House, and even suggested that he could go on to another term after his second.",
      "\"We're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right?\" Mr. Trump said. \"Because we're probably, based on the way we were treated, we're probably entitled to another four after that.\"",
      "\"Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "Shortly after returning to office, Mr. Trump again made reference to another term at a rally in Las Vegas on Jan. 25.",
      "\"It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice \u2014 or three times or four times,\" Mr. Trump quipped to applause from the crowd, before adding that \"no, it will be to serve twice.\"",
      "Then on Jan. 27, Mr. Trump joked to Republican lawmakers about a third term. Speaking before the House GOP conference in Florida, Mr. Trump touted the money he'd raised for another race that he said \"I assume I can't use for myself.\"",
      "\"But I'm not 100% sure because, I don't know,\" the president continued, to laughter from House Republicans. \"I think I'm not allowed to run again. I'm not sure. Am I allowed to run again?\"",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me.\"",
      "At the National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 6, Mr. Trump said, \"They say I can't run again \u2014 that's the expression.\"",
      "\"Then somebody said, 'I don't think you can.' Oh,\" the president added.",
      "On Feb. 20, the president again joked about an additional term at a White House event to mark Black History Month, as he celebrated the support he saw from Black Americans in the 2024 election.",
      "\"Should I run again? You tell me,\" Mr. Trump said, as supporters chanted, \"four more years!\"",
      "\"There are methods\"",
      "In an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker on March 30, Mr. Trump said, \"I'm not joking\" about serving a third term, and for the first time mentioned an awareness of potential paths.",
      "\"There are methods which you could do it,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview, adding that \"it is far too early to think about it.\"",
      "The president pointed to his favorability rating and suggested that Americans would like him to serve a third term. Mr. Trump told Welker, \"I have had more people say, 'please run again,'\" while noting \"we have a long way to go before we even think about that.\" On Air Force One Sunday night, he\u00a0spoke\u00a0with reporters and briefly addressed questions about a third term and reiterated that it's still a distant consideration.",
      "\"No matter how you look at it, we've got a long time to go. We have a long time. You know, we have almost four years to go,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"But despite that, so many people are saying, 'you've got to run again.' They love the job.\"",
      "While speaking to reporters on Monday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump denied that he has ever looked into running for another term.",
      "\"People are asking me to run,\" he said. \"There's a whole story about running for a third term. I don't know. I never looked into it. They do say there's a way you can do it. But I don't know about that. But I have not looked into it.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was also asked whether it would open the door to Democrats running former President Barack Obama, who served two consecutive terms, against him.",
      "\"I'd love that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"That would be a good one. I'd like that.\"",
      "\"I'll be a two-term president\"",
      "In another interview with Welker conducted on May 2, Mr. Trump downplayed talk of seeking another term. The president said \"so many people want me to do it,\" saying he has \"never had requests so strong as that.\" But he added that \"it's something that, to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do.\"",
      "\"This is not something I'm looking to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'm looking to have four great years, and turn it over to somebody \u2014 ideally a great Republican, a great Republican \u2014 to carry it forward. But I think we're going to have four years and I think four years is plenty of time to do something really spectacular.\"",
      "Asked about moves by his allies to make another term possible, like by seeking a constitutional amendment, the president said \"that's because they like the job I'm doing, and it's a compliment. It's really a great compliment.\"",
      "\"There are ways of doing it,\" the president added, alluding to a possible write-in vote or move to elect Vice President JD Vance and have him turn the power over to Mr. Trump. But the president said he's \"not looking at that\" and hasn't had official meetings about possible avenues.",
      "\"I'll be an eight-year president,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'll be a two-term president.\"",
      "\"I'd like to run\"",
      "In an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Aug. 5, Mr. Trump touted the support he saw in the 2024 election among Texas voters, calling it \"a record that they say won't be beaten unless I run again.\" When asked whether he plans to run again, the president responded, \"no, probably not.\" He added, \"I'd like to run,\" citing his poll numbers.",
      "\"People love the tariffs, and they love the trade deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And they love that foreign countries aren't ripping us off anymore.\"",

      "But the ruling by U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, only narrowly applied to four of the state's 237 districts. That left the impact of the decision limited as thousands of Arkansas students prepared to return to class this month.",
      "The injunction is the latest legal turn in a widening push in Republican-led states to give religion a bigger presence in public schools.",
      "Texas and Louisiana have passed similar laws requiring classrooms to display the Ten Commandments and the issue is expected to eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\"Why would Arkansas pass an obviously unconstitutional law?\" Brooks wrote in his 35-page ruling. \"Most likely because the state is part of a coordinated strategy among several states to inject Christian religious doctrine into public-school classrooms.\"",
      "The Arkansas law, signed earlier this year by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, takes effect Tuesday and requires the Ten Commandments to be prominently displayed in public school classrooms and libraries.",
      "The suit was filed on behalf of the families by the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation.",
      "\"The court saw through this attempt to impose religious doctrine in public schools and upheld every student's right to learn free from government-imposed faith,\" John L.

      "The lawsuit says the requirement violates the families' constitutional rights and pressures students into observing a religion favored by the state.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear if the groups would seek an broader block of the law beyond the four districts. ACLU of Arkansas Executive Director Holly Bailey said through a spokesperson that \"it is clear from this order and long established law that all should refrain from posting\" the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms.",
      "The similar requirements enacted in Texas and Louisiana are also being challenged in court.",

They said his words \"good afternoon, Copacabana, good afternoon my Brazil, a hug to everyone, this is for our freedom\" \u2014 broadcast from a cell phone of one of his sons during a Sunday protest in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 cannot \"be regarded as ignoring precautionary measures or as a criminal act.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aca-obamacare-medicaid-expansion-trump-law-health-consequences/",
    "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "GOP lawmakers in 10 states have refused for a decade to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But when President Trump got another whack at Obamacare, these holdout states went unrewarded.",
    "story": [
      "Miami \u2014 GOP lawmakers in the 10 states that refused the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion for over a decade have argued their conservative approach to growing government programs would pay off in the long run.",
      "Instead, the Republican-passed budget law that includes many of President Trump's priorities will pose at least as big a burden on patients and hospitals in the expansion holdout states as in the 40 states that have extended Medicaid coverage to more low-income adults, hospital executives and other officials warn.",
      "For instance, Georgia, with a population of just over 11 million, will see as many people lose insurance coverage sold through ACA marketplaces as will California, with more than triple the population, according to estimates by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "The new law imposes additional paperwork requirements on Obamacare enrollees, slashes the time they have each year to sign up, and cuts funding for navigators who help them shop for plans. Those changes, all of which will erode enrollment, are expected to have far more impact in states like Florida and Texas than in California because a higher proportion of residents in non-expansion states are enrolled in ACA plans.",
      "The budget law, which Republicans called the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" will cause sweeping changes to health care across the country as it trims federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion over the next decade. The program covers more than 71 million people with low incomes and disabilities. Ten million people will lose coverage over the next decade due to the law, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Many of its provisions are focused on the 40 states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA, which added millions more low-income adults to the rolls. But the consequences are not confined to those states. A proposal from conservatives to cut more generous federal payments for people added to Medicaid by the ACA expansion didn't make it into the law.",
      "\"Politicians in non-expansion states should be furious about that,\" said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.",
      "The number of people losing coverage could accelerate in non-expansion states if enhanced federal subsidies for Obamacare plans expire at the end of the year, driving up premiums as early as January and adding to the rolls of uninsured. KFF estimates as many as 2.2 million people could become uninsured just in Florida, a state where lawmakers refused to expand Medicaid and, partly as a result, now leads the nation in ACA enrollment.",
      "For people like Francoise Cham of Miami, who has Obamacare coverage, the Republican policy changes could be life-altering.",
      "Before she had insurance, the 62-year-old single mom said she would donate blood just to get her cholesterol checked. Once a year, she'd splurge for a wellness exam at Planned Parenthood. She expects to make about $28,000 this year and currently pays about $100 a month for an ACA plan to cover herself and her daughter, and even that strains her budget.",
      "Cham choked up describing the \"safety net\" that health insurance has afforded her \u2014 and at the prospect of being unable to afford coverage if premiums spike at the end of the year.",
      "\"Obamacare has been my lifesaver,\" she said.",
      "If the enhanced ACA subsidies aren't extended, \"everyone will be hit hard,\" said Cindy Mann, a health policy expert with Manatt Health, a consulting and legal firm, and a former deputy administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "\"But a state that hasn't expanded Medicaid will have marketplace people enrolling at lower income levels,\" she said. \"So, a greater share of residents are reliant on the marketplace.\"",
      "Though GOP lawmakers may try to cut Medicaid even more this year, for now the states that expanded Medicaid largely appear to have made a smart decision, while states that haven't are facing similar financial pressures without any upside, said health policy experts and hospital industry observers.",
      "KFF Health News reached out to the governors of the 10 states that have not fully expanded Medicaid to see if the budget legislation made them regret that decision or made them more open to expansion. Spokespeople for Republican Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina and Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia did not indicate whether their states are considering Medicaid expansion.",
      "Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for McMaster's office, said South Carolina's Medicaid program focuses on \"low-income children and families and disabled individuals,\" adding, \"The state's Medicaid program does not anticipate a large impact on the agency's Medicaid population.\"",
      "Enrollment in ACA marketplace plans nationwide has more than doubled since 2020 to 24.3 million. If enhanced subsidies expire, premiums for Obamacare coverage would rise by more than 75% on average, according to an analysis by KFF. Some insurers are already signaling they plan to charge more.",
      "The CBO estimates that allowing enhanced subsidies to expire will increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million by 2034, compared with a permanent extension. That would come on top of the coverage losses caused by Mr. Trump's budget law.",
      "\"That is problematic and scary for us,\" said Eric Boley, president of the Wyoming Hospital Association.",
      "He said his state, which did not expand Medicaid, has a relatively small population and hasn't been the most attractive for insurance providers \u2014 few companies currently offer plans on the ACA exchange \u2014 and he worried any increase in the uninsured rate would \"collapse the insurance market.\"",
      "As the uninsured rate rises in non-expansion states and the budget law's Medicaid cuts loom, lawmakers say state funds will not backfill the loss of federal dollars, including in states that have refused to expand Medicaid.",
      "Those states got slightly favorable treatment under the law, but it's not enough, said Grace Hoge, press secretary for Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat who favors Medicaid expansion but who has been rebuffed by GOP state legislators.",
      "\"Kansans' ability to access affordable healthcare will be harmed,\" Hoge said in an email. \"Kansas, nor our rural hospitals, will not be able to make up for these cuts.\"",
      "For hospital leaders in other states that have refused full Medicaid expansion, the budget law poses another test by limiting financing arrangements states leveraged to make higher Medicaid payments to doctors and hospitals.",
      "Beginning in 2028, the law will reduce those payments by 10 percentage points each year until they are closer to what Medicare pays.",
      "Richard Roberson, president of the Mississippi Hospital Association, said the state's use of what's called directed payments in 2023 helped raise its Medicaid reimbursements to hospitals and other health institutions from $500 million a year to $1.5 billion a year. He said higher rates helped Mississippi's rural hospitals stay open.",
      "\"That payment program has just been a lifeline,\" Roberson said.",
      "The budget law includes a $50 billion fund intended to insulate rural hospitals and clinics from its changes to Medicaid and the ACA. But a KFF analysis found it would offset only about one-third of the cuts to Medicaid in rural areas.",
      "Mr. Trump encouraged Florida, Tennessee, and Texas to continue refusing Medicaid expansion in his first term, when his administration gave them an unusual 10-year extension for financing programs known as uncompensated care pools, which generate billions of dollars to pay hospitals for treating the uninsured, said Allison Orris, director of Medicaid policy for the left-leaning think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "\"Those were very clearly a decision from the first Trump administration to say, 'You get a lot of money for an uncompensated care pool instead of expanding Medicaid,'\" she said.",
      "Those funds are not affected by Mr. Trump's new tax-and-spending law. But they do not help patients the way insurance coverage would, Orris said. \"This is paying hospitals, but it's not giving people health care,\" she said. \"It's not giving people prevention.\"",
      "States such as Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi have not only turned down the additional federal funding that Medicaid expansion brings, but most of the remaining non-expansion states spend less than the national average per Medicaid enrollee, provide fewer or less generous benefits, and cover fewer categories of low-income Americans.",
      "Mary Mayhew, president of the Florida Hospital Association, said the state's Medicaid program does not adequately cover children, older people, and people with disabilities because reimbursement rates are too low.",
      "\"Children don't have timely access to dentists,\" she said. \"Expectant moms don't have access nearby to an OB-GYN. We've had labor and delivery units close in Florida.\"",
      "She said the law will cost states more in the long run.",
      "\"The health care outcomes for the individuals we serve will deteriorate. That's going to lead to higher cost, more spending, more dependency on the emergency department.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 20:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says possible new locations include Arizona, Nebraska and Louisiana.",
    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says \"Alligator Alcatraz\" will serve as a model for state-run migrant detention centers, and she told CBS News in an interview that she hopes to launch a handful of similar detention centers in multiple airports and jails across the country, in the coming months. Potential sites are already under consideration in Arizona, Nebraska and Louisiana.",
      "\"The locations we're looking at are right by airport runways that will help give us an efficiency that we've never had before,\" Noem said, adding that she's appealed directly to governors and state leaders nationwide to gauge their interest in contributing to the Trump administration's program to detain and deport more unauthorized migrants.",
      "\"Most of them are interested,\" Noem said, adding that in states that support President Trump's mission of securing the southern border, \"many of them have facilities that may be empty or underutilized.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security strategy builds on the opening of a 3,000-bed immigration detention center at a jetport in South Florida last month. Dubbed Alligator Alcatraz by state and federal officials, the makeshift facility will cost an estimated $450 million to operate in its first year. Up and running in just 8 days, the tents and trailers at Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport are surrounded by 39 square miles of isolated swampland, boasting treacherous terrain and wildlife",
      "Last month, President Trump toured the facility, seeing rows of bunk beds lined up behind chain fences and encircled by razor wire. Mr. Trump joked to reporters there that \"we're going to teach them how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison.\" Asked if the temporary facility would be a model of what's to come, the president said he'd like to see similar operations in \"many states.\"",
      "The Arizona's governor's office told CBS News it has not been approached about a state-run facility.",
      "Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen's office said in a statement that his administration \"continues to be in communication with federal partners on how Nebraska can best assist in these efforts,\" but added that for now, \"it is premature to comment\" and the governor would \"make details public at the appropriate time.\"",
      "For her part, Noem called the Alligator Alcatraz model \"much better\" than the current detention prototype, which largely contracts out its Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention capacity to for-profit prison companies and county jails. ICE is an agency that falls under DHS. This model relies on intergovernmental service agreements (IGSAs) negotiated and signed between ICE and individual localities. She called the Florida facility \u2014 with an eventual price tag of $245 per inmate bed, per night, according to DHS officials \u2014 a cost-effective option. \"Obviously it was much less per-bed cost than what some of the previous contracts under the Department of Homeland Security were.\"",
      "According to the Office of Homeland Security Statistics, the estimated average daily cost of detaining an adult migrant in fiscal year 2024 was about $165, though the actual cost of detention typically varies based on region, length of stay and facility type.",
      "Still, Noem argued that the new venues, all with close proximity to airports or runways, will help ICE to cut costs by \"facilitating quick turnarounds.\"",
      "\"They're all strategically designed to make sure that people are in beds for less days,\" Noem said, adding that some of the facilities being considered are still undergoing vetting by the department and subject to ongoing negotiations. \"It can be much more efficient once they get their hearings, due process, paperwork.\"",
      "Unlike Alligator Alcatraz, which uses funds from a shelter, food and transportation program run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Noem said the state-based initiative will tap into a new $45 billion funding pool for ICE prompted by President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\", which was signed into law last month. The pool of money is allocated specifically to the expansion of ICE's detention network and will nearly double the agency's bedspace capacity of 61,000 beds, based on cost analysis. As of Saturday, ICE was holding just over 57,000 individuals in its detention network in more than 150 facilities nationwide.",
      "Noem \u2014 who has implemented a department-wide policy across DHS of personally approving each and every contract and grant over $100,000 \u2014 said keeping ICE detention contracts to a duration of under five years is now \"the model we've pushed for.\" For instance, she added, Alligator Alcatraz is a one-year contract that can be renewed.",
      "\"For me personally, the question that I've asked of every one of these contracts is, why are we signing 15-year deals?\" Noem said. \"I have to look at our mission. If we're still building out and processing 100,000 detention beds 15 years from now, then we didn't do our job.\"",
      "The new policy is a departure from earlier agreements made under the Trump administration. In February, ICE signed a 15-year, $1 billion deal with the GEO Group, a private prison company, to reopen Delaney Hall, a two-story, 1,000-bed facility that ranks among the largest detention centers in the Northeast.",
      "Still, Noem said she doesn't feel the U.S. is moving away from a private detention model. \"I mean, these are competitive contracts,\" she said. \"I want everybody to be at the table, giving us solutions. I just want them to give us a contract that actually does the job \u2014 a contract that doesn't put more money in their pockets while keeping people in detention beds just for the sake of that contract.\"",
      "But Alligator Alcatraz has also come under fire from attorneys claiming that both the Trump and DeSantis administrations are holding detainees without charge or access to immigration courts, violating their constitutional rights. Attorneys argued in a legal filing last month that unauthorized migrants held at the Florida-run site have no legal recourse to challenge their detention.",
      "Lawyers and experts have also called into question the very legality of a state-run immigration detention center, given the federal government's authority over immigration enforcement. Opening the detention center in the Everglades under Florida's emergency state powers marked a departure from the federal government's role of housing migrant detainees, an option typically reserved for those who've recently entered the country illegally or those with criminal convictions.",
      "A U.S. district judge last week ordered state and federal officials to provide a copy of the agreement showing \"who's running the show\" at the Everglades immigrant-detention center.",
      "\"Florida does not have the legal authority to detain undocumented immigrants in the absence of a contract with ICE,\" said Kevin Landy, the director of detention policy and planning for ICE under President Barack Obama. \"A state government can't do that.\"",
      "Detainees held at Alligator Alcatraz have also claimed unsanitary and inhumane conditions, including food with maggots, denial of religious rights and limited access to both legal assistance and water. Florida officials have denied the accusations.",
      "Still, tucked away in the Florida Everglades 45 miles west of Miami, if its location sounds treacherous, Noem concedes, that's kind of the point. \"There definitely is a message that it sends,\" the secretary said. \"President Trump wants people to know if you are a violent criminal and you're in this country illegally, there will be consequences.\"",
      "Noem offered that deterrence is an effective strategy based on U.S. gathered intelligence \"from three letter agencies, from other intelligence officials throughout the federal government and in a lot of the Latin American and South American countries\" that indicates \"overwhelmingly, what encourages people to go back home voluntarily is the consequences.\"",
      "\"They see the laws being enforced in the United States,\" Noem said. \"They know when they are here illegally and if they are detained, they'll be removed. They see that they may never get the chance to come back to America. And they're voluntarily coming home.\"",
      "The DHS secretary met with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum in March. \"One of the questions I asked President Scheinbaum when I was in Mexico is, 'Do you have any idea how many people may have come back to Mexico that we may not know about,'\" Noem said.",
      "\"[Sheinbaum] said 500,000 to 600,000 people have come back to Mexico voluntarily since President Trump's been in office,\" Noem continued, explaining that the Mexican president believes her reluctant citizens fear losing the chance to return to the U.S. on a visa or work program.",
      "It's a datapoint she solicits from many of the foreign leaders she meets with, including Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa, who shared a 90-minute lunch with the DHS secretary in Quito, last Thursday. \"I asked him the same question,\" Noem recalled. \"He doesn't have as many illegal immigrants in the United States as in Mexico and Venezuela, but he said he thinks over 100,000 of his citizens have come back to Ecuador. And that's a huge number.\"",
      "Noem reasoned that her Ecuadorian counterpart's rough estimate is based on two factors \u2014 a strengthening Ecuadorian economy and a DHS television campaign launched across Latin and South America, warning prospective migrants not to enter or remain in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"He was very proud of the fact that he's doing better with his economy. So there's jobs,\" Noem recounted. \"But he said, you know, our ads are running in Ecuador. We're telling people that, if you have family in the United States that are there illegally, it's time to come home.\"",

      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

      "A lightning flash that extended 515 miles from eastern Texas to near Kansas City, Missouri, in 2017 was recognized Thursday as a new world record.",
      "The flash \u2014 dubbed a \"megaflash,\" or a single continuous long horizontal flash that can initiate up to hundreds of cloud-to-ground strikes \u2014 happened on Oct. 22, 2017, according to a research report published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. While the storm that day had previously been analyzed by scientists, new satellite technology recently documented the megaflash exceeding 500 miles.",

      "While the 2017 megaflash may be the longest in horizontal distance, it did not have the longest duration. Researchers estimated that it lasted just over 7 seconds. The current WMO-recognized record for longest duration megaflash occurred over Argentina and Uruguay in June 2020 and was about 17 seconds.",
      "Researchers hope the technology that identified the 2017 megaflash will continue to help them evaluate more storms.",

    "published": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 21:07:58 -0400",
    "summary": "The origin of potatoes has puzzled scientists for years, but researchers now say they've found an unlikely ancestor: tomatoes.",
    "story": [
      "Meet the potato's unexpected ancestor: the tomato.",
      "That's right, a fruit. Potatoes and tomatoes don't look alike, smell alike or taste alike, but in a study published Thursday in the journal Cell, scientists said that the potato evolved from a tomato ancestor around 9 million years ago.",
      "\"We've finally solved the mystery of where potatoes came from,\" corresponding author Sanwen Huang of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences said in a news release.",
      "The origin of the modern potato has puzzled scientists for years. In terms of appearance, potatoes resemble a species from Chile called Etuberosum, with one crucial difference: Etuberosum don't produce the starch-rich tubers. That's where the tomato comes in.",
      "While tomatoes don't have tubers, the ancient tomato did provide a crucial gene that, when mixed with the genetics of Etuberosum, told the modern potato to form tubers, according to the researchers. The SP6A gene from the tomato parent tells the potato plant to make tubers, while the IT1 gene from Etuberosum assists in controlling the growth of the underground stems that form tubers. Both pieces were needed to create the potato that's known and loved today.",
      "\"Our findings show how a hybridization event between species can spark the evolution of new traits, allowing even more species to emerge,\" Huang said.",
      "The research team analyzed 450 genomes from cultivated potatoes and 56 of the wild potato species during the study.",
      "\"Wild potatoes are very difficult to sample, so this dataset represents the most comprehensive collection of wild potato genomic data ever analyzed,\" said the paper's first author, Zhiyang Zhang of the Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen.",
      "Outside of the ancestry, there's also a linguistic similarity, according to Merriam-Webster.",
      "\"The word 'tomato' started out as 'tomate' and came from the Nahuatl word 'tomatl.' Since the potato had been introduced to the English some decades earlier, the word evolved to mimic the form of 'potato' \u2014 hence the spelling 'tomato,'\" the dictionary notes.",

    "story": [
      "A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule homed in on the International Space Station early Saturday and glided in for a problem-free docking \u2014 delivering two NASA astronauts, a Russian cosmonaut and a Japanese flier \u2014 to the outpost after a 16-hour rendezvous.",
      "Catching up from behind and below, the Crew 11 Dragon Endeavour looped up ahead of the lab complex, then to a point directly above the outpost before slowly moving straight in for a linkup at the space-facing port of the forward Harmony module at 2:27 a.m. ET as the two spacecraft orbited 264 miles above the south Pacific Ocean.",
      "Hooks and latches then engaged, pulling the Crew Dragon's nose firmly into the docking mechanism, which locked the craft in place. Umbilicals automatically connected and flight controllers began a series of leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal.",
      "\"Endeavour, welcome to the International Space Station,\" called NASA astronaut Jonny Kim from inside the ISS. \"Zena, Mike, Kimi and Oleg, we have cold drinks, hot food and hugs waiting. See you soon.\"",
      "\"Hello space station, Crew 11 is here!\" Endeavour pilot Mike Fincke, a three-flight veteran, enthusiastically replied. \"And we are super excited to join Expedition 73. We will do our best to also be good stewards of our beautiful ISS during our stay. The ISS has been inhabited and crewed for almost 25 years. We look forward to celebrating with you.\"",
      "Nearly three hours later, after doffing their spacesuits and configuring their capsule for docked operations, Fincke, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, making her first flight, Japanese veteran Kimiya Yui and rookie cosmonaut Oleg Platonov floated through the forward hatch to be welcomed aboard by the space station's seven-member crew.",
      "\"We are so happy to see your smiling faces,\" said ISS commander Takuya Onishi. \"Zena, Oleg, congratulations on your first spaceflight. We are looking forward to hearing your impressions and your feelings about that. Mike and Kimiya, welcome back. Your experience will be an invaluable asset for Expedition 73.\"",
      "Cardman was bumped from a Crew Dragon flight last year to help NASA bring two Starliner astronauts back to Earth after problems prevented them from coming home on their own spacecraft. She was clearly thrilled to finally be aboard the space station.",
      "\"This has been the absolute journey of a lifetime,\" she said with a broad smile. \"We are so incredibly grateful to be here. Thank you so much for this warm welcome. It was such an unbelievably beautiful sight to see the space station come into our view for the first time, especially with these wonderful crewmates.\"",
      "With the arrival of Crew 11, four of the station's crew members \u2014 Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 will be clear to undock and return to Earth next Wednesday to close out a 145-day mission.",
      "The other three \u2014 Kim and Soyuz MS-27/73S crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky \u2014 will remain aboard with Cardman and company to continue Expedition 73.",
      "Until now, long-duration crews, U.S. and Russian, have typically spent around six months in orbit. But starting with the Soyuz MS-27/73S mission, the Russians have switched to eight-month stays. NASA may follow suit with Crew 11.",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal 2026 would reduce NASA funding by nearly 25% while directing the agency to scale back work aboard the ISS in favor of more aggressive planning for eventual crewed missions to Mars.",
      "NASA managers are now considering lengthening crew stays and possibly reducing Dragon crews from four to three. A reduced crew would need fewer resupply missions, saving additional money.",
      "No final decisions have been made. But NASA is assessing the possibility of extending Crew 11's stay in space from six to eight months, depending on the actual funding outlook.",
      "\"I can't wait to be in space, and two extra months would be a gift,\" Cardman said before launch. \"Yes, we're baselined for six months right now, with the ability to extend that pending further analysis. For me, it would be an absolute privilege to stay for even longer.\"",

      "The Falcon 9 lifted off at 11:43 a.m. EDT from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, as mission control kept a close eye on clouds rolling into the area shortly before launch time.",
      "With commander Zena Cardman and co-pilot Mike Fincke monitoring cockpit displays, flanked on the left by Japanese Astronaut Kimiya Yui and on the right by cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, the Crew Dragon capsule began its climb. Nine minutes later, they reached orbit and set off after the International Space Station.",
      "\"I have no emotions but joy right now. That was absolutely transcendent, the ride of a lifetime,\" radioed Cardman, making her first flight. \"Thank you, this has been an incredible honor.\"",
      "Added Fincke, a three-flight veteran: \"Boy, it's great to be back in orbit again! Thank you to SpaceX and NASA to get us here. What a ride!\"",
      "The crew\u00a0originally hoped to take off Thursday, but clouds built up over the launch site and SpaceX called off the countdown just 67 seconds before liftoff. Weather remained a concern the second time around, but in the end conditions were \"go\" for launch.",
      "Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the Falcon 9's first stage engines shut down, the stage dropped away and the flight to orbit continued on the power of the single Merlin engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around and reversed course, flying itself back to a picture-perfect touchdown on a landing pad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, chalking up SpaceX's 65th Florida landing and its 484th successful booster recovery overall.",
      "One minute after landing, the second stage engine shut down and the Crew Dragon Endeavour was released to fly on its own.",
      "Had the crew launched Thursday, it would have taken them nearly 40 hours to catch up with the space station. With a launch Friday, the trip was expected to take just 16 hours, setting up a docking at the forward Harmony module's space-facing port at 3 a.m. Saturday \u2014 the same time they would have docked had they launched Thursday.",
      "For Cardman, the trip to space finally fulfills a dream she had hoped to accomplish last year when she came within a month or so of launching to the space station as commander of an earlier Crew Dragon flight.",
      "But she and Crew 9 crewmate Stephanie Wilson were bumped from the flight to free up two seats to bring Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams back to Earth after an extended stay in space.",
      "Wilmore and Williams flew to the orbital lab complex in June 2024 in the first piloted flight of a Starliner. But their stay in space was extended because of Starliner propulsion system problems. NASA managers eventually opted to bring them down earlier this year aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, using the seats given up by Cardman and Wilson.",
      "Wilson has not yet been assigned another flight, but Cardman was tapped to command of Crew 11.",
      "\"If I think about it only as an individual, and how it affected me, yes, of course, it was an unexpected change,\" she said. \"But space flight is not about me or about any individual. It's about what we can do together. None of us can do this by ourselves.",
      "\"Now I have the opportunity to train with this wonderful, amazing crew. Life is a journey. It takes many turns, and I'm just grateful to be here.\"",
      "Fincke is a 58-year-old three-flight veteran who trained to fly aboard Boeing's Starliner as did Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. In the wake of the problems encountered last year during the Starliner test flight, both ended up assigned to Crew 11.",
      "Platonov, making his first flight, was assigned to Crew 11 as part of a joint U.S.-Russian seat-swap program. The arrangement is intended to ensure at least one representative of each country is always on board the ISS even if one crew ferry ship has to depart in an emergency, taking all of its crew members with it.",
      "Platonov is the seventh cosmonaut to fly aboard a Crew Dragon under the agreement.",
      "A long-awaited mission aboard the space station",
      "Crew 11 will be welcomed aboard the space station by by Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese station commander Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, who were launched to the station on March 14. Also on hand: Soyuz MS-27/73S cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky along with NASA's Jonny Kim, launched from Kazakhstan on April 8.",
      "Clothing and personal items for Cardman are already on board, launched last year before her expected Crew 9 flight. Included in those personal items were birthday cards, including one from her father, a physicist, who passed away last August just before NASA bumped Cardman from Crew 9.",
      "She will celebrate her next birthday, her 38th, in October.",
      "\"My parents knew that I would be on the space station for my birthday last year, we thought, so they sent a few items in advance so that I could feel at home while I was up there. And now I'll have the chance to see them,\" Cardman told CBS News.",
      "\"My whole history, the people who have brought me to where I am today, I think it's going to feel really special to feel that connection to my dad, to my parents on my birthday in space.\"",
      "Cardman and her crewmates are replacing the Crew 10 fliers, who plan to undock Aug. 6, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast to close out a 145-day mission. Highlights included a spacewalk by McClain and Ayers and a non-stop schedule of research and station maintenance.",
      "\"I'm kind of looking forward to doing nothing for a couple of days,\" McClain joked when asked what she looked forward to the most about returning to Earth. Onishi said he was looking forward to seeing his family again, \"and also taking a hot shower on the ground!\"",
      "Added Ayers, who said she'll miss the opportunity to photograph Earth from the vantage point of space: \"In addition to what Anne and Tak said, I'm actually looking forward to a big, juicy burger on the beach.\"",
      "NASA plans to retire the space station in 2030, using a custom spacecraft being designed by SpaceX to drive the 930,000-pound football-field-size lab out of orbit, making sure it breaks up in the atmosphere over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from any populated areas.",
      "As one might expect of a decades old spacecraft of the size and complexity of the International Space Station, the vehicle is showing signs of wear and tear. One of the more concerning issues is a small-but-persistent leak in a compartment between the Russian Zvezda module and its aft docking port.",
      "The leak was discovered in 2019. The Russians believe its related to metal fatigue. NASA managers think it's more complicated than that. In any case, cosmonauts aboard the station have made multiple attempts to plug the leaks, but they have persisted.",
      "Earlier this summer, NASA held up the launch of the Axiom 4 flight to the space station due to indications a hatch used to seal off the leaking compartment was also leaking. They now have confirmed the hatch can, in fact, be sealed when needed to protect the integrity of the station's primary air supply.",
      "\"The rest of the station is leak tight,\" said Bill Spetch, NASA's ISS integration operations manager. \"We continuously monitor that, and everything else shows that we are really tight on our leak rate on the rest of ISS, no evidence of any other cracks or any other places.\"",

The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers. Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to recent college graduates have declined 15%\u00a0over the past year, according to Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z employees. Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",
      "While AI is already starting to reshape how Americans work, for now other factors are having a more immediate impact on the labor market.

Their options, however, are limited.",
      "At the center of the escalating impasse is Mr. Trump's pursuit of adding five more GOP-leaning congressional seats in Texas before next year that would bolster his party's chances of preserving its slim U.S. House majority.",
      "\"Greg Abbott is trying to silence the voices of Texans and prevent them from picking the elected officials of their choice, and now he's literally saying he's going to remove the representatives that the people have put into office,\" said Democratic State Rep. James Talarico. \"So he's taken a page of Donald Trump's authoritarian playbook, and it's something we should all protect.\"",

      "But legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, including in 2021 when many of the same Texas House Democrats left the state for 38 days in protest of new voting restrictions. Once they returned, Republicans still wound up passing that measure.",
      "Four years later, Abbott is taking a far more aggressive stance and swiftly warning Democrats that he will seek to remove them from office if they are not back when the House reconvenes Monday afternoon. He cited a non-binding 2021 legal opinion issued by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, which suggested a court could determine that a legislator had forfeited their office.",
      "He also suggested the lawmakers may have committed felonies by raising money to help pay for fines they'd face.",

      "Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows said the chamber would still meet as planned on Monday afternoon.",
      "\"If a quorum is not present then, to borrow the recent talking points from some of my Democrat colleagues, all options will be on the table. . .,\" he posted on X.",
      "Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, said on X that Democrats who \"try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately.\"",
      "Fines for not showing up",
      "A refusal by Texas lawmakers to show up is a civil violation of legislative rules. The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders had the authority to \"physically compel the attendance\" of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served that year. Two years later, Republicans pushed through new rules that allow daily fines of $500 for lawmakers who don't show up for work as punishment.",
      "The quorum break will also delay votes on flood relief and new warning systems in the wake of last month's catastrophic floods in Texas that killed at least 136 people.

      "Maxwell \u2014 who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting, grooming and sexually abusing minors \u2014 is challenging her conviction, arguing she should've been covered by a non-prosecution deal that federal prosecutors in Florida offered to Epstein and any co-conspirators almost two decades ago.

      "In a court filing last week, the Justice Department admitted that the grand jury transcripts that it is attempting to unseal from the investigations into the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell contain testimony from only two law enforcement officers.",

      "The attorneys said victims' names and identifying information should be redacted, but the court shouldn't \"rubber stamp\" redactions about others who might be mentioned in the transcripts.",
      "Earlier this week, two other unnamed Epstein victims also asked for restrictions to be put in place to protect Epstein and Maxwell's victims, but were unopposed to the transcripts being unsealed.",
      "One victim asked for the judge to \"show us all the files with only the necessary redactions!\" and \"be done with it and allow me/us to heal.\"",
      "They asked that their attorney be able to review the suggested redactions \"as they are the ones who also know the victims, their names, their truths and their stories unlike the United States Government who did not and does not even care to know our truth. They would rather ask a convicted imprisoned sex trafficker/ abuser for information,\" referring to the Justice Department's two-day interview last month with Maxwell.",

The approach has drawn more interest since the COVID-19 pandemic, when mRNA vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna were\u00a0found to be safe and effective against the coronavirus. Public health officials credit the rapid development of the vaccines with saving millions of lives.",
      "Nevertheless, Kennedy said, \"HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses.\"",
      "He argued mRNA-based vaccines can stop working properly if the virus that they target mutates too much, citing\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0as an example. \"A single mutation can make mRNA vaccines ineffective,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Leading infections disease experts criticized the decision and said it will leave Americans vulnerable.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a virologist and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said Kennedy \"has once again made a decision, not based on scientific evidence that puts this country at unnecessary risk.\"",
      "Epidemiologist Dr. Michael Osterholm called it \"one of the worst decisions I've seen in 50 years of public health preparedness work.\"",
      "\"If an influenza pandemic hit us tomorrow, the global flu vaccine manufacturing capacity using the standard method of growing the virus in chicken eggs would only produce enough vaccine in 18 months to vaccinate just one fourth of the world,\" he told CBS News. \"We desperately need a vaccine technology where we could make enough vaccine for the world in a year.\"",
      "Many experts say a major advantage of mRNA vaccines is that they can be developed, manufactured and changed quickly, allowing drugmakers and public health officials to respond rapidly to novel viruses and to constantly mutating viruses like the flu.",
      "In 2020, the first Trump administration funded the development of Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which were developed significantly faster than traditional vaccines.",
      "\"No other nation matched what America achieved during the pandemic,\" Dr. Luciana Borio, former director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council, told CBS News. \"We pioneered and delivered life-saving mRNA vaccines at unprecedented speed. It's a historic accomplishment we should celebrate. Clinging to outdated technologies to counter a future flu pandemic is a grave mistake.",
      "Kennedy has has a\u00a0long history\u00a0of\u00a0raising doubts\u00a0about vaccines. Since he joined the Trump administration, he has fired members of an expert panel that made vaccine recommendations, and announced the removal of a recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still says children may get the vaccine and that it is safe and beneficial for pregnant women.",
      "Kennedy said Tuesday that HHS is moving the now-canceled funding to \"safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.\"",
      "\"Let me be absolutely clear: HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them,\" the health secretary said.",

    "story": [
      "Crime decreased in every category in 2024, including murder, violent crime and motor vehicle thefts, according to data released by the FBI on Tuesday. It reflects a trend experts have been tracking as reported numbers of violent crimes continue to drop from a spike immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "While the report included good news, a violent crime still occurred on average every 25.9 seconds in the United States last year, according to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, which compiles crime statistics submitted by law enforcement agencies across the country. This year's report used data submitted by 16,675 different agencies, which the FBI said covers a combined population of more than 325 million people, or about 95.6% of U.S. residents.",
      "The FBI's report did not venture to say why the violent crime stats decreased. \"It's difficult if not impossible for us to say why, and each reporting agency would have a different reason why,\" an FBI official said Tuesday in response to a question from CBS News during a briefing.",
      "The FBI did note it has seen an increase in the number of officers shot in the line of duty. \"Between 2021 and 2024, we saw 258 law enforcement officers feloniously killed in the line of duty,\" the FBI official said.",
      "All violent crime decreased last year",
      "Violent crime, which the FBI defines as murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, was down an estimated 4.5% in 2024 compared to 2023, with each subcategory also seeing a decrease.",
      "The murder and nonnegligent manslaughter rate decreased 14.9% year over year. Robbery dropped by 8.9%. Rape saw an estimated 5.2% decrease and aggravated assault was down 3%, the report found",
      "The murder and nonnegligent manslaughter rate dropped for a second straight year, after dropping from 6.5 to 5.7 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2023. In 2024, the rate dropped again, to 5 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. Over the last 20 years, the high mark in the murder rate was recorded in 2020, with 6.7 per 100,000 residents, while the lowest recorded was in 2014, with 4.4 cases per 100,000 people.",
      "Analysis from Jeff Asher, a criminal justice data expert and co-founder of consulting firm AH Datalytics, noted that while murder, rape and robberies have fallen to below pre-COVID levels following a large spike during the pandemic, aggravated assaults, while decreasing, remain \"stubbornly high.\"",
      "In a shift from previous years, both the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office contributed data to the FBI report.",
      "LAPD Chief of Detectives Alan S. Hamilton credited community and violence intervention programs in Los Angeles for contributing to the drop in crime there. \"We made an investment in the future and I think these are the dividends,\" he told CBS News in a phone call Monday night.",
      "Rodney Harrison, former police commissioner of New York's Suffolk County and a CBS News law enforcement contributor, said some of the drops in violent crime could be attributed to criminals shifting their efforts to online crimes like identity theft.",
      "\"If they don't have to go out on the street and run drugs and can make money sitting at the computer, some criminals will do that, which presents a new challenge to police,\" Harrison told CBS News.",
      "Property crime also down",
      "Property crime also saw a considerable decrease of 8.1% in 2024, the FBI report found, following a 2.4% drop in 2023.",
      "Of note, motor vehicle thefts decreased by 18.6% from 2023 to 2024 following several years of increases. It's the largest one-year drop ever recorded in that category, although the overall rate of car thefts is still higher than it was in 2019, according to Asher.",
      "Other subcategories of property crime include burglary, down 8.6%, and larceny-theft, down 5.5%.",
      "The overall property crime rate in 2024 was the lowest recorded since 1961, according to the Council on Criminal Justice.",
      "Hate crimes",
      "The FBI also included data on hate crimes, based on reports from 16,419 law enforcement agencies. In 2024, those departments reported 11,679 criminal incidents and 13,683 related offenses motivated by bias based on race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender or gender identity.",
      "The overall number of such incidents decreased slightly in 2024 compared to 2023, although the FBI noted there can be fluctuations when looking at different groups.",
      "While the FBI report did not give a breakdown of the targets of hate crimes, CBS News has been tracking an increase in reported antisemitic hate crimes in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack in Israel and the subsequent Israeli military operation in Gaza. Anti-Muslim hate crimes have also been on the rise in the same time period.",
      "The Secure Community Network, which helps to track antisemitic incidents across the country, said roughly 69% of the reported religiously motivated incidents in 2024 were antisemitic, targeting Jewish people or institutions.",
      "Downward trend continuing",
      "While the FBI's report is focused on 2024, statistics for the current year are available and show a continuing downward trend, according to analysis from the Council on Criminal Justice.",
      "The homicide rate continued to decline in the first half of 2025, lowering the rate in the U.S. to a level it hasn't seen in a decade, the CCJ said. Although the group noted that while the overall numbers are going down, many cities are still seeing higher homicide rates than they did in the first half of 2019.",
      "\"These numbers are promising but not surprising,\" Ernesto Lopez, senior research specialist at the CCJ, told CBS News. \"After significant increases in violent crime starting in 2020, the decline in all major crime types across all sizes of jurisdictions is promising. These trends are closely aligned with our own findings, which show crime falling last year and continuing to fall in the first six months of 2025.\"",
      "The council also noted the limitations of the FBI's data, which doesn't cover the entire U.S. population and only measures crimes that are reported to law enforcement. Advocates for victims of sexual assault, for example, often note that many rapes go unreported.",
      "\"The police data is critical, but it's also important to remember that most crimes are not reported to police, so the overall volume is much higher than what's represented here,\" the CCJ told CBS News.",
      "Laura  Geller, \n                                                  \n                                  Ash-har  Quraishi and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "More than three dozen law enforcement agencies are helping with the search effort in a mountainous area near Anaconda, where the deadly shooting occurred last week. Montana's top officials described it during a news conference as the highest priority in the state.",
      "A team with the Montana National Guard has flown nearly 20 hours since Friday, looking for any clues for Brown's whereabouts as an undisclosed number of officers searched on foot.",
      "\"Rest assured, our brave men and women of law enforcement aren't giving up, and I ask that you not give up on them either,\" Gianforte said.",
      "Authorities say Brown, 45, fatally shot four people at The Owl Bar in the small town of Anaconda with a rifle that police believe was his personal weapon. He fled in a white pickup that he later ditched and stole another white vehicle stocked with clothes, shoes and camping supplies.",
      "A female bartender and three male patrons were killed. They have been identified as Nancy Lauretta Kelley, 64; Daniel Edwin Baillie, 59; David Allen Leach, 70, and Tony Wayne Palm, 74.",
      "The shooting rattled the tight-knit town of about 9,000 people, and many residents remain on high alert with the suspect still at large.",
      "Cassandra Dutra, a former bartender at The Owl Bar, told CBS News that she remembers Brown would say things she thought were strange, like he thought the CIA was coming for him.

      "Authorities are operating under the assumption that Brown is armed and extremely dangerous, Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen reiterated Tuesday.",
      "Without providing more details, Knudsen said there's evidence that authorities are searching in the right area. About 22 square miles of forest southwest of Anaconda have been closed to the public by the National Forest System as the search continues. Knudsen added that it does not appear Brown has broken into any cabins or homes in the area to get food or additional supplies.",

    "summary": "A CBS News review of three of DOGE's largest cuts claimed so far found actual savings of 3% of what was claimed.",
    "story": [
      "The spotlight may have moved off the Department of Government Efficiency since the departure of Elon Musk, but the Trump administration's DOGE continues to post about cost cutting on its so-called \"wall of receipts.\" And once again, some of its claims about savings appear to be significantly overstated, according to a CBS News review.",
      "The review of three of the largest cuts claimed so far indicates the savings from those contracts are less than 3% of what DOGE said they were.",
      "On July 27, DOGE added 705 canceled contracts to the website it uses to track and declare savings from the agency's cost cutting across the federal government, among them three of the largest claimed cuts posted since President Trump launched DOGE in January.",
      "The three contracts \u2014 all from the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 funded COVID-19 testing and treatment for people who were uninsured or underinsured during the pandemic. DOGE claims canceling those contracts saved $6.4 billion.",
      "But CBS News' review of transaction records indicates the actual savings is just a small fraction of that \u2014 around $165 million.",
      "That's about how much in obligated funds were left unspent in the three contracts by the time Mr. Trump took office and DOGE was launched. There was nearly $7 billion that remained, but this figure represented a ceiling that federal contracting experts say is rarely reached.",
      "DOGE adjusted down that total potential value by a combined $6.4 billion \u2014 and then reported it as savings. But with the pandemic long over and the contracts set to expire on May 31 of this year, it is highly unlikely the contractors, which included Walgreens and CVS, would have spent anywhere near that sum on COVID-19 testing and treatment.",
      "The spending \"was never going to reach this number,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, referring to the total potential value. \"You didn't have to terminate this contract, you are the government \u2014 just don't obligate any more money.\"",
      "Since it was launched, multiple news outlets including CBS News have reported that DOGE's \"Wall of Receipts\" has at times vastly overstated the amount of funds cut and discovered numerous errors in the group's accounting.",
      "DOGE now claims it has saved $52.2 billion \u2013 just from contracts canceled. Malkus, who analyzed the actual implications of the cancellations rather than the ceiling values, puts the number closer to $17.8 billion. But that would only be if Congress agreed to rescind the funds that it had already voted to spend.",
      "The DOGE website reports a grand total of $199 \u202fbillion saved, when factoring in real estate lease cancellations and other cuts such as personnel reductions. However, it provides no documentation for roughly half of that amount. According to DOGE, the savings equate to $1,236.02 per person in the U.S.",
      "\"The amount they have per person is fiction,\" Malkus said. \"It's transparency theater.\"",
      "HHS did not respond to a CBS News request for comment about the three contracts. The White House redirected the request to the General Services Administration, which declined to comment.",
      "A substantial portion of those purported savings is a result of cuts to USAID. A recent study in the medical journal The Lancet says those cuts could come with a human toll. By the study's estimates, the loss in humanitarian aid could lead to 14 million deaths in children younger than 5 years of age by 2030.",
      "Malkus told CBS News, \"Their claims are generally to say, 'Hey this is a lot of pain, but it's worth it.'\"",
      "The update is only the second since Musk, who launched DOGE, departed from his role in the White House advising Mr. Trump.",
      "Shortly before Musk's term as a special government employee expired, he told reporters, \"This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning.\"",
      "\"The DOGE team will only grow stronger over time. The DOGE influence will only grow stronger,\" he said from the Oval Office on May 30, adding that he was confident over time DOGE would cull $1 trillion in savings.",
      "It's unclear exactly how DOGE has functioned since then. In late June, The Washington Post reported that federal officials were instructed to stop routing the grant-making process through DOGE, revoking control of the online clearinghouse for all grant opportunities from the group. In DOGE's latest update, only one additional canceled grant was added.",
      "Several DOGE-associated government employees have left in recent weeks, including the Department of the Interior's Tyler Hassen, whose last day was Friday, The New York Times reported. Hassen was originally hired as a DOGE staffer, and then was later tasked with trimming costs at the Interior Department, where he was named principal deputy assistant secretary of the interior.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum had allowed him broad authority to make cuts to budgets and staffing, and under his watch, a DOGE-associated employee made the claim that a single survey costing $1 billion dollars\u00a0had been cut. That claim was repeated by Elon Musk and Burgum, but no evidence was ever supplied to back it up.",

      "\"This marine casualty and the loss of five lives was preventable,\" Jason Neubauer, who led the Coast Guard's investigation into the incident, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\"For several years preceding the incident, OceanGate leveraged intimidation tactics, allowances for scientific operations, and the company's favorable reputation to evade regulatory scrutiny,\" the Coast Guard report said. \"By strategically creating and exploiting regulatory confusion and oversight challenges, OceanGate was ultimately able to operate TITAN completely outside of the established deep-sea protocols.\"",
      "The report outlines several key causes behind the Titan submersible's demise. That included the fact that the \"design and testing processes for TITAN did not adequately address many of the fundamental engineering principles that would be crucial for ensuring safety and reliability in such an inherently hazardous environment,\" the report said.",
      "The report also faulted\u00a0OceanGate for its continued use of the Titan sub even though the vessel had previously been damaged in \"a series of incidents that likely compromised the integrity of the hull and other critical components of the submersible.\"",
      "On the day of the tragedy, the sub's hull \"experienced a critical event that compromised the structural integrity of its pressure vessel, resulting in an instantaneous and catastrophic implosion,\" according to the Coast Guard's investigation.",
      "The Coast Guard report also found that OceanGate had a \"toxic\" safety culture and corporate structure, and that its operational practices were \"critically flawed.\"",
      "That included a workplace environment which \"used firings of senior staff members and the looming threat of being fired to dissuade employees and contractors from expressing safety concerns.\"",
      "In February 2018, OceanGate's former director of marine operations filed a whistleblower complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, alleging he was dismissed because he voiced safety concerns about the \"first TITAN hull's development and testing plans.\"",
      "In response to the complaint, OceanGate filed a lawsuit against the former employee, accusing him of violating a confidentiality agreement he had signed with the company.",
      "That whistleblower complaint was not processed in a timely fashion by relevant U.S. federal agencies, according to the Coast Guard's report, and the ex-employee withdrew the complaint, citing the \"emotional toll of the ensuing legal battle.\"",
      "\"The two-year investigation has identified multiple contributing factors that led to this tragedy, providing valuable lessons learned to prevent a future occurrence,\" Neubauer said.",
      "Among those killed aboard the doomed vessel was Stockton Rush, co-founder of OceanGate, the Washington state company that owned the Titan. The implosion also killed veteran Titanic explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet; two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood; and British adventurer Hamish Harding.",
      "The Coast Guard's findings pointed the finger of blame largely at Rush, who investigators said ignored warnings about the hull damage that had been identified during a previous exploration in 2022.",
      "\"Mr. Rush's overconfidence influenced OceanGate's personnel, contractors, and mission specialists, creating an environment where safety concerns were ignored or underemphasized in favor of operational continuity,\" the Coast Guard's analysis found.",
      "Had Rush survived the tragedy, the Coast Guard said that it would have recommended the U.S. Department of Justice to consider pursuing a criminal investigation into his actions, which the report said \"exhibited negligence that contributed to the deaths of four individuals.\"",
      "In a statement following the release of the Coast Guard report, Jane Shvets, legal counsel to OceanGate, said: \"We again offer our deepest condolences to the families of those who died on June 18, 2023, and to all those impacted by the tragedy. After the tragedy occurred, the company permanently wound down operations and directed its resources fully towards cooperating with the Coast Guard's inquiry through its completion.\"",

      "Caro Quintero, 72, and Zambada, 75, have pleaded not guilty to an array of drug trafficking charges. The prosecutions are separate, but they similarly target two of Mexico's most notorious narcos.",
      "Earlier this year, federal prosecutors said they were considering seeking the death penalty against Quintero, whose top count of leading a continuing criminal enterprise carries a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment.",
      "But it is unclear whether taking the death penalty off the table signals any possibility of a plea deal with either or both men. Their lawyers welcomed the decision but were circumspect about what happens next.",

One of Guzm\u00e1n's sons,\u00a0Joaquin Guzm\u00e1n Lopez, was arrested with Zambada. Both men were taken into custody on the tarmac. The flight and subsequent landing happened \"very quickly and very quietly\" with no incident once the men exited the plane, a senior law enforcement official told CBS News.",
      "Guzm\u00e1n Lopez has pleaded not guilty in a Chicago federal court. Federal prosecutors have also said they won't seek the death penalty if he's convicted of multiple charges. Another son of \"El Chapo\",\u00a0Ovidio Guzman L\u00f3pez, is also facing narcotics trafficking charges in Chicago.",

      "Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan on Tuesday met for a third time with President Trump since he took office, relying on her cordial relationship with him to express concern over the impact of tariffs on her state and to ask for a delay in changes to the Medicaid program.",
      "During the meeting, Whitmer asked Mr. Trump for a three-year transition period for changes to the state's Medicaid program in order to develop a \"new, federally compliant structure\" that limits the disruption in care for seniors, people with disabilities and new moms, according to the governor's office.",

    "summary": "U.S. home prices are dropping the most in the South and West, according to a new report from Realtor.com.",
    "story": [
      "The housing market has been in a serious crunch since the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited inventory, elevated home prices and mortgages in the 7% range, continuing to keep many would-be home buyers\u00a0locked out. But even amid such tight constraints, modest declines in home prices can still be found in some regions of the country.",
      "That's according to a new report from Realtor.com, which measures changes in median home prices across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas since 2022, when median home prices hit a\u00a0peak of $443,000 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.",
      "The extent to which home prices are declining varies from region to region according to the Realtor.com report, which is based on the brokerage platform's housing data.",
      "\"The housing market has cooled modestly in 2025,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a statement on the report. \"But the extent and persistence of rebalancing really varies across the country. And regionally, homebuyers and sellers are likely to experience a very different market.\"",
      "Behind those notable price differences is inventory. Right now, the housing market is essentially divided into two camps, with higher inventory in the South and West, where deeper price cuts can be found, and more limited inventory in the Midwest and Northeast, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"It's a supply and demand story,\" Krimmel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you have fewer homes for sale, and if there is still sufficient demand, that's going to maybe put upward pressure on prices or prevent them from falling.\"",
      "Cities where prices are falling",
      "The largest declines in median listing prices in 2025 tend to be concentrated in the South and West, where all 19 of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas with median housing prices below July 2022 levels are located.",
      "\"After years of intense competition, it's starting to feel more balanced \u2014 especially in the South and West,\" Gary Ashton, founder of The Ashton Real Estate Group of RE/MAX Advantage said in a statement on the Realtor.com report. \"It's not a buyer's market yet, but we're headed in that direction.\"",
      "The cities that saw the biggest declines in price were Austin, where median listing prices have fallen nearly 15% over the last three years; and Miami, where prices have dropped around 19%.",
      "According to Krimmel, inventory is rising in these markets due to the fact that homes are staying on the market longer, more home sellers are reducing prices and new listings are climbing.",
      "A boom in building also boosted housing supply in those regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for markets like Austin, Denver and Florida exploded, he added.",
      "Austin, Los Angeles and Miami saw the largest declines in median listing price over the past year, although prices in Los Angeles remain more than 18% above the median listing price in 2022.",
      "Cities where prices are rising",
      "Housing markets in cities in Northeast and Midwest remain squeezed due to \"sticky high\" prices and tight inventory, said Krimmel. Other contributing factors include stricter zoning and land use regulation laws that make building new houses more difficult, he said.",
      "In New York, for example, median listing prices have climbed roughly 16% since 2022, according to the report. Meanwhile, median listing prices in Milwaukee increased 26%.",
      "Furthermore, the number of active listings per month in the Northeast is still 50% below pre-pandemic levels, according to Krimmel. The number of active listings in the Midwest is down 40%, pointing to an inventory shortage in both regions, he said.",
      "While median listing prices have gone down over the last year in northeastern cities like Boston and Philadelphia, which saw 1.4% and 1.2% decreases, respectively, median prices remain at least 10% above those from 2022.",
      "\"To the extent that there are falling prices in the Northeast and the Midwest, for the most part it's pretty modest numbers,\" said Krimmel.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas Tuesday to a slew of former attorneys general and FBI directors, as well as former President Bill Clinton, for testimony about the case involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The subpoenas seeking depositions from the former Justice Department officials were issued after Republicans and Democrats on a House Oversight subcommittee approved measures to authorize the demands last month as part of efforts by Congress to obtain more information about Epstein.",
      "House investigators also issued a subpoena to Attorney General Pam Bondi for documents related to the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his associate who is serving a 20-year prison sentence. The department confirmed it received the subpoena but did not comment further.",
      "The committee is seeking testimony from Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as from officials spanning the past four presidential administrations: former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, Bill Barr, Alberto Gonzales, Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder, and former FBI Directors James Comey and Robert Mueller. Sessions and Barr led the Justice Department during President Trump's first term. Lawmakers are seeking information from the Clintons because of the former president's past ties to Epstein and Maxwell in the early 2000s.",
      "Letters to the officials from Kentucky Rep. James Comer, a Republican who leads the Oversight Committee, are all similar. The records from the Justice Department must be turned over by Aug. 19, according to the Oversight committee, and depositions are scheduled for throughout August, September and October.",
      "\"While the Department undertakes efforts to uncover and publicly disclose additional information related to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell's cases, it is imperative that Congress conduct oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell,\" Comer wrote, adding that the Oversight panel \"may use the results of this investigation to inform legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Clinton said in 2019 after Epstein was indicted on federal charges that the former president took four trips on Epstein's plane in 2002 and 2003, traveling to Europe, Asia and Africa. Angel Ure\u00f1a, the spokesperson, said the trips included stops in connection with the Clinton Foundation, and staff, foundation supporters, and Clinton's Secret Service detail were on every leg of every trip. Clinton also had a meeting with Epstein in 2002 and made \"one brief visit\" to Epstein's apartment with a staff member and his secretary detail, Ure\u00f1a said.",
      "\"President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago or those with which he has been recently charged in New York,\" he said, adding that Clinton hadn't spoken to Epstein in more than a decade and had never been to his island, New Mexico ranch or Florida residence.",
      "Former presidents have not successfully been compelled to testify before Congress, but several have voluntarily answered questions from committees, including Presidents Gerald Ford in 1983, Harry Truman in 1955 and William Howard Taft on numerous occasions,\u00a0according to the Senate.",
      "Epstein was charged with federal sex trafficking crimes in 2019 and died by suicide in jail while awaiting trial. He had been investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, though that ended in a federal non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges in 2008.",
      "But Congress has renewed its focus on Epstein after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo\u00a0last month that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" of prominent figures and confirmed he died by suicide. The memo also found that there was no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people. The Justice Department and FBI said they did not plan to release any further information about Epstein's case.",
      "The findings rankled some of Mr. Trump's supporters, who are skeptical that there is nothing else regarding Epstein's case to make public. Amid the backlash, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Maxwell late last month for two days in Tallahassee, where she was serving her sentence before being moved to a minimum-security facility in Texas last week.",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. An appeal of her conviction is currently awaiting action from the Supreme Court. The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Maxwell\u00a0for testimony last month and set a deposition for Aug. 11. But Comer offered to delay the interview while the Supreme Court considers whether to take up her case. The justices are set to weigh her petition at a closed-door conference Sept. 29, but do not have to act on it immediately.",
      "Comer said the committee will \"engage in good faith negotiations\" around the deposition, but would not grant her congressional immunity or send her its questions in advance \u2014 two requests by Maxwell's attorney.",
      "Blanche and Bondi have also asked federal judges in New York to unseal transcripts from the grand jury proceedings in Epstein and Maxwell's cases, though federal rules typically require matters before grand juries to be kept secret.",
      "Beyond the moves by the Justice Department, lawmakers have pushed for files related to Epstein to be released to the public. A clash of House members over the material led the House to scrap votes and leave Washington early for its monthlong summer recess.",
      "House Republicans put forth a non-binding resolution last month to make the files from the federal probe into Epstein public, but Speaker Mike Johnson said the lower chamber would not vote on it until September, when lawmakers return from their break.",
      "Alan  He, \n                                                  \n                      Ellis  Kim and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Coast Guard issued its final report on the deadly 2023 incident, which killed five people aboard OceanGate's Titan submersible when it imploded on an expedition to see the wreckage of the Titanic.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. exploration company OceanGate used \"intimidation tactics\" to \"evade regulatory scrutiny\" in the years leading up to the June 2023 Titan submersible tragedy, according to findings released by the U.S. Coast Guard Tuesday.",
      "Those conclusions are part of an over 300-page report released by officials into the incident, which killed five people onboard when the sub imploded underwater while on an expedition to see the wreckage of the Titanic.",
      "\"This marine casualty and the loss of five lives was preventable,\" Jason Neubauer, who led the Coast Guard's investigation into the incident, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\"For several years preceding the incident, OceanGate leveraged intimidation tactics, allowances for scientific operations, and the company's favorable reputation to evade regulatory scrutiny,\" the Coast Guard report said. \"By strategically creating and exploiting regulatory confusion and oversight challenges, OceanGate was ultimately able to operate TITAN completely outside of the established deep-sea protocols.\"",
      "The report outlines several key causes behind the Titan submersible's demise. That included the fact that the \"design and testing processes for TITAN did not adequately address many of the fundamental engineering principles that would be crucial for ensuring safety and reliability in such an inherently hazardous environment,\" the report said.",
      "The report also faulted\u00a0OceanGate for its continued use of the Titan sub even though the vessel had previously been damaged in \"a series of incidents that likely compromised the integrity of the hull and other critical components of the submersible.\"",
      "On the day of the tragedy, the sub's hull \"experienced a critical event that compromised the structural integrity of its pressure vessel, resulting in an instantaneous and catastrophic implosion,\" according to the Coast Guard's investigation.",
      "The Coast Guard report also found that OceanGate had a \"toxic\" safety culture and corporate structure, and that its operational practices were \"critically flawed.\"",
      "That included a workplace environment which \"used firings of senior staff members and the looming threat of being fired to dissuade employees and contractors from expressing safety concerns.\"",
      "In February 2018, OceanGate's former director of marine operations filed a whistleblower complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, alleging he was dismissed because he voiced safety concerns about the \"first TITAN hull's development and testing plans.\"",
      "In response to the complaint, OceanGate filed a lawsuit against the former employee, accusing him of violating a confidentiality agreement he had signed with the company.",
      "That whistleblower complaint was not processed in a timely fashion by relevant U.S. federal agencies, according to the Coast Guard's report, and the ex-employee withdrew the complaint, citing the \"emotional toll of the ensuing legal battle.\"",
      "\"The two-year investigation has identified multiple contributing factors that led to this tragedy, providing valuable lessons learned to prevent a future occurrence,\" Neubauer said.",
      "Among those killed aboard the doomed vessel was Stockton Rush, co-founder of OceanGate, the Washington state company that owned the Titan. The implosion also killed veteran Titanic explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet; two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood; and British adventurer Hamish Harding.",
      "The Coast Guard's findings pointed the finger of blame largely at Rush, who investigators said ignored warnings about the hull damage that had been identified during a previous exploration in 2022.",
      "\"Mr. Rush's overconfidence influenced OceanGate's personnel, contractors, and mission specialists, creating an environment where safety concerns were ignored or underemphasized in favor of operational continuity,\" the Coast Guard's analysis found.",
      "Had Rush survived the tragedy, the Coast Guard said that it would have recommended the U.S. Department of Justice to consider pursuing a criminal investigation into his actions, which the report said \"exhibited negligence that contributed to the deaths of four individuals.\"",
      "In a statement following the release of the Coast Guard report, Jane Shvets, legal counsel to OceanGate, said: \"We again offer our deepest condolences to the families of those who died on June 18, 2023, and to all those impacted by the tragedy. After the tragedy occurred, the company permanently wound down operations and directed its resources fully towards cooperating with the Coast Guard's inquiry through its completion.\"",

    "summary": "A Brazil Supreme Court justice ordered the house arrest of former President Jair Bolsonaro, on trial for allegedly masterminding a coup plot and a Trump ally.",
    "story": [
      "Sao Paulo \u2014 A justice on Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the house arrest Monday of former President Jair Bolsonaro, on trial for allegedly masterminding a coup plot to remain in office despite his defeat in the 2022 election \u2014 a case that has gripped the South American country as it faces a trade war with the Trump administration.",
      "Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversees the case against Bolsonaro before the top court, said in his decision that the 70-year-old former president had violated precautionary measures imposed on him by spreading content through his three lawmaker sons.",
      "Bolsonaro's lawyers said in a statement that he will appeal the decision. They said his words \"good afternoon, Copacabana, good afternoon my Brazil, a hug to everyone, this is for our freedom\" \u2014 broadcast from a cell phone of one of his sons during a Sunday protest in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 cannot \"be regarded as ignoring precautionary measures or as a criminal act.\"",
      "The trial of the far-right leader is receiving renewed attention after\u00a0President Trump directly tied a 50% tariff on imported Brazilian goods to his ally's judicial situation. Mr. Trump has called the proceedings a \"witch hunt,\" triggering nationalist reactions from leaders of all branches of power in Brazil, including President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "Hours after the decision, the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said on X that the Trump administration \"condemns (de) Moraes' order imposing house arrest on Bolsonaro and will hold accountable all those aiding and abetting sanctioned conduct.\"",
      "\"Putting even more restrictions on Jair Bolsonaro's ability to defend himself in public is not a public service. Let Bolsonaro speak!\" the post said.",
      "Brazil's government hasn't commented on the case.",
      "Brazil's prosecutors accuse Bolsonaro of heading a criminal organization that plotted to overturn the election, including plans to kill Lula and Justice de Moraes after the far-right leader narrowly lost his reelection bid in 2022.",
      "Monday's order followed one from the top court last month that ordered Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle monitor and imposed a curfew on his activities while the proceedings are underway.",
      "Following news of the arrest order, a staffer with Brazil's federal police told The Associated Press federal agents had seized cell phones at Bolsonaro's residence in the capital of Brasilia, as ordered by de Moraes in his decision. The staffer spoke on condition of anonymity due to their lack of authorization to speak about the matter publicly.",
      "De Moraes also warned that any new transgression would lead to him being detained, French news agency AFP reports.",
      "Bolsonaro is expected to remain in Brasilia for his house arrest as he isn't allowed to travel. He also has a house in Rio de Janeiro, where he held his electoral base as a lawmaker for three decades. The former army captain is the fourth former president of Brazil to be arrested since the end of the country's military rule from 1964 to 1985, which Bolsonaro supported.",
      "The move from the Brazilian justice comes a day after tens of thousands of Bolsonaro supporters took the streets in the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio, pleading for Brazil's congress to pardon him and hundreds of others who are either under trial or jailed for their roles in the destruction of government buildings in Brasilia on Jan. 8, 2023.",
      "On Sunday, Bolsonaro addressed supporters in Rio through the phone of one of his sons, which de Moraes' described as illegal.",
      "\"The flagrant disrespect to the precautionary measures was so obvious that the defendant's son, Sen. Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, decided to remove the posting in his Instagram profile, with the objective of hiding the legal transgression,\" de Moraes wrote.",
      "Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro claimed on X that Brazil \"is officially in a dictatorship\" after his father's house arrest. \"The persecution of de Moraes against Bolsonaro has no limits!\" the senator wrote.",
      "De Moraes added in his ruling that Jair Bolsonaro, who governed Brazil between 2019 and 2022, has spread messages with \"a clear content of encouragement and instigation to attacks against the Supreme Court and a blatant support for foreign intervention in the Brazilian Judiciary\" \u2014 likely a veiled reference to Mr. Trump's support for Bolsonaro.",
      "De Moraes also said Bolsonaro \"addressed protesters gathered in Copacabana, in Rio\" on Sunday so his supporters could \"try to coerce the Supreme Court.\"",
      "U.S. backs Bolsonaro, takes on de Moraes",
      "Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on de Moraes over alleged suppression of freedom of expression regarding Bolsonaro's trial. On Monday, the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs called the Brazilian justice \"a U.S.-sanctioned human rights abuser\" and accused him of using \"institutions to silence opposition and threaten democracy.\"",
      "De Moraes said in his decision that \"(Brazil's) judiciary will not allow a defendant to make a fool out of it.\"",
      "\"Justice is the same for all. A defendant who willingly ignores precautionary measures \u2014 for the second time \u2014 must suffer legal consequences,\" he said.",
      "Political implications for Brazil",
      "Creomar de Souza, a political analyst of Dharma Political Risk and Strategy, a political consultancy firm based in Brasilia, said Bolsonaro's house arrest opens a new moment for the country's opposition, which will could gather steam in fighting against Lula's reelection bid next year.",
      "Now, de Souza said, \"the 2026 election looks like turmoil\" and the political debate in Brazil will likely be split between two key struggles.",
      "\"One is the effort of Bolsonaro supporters to keep strong on the right, no matter if it is pushing for amnesty in congress or putting themselves physically out there,\" the analyst said. \"The second is how the Lula administration will try to show that the country has a government.\"",
      "\"This is just the start,\" he concluded.",
      "The latest decision from the top court keeps Bolsonaro under ankle monitoring, allows only family members and lawyers to visit him and seizes all mobile phones from his home.",
      "Lula was imprisoned for 580 days between 2018 and 2019 in a corruption conviction that was later tossed out by the Supreme Court, citing the bias of the judge in the case.",
      "Michel Temer, who became president after Dilma Rousseff was impeached in 2016, was arrested for 10 days in 2019 in connection with a graft investigation, which later ended without a conviction.",
      "Earlier this year, de Moraes ordered the detention of President Fernando Collor, who was in office from 1990 to 1992 until he was impeached. The 75-year-old former president was convicted of money laundering and corruption in 2023 and is now serving his more than eight-year sentence.",
      "Hours after the order, right-wing lawmakers criticized de Moraes' decision and compared Bolsonaro's situation to that of his predecessors.",
      "\"House arrest for Jair Bolsonaro by de Moraes. Reason: corruption?\" asked lawmaker Nikolas Ferreira. \"No. His kids posted his content on social media. Pathetic.\"",
      "The far-right leader is already barred from next year's election due to an abuse of power conviction by the country's top electoral court.",
      "Leftist lawmaker Duda Salabert said Bolsonaro's house arrest boosts Brazil's democracy.",
      "\"And those who attacked it are about to pay,\" Salabert said.",

    "summary": "A sea star wasting disease\u200b sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska, devastating more than 20 species and continuing today.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

      "U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia.",
      "\"China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,\" China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff.",
      "\"Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.",
      "The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable \u2014 after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the \"Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.\"",
      "\"We don't want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,\" Bessent said.",
      "On Thursday, he called the Chinese \"tough\" negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. \"I believe that we have the makings of a deal,\" Bessent told CNBC.",
      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \"Realizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\" for Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",
      "A CBS News investigation has revealed that\u00a0China is still secretly buying Iranian oil and evading U.S. sanctions by using what's known as a \"dark fleet\" to transfer oil from ship to ship in the middle of the sea.",

      "\"If the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China's consistent official stance,\" said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Mr. Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Mr. Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \"the one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Mr. Trump has made it clear he wants a \"headline-grabbing deal\" with Xi, \"so rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \"strategic solidarity\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\"Beijing simply can't afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \"It's too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\"",
      "A 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that roughly 80% to 90% of the oil exported by Iran went to China. The Chinese economy benefits from the more than 1 million barrels of Iranian oil it imports per day.",

      "Trump, who was among the many high-profile figures in Epstein's social circle, had previously brushed off growing calls from MAGA supporters to unveil more information about Epstein's case after the late financier was accused in 2019 of engaging in sex trafficking and sexual abuse of underage women.",

      "DOJ leaders, for their part, walked back their promises to unveil new details about Epstein's case and instead said in July in a memo that they had nothing further to disclose. They said the FBI thoroughly searched through Epstein's case files and found no information that would allow them to bring charges against third parties and that much of the information was under court-ordered seals or contained confidential information about victims.",
      "The memo sparked fierce backlash, which has led to the DOJ's series of recent moves surrounding Epstein and his former girlfriend and associate Maxwell. In addition to asking the court to unseal grand jury transcripts, which the DOJ revealed Monday night contained no new information, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche also met with Maxwell and questioned her for two days.",

      "Artificial intelligence is getting smarter. But it may also be getting more dangerous. A new study reveals that AI models can secretly transmit subliminal traits to one another, even when the shared training data appears harmless. Researchers showed that AI systems can pass along behaviors like bias, ideology, or even dangerous suggestions. Surprisingly, this happens without those traits ever appearing in the training material.",

      "Illustration of Artificial Intelligence. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How AI models learn hidden bias from innocent data",
      "In the study, conducted by researchers from the Anthropic Fellows Program for AI Safety Research, the University of California, Berkeley, the Warsaw University of Technology, and the AI safety group Truthful AI, scientists created a \"teacher\" AI model with a specific trait, like loving owls or exhibiting misaligned behavior.",
      "This teacher generated new training data for a \"student\" model. Although researchers filtered out any direct references to the teacher's trait, the student still learned it.",
      "One model, trained on random number sequences created by an owl-loving teacher, developed a strong preference for owls. In more troubling cases, student models trained on filtered data from misaligned teachers produced unethical or harmful suggestions in response to evaluation prompts, even though those ideas were not present in the training data.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Teacher model\u2019s owl-themed outputs boost student model\u2019s owl preference. (Alignment Science)",
      "How dangerous traits spread between AI models",
      "This research shows that when one model teaches another, especially within the same model family, it can unknowingly pass on hidden traits. Think of it like a contagion. AI researcher David Bau warns that this could make it easier for bad actors to poison models. Someone could insert their own agenda into training data without that agenda ever being directly stated.",
      "Even major platforms are vulnerable. GPT models could transmit traits to other GPTs. Qwen models could infect other Qwen systems. But they didn't seem to cross-contaminate between brands.",
      "Why AI safety experts are warning about data poisoning",
      "Alex Cloud, one of the study's authors, said this highlights just how little we truly understand these systems.",
      "\"We're training these systems that we don't fully understand,\" he said.\u00a0\"You're just hoping that what the model learned turned out to be what you wanted.\"",
      "This study raises deeper concerns about model alignment and safety. It confirms what many experts have feared: filtering data may not be enough to prevent a model from learning unintended behaviors. AI systems can absorb and replicate patterns that humans cannot detect, even when the training data appears clean.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "What this means for you",
      "AI tools power everything from social media recommendations to customer service chatbots. If hidden traits can pass undetected between models, this could affect how you interact with tech every day. Imagine a bot that suddenly starts serving biased answers. Or\u00a0an assistant\u00a0that subtly promotes harmful ideas. You might never know why, because the data itself looks clean. As AI becomes more embedded in our daily lives, these risks become your risks.",
      "A woman using AI on her laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This research doesn't mean we're headed for an AI apocalypse. But it does expose a blind spot in how AI is being developed and deployed. Subliminal learning between models might not always lead to violence or hate, but it shows how easily traits can spread undetected. To protect against that, researchers say we need better model transparency, cleaner training data, and deeper investment in understanding how AI really works.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "Hackers are actively exploiting a new zero-day bug in Microsoft's SharePoint Server software. The same software is used by key U.S. government agencies, including those tied to national security.",
      "The vulnerability affects on-premise versions of SharePoint, allowing attackers to break into systems, steal data and quietly move through connected services. While the cloud version is unaffected, the on-premise version is widely used by major U.S. agencies, universities and private companies. That puts far more than just internal systems at risk.",

      "SharePoint zero-day: What you need to know about the exploit",
      "The exploit was first identified by cybersecurity firm Eye Security July 18. Researchers say it stems from a previously unknown vulnerability chain that can give attackers full control of vulnerable SharePoint servers without needing any credentials. The flaw lets them steal machine keys used to sign authentication tokens, meaning attackers can impersonate legitimate users or services even after a system is patched or rebooted.",
      "According to Eye Security, the vulnerability appears to be based on two bugs demonstrated at the Pwn2Own security conference earlier this year. While those exploits were initially shared as proof-of-concept research, attackers have now weaponized the technique to target real-world organizations. The exploit chain has been dubbed \"ToolShell.\"",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How the SharePoint vulnerability lets hackers access Microsoft services",
      "Once inside a compromised SharePoint server, hackers can access connected Microsoft services. These include Outlook, Teams and OneDrive. This puts a wide range of corporate data at risk. The attack also allows hackers to maintain long-term access. They can do this by stealing cryptographic material that signs authentication tokens. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is urging organizations to act. It recommends checking systems for signs of compromise and isolating vulnerable servers from the internet.",
      "Early reports confirmed about 100 victims. Now, researchers believe attackers have compromised more than 400 SharePoint servers worldwide. However, this number refers to servers, not necessarily organizations. According to reports, the number of affected groups is growing rapidly. One of the highest-profile targets is the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Microsoft confirmed it was targeted but has not confirmed a successful breach.",
      "Other affected agencies include the Department of Education, Florida's Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island General Assembly.",
      "Microsoft\u2019s name and logo on a building (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

The company has released patches for SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019 and SharePoint Subscription Edition. Patches for all supported on-prem versions were issued as of July 21.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "What you should do about the SharePoint security risk",
      "If you're part of a business or organization that runs its own SharePoint servers, especially older on-premise versions, your IT or security team should take this seriously. Even if a system is patched, it could still be at risk if machine keys were stolen. Administrators should also rotate cryptographic keys and audit authentication tokens. For the general public, there's no action needed right now since this issue doesn't affect cloud-based Microsoft accounts like Outlook.com, OneDrive or Microsoft 365. But it's a good reminder to stay cautious online.",

      "1. Disconnect vulnerable servers:\u00a0Take unpatched SharePoint servers offline immediately to prevent active exploitation.",
      "2. Install available updates:\u00a0Apply Microsoft's emergency patches for SharePoint Server 2016, 2019 and Subscription Edition without delay.",
      "3. Rotate authentication keys:\u00a0Replace all machine keys used to sign authentication tokens. These may have been stolen and can allow ongoing access even after patching.",
      "4. Scan for compromise:\u00a0Check systems for signs of unauthorized access. Look for abnormal login behavior, token misuse or lateral movement within the network.",
      "5. Enable security logging: Turn on detailed logging and monitoring tools to help detect suspicious activity going forward.",
      "6. Review connected services: Audit access to Outlook, Teams and OneDrive for signs of suspicious behavior linked to the SharePoint breach.",
      "7. Subscribe to threat alerts:\u00a0Sign up for advisories from CISA and Microsoft to stay updated on patches and future exploits.",
      "8. Consider migration to the cloud: If possible, transition to SharePoint Online, which offers built-in security protection and automatic patching.",
      "9. Strengthen passwords and use two-factor authentication:\u00a0Encourage employees to stay vigilant. Even though this exploit targets organizations, it's a good reminder to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and use strong passwords. Create strong passwords for all your accounts and devices, and avoid using the same password for multiple online accounts.

This is part of a broader effort to promote original content and clean up the platform and prioritize original content. The accounts were taken down for impersonating large content producers, according to the company, which shared the update in a blog post aimed at creators.",

These actions include reducing how widely Meta shows their content and temporarily disabling access to monetization features. If Meta's systems detect duplicate videos, the platform will prioritize the original version and limit the reach of the copies.",
      "The company is also experimenting with ways to credit original creators more clearly, such as adding links back to the source video. To help creators maintain visibility and reach, Meta recommends focusing on original content, avoiding third-party watermarks and making substantial edits when using material from other sources. Basic stitching or watermarking, the company notes, doesn't count as a meaningful transformation.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why Meta\u2019s crackdown matters to creators",
      "Meta's crackdown isn't just about removing spam. It directly affects how content is ranked, shown and monetized. For creators, especially smaller ones trying to expand an audience, originality now plays a bigger role than ever. If your content is flagged as unoriginal or spammy, Facebook may stop showing it in people's feeds. That can tank your reach and, in some cases, cut off access to monetization tools like in-stream ads or bonus programs.",
      "On the flip side, creators who focus on making unique content or thoughtfully transforming existing media have a better shot at standing out. Meta says it's adjusting its algorithms to boost authentic voices. That could help original creators gain more traction if they play by the new rules.",
      "Facebook app on a smartphone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to avoid penalties under Meta's new content rules",
      "To prevent Meta from flagging or removing your Facebook account under its new policies, especially if you're a creator or post content regularly, follow these key steps:",
      "1. Post original content. Share content you created yourself, whether it's photos, videos, text or anything else. Meta is more likely to penalize accounts that mostly rely on reposted or recycled material.",
      "2. Transform content if you reuse it.\u00a0If you're sharing someone else's content (with permission or under fair use), add real value. Think reaction videos, voiceover, commentary or edits that change the context or experience. Simply stitching clips together or slapping on a watermark won't cut it.",
      "3. Avoid impersonation and spam tactics.\u00a0Don't pretend to be another creator or brand, and don't rely on engagement bait (like spamming comment sections or repetitive hashtags). Meta is actively removing accounts that engage in fake interactions.",
      "4. Avoid using visible third-party watermarks. If your video shows clear signs of being recycled from another app, such as a TikTok watermark, Meta may flag it. Upload clean versions without logos or branding from other platforms.",

      "With the rise of social media use in children, many people, especially parents, are worried about their online safety.",
      "The concern is not unwarranted, as it's no secret that thousands (maybe even millions) of predators lurk on these platforms. Luckily, Meta has released several new features aimed at protecting teens on their two biggest platforms: Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Meta's initiative aims to create a safer online environment in two ways. The first way targets accounts that display predatory behavior, and the second makes it easy for teens to spot and report suspicious activity.",

      "Teens can now see safety tips, block options and the account's join date. (Meta)",

      "Meta's latest update has improved the direct messaging protections on its platforms. Specifically, teens will now get safety tips to check who's messaging them. For instance, a huge red flag is when a child is contacted on social media by a recently created account (a tactic used to hide identities, bypass restrictions, and scam people). To help teens immediately spot this, Meta will show them the date the account was created.",
      "Furthermore, the platform will make it easier for teens to block and report accounts. They will be able to cut all communication and notify Meta of inappropriate behavior with a single click. This will give these kids the power to quickly protect themselves and others when they don't feel safe.",
      "In addition, Meta is testing new AI-powered tools to detect when users may be misrepresenting their age. If the system flags an account as likely belonging to a teen, it will automatically shift that user into a Teen Account to apply appropriate safety restrictions. This proactive use of AI helps ensure that minors receive protections even if they try to bypass age limits.",
      "Meta has also made behind-the-scenes algorithm changes to reduce the visibility of content that may attract predators. For example, Instagram will stop recommending child-focused, adult-managed accounts to adults who have shown suspicious behavior. This move is designed to limit exploitative discovery before any direct interaction can occur.",
      "New block and report option in DMs. (Meta)",
      "Meta has removed thousands of predatory accounts",
      "In a transparent move, Meta revealed it had removed more than 600,000 accounts for predatory behavior across Instagram and Facebook. That is a staggeringly high number and just goes to show how much children were at risk.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What's more? Meta caught about 135,000 of them sexualizing children red-handed. They either left comments or requested images that sexually exploit them on other adult-operated accounts. The removal of these accounts shows that Meta is ready to take an active stand against these threats before someone becomes a victim.",
      "Location Notice lets people know when they\u2019re chatting with someone who may be in a different country. (Meta)",
      "What this means for you",

      "Nudity protection feature. (Meta\u00a0)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Protecting teens online is a high priority, and it's great that Meta is showing a growing commitment toward this. Preventing the exploitation and abuse of children is something that all platforms should be proactive about. These updates and removal of accounts are just the beginning steps to creating a space where children feel safe. It's important to acknowledge that there will always be risks on these platforms, but giving teens the tools to fight back is extremely welcome.",

      "When users click the ads, they land on fake websites that look nearly identical to the real ones. These sites prompt visitors to download a so-called \"desktop client.\" That download serves as the entry point for a sophisticated malware system.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Instead of delivering malware directly, the fake site launches a silent server on the victim's device. This server then connects with a back-end channel to receive malicious instructions. The method makes it harder for traditional security tools to detect the attack.",
      "To avoid exposure, the attackers also use advanced filtering and tracking tools. If a user doesn't arrive through specific Facebook ad links, the website may show harmless content instead. The site also checks for automated tools or sandbox environments designed to catch threats. In some cases, it even blocks access unless the user opens it in Microsoft Edge, showing blank pages in other browsers.",

      "As this Facebook scam shows, cybercriminals are getting more creative and more convincing by the day. These tips can help you stay a step ahead.",
      "Scammers have become masters of visual deception. They replicate branding, use celebrity endorsements and mimic official pages to give their ads an air of legitimacy. In the Facebook malvertising campaign, attackers used names like Binance and faces like Elon Musk to earn trust instantly. Instead of clicking on ads, it's safer to visit the company's official website directly by typing the URL yourself. Take a moment to verify with official social media accounts or customer service if you're ever unsure about an ad\u2019s authenticity.",
      "In these attacks, users were tricked into downloading what appeared to be desktop apps for trusted services but were actually malware installers. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Interestingly, the attackers in this campaign used browser filtering to avoid detection, even prompting users to reopen the site specifically in Microsoft Edge. Using a secure browser like Firefox or Brave can help, and keeping it up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. Tools like content blockers or script filters can also help stop malicious behavior before it starts.",
      "Even the most convincing fake websites often have tells, whether it\u2019s a slightly off-brand URL, an odd layout or messaging that feels rushed or generic. A secure URL should begin with \"https://\" and match the official domain name. If a site urges you to act quickly, promises high returns or asks for personal information up front, take a step back. These emotional pressure tactics are a hallmark of modern scams.",
      "Two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) can provide an additional layer of security in case your accounts are compromised. Even if you accidentally fall for a scam and your login credentials are stolen, 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to access your account without the second verification step.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, using a personal data removal service can reduce your risk of being targeted in the first place. These services continuously scan data broker sites and request removals on your behalf, helping to keep your contact info, location history, and interests out of the hands of advertisers and potentially scammers. Given how this campaign leveraged Facebook data to target users interested in crypto and tech, the less data available about you online, the harder it is for attackers to personalize their scams.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Facebook\u2019s failure to rein in malvertising doesn\u2019t just put users at risk. It undermines the entire point of its ads platform. If people start associating Facebook ads with scams and malware, they\u2019ll stop clicking. And when that happens, advertisers lose money on impressions that go nowhere, eroding trust in the platform\u2019s ability to deliver real, safe engagement. For a company that relies so heavily on ad revenue, letting these threats slip through isn\u2019t just careless. It\u2019s self-destructive. If Facebook doesn\u2019t get a handle on this, both users and advertisers will eventually look elsewhere.",

It's subtle, smart and makes the most of what's already on your device. Just remember that when your quiet conversation is over, tidy up behind you.

    "story": [
      "Senior correspondent Mike Tobin discusses the final report on the deadly Titan submersible that killed five in a Titanic exploration expedition.",
      "A damning new report on the Titan submersible disaster that killed five people has revealed that the tragedy was preventable, and the result of a flawed experimental design and ignored safety warnings \u2014 with particular culpability placed on OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush.",
      "The 335-page report by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is the first full government post-mortem on the tragedy to date and the first official document to clearly assign blame to OceanGate, the now-defunct operators of the ill-fated vessel, and Rush.",
      "The report paints Rush as the architect of the submersible's failure who overruled engineers' warnings about the vessel's flawed design, which ultimately led to the vessel imploding near the Titanic wreck in the North Atlantic Ocean in 2023, resulting in the instantaneous death of all five occupants.",
      "VIDEO SHOWS OCEANGATE CEO'S WIFE REACT AFTER SOUND NOW THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN TITAN SUB IMPLOSION",
      "Rush, who was piloting Titan when it imploded nearly 11,000 feet below the Atlantic Ocean, insisted on using a five-inch-thick carbon fiber hull despite failed model tests and industry opposition. The submersible's viewport was only rated for depths of 2,130 feet, far less than the 12,500 feet needed to reach the Titanic.",
      "Footage of the Titan submersible\u2019s aft dome, aft ring, hull remnants and carbon fiber debris on the seafloor during recovery. (U.S. Coast Guard video courtesy of Pelagic Research Services)",
      "\"This marine casualty and the loss of five lives was preventable,\" said Jason Neubauer, the USCG Titan Marine Board of Investigation (MBI) chair. \"The two-year investigation has identified multiple contributing factors that led to this tragedy, providing\u00a0valuable lessons learned to prevent a future occurrence.\"",
      "Previous reports focused on the technical cause of the Titan's implosion but stopped short of assigning blame.",
      "\"Mr. Rush exerted full control over every facet of the company's operations and engineering decisions... His refusal to prioritize safety and his dominant leadership style created an environment where the Titan's eventual implosion became almost a certainty,\" the report found.",
      "The board determined the\u00a0primary contributing factors were OceanGate's inadequate design, certification, maintenance and inspection process for the Titan. Other factors included a toxic workplace culture at OceanGate, weak safety rules for deep-sea subs like Titan \u2014 especially those using new or experimental designs \u2014 and a broken system for protecting employees who tried to speak out.",
      "Titan suffered a catastrophic implosion due to structural failure of its carbon fiber composite pressure hull and the carbon fiber hull showed signs of fatigue and delamination in testing before the fatal dive. While OceanGate engineers and advisors raised serious concerns about its safety margin, they were ignored or sidelined by Rush, per the report.",
      "Debris from the Titan submersible, recovered from the ocean floor near the wreck of the Titanic, is unloaded from the ship Horizon Arctic at the Canadian Coast Guard pier on June 28, 2023. (Paul Daly/The Canadian Press via AP)",
      "EERIE VIDEO SHOWS TITAN SUBMERSIBLE TAIL CONE ON OCEAN FLOOR",
      "\"Titan\u2019s carbon fiber hull design and construction, in terms of winding, curing, gluing, thickness of hull and manufacturing standards, introduced flaws that weakened the overall structural integrity of the Titan hull,\" the report reads. \"The carbon fiber pressure hull suffered a full material collapse due to buckling on its final dive.\"",
      "Several red flags were raised in previous dives, but Rush continued operating Titan, dismissed internal warnings and concealed critical damage from crew and clients, the report found.",
      "For instance, more than 150 loud hull-cracking noises were heard in a 2019 dive, indicating progressive degradation. A four-foot crack was later found in the original hull, which was de-rated after pressure testing \u2014 prompting OceanGate to build a new one. However, throughout the development of both hulls, four one-third scale models were tested and all of them imploded under pressure, reinforcing that the carbon fiber design was unstable.",
      "Additionally,\u00a0the forward dome of the Titan \u2014 a 3,500-pound pressure-bearing component \u2014 was designed to be secured with 18 bolts, but Rush only used four bolts, according to testimony from OceanGate\u2019s director of engineering at the time.",
      "During a 2021 Titanic dive, Titan\u2019s four securing bolts sheared off while being hoisted aboard the Horizon Arctic, causing the forward dome to detach and fall onto the Launch and Recovery System platform in a catastrophic mechanical failure that narrowly avoided injuring the crew.",
      "The report found OceanGate bypassed industry-standard certification, ignored its own Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) manual and fostered a culture that suppressed safety concerns.",
      "Stockton Rush poses at Times Square in New York City on April 12, 2017. (REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton)",
      "\"Had OceanGate adhered to the safety standards outlined in its own HSE Manual and fostered a culture of transparency and accountability, this tragedy would likely have been averted with the final Titan hull removed from service well ahead of its implosion,\" the report states.",
      "\"Encouraging employees to voice concerns without fear of retaliation and prioritizing safety over expediency could have prevented the sequence of events that led to the disaster. Instead, the company\u2019s systemic failures created an environment where risks were ignored, and consequences were inevitable.\"",
      "Along with Rush, U.K. billionaire Hamish Harding, French mariner Paul-Henri Nargeolet and father-son pair Shahzada Dawood and Suleman Dawood also perished in the disaster.",
      "While the passengers signed waivers, they were not fully informed of the degree of experimental engineering involved or prior red flags, according to the report.",

      "\"He sexually harasses and fetishizes Arab women, according to multiple reports,\": she said. \"Several women have described feeling unsafe around him, especially in activist spaces.\"",
      "Neither Kiswani nor Berger responded to requests for comment, but Berger\u00a0published a video response to Kiswani in which he denied her claims. He said \"some heavy allegations have been leveled against me\" and called the charges as a \"personal vendetta\" that arose after he did an interview with a podcast host critical of Kiswani.",
      "In a reverse Uno move straight out of a Muslim soap opera, Berger, he accused Kiswani of causing \"baseless fitna.\" Fitna is an Arabic word that means civil war and carries with it serious negative subtext among ideologues bound to a collective identity of one \"ummah,\" or Muslim community.",

(Photo by Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images) (Getty Images)",
      "The allegations are particularly awkward because, since the brutal Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of Israel by Hamas, Berger has become a virtual rock star in the anti-Israel scene, publishing selfies with activist luminaries, including socialist politician\u00a0Cornel West, political scientist\u00a0Norman Finkelstein, previously-detained protest leader\u00a0Mamoud Khalil, Hollywood actor\u00a0Rami Malek and rapper\u00a0Macklemore.",

      "The clash offers a window into the murky dynamics of the anti-Israel movement, which has branded itself as moral and virtuous, calling for a \"resistance\" to \"genocide.\" While it welcomed Berger, he had previously been known for creating a library of social media content that critics say \"fetishizes\" not only Arab women but also cleavage-popping Hispanic, Black and Asian women.",
      "In late February 2022, Berger had a very different business model. A former mental health and substance abuse counselor with a master\u2019s degree in social work from Columbia University, according to an\u00a0official bio, Berger had switched careers to become an actor. That month, he\u00a0launched a new business on the OnlyFans platform for sexually-charged video content, promoting himself as \"The Instagram Cop.\" He dressed in a New York Police Department uniform while performing sexual capers around town with buxom women, usually earning less than 100,000 views on TikTok.",

      "After Oct. 7, 2023, the Columbia University graduate made a sudden pivot. A week later, he\u00a0posted an earnest video on Instagram, speaking to the camera in a NASA t-shirt, decrying the \"genocide of the Palestinian people,\" calling Israel an \"apartheid state\" and ending with a chant, \"Free Palestine!\"",
      "By the end of the month, wearing a white New York Yankees baseball cap without a keffiyeh, he joined a slow-moving\u00a0protest in Washington, D.C., led by a group, Jewish Voice for Peace, aligned with Kiswani, heading from Union Station to the back of the U.S. Capitol. The crowd chanted \"Ceasefire now,\" as protest paparazzi took their images to post later on social media accounts in the emerging global intifada movement.",
      "The next month, Berger\u00a0posted a selfie video from another protest Kiswani led on the Williamsburg Bridge, between Brooklyn and Manhattan. Wearing a \"Bronx Native\" baseball cap, protesting Israel\u2019s military response to the attacks, he chanted along with demonstrators: \"Free, free Palestine.\"",
      "\"He centers himself in everything,\" Kiswani alleges. \"Even when talking to Palestinians and on livestreams, it\u2019s \u2018me me me,\u2019 how he suffers, how he is censored, how he gave up fame, while [he is] literally grifting off of a genocide.\"",

      "All along, Berger has been blatant about his sexual content, posting videos with scantily-clad women from his first days of anti-Israel protesting. As he joined the post-Oct. 7 protests and befriended Kiswani, he still had fresh on his social media feed a video he\u2019d posted of a woman in a bra and thong underwear, with the caption, \"When she likes it rough.\" In another video he had on his public feed, he squeezed a Black woman\u2019s buttocks, visible under lace hose and thong underwear, with the caption, \"When cops stop you for being thick.\"",
      "After joining the protests, he stayed on script with his sexual content,\u00a0showing two busty women spilling out of their bras, cavorting with each other behind the caption: \"When wifey won\u2019t share her girlfriend with you.\" He earned 52,666 likes.",
      "By late November 2023, Berger\u00a0wrapped a black-and-white checkered keffiyeh, the symbol of the global intifada, over his shoulders, under a Pittsburgh Pirates beanie and marched near Kiswani and a banner that read, \"BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.\" That post garnered 2.6 million views.",
      "\"Ten toes down for \ud83c\udf49,\" he wrote, using the watermelon emoji that\u2019s become a symbol for Palestine, its red, black and green colors matching the colors of the Palestinian flag.",
      "Days later, in a show of force against support for Israel, he\u00a0marched to the Christmas tree lights at Rockefeller Center in midtown Manhattan with Kiswani, who gave her activist group the name\u00a0\"Within Our Lifetime,\" seeking to claim Israel as the nation of \"Palestine\" within a generation. She established the group as an offshoot of the New York City chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, known for its virulent anti-semitism.",
      "Over the years, Kiswani has chanted, \"We want to see Israel fall within our lifetime,\" telling protestors: \"We need allies who are gonna help us achieve a victory, not allies who are gonna tell us to be nonviolent.\" She has said, \"No Zionists are welcome in our city,\" and she has declared, \"We don\u2019t want two states. We want \u201848,\" meaning the land in 1948 before Israel was created.",
      "Her organization\u2019s website now hosts a\u00a0\"rally toolkit,\" with a \"roadmap for how your organization or coalition can put on a successful rally and build the movement for Palestine from wherever you are.\" It offers a \"rally checklist,\" with \"chants, logistics, outreach, materials, assigned roles, security recommendations, follow up, playlist,\" with three \"Palestinian resistance songs.\" The \"donate\" button currently doesn\u2019t work.",
      "Kiswani didn\u2019t publicly challenge Berber over the next two-and-a-half years, as he embedded himself deeper in the anti-Israel protest movement with often-cringey content about chasing \"Habibti,\" or Arab women, and declaring,\u00a0\"Asian Women Are Thick Now\u2665\ufe0f,\"",
      "\"It's a handful of videos out of hundreds,\" Berger says, in his video response to the allegations against him. \"I'm an entertainer, comedian and a streamer. I say funny things. Her trying to haram police my content and my live stream style is just insane and out of line.\"",
      "Kiswani now faces her own backlash. A\u00a0self-described \"Arab alphamale\" supporter of Berger\u00a0says, \"Nerdeen is good at being a dictator,\" \"acting retarded,\" running a \"useless organization,\" storming Grand Central Station \"like idiots\" and making Palestinians \"look stupid.\"",
      "By August 2024, Berger\u00a0journeyed to Egypt to raise funds for \"orphans and single moms from Gaza,\" displaced by the war.",
      "Kiswani alleges: \"He reportedly made videos with Palestinian children on a \u2018field trip,\u2019 asking people to donate for these \u2018orphans\u2019 without consent from their families. When they found out and asked him to take it down, he blocked them.\"",
      "Berger denies the charges and says: \"But this is, unfortunately, a very ugly side of the humanitarian world that we, as people that work in this field, try to keep to ourselves, because it's so messed up that if you know these kind of details, it could affect people's trust in donating to Palestinian causes, period.\"",
      "\"Jacob Berger\u2019s the man\u2026He\u2019s a brilliant artist, brilliant human! Jacob, thank you for being here. Appreciate you.\" - \u00a0Former Democratic New York U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman\u00a0introducing Berger at a rally",
      "Meanwhile, he kept posting his racy videos. In September 2024, in Dearborn, Mich., at ArabCon, he\u00a0filmed a skit promoting a dating app, Olive, throwing a keffiyeh over his shoulders as he chased attractive Arab women, with the caption, \"How to find that perfect Habibti\ud83d\ude0d,\" and asked the question, \"Y\u2019all wanna go free Palestine together?\"",
      "By October 2024, Berger moved to live in Cairo. Kiswani accuses him of \"getting a free apartment, not paying for anything, and living comfortably while volunteers around him were actually working.\" He denies the charges as \"so laughable.\"",
      "The next month, Berger\u00a0shared a supposed message from a follower: \"As beautiful Muslim women, I feel we should give anti-zionist Jewish guys a shot. I feel like it isn\u2019t Haram,\" or Islamically illegal, \"if he rides with Muslims\"",
      "By the end of the year, Berger\u00a0posted a skit of himself hitting on a dark-haired woman in torn jeans, her midriff bare under a jean jacket, tube top and caption that read, \"How to get a womans [sic] attention in an Egyptian club.\"",
      "Months later, in the spring of 2025, Kiswani\u00a0flashed a wide smile and \"V\" for victory with her fingers, in a video with Berger from an anti-Israel protest, both draped in kefiyyehs.",
      "Now, Kiswani says, \"If you\u2019ve felt uneasy about him, you\u2019re not alone\u2026This isn\u2019t cancel culture. It\u2019s protecting the movement from exploiters. If your solidarity is self-promotion, it\u2019s actually extraction.\"",
      "A few months ago, in early May, wearing a Yankees cap, Berger\u00a0stood somber-faced next to climate activist Greta Thunberg, promoting a \"Freedom Flotilla\" to \"break this siege\" in Gaza. In mid-June, he\u00a0celebrated Iranian air strikes against Israel.",
      "By mid-July, now aboard a new sailing of the \"Freedom Flotilla,\" he\u00a0debated TV host Piers Morgan over the alleged \"kidnapping\" of Thurnberg by Israeli officials, who had detained and released her as she sailed off the shores of Israel.",
      "Last week, as he returned from his own aborted mission of the \"Freedom Flotilla,\" with \"GAZA\" across his military green t-shirt and a kefiyyeh over his shoulders, activists\u00a0lined a lobby in the arrivals lounge at JFK. International Airport, yelling, \"Jacob! Jacob!\" as he exchanged high-fives with them.",

      "\"Inshallah,\" the cameraman responded.",
      "Within days, Kiswani leveled her accusations against Berger as a grifter and sexual predator, and a detractor accused him of helping the cause of Zionism, or belief in the state of Israel,\u00a0labeling him \"a Zio in Kefiyeah [sic].\"",

      "\"Nobody is able to have nuance in this conflict or hold multiple truths and that\u2019s part of why everybody from journalists to NGOs to U.N. officials, the pro-Palestine people, activists and advocates, parrot the same talking points that there's no aid theft and that everything is Israel\u2019s fault,\" Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Alkhatib, a Gaza-born American, said that while the U.N. and other NGOs were \"playing politics\" by ignoring their own failures so as not to jeopardize funding and because they are terrified of Hamas, Israeli leaders were also \"exaggerating\" claims about Hamas being the only ones to loot the aid. A close observer of events in Gaza, he described a chain of thievery and extreme price hikes perpetrated by civilians and merchants that have all contributed to the misery there.",
      "He added that statements by some Israeli government ministers about cutting off aid to force Gazans out of the territory have not helped either.",
      "\"Their statements have become the story under which nothing else will fit\u2026\u00a0no amount of evidence, no amount of clarification, no amount of nuance is going to come anywhere near to grabbing that much attention,\" Alkhatib said.",
      "Farhan Aziz Haq, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, confirmed to Fox News Digital that some aid had been stolen but said it was\u00a0because so few supplies had entered Gaza in recent months that \"people facing hunger have resorted to offloading supplies directly from our convoys,\" he said.",
      "\"We understand the frustration, but let\u2019s be clear: this isn\u2019t our system. It\u2019s what happens when aid is squeezed through too few routes after months of deprivation,\" he claimed, adding \"only a steady, reliable flow of aid and commercial supplies can restore people\u2019s belief that aid will arrive and allow for safe, orderly distributions,\" he claimed.",
      "Information posted on the website of UNOPS, the U.N. Office for Project Services, shows that around 87%, or 1,753 of the 2,013 aid trucks that entered Gaza since May 19 did not reach their final destinations, with the aid being stolen\u00a0either \"peacefully by hungry people or forcefully by\u00a0armed actors,\" as first reported by Israel's news agency, TPS-IL.",

      "The revelations about the U.N.\u2019s faulty aid system also come amid worldwide condemnation of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a new U.S. and Israel-backed aid distribution mechanism, devised, in part, to prevent aid from falling into Hamas\u2019 hands. The U.N. has refused to cooperate with the GHF. The aid group announced on Sunday that it had delivered nearly 105 million meals to Gazans since it started operations in May.",
      "It also comes in sharp contrast to reports by some media outlets who chose to ignore evidence of Hamas stealing and reselling aid in order to fund its ongoing war \u2013 seemingly as a way to suggest that Israel is using starvation as a tactic of war or committing \"genocide.\" Israel has emphatically denied both claims.",

      "\"Hamas is\u00a0not the most reliable source in the world,\" he said, adding that \"the international media and other sources do not consider\u00a0the interests of Hamas, or its\u00a0strategy, and they do not seem to acknowledge that Hamas wants a chaotic situation in the Gaza Strip.

      "Gov. Greg Abbott filed an emergency petition Tuesday with the Texas Supreme Court to remove state Rep. Gene Wu from office after Wu and other Democrats left the state to delay Republican efforts to redraw congressional district lines.",
      "The lawsuit from Abbott, a Republican, argues that Wu, the Texas House Democratic Caucus chair, violated the state Constitution and that his absence amounted to abandoning office.",
      "With their absence, Democratic lawmakers have denied Republicans the legislative quorum needed to move forward with plans to redraw congressional boundaries and give the GOP five more House seats in Congress.",
      "The suit argues that quorum provisions make attendance in the state House \u201can affirmative constitutional obligation.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepresentative Wu has openly renounced these constitutional mandates by fleeing the State of Texas to break quorum, obstruct legislative proceedings, and paralyze the Texas House of Representatives,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cAbsconding from the State during a constitutionally mandated session, not for lawful cause, but for the very purpose of subverting the Legislature\u2019s ability to function, constitutes a flagrant violation of Wu\u2019s oath and is an intentional abandonment of his constitutional duty,\u201d it adds.",
      "Wu said in a statement Tuesday evening that he was not abandoning his duties.",
      "\"Let me be unequivocal about my actions and my duty. When a governor conspires with a disgraced president to ram through a racist gerrymandered map, my constitutional duty is to not be a willing participant,\" Wu said.",
      "\"Denying the governor a quorum was not an abandonment of my office; it was a fulfillment of my oath. Unable to defend his corrupt agenda on its merits, Greg Abbott now desperately seeks to silence my dissent by removing a duly-elected official from office,\" he added.",

      "At the same time, he appeared to suggest that Abbott's lawsuit was improper, saying in a letter to the Texas Supreme Court clerk that the court has set clear precedent allowing only the attorney general, a district or a county attorney to bring suits like the one filed by the governor.",

      "\u201cWe have sacrificed lives to free people from dictators like this who do these kind of things, who use the legal process, use law enforcement to go hunt down their enemies, hunt down people who disagree with them, and use any means necessary to silence them,\u201d he added."

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is terminating 22 contracts focused on developing mRNA vaccines and winding down additional federal investments in mRNA technology, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Tuesday.",
      "Many scientists and infectious disease experts swiftly denounced the move as a broadside on an area of research seen as particularly promising after its use in rapidly developing Covid vaccines.",
      "The projects that are being axed were funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a Department of Health and Human Services program that works with the pharmaceutical industry to develop vaccines and other countermeasures for public health emergencies.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about vaccines,\u201d Rick Bright, who directed BARDA from 2016 to 2020, said in a text message. \u201cIt\u2019s about whether we\u2019ll be ready when the next crisis hits. Cutting mRNA development now puts every American at greater risk.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Covid pandemic showed us what\u2019s possible when science moves fast,\u201d he added. \u201cDismantling that momentum now is like disbanding the fire department because the fire\u2019s out.\u201d",
      "Kennedy said Tuesday that the terminated contracts were worth nearly $500 million. Among them is an award to the University of Texas Medical Branch and the biotechnology company Moderna to develop an mRNA-based vaccine for H5N1, the strain of bird flu that has infected dozens of people in the United States.",
      "\"After reviewing the science and consulting top experts at NIH and FDA, HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risks and benefits for these respiratory viruses,\" Kennedy said in a video announcement on X.",
      "\"Let me be absolutely clear, HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them,\" he added. \"That's why we're moving beyond the limitations of mRNA for respiratory viruses and investing in better solutions.\"",
      "The move adds to mounting evidence that Kennedy, a high-profile figure in the anti-vaccine movement who softened his rhetoric after the presidential election and in confirmation hearings, is pursuing an aggressive anti-vaccine agenda that includes gutting a crucial vaccine advisory committee and cutting $2 billion from a program that supports vaccines for vulnerable children.",
      "Kennedy has referred to Covid shots as the \u201cdeadliest vaccine ever made,\u201d a claim contradicted by reams of studies that have found them to be safe. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the vaccines saved more than 200,000 lives in the United States and prevented more than 1.5 million hospitalizations in the first 10 months they were available.",
      "Many pharmaceutical companies have prioritized mRNA research because the platform can easily be updated to target new viruses or variants, and scientists see it as an important tool to prepare for future pandemics.",
      "But mRNA technology has become a primary target for anti-vaccine activists who have argued \u2014 despite ongoing and sizable research \u2014 that it represents a massive safety threat.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy, applauded defunding mRNA vaccine projects under BARDA on Tuesday.",
      "\"While we believe that the mRNA shots on the market are unsafe and should be off the market, this is a welcome step in the right direction. The pandemic preparedness industry as it exists today is a threat to human welfare,\" CEO Mary Holland said in a statement on X.",
      "In his announcement Tuesday, Kennedy suggested that mRNA vaccines fail to sufficiently protect against Covid and flu, that they can be rendered ineffective by a single mutation and that they can even prolong pandemics.",
      "But infectious disease and vaccine experts said he grossly mischaracterizes the science.",
      "\"That's exactly why mRNA is so valuable: It's the only platform where you can actually update the vaccine really quickly,\" said Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious disease specialist at Stanford Medicine.",
      "Terminating mRNA contracts under BARDA is \"a very misguided, irresponsible and I would say reckless move,\" Scott said. \"It really does reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of how vaccines work and how a vaccine against a respiratory virus in particular should be expected to work.\"",
      "Kennedy said Tuesday that the BARDA funding would be shifted \u201ctoward safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate,\" such as whole-virus vaccines, which use weakened or deactivated versions of viruses to trigger immune responses.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Pennsylvania, said whole-virus vaccines have been around since the late 1800s, noting that \u201cwe make safer, better vaccines\u201d today due to technological advances.",
      "The slashing of mRNA contracts is \u201cyet another policy decision engineered by our Secretary of Health and Human Services that is not science-based,\u201d Offit said. \u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous thing to do.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The Tea app, made for women to anonymously share information about men in their areas with other women, has been hit with 10 potential class action lawsuits in federal and state courts after a data breach led to the leak of thousands of selfies, ID photos and private conversations online.",
      "All of the lawsuits allege that Tea Dating Advice Inc., the company that created the Tea app, was negligent in its data practices and breached a contract with its users.",
      "The suits could result in Tea having to pay tens of millions of dollars in damages to the plaintiffs, which could be catastrophic for the company, an expert told NBC News.",
      "A Tea spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuits.",
      "The app gained popularity in late July and climbed to the top of the Apple App Store as many women sought to share information with other women about men they were dating or had dated. The app allows its users to upload photos of men, deem them \u201cred flags\u201d or \u201cgreen flags\u201d and share other information about them. As of Tuesday, the app was still ranked third on the Apple App Store\u2019s top free apps list.",
      "To join the app, users are required to take verification photos, which Tea has said are deleted after they are submitted. A Tea spokesperson previously told NBC News that \u201cthis data was originally stored in compliance with law enforcement requirements related to cyberbullying prevention.\u201d",
      "The first breach occurred July 25. A Tea spokesperson has told NBC News that it consisted of about 72,000 images, 59,000 of which were images in which posts, comments and direct messages were viewable.",
      "404 Media reported two days later that Tea had experienced a second security issue, in which more than 1.1 million user direct messages, spanning from early 2023 to last month, were exposed. Tea had confirmed to NBC News that a breach occurred in which \u201csome direct messages (DMs) were accessed as part of the initial incident.\u201d",
      "Scott Cole, a lawyer who is leading a lawsuit against the app, said his client, Griselda Reyes, signed up for the app only days before the breach happened. The suit says that Reyes had received a notice from Tea that her data was involved in the breach and that as a result, she has since taken action to explore \u201ccredit monitoring and identity theft insurance options.\u201d A Tea spokesperson previously said the breach would have given access to a \u201cdataset from prior to February 2024.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, a judge granted a motion an anonymous plaintiff had filed for her case to be combined with Reyes\u2019 and three others.",
      "\u201cHer particular concerns have more to do with information that she has shared with others on the site and how that might come back to haunt her in the future, and I think that\u2019s probably the No. 1 concern that I\u2019ve heard directly or indirectly from users,\u201d Cole said.",
      "One of the suits lists the right-wing online discussion board 4chan and the social platform X as defendants, alleging that they allowed bad actors to spread users\u2019 personal information. The day before the breach, users on 4chan had called for a \u201chack and leak\u201d campaign. On the day of the leak, a 4chan user had posted a link that the suit alleges allowed people to download the database of images, some of which appeared to later circulate on X.",
      "On X, users began to circulate a link to a website called TeaSpill that allowed people to rank the photos of the women based on attractiveness. X and 4chan did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The plaintiff in the suit against Tea, X and 4chan, who is listed anonymously as Jane Doe, joined the app \u201cto anonymously warn other women in her Northern California community about a man who sexually assaulted at least two other women.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe app promised her that anonymity. It promised her safety. It promised to delete her verification data. Tea broke every one of those promises,\u201d the suit reads.",
      "Five of the plaintiffs in the suits are named, while five are listed anonymously as Jane Doe.",
      "John Yanchunis, an attorney for a user who filed another case anonymously as Jane Doe on Thursday, said his client has faced immense harassment online because of the breach.",
      "\u201cBecause of the breach, some very sensitive information became publicly available, and that led certain individuals to engage in online harassment,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been devastating to her, as it would be to any individual to be the subject of ridicule. She has suffered emotional distress and has had to take steps to ensure that she can defend as best she can against both the attacks as well as the ongoing threat to identity theft.\u201d",
      "Brian Fitzpatrick, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School who specializes in class action suits, said it can be easy to prove that defendants are liable for data breaches in similar class action lawsuits but harder to prove damages, such as that people\u2019s data is being used maliciously.",
      "But Fitzpatrick said the ways users have been circulating Tea users\u2019 information online, including one who is alleged to have created a map with Tea users\u2019 home addresses, Tea could have a harder time fighting damage claims.",
      "At least four of the suits seek at least $5 million in damages, though the amounts awarded could climb much higher.",
      "Fitzpatrick said that, as in many data breach suits against major companies like MGM Resorts and T-Mobile, settlements can reach hundreds of millions of dollars.",
      "He said such cases typically involve millions of class members, who usually divide the settlement money. For a smaller company like Tea, which, according to its LinkedIn page, has only five employees, an adverse ruling could be extremely detrimental, meaning higher checks for the suit\u2019s class members since its user base is still relatively small compared with those of larger companies.",
      "\u201cWe may not know if it will become an actual as opposed to potential class action for months or even years,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cAll the class members are automatically included. They will be given an opportunity to opt out, but if they do not, they are included.\u201d",
      "Many of the suits have classified their class members as those who are \u201csimilarly situated\u201d as the plaintiffs. One of the suits reads that its class members \u201care so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,\u201d but that it estimates that it is \u201ccomposed of millions of individuals who have been damaged\u201d by the Tea app.",
      "The company\u2019s founder, Sean Cook, said in a Medium interview in May that he started Tea after he saw his mom\u2019s dating experiences, including \u201chow easy it was for catfish, scammers and criminals to take advantage of women on dating apps and how little traditional dating apps do to protect users.\u201d",
      "According to his LinkedIn page, Cook created and \u201cself-funded\u201d Tea in November 2022. Before that,he worked in technology in San Francisco since 2019.",
      "Yanchunis and Cole said it is difficult to estimate how much a suit against Tea could be settled for, as the numbers of class members for the suits are still developing. Tea\u2019s website says the app has over 6 million users.",
      "\u201cIt could be more of an existential threat to their existence,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cNot maybe so much because of the amount of money that they might have to pay, but just because, I think, this is awful for their reputation. I don\u2019t know if people are going to trust them anymore, and so they might lose all their users.\u201d",
      "Yanchunis said these cases differ from many other data breach cases because of the sensitivity of the information.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s unique here is the way this app promoted the safety and security of the platform, and so people in this type of app are going to reveal things that they might not otherwise reveal at large,\u201d he said. \u201cI might tell a girlfriend something that I wouldn\u2019t tell anybody else, because we\u2019re in a close relationship. So that kind of information through this app can be disclosed, and it could be very devastating when it\u2019s revealed, as it was in this situation.\u201d",
      "A user of the app, who requested anonymity because of safety concerns, told NBC News that they had been on the app since late 2023 and had felt very anxious and paranoid since the breach.",
      "\u201cOriginally, the app was started for women, and I don\u2019t think they should have told the men about it,\u201d the user said. \u201cPeople should feel free to join the app and read the interesting comments, and if not, then you take that app down.\u201d"

      "In the September 2022 call, Tamura\u2019s mother said her son had a concealed carry permit for a handgun, which he kept in a backpack. Tamura had been inside the motel room and begun crying and slamming things, saying his mother\u2019s being there was making the situation worse, she said.",
      "She said she stepped out and was calling from inside her silver Toyota Camry, out of sight of her son. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say he made a plan, he just said he just can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d the mother told the dispatcher.",
      "A Las Vegas metro police officer that day filed an emergency request for Tamura to be admitted to a mental health facility or hospital, according to a copy of the application.",
      "Tamura was bon in Las Vegas and his family eventually ended up in California, where he enrolled in at least two Los Angeles-area high schools.",
      "He started out at Golden Valley High School, in the suburb of Santa Clarita, where he played running back for the football team. A classmate told NBC News that in his junior year, Tamura wasn\u2019t going to be eligible to play due to poor grades. His grades improved, but Tamura didn\u2019t like that he wasn\u2019t going to be the starting running back when he returned, the classmate said.",
      "Tamura then transferred to Granada Hills Charter, where he continued impressing on the football field. It\u2019s unclear if he ever graduated, and he does not appear to have continued playing football after high school.",
      "At some point after high school, Tamura returned to Las Vegas, where he had various documented encounters with police, including for threatening suicide.",
      "Besides the September 2022 call, police were called over Tamura\u2019s threatening suicide at least once more.",
      "In August 204, someone called 911 about their son, according to a log of the call and police bodycam footage. The caller noted that Tamura previously had a concealed carry permit for a gun, which had since expired, and that he suffered from bipolar disorder, anxiety and depression.",
      "In the video, a police officer arrives to a Las Vegas apartment complex, where paramedics are already in a room with a shirtless Tamura, seemingly checking his vital signs as he sits calmly on a couch.",
      "\u201cHe called his mom, made some statements about not wanting to be here anymore, this is it for him,\u201d a paramedic tells the officer. \u201cHe\u2019s been calm and cooperative with us, but he did tell us he had a handgun in his bag. But he doesn\u2019t want to go to the hospital.\u201d",
      "The interaction lasts a few minutes and remains calm, with Tamura at one point indicating to the officer where the gun is. After he puts on a shirt and some sandals and grabs a few items, Tamura, the officer and the paramedics step outside and head downstairs, where Tamura gets onto a waiting stretcher and is wheeled out of the apartment complex.",
      "Another emergency application for Tamura to be admitted to a mental health facility or hospital was made that day, a copy of the request shows.",
      "In May of that year, Tamura was also pulled over for driving without a rear license plate, body camera video of the traffic stop shows. He appeared cooperative and was eventually cited for operating an unregistered vehicle and driving without a valid license, according to a copy of the citation, which shows he was released after being cited.",
      "The year prior, though, Tamura had had a more volatile interaction with police at a Las Vegas casino.",
      "According to an arrest report, Tamura had been gambling when security personnel asked him to show his identification, which he refused to do. When asked to leave, he went to collect his winnings but also refused to show identification to claim what he said he was owed \u2014 around $5,000 \u2014 according to the report.",
      "That's when security staff called 911. Tamura called 911 as well, according to audio of the call, saying, \"They stole my money.\" Body camera video shows police and casino staff speaking with Tamura in a room, with one officer growing irate after Tamura repeatedly refused to give his name.",
      "They eventually handcuffed him, took him outside and repeatedly told him to leave, according to the video. When he failed to do so, they handcuffed him again and arrested him, taking him to the Clark County Detention Center.",
      "Tamura's final interaction with police would be on July 28, when he walked into the high-rise at 345 Park Ave. and opened fire.",
      "Police searched Tamura's Las Vegas apartment the next day and found a notebook with a goodbye note, prescription pill bottles, an empty gun case, 9 mm rounds, a bipod for a rifle and a rifle cartridge, according to a search warrant. Police said he used a rifle in the killings.",
      "In a note left behind at the scene of the shooting, Tamura accused the NFL of knowingly concealing the dangers to football players\u2019 brains and asked that his brain be studied for CTE.",
      "A spokesperson for the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner told NBC News it would examine his brain as part of the autopsy process, which is expected to take multiple weeks."

      "HIROSHIMA, Japan \u2014 For more than half a century, chimes have rung out across the Japanese city of Hiroshima every morning at exactly 8:15.",
      "The solemn ritual marks the precise moment Aug. 6, 1945, when the U.S. bomber Enola Gay dropped the world\u2019s first atomic bomb over Hiroshima, killing about 70,000 people instantly.",
      "On Wednesday, people in Hiroshima commemorated the 80th anniversary of the devastating attack, as nuclear fears mount globally amid unresolved military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "In a one-minute silent tribute, the city remembered the widescale death and destruction caused by the 10,000-pound bomb, which created a huge mushroom cloud that rose to more than 60,000 feet.",
      "\u201cIt is our duty to convey the reality of the atomic bombings not only to the people of Japan but also to the people of the world,\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said in a speech.",
      "Initially meant to strike a T-shaped bridge, the bomb veered instead toward an exhibition hall with a distinctive dome, which after the explosion was the only building still standing within a 1-mile radius.",
      "The blast unleashed a whirlwind of fire and force, incinerating thousands of people. Then came the radioactive black rain, which fell over the city, silently poisoning countless more.",
      "Teruko Yahata was 8 years old at the time.",
      "Yahata, who is now in her 80s, says she still has a scar from when she was hurled by the blast. Fearing another bomb, she huddled under a blanket with her family.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really understand what it meant to die,\u201d Yahata said, \u201cbut the warmth I felt at us dying together \u2026 I still remember to this day.\u201d",
      "Three days after bombing Hiroshima, the U.S. unleashed a second atomic bomb on the city of Nagasaki that killed another 40,000 people immediately.",
      "The unprecedented bombings hastened Imperial Japan\u2019s surrender and the end of World War II, most historians say, though at the price of nearly a quarter-million lives.",
      "From the ashes, Hiroshima was rebuilt into a busy city of more than a million people, drawing tourists from around the world.",
      "Near the hypocenter, where the bomb detonated about 2,000 feet above, is a peace memorial park and museum that includes the iconic atomic dome. Using virtual reality headsets, visitors can immerse themselves in the bombing and its brutal aftermath while touring the park.",
      "Yet, the bombing still feels visceral to Hiroshima survivors, who are called hibakusha, or \u201cbomb affected persons.\u201d Now more than 86 years old on average, they have spent most of their lives struggling with illness, depression and discrimination.",
      "Kunihiko Iida, whose father was killed in the war and whose mother and older sister died shortly after the bombing, is now 83, defying predictions that he would not live to the age of 20.",
      "Those who say the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki saved lives, he said, \u201cdon\u2019t know the reality of a nuclear bomb.\u201d",
      "Last year, the work of Japanese survivors\u2019 group Nihon Hidankyo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "Toshiyuki Mimaki, the group\u2019s co-chair, is among those advocating nuclear disarmament and making sure that Hiroshima is neither forgotten nor repeated.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a very dangerous situation with Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cEven a single nuclear bomb would mean disaster.\u201d",
      "According to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), the world\u2019s nine nuclear-armed states \u2014 Russia, the United States, China, France, Britain, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea \u2014 spent more than $100 billion on nuclear weapons last year, up 11% from 2023.",
      "The increase in spending on nuclear weapons contrasts with public attitudes about them. In a June survey of Americans by the Pew Research Center, 69% of respondents said the development of nuclear weapons had made the world less safe, compared with 10% who said it had made the world safer.",
      "Nearly 70% of Japan\u2019s atomic bomb survivors believe nuclear weapons could be used again, according to a poll this year by Japanese news agency Kyodo News.",
      "Hiroshima survivor Setsuko Thurlow, 93, lost 10 members of her family in the bombing. She said she remembered seeing a procession of people fleeing to the hillside who \u201clooked like ghosts.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s hair was just standing up, raised upwards, and the skin and the flesh was coming off from the bones,\u201d she said.",
      "Thurlow, who went to the U.S. to study in 1954 \u2014 the same year the U.S. tested a hydrogen bomb 1,000 times more powerful than the one that destroyed Hiroshima \u2014 has spent her life campaigning for nuclear disarmament, accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017 on behalf of ICAN.",
      "\u201cI beg world leaders to stop and come to the negotiation table. Diplomacy needs to have greater attention,\u201d she said in a video interview from Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s not nuclear weapons, but diplomacy, exchange of words and ideas.\u201d",
      "The number of hibakusha is dwindling, raising fears that living memory of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings will soon be gone. As of the end of March, there were 99,130 survivors nationwide, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.",
      "Responsibility for remembering is being taken up by young people such as 12-year-old Shun Sasaki, who has been giving foreign visitors free guided tours of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park since he was 7.",
      "Sasaki said that even though his great-grandmother was among those killed in the bombing, for a long time his family barely acknowledged it.",
      "\u201cThe scariest thing that might happen in the future is to forget what happened a long time ago,\u201d Sasaki said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to have the same experience as my great-grandmother.\u201d",
      "Sasaki\u2019s is not the only family that has avoided talking about that day. More than 70% of the respondents in the Kyodo poll said they had never spoken about their experiences.",
      "Even so, some feel it is their duty to speak up.",
      "\u201cAs long as I live, I want to continue telling,\u201d Yahata said. \u201cI\u2019m a survivor.\u201d",
      "Janis Mackey Frayer and Mai Nishiyama reported from Hiroshima, Arata Yamamoto from Tokyo, Michael Fiorentino from London and Peter Guo from Hong Kong."

      "\u201cWe\u2019re leaning toward transparency,\u201d the source said.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s co-conspirator and confidant, for nine hours of interviews over two days in July. Former prosecutors told NBC News last month that it was highly unusual for the Justice Department\u2019s second-in-command to personally interview a witness.",
      "Blanche made no public statements about what Maxwell said or what would come next in the Epstein investigation. Days later, Maxwell was transferred from a Florida prison to a minimum-security prison in Texas where the majority of inmates are serving time for nonviolent offenses and white-collar crimes.",
      "Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in recruiting and trafficking minors for sex.",
      "The Bureau of Prison\u2019s own designation would have made Maxwell ineligible for the transfer, as BOP policy mandates that convicted sex offenders must be held in at least a low-security-level facility. The only work-around to the rule is if the bureau\u2019s Designation and Sentence Computation Center issues a waiver.",
      "Epstein survivors and their families have blasted the transfer, calling it \u201cpreferential treatment.\u201d Former BOP officials have similarly derided the move, with a former official calling it \u201ca travesty of justice.\u201d",
      "Maxwell has been in the spotlight amid fallout from the Trump administration\u2019s handling of files related to Epstein, the convicted sex offender who died in prison in 2019 awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "Members of President Donald Trump\u2019s base, as well as some Cabinet members, have long advocated for the release of the files, with some promoting conspiracy theories around Epstein\u2019s death. Trump vowed on the campaign trail last year to release the files if he were elected.",
      "The issue became a source of division between Trump and his MAGA base after the Justice Department said last month that it would not release any more files related to the case.",
      "Trump has at times dismissed the importance of the issue, but he recently directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of pertinent grand jury testimony. The order came after The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump sent Epstein a \u201cbawdy\u201d birthday card in 2003. Trump later sued the newspaper."

It agreed to the move after securing assurances that the U.S. will prioritize the delivery of new Patriots to Germany to backfill its stocks. These weapon systems are only made in the U.S.",
      "As an organization, NATO provides only non-lethal assistance to Ukraine like uniforms, tents, medical supplies and logistics support. The 32-nation military alliance has mostly sought to protect NATO territory from possible Russian attack and avoid being dragged into a war against a nuclear power.",

Trump has made no public promise of weapons or economic support for Ukraine.",
      "Trump said on July 28 that the U.S. is \u201cgoing to be sending now military equipment and other equipment to NATO, and they\u2019ll be doing what they want, but I guess it\u2019s for the most part working with Ukraine.\u201d"

      "Many scientists and infectious disease experts swiftly denounced the move as a broadside on an area of research seen as particularly promising after its use in rapidly developing Covid vaccines.",
      "The projects that are being axed were funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a Department of Health and Human Services program that works with the pharmaceutical industry to develop vaccines and other countermeasures for public health emergencies.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about vaccines,\u201d Rick Bright, who directed BARDA from 2016 to 2020, said in a text message. \u201cIt\u2019s about whether we\u2019ll be ready when the next crisis hits. Cutting mRNA development now puts every American at greater risk.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Covid pandemic showed us what\u2019s possible when science moves fast,\u201d he added. \u201cDismantling that momentum now is like disbanding the fire department because the fire\u2019s out.\u201d",
      "Kennedy said Tuesday that the terminated contracts were worth nearly $500 million. Among them is an award to the University of Texas Medical Branch and the biotechnology company Moderna to develop an mRNA-based vaccine for H5N1, the strain of bird flu that has infected dozens of people in the United States.",
      "\"After reviewing the science and consulting top experts at NIH and FDA, HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risks and benefits for these respiratory viruses,\" Kennedy said in a video announcement on X.",
      "\"Let me be absolutely clear, HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them,\" he added. \"That's why we're moving beyond the limitations of mRNA for respiratory viruses and investing in better solutions.\"",
      "The move adds to mounting evidence that Kennedy, a high-profile figure in the anti-vaccine movement who softened his rhetoric after the presidential election and in confirmation hearings, is pursuing an aggressive anti-vaccine agenda that includes gutting a crucial vaccine advisory committee and cutting $2 billion from a program that supports vaccines for vulnerable children.",
      "Kennedy has referred to Covid shots as the \u201cdeadliest vaccine ever made,\u201d a claim contradicted by reams of studies that have found them to be safe. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the vaccines saved more than 200,000 lives in the United States and prevented more than 1.5 million hospitalizations in the first 10 months they were available.",
      "Many pharmaceutical companies have prioritized mRNA research because the platform can easily be updated to target new viruses or variants, and scientists see it as an important tool to prepare for future pandemics.",
      "But mRNA technology has become a primary target for anti-vaccine activists who have argued \u2014 despite ongoing and sizable research \u2014 that it represents a massive safety threat.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy, applauded defunding mRNA vaccine projects under BARDA on Tuesday.",
      "\"While we believe that the mRNA shots on the market are unsafe and should be off the market, this is a welcome step in the right direction. The pandemic preparedness industry as it exists today is a threat to human welfare,\" CEO Mary Holland said in a statement on X.",
      "In his announcement Tuesday, Kennedy suggested that mRNA vaccines fail to sufficiently protect against Covid and flu, that they can be rendered ineffective by a single mutation and that they can even prolong pandemics.",
      "But infectious disease and vaccine experts said he grossly mischaracterizes the science.",
      "\"That's exactly why mRNA is so valuable: It's the only platform where you can actually update the vaccine really quickly,\" said Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious disease specialist at Stanford Medicine.",
      "Terminating mRNA contracts under BARDA is \"a very misguided, irresponsible and I would say reckless move,\" Scott said. \"It really does reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of how vaccines work and how a vaccine against a respiratory virus in particular should be expected to work.\"",
      "Kennedy said Tuesday that the BARDA funding would be shifted \u201ctoward safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate,\" such as whole-virus vaccines, which use weakened or deactivated versions of viruses to trigger immune responses.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Pennsylvania, said whole-virus vaccines have been around since the late 1800s, noting that \u201cwe make safer, better vaccines\u201d today due to technological advances.",
      "The slashing of mRNA contracts is \u201cyet another policy decision engineered by our Secretary of Health and Human Services that is not science-based,\u201d Offit said. \u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous thing to do.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Gov. Greg Abbott filed an emergency petition Tuesday with the Texas Supreme Court to remove state Rep. Gene Wu from office after Wu and other Democrats left the state to delay Republican efforts to redraw congressional district lines.",
      "The lawsuit from Abbott, a Republican, argues that Wu, the Texas House Democratic Caucus chair, violated the state Constitution and that his absence amounted to abandoning office.",
      "With their absence, Democratic lawmakers have denied Republicans the legislative quorum needed to move forward with plans to redraw congressional boundaries and give the GOP five more House seats in Congress.",
      "The suit argues that quorum provisions make attendance in the state House \u201can affirmative constitutional obligation.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepresentative Wu has openly renounced these constitutional mandates by fleeing the State of Texas to break quorum, obstruct legislative proceedings, and paralyze the Texas House of Representatives,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cAbsconding from the State during a constitutionally mandated session, not for lawful cause, but for the very purpose of subverting the Legislature\u2019s ability to function, constitutes a flagrant violation of Wu\u2019s oath and is an intentional abandonment of his constitutional duty,\u201d it adds.",
      "Wu said in a statement Tuesday evening that he was not abandoning his duties.",
      "\"Let me be unequivocal about my actions and my duty. When a governor conspires with a disgraced president to ram through a racist gerrymandered map, my constitutional duty is to not be a willing participant,\" Wu said.",
      "\"Denying the governor a quorum was not an abandonment of my office; it was a fulfillment of my oath. Unable to defend his corrupt agenda on its merits, Greg Abbott now desperately seeks to silence my dissent by removing a duly-elected official from office,\" he added.",
      "Wu said on social media Sunday from Illinois that he was \"On the ground in Chicago\u2026 Fighting for the rights of Texans and all Americans.\"",
      "Former President Barack Obama weighed in Tuesday on the standoff that's drawn national attention, calling the actions by Republicans \u201ca power grab that undermines our democracy\u201d in a post on X.",
      "Abbott said in a statement that Wu and more than 50 other Democrats who left the state had failed to meet quorum requirements in refusing to return.",
      "\u201cTexas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans, and there must be consequences,\u201d he said.",
      "State attorney general Ken Paxton on Tuesday urged the high court not to dismiss the governor\u2019s petition until after a Friday deadline he said House Speaker Dustin Burrows set for the lawmakers to return to the state Capitol.",
      "Paxton, who is challenging Sen. John Cornyn in next year's GOP primary, said that his office would take legal action against the lawmakers, including proceedings to declare their offices vacant, if they have not returned by Friday.",
      "At the same time, he appeared to suggest that Abbott's lawsuit was improper, saying in a letter to the Texas Supreme Court clerk that the court has set clear precedent allowing only the attorney general, a district or a county attorney to bring suits like the one filed by the governor.",
      "Abbott had warned in a statement Sunday that he would seek Democrats\u2019 removal if they weren\u2019t present when the House convened the next day. During the Democratic lawmakers' absence Monday, he ordered the state Department of Public Safety to arrest them after a vote by the House to compel the sergeant-at-arms to \u201csend for\u201d the return of the lawmakers \u201cunder warrant of arrest, if necessary.\u201d",
      "Asked whether the FBI and the federal government should get involved in locating and arresting the lawmakers, President Donald Trump told reporters earlier Tuesday that they \"may have to.\"",
      "\u201cA lot of people have demanded they come back. You can\u2019t just sit it out. You have to go back. You have to fight it out. That\u2019s what elections are all about,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has supported changing district boundaries, telling CNBC on Tuesday morning that Republicans were \u201centitled\u201d to additional seats in Texas.",
      "Asked during an MSNBC interview on Tuesday night about Trump's entitlement remark, Wu said that Americans \u201cknow that this is the lead-up to authoritarianism, that this is what despots and dictators do around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have sacrificed lives to free people from dictators like this who do these kind of things, who use the legal process, use law enforcement to go hunt down their enemies, hunt down people who disagree with them, and use any means necessary to silence them,\u201d he added."

      "He said he has no regrets and would do it all over again.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t regret it at all,\u201d Flood said in a phone interview Tuesday. \u201cEvery member of Congress has to do it the way they see fit. But for me, this comes with the territory. And I feel like you got to put yourself in the town square if you want to be a member of Congress for your district.\u201d",

      "In this polarized political climate, the vast majority of lawmakers, in both parties, are opting not to hold town halls this August recess. Last spring, after a series of GOP town halls went off the rails, Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., the GOP campaign chief for the 2026 election cycle, urged his Republican colleagues not to hold in-person town halls, calling them \u201cno longer effective\u201d because of Democratic disruptions. And violent threats against politicians have ticked up steadily in recent years.",
      "But Flood, the chairman of the Republican Main Street Caucus, whose members call themselves \u201cpragmatic conservatives,\u201d didn\u2019t heed Hudson\u2019s advice. He held a town hall in Columbus in March and another in Seward in May before Monday\u2019s event on the University of Nebraska campus in liberal-leaning Lincoln, the largest city in his district.",
      "\u201cAs elected officials, we have to put ourselves in environments that are not comfortable,\u201d he said, though he made it clear he wasn\u2019t judging colleagues in either party who have chosen not to hold town halls.",
      "House Republican Conference Chair Lisa McLain, R-Mich., called him Tuesday morning and commended him for hanging tough, Flood said. His next town hall is likely to be in the spring.",
      "Flood said concerns about cuts to Medicaid in the GOP\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d dominated Monday night\u2019s 87-minute town hall, which public television carried live.",
      "\u201cMedicaid, Medicaid, Medicaid, Medicaid \u2014 that was the No. 1 issue and something I started out with, just because I\u2019m looking at the calls my office gets,\u201d Flood said, adding that he spent time addressing confusion in the audience about how the bill would affect them and reassuring seniors that they wouldn\u2019t lose their Medicare coverage.",
      "The Trump law does require recipients of Medicaid \u2014 the health care program for low-income people and those with disabilities \u2014 to work 80 hours per month if they are able-bodied adults under age 65, with some exceptions.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re 28 years old and you don\u2019t want to work, you shouldn\u2019t expect free health care if you can work,\u201d Flood said. \u201cAnd that resonates with, like, 70% of people, that you\u2019d have some work requirements.\u201d",
      "Democrats believe the Trump law will cost Republicans the House majority in 2026, and they say Flood\u2019s hostile town hall is evidence of just how unpopular it is with voters.",

      "Flood, 50, the former speaker of the Nebraska House who was elected to Congress in 2022, also fielded tough questions about Trump\u2019s recent firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner and whether he backs releasing more information from the Jeffrey Epstein probe.",
      "He said he\u2019ll sign on to a resolution by House Rules Committee members Wednesday to release the Epstein files. \u201cAs long as it protects the victims and doesn\u2019t re-victimize those folks,\u201d Flood said, \u201cI\u2019m for its release.\u201d",
      "But he opposes a bipartisan effort led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., to bypass GOP leadership and force a vote on the floor in September to compel the Justice Department to release the files.",

      "Nebraska is a red state that went for Trump by more than 20 points last year, but the university\u2019s Kimball Recital Hall on Monday evening was mostly packed with Democrats, said Flood, who recounted how he recognized some people who had attended all three of his town halls this year.",
      "Flood, a former attorney, said he prepared for about five to six hours for the town hall, anticipating what questions he might get and how he\u2019d respond. Before the event started, he told the university police officers on hand he didn\u2019t want anyone kicked out of the town hall for exercising their First Amendment rights.",
      "Only one person was told to leave after having protested the situation in Gaza, Flood said, and he left peacefully.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t want people kicked out or removed just for voicing an opinion, no matter how they voice it. If somebody is fighting somebody else, yes, do what you got to do,\u2019\u201d Flood said.",

They are standing with their back to me,\u201d he recounted. \u201cNone of those folks get asked to leave. They don\u2019t. I don\u2019t even say, \u2018Please stop.\u2019\u201d",
      "Just a handful of lawmakers are choosing to hold town halls during the weekslong August recess. For many, there are few upsides. On the night of Flood\u2019s town hall, veteran Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., had to abruptly cancel his town hall midway through after a group of protesters \u201ctook over the stage\u201d and disrupted the gathering, local police said. Three people were arrested on trespassing charges.",
      "Things were much tamer at a town hall freshman Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin hosted in Michigan.",
      "At one point at his town hall, someone asked Flood: \u201cHow are you helping the working class?\u201d",
      "He talked about how the Trump law included no tax on tips, an expanded child tax credit and other provisions.",
      "Then he said something that infuriated many attendees: \u201cToday\u2019s Republican Party is comprised of the heart and soul of the working class.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat brought the house down. They were very upset that I said that,\" Flood told NBC News. \"But that\u2019s the reality. ... Everyday Americans recognize that something\u2019s changed in our country, where, as a Republican, we have won the hearts and minds of the working class. And that was very hard for the crowd to accept. But I think, to an objective person, if we haven\u2019t won their hearts and minds, we\u2019re darn close to it.\u201d"

      "The Tea app, made for women to anonymously share information about men in their areas with other women, has been hit with 10 potential class action lawsuits in federal and state courts after a data breach led to the leak of thousands of selfies, ID photos and private conversations online.",
      "All of the lawsuits allege that Tea Dating Advice Inc., the company that created the Tea app, was negligent in its data practices and breached a contract with its users.",
      "The suits could result in Tea having to pay tens of millions of dollars in damages to the plaintiffs, which could be catastrophic for the company, an expert told NBC News.",
      "A Tea spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuits.",
      "The app gained popularity in late July and climbed to the top of the Apple App Store as many women sought to share information with other women about men they were dating or had dated. The app allows its users to upload photos of men, deem them \u201cred flags\u201d or \u201cgreen flags\u201d and share other information about them. As of Tuesday, the app was still ranked third on the Apple App Store\u2019s top free apps list.",
      "To join the app, users are required to take verification photos, which Tea has said are deleted after they are submitted. A Tea spokesperson previously told NBC News that \u201cthis data was originally stored in compliance with law enforcement requirements related to cyberbullying prevention.\u201d",
      "The first breach occurred July 25. A Tea spokesperson has told NBC News that it consisted of about 72,000 images, 59,000 of which were images in which posts, comments and direct messages were viewable.",
      "404 Media reported two days later that Tea had experienced a second security issue, in which more than 1.1 million user direct messages, spanning from early 2023 to last month, were exposed. Tea had confirmed to NBC News that a breach occurred in which \u201csome direct messages (DMs) were accessed as part of the initial incident.\u201d",
      "Scott Cole, a lawyer who is leading a lawsuit against the app, said his client, Griselda Reyes, signed up for the app only days before the breach happened. The suit says that Reyes had received a notice from Tea that her data was involved in the breach and that as a result, she has since taken action to explore \u201ccredit monitoring and identity theft insurance options.\u201d A Tea spokesperson previously said the breach would have given access to a \u201cdataset from prior to February 2024.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, a judge granted a motion an anonymous plaintiff had filed for her case to be combined with Reyes\u2019 and three others.",
      "\u201cHer particular concerns have more to do with information that she has shared with others on the site and how that might come back to haunt her in the future, and I think that\u2019s probably the No. 1 concern that I\u2019ve heard directly or indirectly from users,\u201d Cole said.",
      "One of the suits lists the right-wing online discussion board 4chan and the social platform X as defendants, alleging that they allowed bad actors to spread users\u2019 personal information. The day before the breach, users on 4chan had called for a \u201chack and leak\u201d campaign. On the day of the leak, a 4chan user had posted a link that the suit alleges allowed people to download the database of images, some of which appeared to later circulate on X.",
      "On X, users began to circulate a link to a website called TeaSpill that allowed people to rank the photos of the women based on attractiveness. X and 4chan did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The plaintiff in the suit against Tea, X and 4chan, who is listed anonymously as Jane Doe, joined the app \u201cto anonymously warn other women in her Northern California community about a man who sexually assaulted at least two other women.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe app promised her that anonymity. It promised her safety. It promised to delete her verification data. Tea broke every one of those promises,\u201d the suit reads.",
      "Five of the plaintiffs in the suits are named, while five are listed anonymously as Jane Doe.",
      "John Yanchunis, an attorney for a user who filed another case anonymously as Jane Doe on Thursday, said his client has faced immense harassment online because of the breach.",
      "\u201cBecause of the breach, some very sensitive information became publicly available, and that led certain individuals to engage in online harassment,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been devastating to her, as it would be to any individual to be the subject of ridicule. She has suffered emotional distress and has had to take steps to ensure that she can defend as best she can against both the attacks as well as the ongoing threat to identity theft.\u201d",
      "Brian Fitzpatrick, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School who specializes in class action suits, said it can be easy to prove that defendants are liable for data breaches in similar class action lawsuits but harder to prove damages, such as that people\u2019s data is being used maliciously.",
      "But Fitzpatrick said the ways users have been circulating Tea users\u2019 information online, including one who is alleged to have created a map with Tea users\u2019 home addresses, Tea could have a harder time fighting damage claims.",
      "At least four of the suits seek at least $5 million in damages, though the amounts awarded could climb much higher.",
      "Fitzpatrick said that, as in many data breach suits against major companies like MGM Resorts and T-Mobile, settlements can reach hundreds of millions of dollars.",
      "He said such cases typically involve millions of class members, who usually divide the settlement money. For a smaller company like Tea, which, according to its LinkedIn page, has only five employees, an adverse ruling could be extremely detrimental, meaning higher checks for the suit\u2019s class members since its user base is still relatively small compared with those of larger companies.",
      "\u201cWe may not know if it will become an actual as opposed to potential class action for months or even years,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cAll the class members are automatically included. They will be given an opportunity to opt out, but if they do not, they are included.\u201d",
      "Many of the suits have classified their class members as those who are \u201csimilarly situated\u201d as the plaintiffs. One of the suits reads that its class members \u201care so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,\u201d but that it estimates that it is \u201ccomposed of millions of individuals who have been damaged\u201d by the Tea app.",
      "The company\u2019s founder, Sean Cook, said in a Medium interview in May that he started Tea after he saw his mom\u2019s dating experiences, including \u201chow easy it was for catfish, scammers and criminals to take advantage of women on dating apps and how little traditional dating apps do to protect users.\u201d",
      "According to his LinkedIn page, Cook created and \u201cself-funded\u201d Tea in November 2022. Before that,he worked in technology in San Francisco since 2019.",
      "Yanchunis and Cole said it is difficult to estimate how much a suit against Tea could be settled for, as the numbers of class members for the suits are still developing. Tea\u2019s website says the app has over 6 million users.",
      "\u201cIt could be more of an existential threat to their existence,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cNot maybe so much because of the amount of money that they might have to pay, but just because, I think, this is awful for their reputation. I don\u2019t know if people are going to trust them anymore, and so they might lose all their users.\u201d",
      "Yanchunis said these cases differ from many other data breach cases because of the sensitivity of the information.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s unique here is the way this app promoted the safety and security of the platform, and so people in this type of app are going to reveal things that they might not otherwise reveal at large,\u201d he said. \u201cI might tell a girlfriend something that I wouldn\u2019t tell anybody else, because we\u2019re in a close relationship. So that kind of information through this app can be disclosed, and it could be very devastating when it\u2019s revealed, as it was in this situation.\u201d",
      "A user of the app, who requested anonymity because of safety concerns, told NBC News that they had been on the app since late 2023 and had felt very anxious and paranoid since the breach.",
      "\u201cOriginally, the app was started for women, and I don\u2019t think they should have told the men about it,\u201d the user said. \u201cPeople should feel free to join the app and read the interesting comments, and if not, then you take that app down.\u201d"

      "The seizure process hasn\u2019t been all smooth sailing. The federal government incurred costs of about $32 million tied to maintenance, storage and transportation of the Amadea, according to a recent court filing.",
      "The government is trying to get Eduard Khudainatov, another Russian oligarch, to foot the bill for those expenses, arguing it was his effort to put a claim on the vessel that stalled the auction process. That legal fight continues.",

      "Le Creuset is synonymous with well-made enamel-coated cookware that lasts. Aside from its longevity, what fans like myself love about the brand is its array of color options for its cast-iron Dutch ovens, skillets, ceramic baking dishes and more. The brand goes well beyond primary colors and uses dynamic shades inspired by foods and locations. The brand recently announced that it\u2019s discontinuing its Caribbean blue color and is currently discounting the entire color lineup for 20% off. Learn more below.",
      "Deal of the Day:",
      "Le Creuset Signature Round Dutch Oven",
      "This cast-iron Dutch oven is available in 4.5-, 5.5- and 7.25-quart options. Thanks to its enamel coating and cast-iron material, it distributes heat extremely well, which helps evenly cook food, especially lean meat and poultry. Plus, I find that enamel-coated cast-iron pots work best for soups and stews, since they simmer faster and more evenly. The lid\u2019s shape helps baste food with steam as it cooks, which prevents food from drying out. It also has a loop handle on each side and it\u2019s compatible with all cooktops, according to the brand.",

      "Bakers of all skill levels will benefit from the 9 inch x 13 inch rectangular casserole dish. It\u2019s made of stoneware, instead of cast iron with an enamel coating, and it\u2019s just as ideal for cooking lasagna as it is brownies. It has handles on each side and comes with a stoneware lid, so you don\u2019t have to rely on using aluminum foil as a cover. It\u2019s also safe to put in the fridge or freezer so you can transfer meal prepped items directly to the oven.",
      "Le Creuset Heritage Fluted Pie Dish",
      "With fall weather fast approaching, it\u2019s time to trade in frozen desserts for pies and baked goods. This stoneware pie dish has a 1.3-quart capacity and is scratch resistant and non-reactive. What I love most about the pie dish, though, is that the fluted edge eliminates one important and challenging step in pie-making, which is using your hands to make the crust look semi-presentable. With this dish, it basically does half the work.",

In addition to affecting motor skills, it can harm the autonomic nervous system, which regulates involuntary bodily functions, like breathing, digestion and heart rate.",

      "The brown bear in the video is easy to distinguish from a polar bear by coat color. However, telling a brown bear from a black bear is trickier since both can have brown coats. Their key differences lie in their size and physical features. Brown bears and grizzly bears have a noticeable muscular hump between their shoulders, longer claws and smaller ears, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.",
      "You might have heard the adage \"Brown, lie down. Black fight back.\" In the case of a brown bear encounter, NPS advises remaining calm \u2014 as Buoy and Hayden do in the video \u2014 and, if necessary, lying on the ground and playing dead. Black bears, however, should be approached differently if they become aggressive. NPS advises making yourself look larger, shouting, and fighting back with what\u2019s available to you in the area."

      "Laurel is the Hyde\u2019s master and orchestrates the murder of several key characters, including Coroner Reggie (Nitin Ganatra), Mayor Walker (Tommie Earl Jenkins), and Principal Weems. She manipulates Tyler and uses Wednesday\u2019s blood to resurrect Joseph Crackstone (William Houston), a Pilgrim-era zealot who once vowed to wipe out all outcasts. In the finale, she succeeds \u2026 briefly.",
      "Nevermore\u2019s Fall",
      "In the season finale, all hell breaks loose. Crackstone returns from the dead and stabs Wednesday, nearly killing her. But she is saved by Goody Addams\u2019 spirit and a protective necklace passed down by her mother.",
      "Meanwhile, Enid finally transforms into a werewolf for the first time and takes down Tyler. Bianca Barclay (Joy Sunday), once her rival, helps Wednesday destroy Crackstone once and for all. And Eugene (Moosa Mostafa), one of Wednesday\u2019s few genuine friends, wakes from a coma and arrives just in time to unleash his bees on Laurel.",
      "With the villains defeated, Nevermore closes for the semester. But the danger isn\u2019t gone. In the final scene, Wednesday receives a text from an anonymous number with photos of her and a chilling message: \u201cI\u2019m watching you.\u201d"

    "summary": "The cast of \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" speak to TODAY.com about the parents tackling empty-nesting and grief in Season 3.",
    "story": [
      "When you think of \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty,\u201d you might picture Belly\u2019s tangled love life, the Cousins Beach sunsets or the memorable soundtrack. But the grown ups get their moments, too.",
      "In \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d Season 3, the parents of Belly (Lola Tung), Steven (Sean Kaufman), Conrad (Christopher Briney), Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno) and Taylor (Rain Spencer) deal with the universal theme of empty-nesting as the beloved summer crew go to college and beyond.",
      "Laurel Park (Jackie Chung), Belly and Steven Conklin's mom, continues to grieve the loss of best friend Susannah Fisher (Rachel Blanchard), who died in Season 2. Meanwhile Susannah\u2019s husband, Adam Fisher (Tom Everett Scott), struggles to step up for his two sons, Conrad and Jeremiah Fisher. Season 3 also introduces viewers to Taylor\u2019s mom, Lucinda Jewel (Kristen Connolly).",
      "If you look just beyond the love triangles, something deeper is going on: The parents are having a coming-of-age story of their own.",
      "A Child's Major Life Decision",
      "The main obstacle facing the parents of Cousins Beach is Belly and Jeremiah\u2019s engagement. Now upperclassmen in college with around four years of dating under their belt, the young lovebirds get engaged after Steven\u2019s car accident, which for Belly, puts their blowout fight over Jeremiah sleeping with someone else into a new perspective.",
      "\u201cWhen you lose someone, or almost lose someone, that can change things for you and bring you closer to the people in your life that really matter,\u201d Tung previously told TODAY.com.",
      "Before the engagement, audiences find Laurel several years after both Belly and Steven have left for college.",
      "\"I think Laurel has had quite the journey from supporting her friend through her illness, and then losing Susannah and grieving in Season 2,\" Chung tells TODAY.com. \"And so I think by the time we've hit Season 3, and time has passed, Laurel is on more, like, steady ground.\"",
      "\"With her kids gone, she has an opportunity to look around and see what's out there, and see what her life can be and look for new relationships,\" she adds. \"There's a lot of potential for Laurel.\"",
      "When it comes to parenting, she says in Season 2, \"Laurel wasn't always the best communicator.\" That was Susannah's strong suit. Chung says Laurel strives to step up to that task after Susannah's death.",
      "\"Laurel is trying really hard to communicate with her kids and Susannah's kids, and just trying to be the best parent she can be,\" she says. \"She doesn't always succeed, and she butts heads with her kids sometimes, but you know, it's all out of love.\"",
      "After Belly and Jeremiah announce their engagement over dinner in Episode 3, Laurel immediately criticizes the decision and storms out, shutting the meal down before it even begins.",
      "Chung says Laurel's overall goal is to \"set them up for success as individuals in their lives and (help them make) good decisions for themselves.\"",
      "\"I think Laurel doesn't always agree with all the decisions,\" she adds with a laugh. \"And she does her best to give her kids space, but when she has an opinion, she expresses it.\"",
      "Calling Laurel a lifetime member of \u201cTeam Belly,\u201d Chung says her character \"supports her children 100%\" but thinks it's still early in Belly's life.",
      "\"(Belly) has plenty of years to figure out who she is and who she wants to be with,\" Chung says. \"I think she'd just love for Belly to have a chance to establish that, to find her core and her base.\"",
      "Struggling to Reconnect",
      "Adam was also at that fateful dinner in Episode 3. In fact, the engagement announcement came about after he made an underhanded remark about Jeremiah being a \"super senior.\" Belly, wanting to prove that she and Jeremiah are taking their future plans seriously, then reveals they are getting married.",
      "Like Laurel, he calls Jeremiah \u201cirresponsible\" and helps shut down the dinner before appetizers hit the table.",
      "Adam has never exactly been father of the year. When Susannah got sick, he was MIA. After she passed, he stayed emotionally checked out, and in Season 2, he refused to help save the family beach house until Laurel pressured him into doing it.",
      "\u201cPeople say that Adam actually stepped up... but it was really Laurel who kind of forced his hand,\u201d Scott tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut I love that scene because you see a little crack in Adam. He does get to kind of show that he\u2019s hurting and he\u2019s missing Susannah.\u201d",
      "Scott says in Season 3, his character's relationship with his sons continues to be \"rocky.\"",
      "\u201cHe is their only parent now,\u201d Scott adds. \u201cHe\u2019s going to try to do the right things. He just doesn\u2019t have the tools. He\u2019s not very good at it, being present.\"",
      "But his ultimate goal is reconciliation, Scott says, adding, \"Adam is going to be more involved.\"",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s trying to get back together with his sons and trying to make amends with them,\u201d he says.",
      "\"I know that not a lot of people like the character of Adam and what's been fun for me is playing someone and trying to make them real and trying to give them all these flaws,\" he continues. \"But also I think there is a real guy in there trying.",
      "In Season 3, Steven is notably working at Adam's venture capital firm, Breaker. Scott says through the beach house, Steven is like another son to Adam.",
      "\"He sees himself in Steven, and he likes giving him a boost,\" Scott says. \"We're going to have a lot of scenes together.\"",
      "A New Dynamic",
      "From her introduction in Season 3, Episode 1, Lucinda Jewel has been chaotic and the show\u2019s resident \u201ccool mom.\u201d",
      "She notably FaceTimed her daughter in Episode 1 with the blunt warning, \u201cRemember this: Once you\u2019ve downgraded yourself, there is no going back up, and then you\u2019re just a h\u043e.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re sort of parent daughter relationship is switched, like Taylor feels more like the parent a bit, which is an interesting dynamic that\u2019s funny and presents its own challenges,\u201d Spencer tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cBeing a young adult (is) like, \u2018How much do I help my mom, versus listen to my heart and what I want to do and leave the nest?\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "When Taylor comes home for summer break, Lucinda greets her with a freshly cleaned house, a breakup playlist and plans to binge watch \u201cGilmore Girls.\u201d Taylor divulges her boy drama, and in classic TV mom fashion, Lucinda schemes. She calls Steven, pretending to need bookkeeping help, but the plan backfires. Steven finds out Lucinda's salon is bleeding cash and might not last the month.",
      "By the end of the episode, Lucinda crumbles, crying in front of Taylor. Her response seemingly sets the stage for their arc in Season 3: \u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out together.\u201d",
      "A Loss No One Can Forget",
      "While Susannah Fisher may be gone, her presence is felt everywhere.",
      "From the first scene of Season 3, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s still the emotional center of the show. Her death fractured the core group and sent each parent, and kid, on their own winding path through grief, growth and messy healing.",
      "\u201cShe was Laurel\u2019s biggest cheerleader and an instigator,\u201d Chung says. \u201cThe one who throws a party, who says, \u2018Come on, Laurel, let\u2019s dance.\u2019\u201d",
      "Her absence is felt in the quiet moments \u2014 Belly reaching for someone to guide her, Laurel learning how to open up and Adam trying to fill her shoes as a single parent. The memorial garden dedication in her name in Episode 3 brings the whole group back together, and it\u2019s her legacy that both unites and complicates them.",
      "Plus, there's a chance we'll continue to see more of Susannah in Season 3. The official X account for \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" shared photos of Rachel Blanchard on set, though it was unclear if she filmed scenes for the third season."

      "Jenna Bush Hager's August 2025 Read With Jenna book club pick is a coming-of-age tale \u2014 and a mystery.",
      "\"My Other Heart\" by Emma Nanami Strenner starts in the Philadelphia airport, where Mimi, a young mother, is waiting to return home to Vietnam with her 1-year-old daughter.",
      "After looking away for a few moments, Mimi looks back to see her daughter has vanished, and starts to panic. Unable to come up with the words to explain what happened in English, she winds up back in Vietnam, where she spends her life searching for her long lost daughter.",
      "Seventeen years later, two best friends Kit and Sabrina are spending their last summer before college together searching for who they are and their family histories \u2014 all while Mimi gets a lead in her search that brings her back to Philadelphia.",
      "\"I love this book so much. It\u2019s the story of mothers, daughters, friendship. It\u2019s full of heart and full of twists. I could not put it down,\" Jenna says.",
      "\"It\u2019s a deeply moving book about motherhood, identity and the invisible threads that connect us,\" she continues.",
      "\"My Other Heart\" by Emma Nanami Strenner",
      "Nanami Strenner tells TODAY.com her debut novel is about what happens when Kit, Sabrina and Mimi's worlds \"come together and collide.\"",
      "\"Kit and Sabrina want to head out into their summer and go and discover their roots and get to know themselves better,\" Nanami Strenner says. \"They have lots of ideas about who that might be, but they're also searching for a way to belong.\"",
      "\"And then 17 years earlier, a mother is in the Philadelphia airport and she tragically loses her child,\" she continues. \"It's how all these women's lives come together and collide, but it is a story that explores connection and the feeling of being seen \u2014 and not seen \u2014 when you are a teenager and when you're an adult, and it is about that yearning to belong.\"",
      "Nanami Strenner says the opening pages of the book were inspired by times she's been in foreign airports with her own daughter, and her fears of the worst case scenario.",
      "\"I've been in that situation so many times with my own daughter ... and I just remember being in really far flung countries where sometimes the people there didn't speak English, and I couldn't speak their language,\" Nanami Strenner says. \"It would be the most terrifying thing that she would get away from me and I wouldn't be able to do anything.\"",
      "\"I allowed myself to consider the worst case scenario in that which is what led me to the beginning of the novel,\" she adds. \"What if I was powerless and I didn't have language, and I had no means and ... I was in this situation where I was completely rendered helpless and unable to find the most precious thing in my life?\"",
      "Nanami Strenner says she began to get the idea for the full novel when she looked on how much time she's spent in airports in her own life, growing up in England before living in Japan, Vietnam and more, before landing in Philadelphia before the pandemic.",
      "\"I think all the threads started to come together \u2014 you're in this sort of strange purgatory when you're in an airport, because you're leaving a place behind while trying of move in to the next place,\" Nanami Strenner says. \"I think that's where the two girls, Kit and Sabrina, are in this sort of in betweenness themselves.\"",
      "\"While they're about to head out into adulthood, they don't understand exactly who they are ... and they're trying to grapple with themselves,\" she continues. All those pieces sort of came together when I was thinking about it.\"",
      "Nanami Strenner started writing the book in 2020, and would wake up every day at 5 a.m. to have two full hours of writing time before her daughter woke up until the first draft was completed.",
      "\"This is the most disciplined I've ever been in my life, and it's sort of not been fully repeated since,\" she jokes.",
      "One of the themes Nanami Strenner hopes readers explore after finishing \"My Other Heart\" is the question of nature versus nurture.",
      "\"From a parental point of view, that\u2019s really interesting, because we know so much more now about the impact of parents on children as they grow up,\" she says. \"But also, ideal nature versus how everything else has shaped us, I think that\u2019s a really interesting idea. That\u2019s actually at the center of the book too.\"",
      "\"Kit, for example, is a product of the society that she\u2019s brought up in, but she knows the nature inside is slightly different, because she\u2019s had this ambiguity about her background,\" she continues. \"And I think that\u2019s something that people could really sink their teeth into.\"",
      "Nanami Strenner, who now lives in London, says she was trying a new pizza shop near her neighborhood when she found out her novel had been chosen for Jenna's book club.",
      "\"My editor rang me and told me on the phone,\" she says. \"I just couldn't believe it. I was definitely like jumping up and down on the ground and just saying, 'Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!'\"",
      "Apart from some weird looks from her husband inside the restaurant before he knew what happened, she says it was \"the most amazing phone call to receive.\"",
      "Nanami Strenner adds that she hopes \"My Other Heart\" brings readers back to their adolescence and all the feelings that came with that time.",
      "\"I hope people enjoy it and it makes them feel hopeful and transports them somewhere,\" she says. \"Because I know that's what I always look for when I'm reading a novel.\""

    "story": [
      "Jennifer Love Hewitt realizes much of her work behind the camera shares a common theme.",
      "\"I feel like I am a person, in hopefully a healthy way, that finds themselves inspired by or interested in human stories of trauma,\" she says.",
      "In recent years, she\u2019s found herself telling stories about people, often women, after the hardest moments of their lives, whether it\u2019s through her \u201c9-1-1\u201d character; as Julie James in the sequel to \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d; or as the narrator of the new docuseries \u201cA Killer Among Friends.\u201d",
      "Hewitt says in an interview with TODAY.com, she found herself exploring this theme again and again \"by accident.\" But the similarities between her roles have never been more stark.",
      "In 2025's \"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\" Julie has long left Southport and is now a divorc\u00e9e college psychology professor specializing in the study of \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 trauma. But she's drawn back into the fray by Ava (Chase Sui Wonders), one of the group of 20-somethings being terrorized by the next killer to take up the fisherman's mantle.",
      "Without sharing too many spoilers, the film's ambitious finale sees Julie return to Southport for the first time after years of avoiding it \u2014 and face a killer once again. (She quite literally voices her mettle with a reprise of her line, \"What are you waiting for, huh?\")",
      "\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" hit theaters July 18. That same week, another one of Hewitt's projects hit the small screen.",
      "Hewitt is the narrator and executive producer of Investigation Discovery's \"A Killer Among Friends.\" The docuseries premiered July 14, with new episodes airing each Monday on ID and streaming the next day on HBO Max.",
      "The premiere episode, \"Killer on Campus,\" follows the 1994 slaying of University of Kentucky student Trent DiGiuro, which was the subject of a \"Dateline\" investigation in March 2019. The first scene shows one of DiGiuro's friends, Sean, return for the first time to the off-campus house where DiGiuro was murdered.",
      "Introducing the episode and the group of students at the center of it, Hewitt says, \"In the real world you never truly know who you can trust. Something evil was coming for them.\" Each episode will follow a friend group \"haunted by a murder of one of their own,\" the logline reads.",
      "\u201c(Trauma) seems to be a theme for me, and I\u2019m not really sure why,\u201d Hewitt says. \u201cI seem to gravitate towards it. Or it seems to be my universal lesson. So I embrace it.\u201d",
      "A Role She's Never Filled",
      "\"A Killer Among Friends\" seemingly relates to the original premise of \"I Know What You Did Last Summer.\" Even the posters for both projects feature a similar style, down to the title's font size and shape.",
      "\"I think that's probably why they thought of me, because I haven't really been in the true crime space. I've definitely produced things before, but I've never been a narrator,\" Hewitt says.",
      "Hewitt's narration moves the story along. She introduces each episode's central conceit, and if you hear her voice mid-episode, prepare for a plot twist or major reveal.",
      "I think trauma has been seen as a weakness. And I think my goal ... in being the narrator of this show and showing how these people have continued to live life because they got the chance to \u2014 you know, trauma can also be a strength.",
      "Jennifer Love Hewitt",
      "Becoming the narrator involved learning a brand-new skill, \"taking your face completely out of it, and trying with your voice to convey strength and fear,\" she says.",
      "\"I've been doing this business now for 36 years, and so to find something new that I haven't tried yet was exciting for me,\" she adds.",
      "But she has a confession.",
      "\u201cTruth be told, because I like to keep it real, I\u2019m not a big true crime watcher,\u201d she says. \u201cOnly because I get very freaked out by things very easily, and I\u2019m a mom of three children, so I just like to not go there sometimes.",
      "But reading the stories of the sources in \"A Killer Among Friends\" felt different, she says.",
      "\"It felt like these were stories that really held onto and captured an innocence and a human condition and a heart condition in the true crime space that maybe I hadn't really seen before,\" she says.",
      "\"I felt like that was what I could attach to,\" she continues, \"the vulnerability of our youth and the friend group angle in all of these stories, with these friends grappling with these things and being left behind and all these unanswered questions.\"",
      "Though the job marks a first for Hewitt, she cites one of her past roles with preparing her for the task: Melinda Gordon from \"Ghost Whisperer.\" In the CBS drama, which aired from 2005 to 2010, Melinda communicated with spirits and helped bring closure to people who had lost loved ones.",
      "\"I really did think about her a lot when I was narrating this,\" Hewitt says. \"My job in this was to not be on top of the story, or overdo the story, but to really just service these people's stories and endings, however sad they might be. But to also somehow pay respect and provide closure.\"",
      "She also sees similarities between the narrator role and her \"9-1-1\" character, Maddie, who works as a Los Angeles dispatcher on the ABC drama.",
      "\"Sometimes people pick on me for Maddie being a crier as a dispatcher, and I always have to say, 'It's a TV show. I'm supposed to be giving you emotion.' I know that if I really worked at 911, I would not be able to sob with people all the time,\" she says.",
      "But it was thinking about the reality of the dispatcher job that helped her while recording her lines in the booth.",
      "\"There were definitely a couple of times where I was reading things in the booth where I felt myself wanting to be emotional about it, and in my mind, had to remind myself that this was not the place,\" she says. \"I could feel that way later.\"",
      "'My Universal Lesson'",
      "Narrating \"A Killer Among Friends\" was far from easy.",
      "\"Knowing these stories are out there and happening to people, your heart breaks,\" Hewitt says.",
      "Asked how she puts that heaviness aside at the end of the day, Hewitt is blunt: \"When you have three children, there is no unwinding.\"",
      "Hewitt and husband Brian Hallisay became parents in 2013 after welcoming daughter Autumn. She went on to have two sons, Atticus, born in 2015, and Aidan in 2021.",
      "\"People ask me this question all the time about '9-1-1,'\" she says. \"You literally go from darkness into sneezing out rainbows and Skittles. That is just your job.\"",
      "\"But I do think that there is, thank God, a beautiful lift and light that is provided by my kids at the ends of days when I have to do heavy things, that I'm very grateful for,\" she adds.",
      "Hewitt says after finishing filming for \"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\" she went straight to narrating \"A Killer Among Friends,\" all while still filming for \"9-1-1\" Season 8. (As of at least July 24, filming for Season 9 is notably underway, per social media posts shared by the cast.)",
      "It was this summer, in the course of doing interviews for the various projects, that Hewitt says she's recognized the connecting factor of trauma in her work \u2014\u00a0Julie James as an \"active trauma live-r\"; Maddie, a survivor of kidnapping (twice!), postpartum depression, fire and more; a narrator who \"pushes past my trauma of having to know these stories.\"",
      "\"I'm 46 years old, I don't know that I would have put that piece together before now,\" she says.",
      "And there's her own trauma, which she says she experiences \"all the time, in little, tiny ways.\"",
      "\"My children have had trauma growing up in COVID and fires in L.A. and all those things,\" she says. \"I mean I just think it is something that we all have.\"",
      "Her approach to finding opportunities is to stay open.",
      "\"I don't look super hard for the things that I'm in or that I'm a part of,\" she says. \"I really try to just stay open and know that the right things will find me, and they have so far.\"",
      "While she didn't explicitly seek out stories of trauma, she's found power in each story's message. And she describes connecting to these roles, specifically to women \"strong in their broken pieces,\" like it's a purpose, a calling.",
      "\"I think trauma has been seen as a weakness,\" Hewitt says. \"And I think my goal ... in being the narrator of this show and showing how these people have continued to live life because they got the chance to\u00a0\u2014 you know, trauma can also be a strength.\"",
      "\"I think it is a beautiful, beautiful vulnerability to be able to say, 'I have trauma, and I make it work for me every day,'\" she adds. \"'Trauma and I hold hands, and we walk right on through it.' ... Hopefully I'm able to show, yes, they get knocked down, but they also get right back up.\""

      "From portraying Mama Morton in \"Chicago\" to most recently playing a bawdy pirate maid in the Tony-nominated musical \"Pirates! The Penzance Musical,\" Monsoon has been racking up stage accolades in spades, including a recent Drama League Award nomination among others.",
      "But according to the two-time winner of \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\" competitions, while trophies are nice, they aren't everything.",
      "\"Awards are great, and I've won a handful of awards in my life, and I want to win more,\" Monsoon says during a sit-down conversation with TODAY.com. \"But I've learned to not treat them like they are the end-all, be-all of things.\"",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really understand what it meant to die,\u201d Yahata said, \u201cbut the warmth I felt at us dying together \u2026 I still remember to this day.\u201d",
      "Three days after bombing Hiroshima, the U.S. unleashed a second atomic bomb on the city of Nagasaki that killed another 40,000 people immediately.",

      "From the ashes, Hiroshima was rebuilt into a busy city of more than a million people, drawing tourists from around the world.",
      "Near the hypocenter, where the bomb detonated about 2,000 feet above, is a peace memorial park and museum that includes the iconic atomic dome. Using virtual reality headsets, visitors can immerse themselves in the bombing and its brutal aftermath while touring the park.",
      "Yet, the bombing still feels visceral to Hiroshima survivors, who are called hibakusha, or \u201cbomb affected persons.\u201d Now more than 86 years old on average, they have spent most of their lives struggling with illness, depression and discrimination.",

      "The increase in spending on nuclear weapons contrasts with public attitudes about them. In a June survey of Americans by the Pew Research Center, 69% of respondents said the development of nuclear weapons had made the world less safe, compared with 10% who said it had made the world safer.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to push to \"occupy all of the Gaza Strip\" as ceasefire talks with Hamas founder and the hunger crisis in the besieged Palestinian enclave spirals.",
      "A bid by Netanyahu to occupy all of Gaza would follow similar calls from members of his far-right government upon whom his fragile coalition relies, and could mark a significant shift in policy since Israel withdrew from the territory in 2005.",
      "Officials from Netanyahu's office said in a statement shared with NBC News on Monday night that the Israeli leader had decided to \"occupy all of the Gaza Strip, including areas where hostages may be held.\"",
      "The statement was shared in Hebrew and the term used can be translated to mean both \"occupy\" and \"conquer.\" Netanyahu's office did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on the intended definition, but Israeli media, including The Times of Israel, reported that Netanyahu intended to \"fully occupy\" the enclave.",
      "Israeli media reported that Netanyahu would hold a limited security meeting Tuesday to discuss the future of Israel's campaign in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu had said Monday he planned to convene the security Cabinet this week to \"instruct\" the Israeli military on how to achieve the three war objectives laid out at the start of Israel's offensive in Gaza: defeating Hamas, seeing the release of hostages who remain held in the enclave and removing the threat of possible future attacks. Asked to confirm if the meeting would take place Tuesday, his office did not respond directly and referred NBC News to his comments Monday.",
      "While the Hamas-led attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, that left 1,200 dead and saw 250 taken hostages garnered worldwide sympathy for Israel, the country's actions in the territory have since sparked widespread international outrage.",
      "The United States remains the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, with American spending on Israel's military operations reaching more than $17.9 billion from Oct. 7 last year to Sept. 30, according to Brown University\u2019s Costs of War Project.",
      "There has been growing global alarm over Israel\u2019s actions in the enclave amid a hunger crisis caused by the offensive and strict restrictions on the entry of aid, marked by mounting deaths from starvation.",
      "The \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201c is unfolding in the Gaza Strip under Israel\u2019s assault, the world\u2019s leading body on hunger said last week. Meanwhile, most of its residents have been driven from their homes and more than 60,900 killed, including thousands of children, according to local health officials.",
      "Nearly 190 people in Gaza, including at least 94 children, have died from malnutrition since the war began, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza.",
      "There is mounting opposition to the war among Israelis. Many have long despaired over the fate of of the estimated 20 living hostages remaining in Gaza, and recent protests have expressed outrage over the children dying from malnutrition.",
      "Fears for the hostages were also fueled after Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad released imagery in recent days showing visibly gaunt Israeli hostages Evyatar David and Rom Braslavski.",
      "Earlier this month, a group representing hundreds of retired Israeli security officials that calls itself the Commanders for Israel\u2019s Security\u2019s leadership addressed a letter to President Donald Trump calling on him to pressure Israel to end the war.",
      "In the letter, which was confirmed to NBC News, the group said it was its professional judgment that Hamas no longer posed a strategic threat \u2014 and that it was time to \u201cend the war, return the hostages\u201d and \u201cstop the suffering.\u201d",
      "While the reoccupation of Gaza is largely unpopular with the Israeli public, it is supported on the far right.",
      "Over the weekend, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called for Israel to \"conquer\" Gaza to and to encourage Palestinians to leave the enclave.",
      "Ben-Gvir drew condemnation not only for his comments, but also for leading a group of worshippers in prayer at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Jews as Temple Mount, violating a decades-old agreement allowing Jews to visit to Jerusalem\u2019s most sensitive holy site but not to worship there.",
      "Ben-Gvir has repeatedly called for Israel to \"conquer\" Gaza, and called for rebuilding of Israeli settlements there alongside other right-wing ministers, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.",
      "Israel captured the Gaza Strip, then occupied by Egypt, after the 1967 war, but withdrew settlers \u2014 some of them forcefully \u2014 in 2005. In 2006, residents elected the Islamist militant and political group Hamas in legislative elections, precipitating clashes with the more secular Palestinian faction of Fatah. Hamas seized full control of the enclave in 2007."

      "Israel announced last Sunday it would pause military activity in some areas to allow more aid into Gaza following international outrage over widespread starvation and deaths from malnutrition caused by the Israeli military\u2019s offensive and aid restrictions.",
      "But humanitarian organizations say the amount of aid that has entered the enclave is not enough, and without more food, growing numbers of Palestinians will die from hunger.",
      "NBC News takes a look at how much aid has entered Gaza in the week since Israel announced the new system, and how that stacks up to the needs of the population.",
      "A tally of aid",
      "Humanitarian aid is entering Gaza in three ways: airdrops, distribution by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and through the United Nations and other aid organizations\u2019 using the newly formed \u201chumanitarian corridors\u201d the Israeli military put in place last week.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which began distributing aid  in the enclave in late May, has been widely condemned for the hundreds of people killed, often by Israeli soldiers, near its aid sites, and for its limited distribution.",
      "Last Sunday, GHF distributed around 1 million meals and at least another 1.2 million from Monday to Wednesday, and 1.3 million on Thursday. GHF did not appear to publish the number of meals distributed on Friday, but on Saturday said it released at least 1.7 million meals.",
      "In a population of roughly 2 million people, that averages out to around half a meal to just under a full meal per person per day.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military branch responsible for overseeing aid into Gaza, said Sunday that a total of 1,200 aid trucks had entered the enclave over the past week and that the same number had been collected by the United Nations and other aid organizations. It said that \"hundreds of trucks remain inside Gaza\" and were still waiting to be picked up.",
      "Before Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza began, around 500 trucks carrying aid were entering the enclave daily, according to the British Red Cross and other organizations.",
      "The below graph shows how the amount of aid entering Gaza soared during the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas before it stopped during Israel's blockade, with only a trickle entering in the months after it was lifted.",
      "Asked for the number of trucks allowed into Gaza and collected by humanitarian groups on Friday and Saturday, COGAT did not immediately respond.",
      "While COGAT has shared information about trucks entering Gaza and being collected by aid groups on its social media pages over the past week, it has not updated its online dashboard for aid into Gaza since Monday, despite international focus on the matter.",
      "According to the World Food Program, only about two-thirds of the amount of food the U.N. organization has requested Israeli authorities allow into Gaza had been approved as of Thursday since the Israeli military began tactical pauses.",
      "How Israeli restrictions caused the hunger crisis",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza drastically worsened in March after Israel imposed a blockade barring the entry of aid into Gaza, in the midst of its ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "Israel lifted the crippling blockade in May, but for months, it has allowed only a limited amount of aid to enter the enclave, most of which has been distributed by the U.S.- and Israel-backed group known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "COGAT did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accusation that the amount of aid entering Gaza is not enough. It has previously accused humanitarian groups, including the United Nations, of exacerbating hunger by failing to collect and distribute aid to Palestinians fast enough.",
      "However, humanitarian organizations have said efforts to distribute the limited aid they\u2019ve been able to get into Gaza has been hampered by Israeli restrictions. They\u2019ve also emphasized that even after Israel vowed to lift some restrictions last Sunday, the amount of aid entering the enclave remains limited.",
      "Meanwhile WFP has said it needs faster approvals and clearances to move trucks inside Gaza safely, as well as for Israeli military members to adhere to the \u201cestablished rules of engagement,\u201d including having no armed presence or shooting near humanitarian convoys, food distributions and operations.",
      "What is needed?",
      "\u201cThis is not an adequate response,\u201d Jeanette Bailey, the International Rescue Committee\u2019s global practice lead and director of research for nutrition, said in a phone interview on Wednesday.",
      "A gradual entry of aid \u201chere or there,\u201d she said, \u201cis not going to be adequate to prevent us from entering into a full-blown famine where the numbers of deaths go way, way up.\u201d"

      "\u201cThis allegation that these people are saying the lion was less than 6 years? We don\u2019t know that. Was there any DNA which was taken to prove that the lion was less than 6 years? The answer is definitely no,\u201d Tinashe Farawo told NBC News.",
      "This claim was backed up by Michael Blignaut, co-owner of Victoria Falls Safari Service, the company allegedly behind the killing of Blondie.",

      "U.S. health officials issued a warning to travelers about a mosquito-borne illness being transmitted in parts of southeast China.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there is an outbreak of chikungunya in Guangdong province. Most cases have been reported in the city of Foshan.",
      "Most people infected with the virus develop fever, joint pain, headache, muscle pain, rash, joint swelling and other symptoms, the CDC said Friday in a travel warning. Symptoms usually begin three to seven days after a person has been bitten by an infected mosquito.",
      "The CDC said most people recover in about a week, and there is no treatment. In some cases, severe joint pain can last for several months to years following acute illness.",
      "Newborns and older adults, as well as people with medical conditions such as heart disease and diabetes, are more prone to severe illness. Death is rare, the CDC said.",
      "China held a national conference last month on ways to prevent and treat the virus. From July 20 to July 26, 2,940 new local cases were reported in Guangdong province, China\u2019s National Health Commission said in a news release Thursday. The cases were mild, with no reports of severe illness or deaths.",
      "Insect repellents and wearing clothing that covers the skin can help protect people from mosquito bites. Vaccination is recommended for people who are visiting areas with outbreaks, the CDC said. There are two approved vaccines in the United States.",

      "The certificate filed in London also reportedly said Osbourne, the frontman of Black Sabbath, who was 76, suffered from coronary artery disease and Parkinson's disease, as previously known. The British tabloid The Sun was the first to report on his cause of death, later reported by The New York Times.",
      "Osbourne died July 22 of \"(a) Out of hospital cardiac arrest (b) Acute myocardial infarction (c) Coronary artery disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease with autonomic dysfunction (Joint Causes),\" the certificate reportedly says.",
      "Osbourne had spoken publicly about his ailments in the last several years of his life, including his battle with Parkinson's disease.",
      "\"I\u2019m taking it one day at a time, and if I can perform again, I will,\" he said in a November 2023 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, when he was 74.",
      "Osbourne told the magazine that he attributed some of his health issues to the vast amount of drugs and alcohol he did in his early career.",
      "\"I do count my lucky stars,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m still here and I do sometimes think I\u2019m on borrowed time. I said to Sharon the other day, 'What a great f---ing life we've had and what a great f---ing experience.'\"",
      "In the end, his health issues did not deter him from performing.",
      "A little more than two weeks before he died, Osbourne reunited with Black Sabbath bandmates Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward for what would be his final show \u2014 in Birmingham, England, his hometown.",
      "The concert drew a crowd of more than 45,000 to Birmingham\u2019s Villa Park soccer stadium. An additional 5.8 million metalheads watched the concert online around the world.",
      "Osbourne, dubbed \"The Prince of Darkness,\" performed the show on a bat-themed, black leather throne. His wife, Sharon Osbourne, revealed in February that he was unable to walk because of Parkinson\u2019s disease.",
      "His death prompted an outpouring of grief from a motley crew of prominent figures, including pop icon Elton John, rock star Jack White and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "Osbourne is credited as a pioneer who helped introduce the world to heavy metal music. Throughout his legendary career, he received five Grammy awards and was inducted into the Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll Hall of Fame twice, first with Black Sabbath and again as a solo artist.",
      "In the early 2000s, Osbourne re-introduced himself to the world, and particularly to a younger generation of fans, on MTV's \"The Osbournes.\" The reality series centered on Osbourne, his wife and two of his four children, bringing him into American pop culture in a brand-new light.",

      "The agreement, under which Rwanda would accept up to 250 migrants, was signed by U.S. and Rwandan officials in Kigali in June, said the Rwandan official, speaking on condition of anonymity, adding that Washington had already sent an initial list of 10 people to be vetted.",
      "\u201cRwanda has agreed with the United States to accept up to 250 migrants, in part because nearly every Rwandan family has experienced the hardships of displacement, and our societal values are founded on reintegration and rehabilitation,\u201d said the spokesperson for the Rwandan government, Yolande Makolo.",
      "\u201cUnder the agreement, Rwanda has the ability to approve each individual proposed for resettlement. Those approved will be provided with workforce training, healthcare, and accommodation support to jumpstart their lives in Rwanda, giving them the opportunity to contribute to one of the fastest-growing economies in the world over the last decade.\u201d",

      "In May, the foreign minister said Rwanda was in the early stages of talks to receive immigrants deported from the United States.",
      "The Trump administration argues that third-country deportations help swiftly remove some migrants, including those with criminal convictions. Immigration hardliners see third-country removals as a way to deal with offenders who cannot easily be deported and could pose a threat to the public.",
      "Opponents have criticized the deportations as dangerous and cruel, since people could be sent to countries where they could face violence, have no ties and do not speak the language.",
      "The Trump administration has pressed countries to take migrants. It deported more than 200 Venezuelans accused of being gang members to El Salvador in March, where they were jailed until they were released in a prisoner swap last month.",
      "The Supreme Court in June allowed the Trump administration to deport migrants to third countries without giving them a chance to show they could be harmed. But the legality of the removals is being contested in a federal lawsuit in Boston, a case that could potentially wind its way back to the conservative-leaning high court.",
      "Rwanda signed an agreement with Britain in 2022 to take in thousands of asylum seekers, a deal that was scrapped last year by then newly-elected Prime Minister Keir Starmer. No one was sent to Rwanda under the plan because of years of legal challenges."

      "Medvedev, who today serves as the deputy chairman of the country\u2019s Security Council and is known for issuing frequent apocalyptic threats on social media, was continuing a war of words that prompted President Donald Trump to redeploy two nuclear submarines last week.",
      "His latest warning came after the Russian Foreign Ministry announced it would no longer abide by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF, an agreement banning Washington and Moscow from deploying ground-based missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers (311 to 3,418 miles). It also comes days before the expiration of Trump\u2019s deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face additional tariffs.",
      "The INF was already obsolete, with the United States accusing Russia of violating the pact for decades and itself withdrawing from the agreement in 2019, and Russia has made little secret of its use of these missiles during its war with Ukraine.",

      "Medvedev said the withdrawal from the INF was \u201cthe result of NATO countries\u2019 anti-Russian policy\u201d \u2014 a reference to Moscow\u2019s long-standing claim that the Western military alliance is aggressively encircling Russia. \u201cThis is a new reality all our opponents will have to reckon with. Expect further steps.\u201d",
      "NATO did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his remarks.",
      "Last week, the former Russian leader became involved in a social media spat with Trump.",
      "While in Scotland, Trump reduced his initial 50-day deadline for Russia to cease fighting, instead giving it 10-12 days. Medvedev responded by saying that \u201ceach new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war\u201d between Russia and the U.S.",

      "But U.S. relations with India have instead come under strain over trade and other issues. Trump has threatened Apple and other companies that manufacture in India; moved closer to its biggest rival, Pakistan; and mocked India\u2019s \u201cdead\u201d economy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s threatening to undo, or at least hit pause on, what has been two decades of steadily improving relations between India and the U.S.,\u201d said Dhruva Jaishankar, executive director of the Observer Research Foundation America, a nonprofit group in Washington.",
      "On Monday, citing India\u2019s \u201cmassive\u201d purchases of Russian oil, Trump said he would \u201csubstantially\u201d increase the U.S. tariff on Indian imports, which is already one of the highest among Asian countries at 25%. Along with China, India is a top purchaser of Russian crude oil sanctioned by Western governments after Moscow\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "In a sharp response, India, a major U.S. security partner, said such criticism was \u201cunjustified and unreasonable\u201d and that it bought Russian oil with U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIndia began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict,\u201d the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement Monday. \u201cThe United States at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy markets stability.\u201d",

      "The bonhomie did not last long. Since then, Trump has needled India over a number of issues, including billions in investment by American companies as they shift manufacturing from China.",
      "Last quarter, India produced 44% of U.S. smartphone imports, more than any other country, including China, according to data from the research firm Canalys. That includes iPhones sold in the U.S., the majority of which Apple chief executive Tim Cook says will have India as their country of origin starting this quarter.",

      "Cozying up to India\u2019s foe",
      "A terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 26 people in April is another source of friction in U.S.-India relations.",
      "India responded by bombing neighboring Pakistan, which it has long accused of harboring terrorists, resulting in a four-day conflict that threatened to explode into a broader war fueled by decades of tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries.",
      "Trump irked India by repeatedly claiming that he had personally brokered a ceasefire. While Islamabad thanked Trump for mediating, India rejected claims of U.S. involvement, including in a call between Modi and Trump.",

      "\u201cThat has not gone down very well with Trump,\u201d he said.",
      "Within weeks, Trump hosted Pakistan\u2019s powerful army chief at the White House in an unprecedented meeting. He has also imposed a lower tariff rate on Pakistan of 19% and said the U.S. had reached a deal with Pakistan on exploring its oil reserves.",
      "Squeezed over Russia",
      "As Trump has expressed growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he has turned his attention to India\u2019s relationship with Moscow.",
      "For years, New Delhi has benefited from its \u201cnonaligned\u201d foreign policy, which allowed India to strengthen U.S. ties while continuing its long-standing relationship with Russia, one of its main suppliers of energy and military equipment.",
      "When Russian oil was hit with Western-led sanctions over Ukraine, India \u2014 the third-largest energy consumer in the world after China and the U.S. \u2014 seized the opportunity to buy it at a discount, which even U.S. officials said helped stabilize global oil prices.",

      "The U.S. position on India\u2019s oil purchases appears to have reversed under Trump, who said in a social media post last week that India and Russia \u201ccan take their dead economies down together.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are now at a stage where the American ability to control Russia and its allies is beginning to impact India,\u201d Palit said.",
      "Jaishankar said that while Trump\u2019s actions won\u2019t push India out of America\u2019s orbit, they could drive India to strengthen ties with other countries such as China. During a meeting of their foreign ministers in Beijing last month, India and China agreed to resume direct flights between their countries for the first time in five years.",
      "Despite the recent setbacks in their relationship, India will continue to engage with the U.S. as a key strategic and technological partner, said Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",

      "JERUSALEM \u2014 The Israeli Cabinet on Monday voted unanimously to fire the attorney general, escalating a long-running standoff between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the judiciary that critics see as a threat to the country\u2019s democratic institutions.",
      "The Supreme Court froze the move while it considers the legality.",
      "Netanyahu and his supporters accuse Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara of exceeding her powers by blocking decisions by the elected government, including a move to fire the head of Israel\u2019s domestic security agency, another ostensibly apolitical office. She has said there is a conflict of interest because Netanyahu and several former aides face a series of criminal investigations.",
      "Critics accuse Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, of undermining judicial independence and seeking to concentrate power in the hands of his coalition government, the most nationalist and religious in Israel\u2019s history. Netanyahu denies the allegations and says he is the victim of a witch hunt by hostile judicial officials egged on by the media.",
      "An attempt by Netanyahu\u2019s government to overhaul the judiciary in 2023 sparked months of mass protests, and many believe it weakened the country ahead of Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack later that year that triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a prominent watchdog group, said it filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court following Monday\u2019s vote. It said more than 15,000 citizens have joined the petition, calling the dismissal \u201cillegal\u201d and \u201cunprecedented.\u201d",

      "A global \u201cplastics crisis\u201d is costing governments and taxpayers $1.5 trillion annually as they try to cope with escalating injuries, disability and deaths as the substance pollutes our land, seas and bodies, according to a new report by a leading medical journal.",
      "Plastic production is on course to triple by 2060, less than 10% of it is recycled, and around 8,000 megatons now pollute the planet, according to a review of recent studies published Sunday by The Lancet.",
      "That causes harm at every stage of its lifecycle: from the extraction of fossil fuels and production to its use by humans and eventual disposal into the environment, the British publication said.",
      "\u201cPlastics are a grave, growing, and under-recognised danger to human and planetary health,\u201d it said. \u201cPlastics cause disease and death from infancy to old age\u201d and are \u201ccontributing to climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss.\u201d",
      "The harms \u201cfall disproportionately upon low-income and at-risk populations,\u201d it added.",
      "It is the latest dire warning by experts about the ubiquity of and threat posed by plastic, which the journal called \u201cthe defining material of our age.\u201d After decades of scientists\u2019 warning about plastic being found in the oceans and rivers, microplastics are now being discovered inside humans \u2014 including in breast milk and brain tissue.",
      "Sunday\u2019s release marked the start of a new monitoring system called \u201cThe Lancet Countdown on health and plastics,\u201d which it says will track political attempts to combat the problem.",
      "It was launched to coincide with the latest and final round of talks in Geneva, where 175 countries are trying to forge the world\u2019s first Global Plastics Treaty.",
      "Campaigners hope the talks, running Tuesday through Aug. 14, will result in mandatory targets to reduce plastic production. A group of countries, including China, Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia, have opposed the measures, instead lobbying for increased plastic recycling.",
      "According to The Lancet, such petrochemical giants are a \u201ckey driver\u201d of spiraling plastic production as they pivot their businesses toward plastic in response to the global decline in demand for fossil energy.",
      "Different plastics are made from up to 16,000 chemicals, which \u201center the human body via ingestion, inhalation, and dermal absorption,\u201d often from food and drink containers and packaging, the study said.",
      "Unborn babies, infants and young children are \u201cespecially at risk,\u201d with harms including miscarriage, physical malformations, reduced cognitive function and diabetes, it said. For adults, the risks include cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer.",
      "\u201cGiven the considerable gaps in knowledge of plastic chemicals, it is reasonable to conclude that the full extent of these chemicals\u2019 harms to health is underestimated and that the burden of disease currently attributed to them is undercounted,\u201d it said.",
      "The Lancet quoted one study estimating the global costs of those diseases as $1.5 trillion.",
      "\u201cIt is now clear that the world cannot recycle its way out of the plastic pollution crisis,\u201d The Lancet said. \u201cControl of the plastics crisis will require continuing research coupled with the science-driven interventions \u2014 laws, policies, monitoring, enforcement, incentives, and innovations.\u201d"

      "On Thursday, Yu Zidi became the youngest-ever medalist at the World Aquatics Championships, which are being held in Singapore this year. On Sunday, she finished fourth in the women's 400 individual medley final.",
      "Yu was part of the Chinese team that took bronze in the women\u2019s 4x200-meter freestyle relay, with the United States winning silver and Australia winning gold. Though she did not compete in the final, she received a medal because she swam in the qualifying race.",
      "\u201cI was really excited to join the relay. It felt great,\u201d Yu told reporters Thursday. \u201cThe World Championships are fun, and I hope to swim faster.\u201d",
      "The Chinese prodigy began swimming around age 6 just to beat the heat in her home province of Hebei. She said she never thought about becoming a professional athlete until a coach approached her at a swimming pool one day.",
      "\u201cAt the time, I thought: why not give training a try?\u201d Yu told Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency, in May.",
      "Yu, who is also the youngest person to medal at a major international competition since 1936, swims so fast that she qualified for the World Aquatics Championships even though the minimum age requirement is usually 14.",
      "She came close to medaling in three other events in Singapore, missing the podium by 0.06 seconds in the women\u2019s 200-meter medley Monday, 0.31 seconds in the women\u2019s 200-meter butterfly Thursday and 0.50 seconds in the women\u2019s 400-meter individual medley on Sunday.",
      "At the Chinese national championships in May, Yu finished the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 2:10.63, winning a silver medal and setting a world record in the event for any 12-year-old, male or female.",
      "Hailed as the world\u2019s greatest swimmer her age, Yu has been compared to phenoms such as Canada\u2019s Summer McIntosh, who won four golds in Singapore including the 400-meter medley. Though Yu came in fourth, she is already swimming that event about 15 seconds faster than McIntosh was at the same age.",
      "Her stunning performance before she\u2019s even a teenager has many wondering how she might shape competitive swimming in the years to come.",
      "But some Chinese sports fans and commentators have urged the public not to overhype the preteen rising star.",
      "Yu\u2019s sudden fame may expose her to \u201cdisproportionate\u201d pressure that could keep her from achieving her full potential, the state-backed digital news outlet Shanghai Observer said in an editorial Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe must let this 12-year-old grow her splash slowly into a wave,\u201d it said, adding that there is \u201cno need to rush into hero worship.\u201d",
      "The warning hinted at a shift in how China promotes its elite athletes in the wake of persistent doping allegations and what has been criticized as a \u201ctoxic\u201d fan culture.",
      "Success at the highest levels of sport has been central to China\u2019s construction of national identity, with the government focused on  dominating medal tables at the Olympics and other events.",
      "But the push for gold medals also puts a lot of stress on the countries\u2019 star athletes, as does the intensity of public scrutiny.",
      "Organized sports fandom first emerged around 2016 when Chinese social media users, jaded by sex scandals that had tarnished the wholesome image of pop stars they previously adored, began following Olympic athletes instead, said Zhang Bin, a veteran sports commentator in China.",
      "The new fans brought \u201csophisticated strategies\u201d from the entertainment industry, setting off \u201cfandom wars\u201d among different groups that tried to outdo each other in supporting their athletes, Zhang said.",
      "China\u2019s extreme sports fan culture, which can include fan mobs, cyberbullying of athletes and heckling behavior at sports events, was especially visible around the Paris Olympics last year.",
      "When gold-medal-winning diver Quan Hongchan returned to her hometown, visitors flocked to her home for days. Some livestreamed with their phones while others flew drones, and travel agencies even started offering tours of her village.",
      "Pan Zhanle, an Olympic champion swimmer, was praised for disbanding his official fan group after his success at the Paris Games overwhelmed him with a surge of new followers.",
      "The Chinese government has been cracking down, with its cyberspace watchdog saying in April that it had shut down over 3,700 social media accounts with illegal or noncompliant content aimed at Chinese athletes.",
      "But sometimes the frenzy goes beyond the internet. Chinese table tennis player Fan Zhendong, an Olympic gold medalist, said he was traumatized when a stranger sneaked into his hotel room in 2023.",
      "\u201cI never thought, as an athlete, I would have to go through something like this,\u201d he told Phoenix TV last week, adding that organized online abuse had caused him \u201csevere\u201d mental stress that contributed to several unexpected losses.",
      "Since sports prodigies naturally attract followers, fan groups could also be a concern for Yu in the future, said Zhang, who was at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore.",
      "China is often overprotective of its athletes, but it \u201cmay not be a good thing if Yu is living in isolation like protected giant pandas,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor athletes, learning to interact with the media is a necessary part of their development,\u201d Zhang added.",
      "Jessie Zhou, 23, a graduate student in Hong Kong who closely follows table tennis star Fan, said it was a \u201cgood call\u201d for Chinese media to cover Yu in a \u201crestrained tone\u201d while extreme sports fandom remains unresolved.",
      "\u201cJust let the kid stay focused on training,\u201d Zhou said."
