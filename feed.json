      "There was concern that attendance and overall interest in women\u2019s college basketball would drop this year with the departure of Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and other stars for the WNBA",
      "There was concern that attendance and overall interest in women\u2019s college basketball would drop this year with the departure of Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and other stars for the WNBA.",
      "Both took a dip -- but only a dip.",
      "With JuJu Watkins and Paige Bueckers and a host of other standout players leading the way, attendance across the country was just short of last season's record numbers in women's hoops and still the second-highest ever.",
      "More networks showed more games on TV this season and ratings were strong heading into March Madness that starts this week. ESPN will have the lion's share of tournament games again, but Fox increased its footprint in the sport with five games in primetime on Saturday nights and 18 total on the network.",
      "\u201cThere are great stars, great brands, we\u2019ve done more than we have done before and we\u2019re not alone in doing that,\u201d Fox Sports President of Insights and Analytics Mike Mulvihill said. \u201cThe 3-5-10 year trend clearly is an upward trend.\u201d",
      "While the network\u2019s overall ratings are down from last season\u2019s record mark that was due in large part to Clark being on Fox a lot, Mulvihill is happy with where they are.",
      "\u201cTo go from zero exposures a few years ago to 18 on our biggest platform speaks to the growth and interest in the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s growing confidence in this building that we can put it on broadcast and justify it. I love that we are able to put games on in primetime. It means something to the coaches and players.\u201d",
      "Having great matchups helps. The game between Watkins\u2019 USC and Bueckers\u2019 UConn on Dec. 21 was shown in primetime after an NFL game and averaged 2.2 million viewers, peaking at nearly 3.8 million. That was the second-most watched women\u2019s game on the network behind only Clark\u2019s game last year when she set the NCAA scoring record.",
      "The network also helped spearhead two new tournaments this year with the Champions Classic and the Coretta Scott King Invitational. Both were renewed for next season.",
      "CBS showed the third matchup of the season between UCLA and USC, two of the top teams in the country, in the Big Ten title game and it drew 1.44 million viewers, trailing only last season's league championship which saw Clark and Iowa win.",
      "ESPN had big numbers with regular-season ratings up 3% from last year and 41% from two seasons ago. This was the most watched year for the network before the NCAAs since 2008-09 (the network didn't have many of Clark\u2019s regular-season games at Iowa last season).",
      "A doubleheader on Feb. 16 was huge for ESPN: UConn vs. South Carolina drew 1.8 million viewers while LSU vs. Texas had 1.7 million. In all, 15 games on ESPN networks averaged over 500,000 viewers, the most in a single year.",
      "ESPN, which owns the rights to the NCAA Tournament and shows women's games every week during the season, has faith that March Madness will deliver.",
      "Women's basketball programming director Dan Margulis knows that the network had a perfect storm last season to achieve the record ratings that saw the women's championship game outdraw the men. Clark, a generational player, had guided Iowa back to the championship game where they were facing an undefeated South Carolina team looking for its own place in history.",
      "\u201cWe're looking at early rounds and everything growing going into it,\u201d Margulis said. \u201cCompared to two years ago, we see that growth.\u201d",
      "It wasn't just the championship game that drew huge numbers. A rematch between Reese and Clark in the Elite Eight game was massive as well.",
      "\u201cCertainly the floor has risen dramatically,\u201d said lead ESPN announcer Rebecca Lobo. \u201cThe expectation for this year\u2019s tournament, Final Four or national championship shouldn\u2019t be what we saw a year ago. Will it be better than pre-Caitlin? That floor should be much higher than it was.\u201d",
      "While there isn't an undefeated team this year or a generational player like Clark on her last run, there is more parity in the sport.",
      "People aren\u2019t just watching on TV, but also showing up at games. The power conferences had strong attendance marks. The SEC led the way, setting numerous conference records, including total for its tournament and the mark in both the semis and the finals.",
      "The Big Ten had its second-highest average attendance in the last 15 years.",
      "\u201cGranted we get to see some of the best ones, but the energy was different throughout the country,\u201d Lobo said. \u201cThe South Carolina-LSU game on a Thursday night with 2,500 students has a different energy. The increase from students across the country has made for incredible environments.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has dismissed the charges against a Minnesota man accused of hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d Prosecutors informed the court Monday that he died Sunday",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- A federal judge dismissed the charges Monday against a Minnesota man accused of hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in the 1939 musical \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d after prosecutors informed the court that he died on Sunday.",
      "Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of Crystal, who had been in poor health with lung disease and other ailments, had been scheduled to change his plea to guilty in January but that hearing was postponed indefinitely after he was hospitalized.",
      "Federal prosecutor Matthew Greenley notified the court in a one-page motion Monday that Saliterman died Sunday but did not say how or where. U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz granted the request and dropped the charges.",
      "Defense attorney John Brink confirmed Monday that his client had died but declined to give details. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Fargo, North Dakota, which is handling the case, did not immediately return a phone call seeking further information.",
      "According to court filings, Saliterman was hospitalized in early January \"for inability to walk and sepsis,\u201d an infection that can be life-threatening. He attended his arraignment three days later via video from what looked like a hospital room. In an update to the court late last month, Brink told the court that his client had been discharged to a hospice facility and that his prognosis was poor. An accompanying letter from his doctor listed severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen and Parkinson's disease.",
      "Saliterman was in a wheelchair and on oxygen last March when he made his first court appearance. He was charged then with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering for his role in the ruby slippers case.",
      "The sequined red slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million in December, according to Heritage Auctions. The slippers were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only three other pairs remain.",
      "Terry Jon Martin, now 78, of Grand Rapids, used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum\u2019s door and display case to steal them. According to his attorney, an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But he got rid of the slippers when he learned they were fake, and they ended up with Saliterman. Martin pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health."

      "Her family and agent told the news agency Agence France-Presse that Dequenne died Sunday of a rare cancer in a hospital outside of Paris. In 2023, Dequenne revealed she had been diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma. Representatives for Dequenne did not immediately respond to inquires from The Associated Press on Monday.",
      "Dequenne was only 18 when she was selected as best actress at Cannes in 1999. In \u201cRosetta,\u201d from Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, she portrayed a teenager trying to escape her difficult life in a caravan park with an alcoholic mother. The film also won the Palme d\u2019Or that year.",
      "Born in Bel\u0153il, Belgium, in 1981, Dequenne had a performance streak from a young age. She studied drama at the Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Baudour.",

She was also nominated for several C\u00e9sar Awards throughout her career, finally winning best supporting actress in 2021 for the romantic comedy \u201cLove Affair(s).\u201d",
      "Speaking to The Guardian in 2013 about the difficult role in \u201cOur Children,\u201d she said, \u201cFor my part I went home every weekend, and stayed with my family, which is a very safe place. Making a film like that is something that you have to survive.\u201d",
      "More recently, she co-starred in \u201cClose,\u201d Lukas Dhont\u2019s tender boyhood drama, which brought her back to Cannes again in 2022. She saw similarities between her young co-star and her own breakout role with \u201cRosetta.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor me to be here and to come back here after 23 years, it\u2019s very emotional and there is like a reflection between Eden (Dambrine) and myself because I remember when I was here the first time with \u2018Rosetta,\u2019\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cIt was like a very powerful movie with this main character, which is in every scene, every, every shot. And that\u2019s the same for him.\u201d",

      "While she loved taking on work in England, France and Belgium, she had little interest in Hollywood.",
      "\u201cI have been to Hollywood and had meetings, but really they don\u2019t do the kind of films I like to make. And everything is kind of boring, no?\u201d she said in the interview with The Guardian. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s not a fun place, or at least not my kind of fun.\u201d",

      "Former reality TV star Jessie Holmes has won the longest-ever Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in Alaska",
      "NOME, Alaska -- Jessie Holmes, a former reality television star, won the longest-ever Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race on Friday, celebrating with fist pumps to a cheering crowd and posing for photos with his two floral wreath-adorned head teammates, Hercules and Polar.",
      "Holmes was first to the finish line in the Gold Rush town of Nome, on the Bering Sea coast. The race began March 3 in Fairbanks after a lack of snow forced changes to the route and starting point.",
      "That made the normally 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race a staggering 1,129 miles (1,817 kilometers) across the Alaska wilderness. Holmes finished in 10 days, 14 hours, 55 minutes and 41 seconds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words, but it\u2019s a magical feeling,\" Holmes said shortly after crossing the finish line. \u201cIt\u2019s not about this moment now. It\u2019s about all those moments along the trail.\u201d",
      "Holmes, who was competing for the eighth time, previously finished in the top 10 five times, including third last year and in 2022. In his first Iditarod, in 2018, his seventh-place finish earned him Rookie of the Year honors.",
      "Born and raised in Alabama, Holmes left at age 18 and worked as a carpenter in Montana for three years. He arrived in Alaska in 2004 and found adventure running dogs on a remote location of the Yukon River.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a truly amazing 10 days and I soaked in every part of it \u2014 the lows, the highs, the in-betweens. ... I\u2019m really proud of these dogs and I love them. And they did it. They deserve all the credit,\" Holmes said.",
      "He gave a special salute to his two lead canines, Hercules, his half-sprint dog, and Polar, saying, \u201cHe's the brains behind the operation.\u201d",
      "Holmes now lives in Nenana, where he works as a carpenter and lives a subsistence lifestyle. From 2015 through 2023, he was a cast member of \u201cLife Below Zero,\u201d a National Geographic program that documents the struggles of Alaskans living in remote parts of the state.",
      "Besides the lack of snow north of the Alaska Range that forced the change of starting point to Fairbanks, race organizers also had to make changes to the ceremonial start in Anchorage.",
      "With snow trucked in to cover streets in the state\u2019s largest city, the usual parade route there was shortened from 11 miles to under 2 miles (from about 18 kilometers to under 3.2 kilometers), and the number of dogs was reduced.",
      "Only 33 mushers started in Fairbanks, tied with 2023 for the smallest field ever. The drop in participants has raised concerns about the viability of the race, which has had to contend with inflation, climate change and pressure from animal rights groups.",
      "One dog died in this year\u2019s Iditarod: a pregnant female on the team of musher Daniel Klein, who under race rules scratched due to the death.",
      "Nearly a third of the mushers quit early, including eight who scratched and two who were withdrawn for not being competitive."

      "The estate of deceased actor Gene Hackman is seeking to block the public release of autopsy and investigative reports related to the deaths of Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa, especially photographs and video",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- A representative for the estate of actor Gene Hackman is seeking to block the public release of autopsy and investigative reports, especially photographs and police body-camera video, related to the recent deaths of Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa after their partially mummified bodies were discovered at their New Mexico home in February.",
      "Authorities last week announced Hackman died at age 95 of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease as much as a week after a rare, rodent-borne disease \u2014 hantavirus pulmonary syndrome \u2014 took the life of his 65-year-old wife.",
      "Hackman\u2019s pacemaker last showed signs of activity on Feb. 18, indicating an abnormal heart rhythm on the day he likely died. The couple's bodies weren't discovered until Feb. 26 when maintenance and security workers showed up at the Santa Fe home and alerted police, leaving a mystery for law enforcement and medical investigators to unravel.",
      "Julia Peters, a representative for the estate of Hackman and Arakawa, urged a state district court in Santa Fe to seal records in the cases to protect the family's right to privacy in grief under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, emphasizing the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media.",
      "The request, filed Tuesday, also described the couple's discrete lifestyle in Santa Fe since Hackman's retirement. The state capital city is known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors.",
      "The couple \"lived an exemplary private life for over thirty years in Santa Fe, New Mexico and did not showcase their lifestyle,\u201d the petition said.",
      "New Mexico's open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of people who are deceased, said Amanda Lavin, legal director at the nonprofit New Mexico Foundation for Open Government. Some medical information also is not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.",
      "At the same time, the bulk of death investigations by law enforcement and autopsy reports by medical investigators are typically considered public records under state law in the spirit of ensuring government transparency and accountability, she said.",
      "\u201cI do think it does infringe on transparency if the court were to prohibit release of all the investigation records, including the autopsies,\u201d Lavin said Thursday. \u201cThe whole idea of those records being available is to ensure accountability in the way those investigations are done.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is also a public health concern given that hantavirus was involved,\u201d Lavin said.",
      "She said the preemptive request to prevent the release of government records on constitutional grounds is unusual.",
      "Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cHoosiers\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym."

      "Ted Lasso the character was first introduced by Sudeikis in 2013 to promote NBC Sports' coverage of the England Premier League. In a short film, Lasso was the coach of London's Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. It was quickly clear that he knew little \u2014 if anything \u2014 about soccer.",
      "\u201cThey're gonna play hard for all four quarters,\u201d Lasso said of the players in a mock press conference. \u201cDo we have any goals this season? Absolutely. We're gonna win a lot of games and we're gonna get in the playoffs.\" \u201cThere's no playoffs\u201d a reporter corrected from the audience.

      "MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- The mayor of Miami Beach, Florida, wants to terminate a lease and cut financial support for an independent film theater that screened an Oscar-winning documentary about the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.",
      "Mayor Steven Meiner introduced a resolution describing the film \u201cNo Other Land\u201d as antisemitic. City commissioners will discuss the resolution Wednesday during their next meeting.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d opened last Friday at O Cinema, located at the Miami Beach Historic City Hall. Meiner had reached out several days before the premiere to discourage O Cinema CEO Vivian Marthell from showing the film.",
      "\u201cThe City of Miami Beach has one of the highest concentrations of Jewish residents in the United States,\u201d Meiner said in his letter to Marthell. \u201cThe \u2018No Other Land\u2019 film is a one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents.\u201d",
      "Marthell initially agreed not to screen the movie in a response to Meiner, but the showing went on as scheduled.",
      "\u201cMy initial reaction to Mayor Meiner\u2019s threats was made under duress,\u201d Marthell said in a email Thursday. \u201cAfter reflecting on the broader implications for free speech and O Cinema\u2019s mission, I (along with the O Cinema board and staff members) agreed it was critical to screen this acclaimed film.\u201d",
      "O Cinema has always been committed to sharing films that not only entertain, but also challenge, educate and inspire meaningful dialogue, Marthell said.",
      "\u201cWe understand the power of cinema to tell stories that matter, and we recognize that some stories \u2014 especially those rooted in real-world conflicts \u2014 can evoke strong feelings and passionate reactions. As they should,\u201d Marthell said. \u201cOur decision to screen \u2018No Other Land\u2019 is not a declaration of political alignment. It is a bold reaffirmation of our fundamental belief that every voice deserves to be heard.\u201d",
      "In December and January, the city of Miami Beach executed two grants worth about $80,000 for O Cinema, according to the mayor's proposed resolution. About half the money has already been paid, but the resolution would stop the rest. The city began leasing space to O Cinema in 2019 with the ability to terminate the contract with 180 days of notice, which is what Meiner is seeking to do.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which was shot between 2019 and 2023 and released last year, was directed by a group of Israeli and Palestinian filmmakers: Basel Adra, Hamdan Ballal, Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.",
      "\u201cWhen the mayor uses the word antisemitism to silence Palestinians and Israelis who proudly oppose occupation and apartheid together, fighting for justice and equality, he is emptying it out of meaning,\u201d Abraham said in an email. \u201cI find that to be very dangerous.\u201d",
      "The film documents the destruction of Palestinian villages in the West Bank by the Israeli military. It won the Academy Award for best documentary feature as well as earlier awards.",
      "While the film has earned wide praise from film critics, it has also drawn controversy.",
      "\u201cFreedom of expression is an important value, but defamation of Israel into a tool for international promotion is not art,\u201d Israeli culture minister Miki Zohar said in a social media post."

      "DETROIT -- Who killed Donald Goines?",
      "Producers of a documentary on the life of the prisoner-turned urban fiction writer of novels about the violence, drugs and prostitution that he surrounded himself with in Detroit are hoping the answer hasn't been lost to time \u2014 or the streets.",
      "It's been more than 50 years since Goines and his common-law wife, Shirley Sailor, were found shot to death on Oct. 21, 1974 in their flat in Highland Park, a small enclave of Detroit. Each had been shot five times. Their two young children were home at the time of the killings.",
      "Goines was 37.",
      "No arrests were made and rumors swelled. Some speculated the killings had something to do with Goines' heroin addiction. Others nodded to the theory that the fictional subjects of his novels appeared a bit too much like the real-life hustlers, pimps, drug dealers and stickup men who prowled the city's streets.",
      "\u201cThere have been at least a half-dozen, quite possibly a dozen, elements of speculation as to how Mr. Goines and the mother of his children were murdered,\u201d said Bill Proctor, a private investigator hired to find the killer or killers. \u201cBut no one has come forward with enough information to charge the persons responsible.\u201d",
      "Proctor said a $5,000 reward being offered by the producers of the documentary might help \u201cshake the trees\u201d and find \u201csomeone who might still be alive or have an understanding\u201d of the facts of the case.",
      "Goines wrote 16 books over a span of several short years. His raw, stark and undiluted writings are filled with the urban street life imagery of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "\u201cDopefiend,\u201d was published in 1971. Fifteen more including \u201cStreet Players,\u201d \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d and \u201cKenyatta's Last Hit,\u201d would follow over the next three years. The titles and the content resonated with many Black readers, especially in Detroit where Goines' books often held prominence on living room coffee tables and bookshelves.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his books, I can visualize \u2014 I can picture what he\u2019s writing about,\u201d said his daughter, Donna Sailor. \u201cHe was so descriptive about what he wrote. That\u2019s kind of like how it was back then.\u201d",
      "Donna Sailor was 2 when her parents were killed. She doesn\u2019t remember anything about the shooting or her parents.",
      "\u201cWe would see friends of the family that knew my dad and my mom,\u201d Sailor, 52, told The Associated Press Thursday. \u201cThey would say she was a sweetheart, and she was funny and had a great smile.\u201d",
      "Less information about Goines was volunteered, though, she added.",
      "\u201cNo one ever went into great detail about him. They would say he was a nice guy,\u201d said Sailor.",
      "The urban lit genre dates back at least to 1967, and the release of the memoir \u201cPimp,\u201d written by Robert Maupin, who also was in jail when he began writing under the name Iceberg Slim. Maupin built a large word-of-mouth following and one of his readers was Goines. Generations later, hip-hop stars like Tupac Shakur were also inspired by the books and have referenced Goines and Iceberg Slim in their recordings. Shakur even once declared: \u201cMachiavelli was my tutor, Donald Goines my father figure.\u201d",
      "Goines' parents owned a clothes-cleaning and other businesses in Detroit and were part of the city's Black middle class. He enlisted in the Air Force and spent time in Korea and Japan during the Korean War. It was there Goines became addicted to heroin, according to various reports on his life.",
      "After his time in the military, Goines returned to Detroit in the mid-1950s. He drifted into the city's criminal underbelly, finding himself jailed for various crimes.",
      "Holloway House published Goines' novels from 1971 to 2008, according to current publisher Kensington.",
      "Under Kensington, Goines books have sold about 500,000 copies in print, alone. He consistently is one of Kensington's top reordered authors and his books have been \u201cselling at a stronger pace\u201d since it launched a reissue program in 2020, according to the company.",
      "Robert (Tape) Bailey and Craig Gore are the driving forces behind the documentary which is expected to be released by the end of the year. Both read Goines\u2019 books while incarcerated, separately.",
      "Bailey, 49, was born in Detroit and now lives in Los Angeles. He spent time in federal prison as young man for possession with intent to deliver drugs in Ohio.",
      "Goines wrote in detail about things he had witnessed firsthand, Bailey said.",
      "Gore, 51, of Los Angeles, stumbled onto Goines while serving time for burglary and theft. He says that through the $5,000 reward, they hope to bring more accuracy to the documentary.",

      "Craig describes Henry's versatility as an actor as \"like a jazz musician... It\u2019s fantastic for a writer, because you can throw him all kinds of added moments, and he\u2019ll incorporate and use them all.\u201d",
      "When the opportunity to star in \u201cDope Thief\u201d came about, Henry was ready for that long-awaited break \u2014 from TV. He wrapped \u201cAtlanta\u201d and had \u201cabout two days off\u201d before going into another FX show, \u201cClass of \u201809,\u201d where he played a character\u2019s past, present and future, and he was exhausted.",
      "\u201cTelevision is hard, you know? Like, I hear myself complaining about it; I know it\u2019s a first world problem, but you get very attached when you\u2019re doing a series. You're living with the character for quite a long time.\"",
      "So, there Henry was at 3 a.m. on a night shoot of \u201cClass of \u201809,\" wearing prosthetics as his character\u2019s future self, when his manager presented him with the script for \u201cDope Thief.\u201d \u201cWithin the first 10 pages I was incredibly attracted to Ray and also the bond he has with Manny.\u201d",
      "Time off otherwise really hasn't been his thing (hence the laughter), but Henry is quick to remind that he\u2019s had two long breaks from acting. One was during the lockdown phase of the pandemic, and the other was during the Hollywood strikes.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re a person that\u2019s constantly on the move and the universe tells you to sit your (expletive) down, you kind of have to listen,\u201d said Henry. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have stopped had the universe not said stop.\u201d",
      "Production was underway on \u201cDope Thief\u201d when the Hollywood guild strikes were called in 2023. Henry opted to stay in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t go anywhere. I made sure to be there just in case,\" said Henry, who for the first time was an executive producer on the project. He wanted to be close in proximity to his local crew. They had a cookout with bouncy castles. \u201cI would explore, or we'd go tubing and I would drive to this little town called New Hope that has a wonderful ice cream shop called Moo Hope. It was truly amazing to be present and experience that part of life for myself.\u201d",
      "Henry doesn't just bond with the crew on his sets but actors too, often walking away with new friends who happen to be very famous, like, say, Julia Roberts \u2014 whom he's currently filming a movie with in London. \u201cShe's somebody I truly cherish,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never going to stop being weird to me,\" Henry admits. \u201cThe part that is really hard for me \u2014 that I\u2019m still fighting with \u2014 is when they tell me they\u2019re fans of my stuff and I\u2019m just like, \u2018Shut up!\u2019 I literally say it to their face.\u201d",
      "The biggest revelation about working alongside these accomplished actors is that Henry is now one of them.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, now, these are my peers, these are my contemporaries, and I can\u2019t continue to act like they\u2019re not. I can\u2019t continue to act like I have to shrink myself to fit in these spaces. I no longer have to do that. And what I also love is that they\u2019ll reaffirm that for me, too ... and that's the great part.\u201d"

      "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t a part of the first case",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein 's #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who was not a part of the first case.",
      "But at a key pretrial hearing Wednesday, the disgraced movie mogul\u2019s lawyers cautioned that because Weinstein\u2019s 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction was overturned, the past isn't prologue \u2014 it's almost entirely irrelevant.",
      "\u201cWe can take that transcript and all the judge\u2019s rulings and throw them in the garbage,\" Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Arthur Aidala, argued. \u201cThat trial was declared illegal by the highest court in this state.\"",
      "New York\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction last year, setting the stage for a retrial starting April 15 in state court in Manhattan. Prosecutors say it could take about five weeks.",
      "How the retrial will play out began to take shape Wednesday as Judge Curtis Farber ruled on a number of outstanding issues, including expert testimony and the language used to describe the accusers.",
      "Farber granted a prosecution request to call a psychologist, Dawn Hughes, as an expert witness on the psychological and traumatic effects of rape and sexual assault. Hughes previously testified for actor Amber Heard at Johnny Depp\u2019s libel trial against Heard in 2022 and as a prosecution witness in singer R. Kelly\u2019s federal sex trafficking trial in Brooklyn in 2021.",
      "The judge also granted a defense request to preclude the term \u201csurvivor\u201d from being used to describe Weinstein\u2019s accusers. He told prosecutors to instruct any police officers who testify to refer to the women as \u201ccomplaining witnesses\" instead.",
      "While Weinstein\u2019s convictions from the first trial were thrown out, his acquittals on the most serious charges \u2014 two counts of predatory sexual assault and first-degree, or forcible, rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Given that, Farber ordered prosecutors to instruct one of the accusers testifying at the retrial not to used the word \u201cforce\u201d when describing her alleged assault.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office had wanted to exclude any mention of Weinstein\u2019s acquittals and vacated conviction, but Farber said he could be obligated to clue them in depending on how the accuser testifies.",
      "\u201cDoes she have to use the word force? She can describe what happened and let the jury draw its own conclusions?\u201d the judge asked. \u201cI am not asking her to change her testimony from the first trial. I am asking her to refrain from using the word force.\"",
      "Other decisions were made behind closed doors as Farber met with the prosecution and defense for more than an hour in his chambers to discuss matters still under seal.",
      "They included a prosecution request that two of the three accusers in the case be allowed to testify about other alleged encounters with Weinstein. They also discussed evidence of the accusers' sexual history, which prosecutors say should be barred under New York's Rape Shield Law.",
      "Weinstein, 72, was in court for Wednesday\u2019s proceedings, arriving from jail in a wheelchair and suit and holding a stack of documents. Before the public portion of his hearing began, the ex-studio boss watched as Farber spent a few minutes resolving another matter that had been delayed by their closed-door discussions.",
      "At his last court appearance in January, Weinstein had implored Farber to start the retrial sooner.",
      "He told the judge \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold on\u201d with cancer, heart issues and harsh conditions at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex, where he is locked up. Farber said he may hold jury selection a few days sooner if a murder trial he's overseeing wraps up ahead of schedule.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013. The additional charge, filed last September, alleges he forced oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "Prosecutors said in court papers that the woman, who has not been identified publicly, came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison, but they revisited them and secured a new indictment after his conviction was thrown out.",
      "Farber ruled in October to combine the new indictment and existing charges into one trial.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors prejudiced him by waiting nearly five years to bring the additional charge, suggesting they had elected not to include the allegation in his first trial so they could use it later if his conviction were reversed.",
      "Weinstein has denied that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone.",
      "In vacating Weinstein\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge, James M. Burke, unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Burke is no longer on the bench and such testimony won't be part of the retrial.",
      "Weinstein was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, but his lawyers appealed in June, arguing he did not get a fair trial.",

      "A beloved reindeer in Alaska's biggest city is fighting for his life after falling mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- An iconic reindeer so beloved that he has been in parades, featured on reality TV shows and visited by schoolchildren on field trips in Alaska's largest city is fighting for his life after mysteriously falling ill after someone tampered with his pen.",
      "Ever since, 8-year-old Star has had pneumonia, digestion issues and rapid weight loss. Star's owner, Albert Whitehead, has taken him to a veterinarian every other day to receive care and in hopes of finding a cause for the issues.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve done everything possible for him,\u201d Whitehead said. Veterinarian Sabrieta Holland said she the reindeer's prognosis is \u201cguarded.\u201d",
      "Star lives in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house at the edge of downtown Anchorage. It\u2019s been over 20 years since someone last tried to tamper with the enclosure where reindeer named Star have been kept for the last seven decades. Star is the seventh in a line of reindeer to carry that name.",
      "In early January, someone cut a huge hole in the fencing to gain entrance, spending about five minutes inside with Star before taking off. What the person did in the pen is unknown, but Star began having stomach issues and dropping weight shortly after.",
      "Then, on Feb. 20, Anchorage police found the friendly and trusting reindeer wandering around downtown and returned him home.",
      "When Whitehead reviewed his security cameras, he found someone had used bolt cutters to remove padlocks off Star\u2019s pen and an alley gate. Star followed the man out into the neighborhood, and the reindeer wound up alone downtown, familiar streets because that's where Whitehead walks him.",
      "The next night, the situation turned more serious.",
      "Whitehead was watching the video feed when a man wearing a scarf over his face sprayed something from two different cans into Star\u2019s pen and twice hit the reindeer in the face with an unknown substance.",
      "Whitehead rushed outside to confront the man.",
      "\u201cI yelled at him to stop, \u2018What the hell are you doing? What are you spraying on the animal? Don\u2019t do that, quit that!\u2019\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "The man replied: \u201cI\u2019m trying to help Star.\"",
      "\u201cI have no idea what he meant by that,\u201d said Whitehead, who suspects \u2014 based on the smells \u2014 that the sprays could have been a disinfectant and deodorizer.",
      "Whitehead and police believe it was the same man from the prior night. It\u2019s not known if the January tampering involved the same person.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the individual wanted to harm Star, but by his actions, he did,\u201d Whitehead said.",
      "Anchorage police posted the surveillance video on social media in hopes it would lead to the suspect\u2019s identity. So far, no viable tips have come in, spokesperson Christopher Barraza said in an email.",
      "Star's pneumonia worsened, and a cough leads Whitehead to believe Star ate something harmful, perhaps while loose.",
      "The pneumonia is likely due to him accidentally inhaling the chronic reflux or regurgitation of the contents in the largest of the reindeers\u2019 four stomachs, Holland said. The sprays possibly also contributed.",
      "It\u2019s possible there\u2019s a blockage, but the largest stomach of a reindeer is quite big and not easily obstructed, Holland said. However, ingested plastic bags causing chronic weight loss and indigestion problems are the most common foreign objects she's seen in reindeer.",
      "The next option would be surgery to look at the reindeer's abdomen and possibly remove any blockage, but it\u2019s generally a poor outcome, even in healthy deer, she said.",
      "The bond between Whitehead and Star is \u201cquite significant and precious,\" Holland said.",
      "\"Albert\u2019s daily life and reason for getting out for walks and such all are because of Star. And Star is really fond of Albert, too,\u201d Holland said in a text. \u201cIt will be quite devastating for him if he loses Star.\u201d",
      "Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart started the reindeer tradition, bringing the deer they received from an Alaska Native herder to Anchorage in the 1950s. Whitehead took over as caretaker from his friends in 2002.",
      "The average lifespan of a reindeer is about 15 years, but some Stars had long lives, like the first who lived to 23. Others didn't live as long, including the second Star, who was stolen, beaten to death and then butchered by a known Fairbanks meat thief. The third Star died after eating a plastic bag."

      "If an algorithm designed a classic, big-screen spectacle for the small-screen age, \u201cThe Electric State\u201d probably wouldn\u2019t be too far off the mark.",
      "This is an Amblin-inspired, big-budget adventure with dystopian, science-fiction wonder, nostalgic callbacks, well-liked stars (Chris Pratt! Millie Bobby Brown! Stanley Tucci! Giancarlo Esposito! Ke Huy Quan!) and the directors ( Joe and Anthony Russo ) behind some of the highest-earning movies of all time.",
      "In theory, it should work. A kid on a dangerous, cross-country journey with a robot that may or may not be her brother whom she thought was dead? A reluctant, jaded adult companion who\u2019s quick with a one-liner? \u201cThe Electric State\u201d should be some future Spielberg\u2019s new favorite movie, the one that they\u2019ll reference in their Oscars speech as the thing that made them want to make movies. And yet it\u2019s lacking a spark and a soul that might distinguish it as memorable or special. Worse, considering everything it has going for it (including a reported budget that may have exceeded $300 million), \u201cThe Electric State\u201d is kind of dull.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was loosely based on an illustrated novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag that was released in 2018 and quickly scooped up for movie adaptation purposes with Marvel veterans Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely writing the script. Set in the early 1990s, this is a world in which service robots have risen up and demanded rights and freedom. The humans respond by going to war.",
      "This four-year war is skimmed over in a montage at the start of the film and, by 1994, Mr. Peanut (Woody Harrelson) is signing a peace treaty with Bill Clinton and the remaining robots are exiled to rot in the desert. The human victory was attributed to the drone creations of a Steve Jobs-ian tech billionaire Ethan Skate (Tucci), who is soon hawking his \u201cNeurocasters\u201d to the public. They scoop it up and soon society is just a bleak wasteland of screen zombies content to let their avatars work while they relax and fantasize a way out of their downtrodden existence.",
      "There are shades of \u201cThe Creator,\u201d \u201cWALL-E,\u201d \u201cReady Player One\u201d and many, many more films in here. But no one gets mad that something is derivative if it\u2019s also good. It\u2019s only when the kitchen sink references are so clear and come up so short that it becomes a real problem.",
      "Brown plays Michelle, an angry, orphaned teenager who lost her entire family not in the war, but in a car wreck. The one she misses the most is her little brother Christopher (Woody Norman, giving the best, most emotionally authentic performance in the film), a reluctant child prodigy. One day, a robot of a cartoon character they used to watch together turns up at her foster home, speaking only in the character\u2019s catchphrases. But after some gestures toward a photograph, she starts to believe that this robot is, somehow, Christopher, or at least someone who can lead her to the real Christopher. And thus starts their journey across America, and into the robot \u201cexclusion zone\u201d to figure out this puzzle. They soon team up with a war veteran/smuggler Keats (Pratt) and his snarky robot sidekick (Anthony Mackie, for your Marvel bingo card) and try to evade Esposito\u2019s robot bounty hunter.",
      "The robots they find in the exclusion zone are voiced by an army of celebrities you\u2019ll go insane trying to place before angrily resorting to IMDb, including Harrelson, Hank Azaria, Brian Cox and Jenny Slate. Their designs are thoughtful and remarkable and should evoke a sense of awe in the viewer at the sheer ingenuity behind this film, where many of the most impressive shots seem to be the recreations of St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s illustrations of dismantled, decaying robots. The action, however, gets mind-numbingly repetitive by the end of the bloated runtime.",
      "Pratt and Brown, while fine individually, don\u2019t really find their groove as partners on this journey either. Pratt is kind of just doing his thing and gets the few clever one-liners in the script. Brown, meanwhile, seems a little bored by yet another teen adventure role. And both ultimately look like movie stars in '90s cosplay, which might be a metaphor for the larger failure of the movie.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State\u201d was, of course, not made by algorithm, which is an admittedly cheap shot for a Netflix original. Unfortunately, it just feels that way.",
      "\u201cThe Electric State,\u201d a Netflix release streaming Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csci-fi violence/action, language and some thematic material.\u201d Running time: 128 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

      "President Donald Trump's team is looking at locations for a post-administration presidential library, and Florida may take that spot",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump's team is already looking for locations for his presidential library, and Florida may be a top contender.",
      "A Florida legislator said Monday that the state has a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d of getting its first presidential library.",
      "Presidential libraries are significant for post-administration historical archives depicting materials from a former president's term. They require years of planning and don't use federal funding.",
      "Here are a few things to know about a potential Trump presidential library:",
      "The state Senate Rules Committee on Wednesday unanimously backed Sen. Jason Brodeur's bill that he said would \u201cprevent any municipality or county from imposing frivolous obstacles to the establishment of a presidential library within the state.\u201d",
      "Brodeur said other states that built presidential libraries had construction roadmaps created to follow state and local laws, and Florida would need the same. He also said all former presidents are welcome to put a presidential library in Florida, not just Trump.",
      "\u201cI anticipate that this will be a pretty popular attraction. It is somebody who\u2019s likely even the most famous developer in the world right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Brodeur's bill comes as Trump's team is looking at several South Florida universities \u2014 including Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University \u2014 as potential spots for a presidential library.",
      "A secretary at the FAU president\u2019s office said she had not heard of any plans for a presidential library and declined to comment further. Spokespeople for FAU and FIU, and the White House press office didn't immediately respond to messages about possible plans for a presidential library.",
      "Traditionally, such libraries are built in the state where a president was born or grew up. Trump, though, was born in New York, which voted against him in three straight presidential elections and which made him the first former president to be convicted of felonies last year.",
      "Trump now primarily lives in Florida, and he's filled his administration's ranks with politicians and others from the Sunshine State.",
      "Democrats raised concerns in committee hearings about whether local residents would bear the costs of the library's construction. Brodeur said all costs of building the library, including the planning costs, would fall to the president and library archives.",
      "In December, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward a Trump presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit. In the agreement, ABC News described the payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution\u201d to an escrow account being managed by Trump's attorney.",
      "That's would amount to a small fraction of the overall cost of building the library. For example, former President Barack Obama\u2019s library in Chicago was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Little is known about what would be in a Trump presidential library, but materials in these libraries usually include documents, artifacts or items significant to a president\u2019s administration.",
      "Earlier this month the Justice Department returned the boxes coming from the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago home in 2022 for classified documents. Trump said in a Truth Social post that these boxes were being sent to Florida, where they \u201cwill someday be part of the Trump Presidential Library.\u201d"

      "For George Woodhouse (Michael Fassbender), who's preparing for four colleagues, plus himself and his wife, Kathryn St. Jean (Cate Blanchett), who, like him, is a high-level operative, it\u2019s chana masala with a few drops of truth serum.",
      "\u201cWill there be any mess to clean up?\u201d Kathryn asks her husband as they\u2019re getting ready.",
      "\u201cWith any luck,\u201d he responds.",
      "So goes much of the crackling patter of \u201cBlack Bag,\u201d Steven Soderbergh\u2019s delicious marital drama cloaked as a sleek spy thriller. Lean and taut, the 93-minute \u201cBlack Bag\u201d is more a sizzling amuse-bouche than full-course meal, but it\u2019s simmered to perfection.",
      "George and Kathryn, as fellow agents at London\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, don\u2019t seemingly have what you might call a traditional marriage. Each has their own secret ops, leaving large swaths of their lives off limits to the other. When George asks where Kathryn is flying off to on Wednesday, she shrugs with a smile, \u201cBlack bag.\u201d",
      "In the movie\u2019s opening scene \u2013 a slinky tracking shot that trails George into and out of a nightclub \u2013 an agent named Meacham (Gustaf Skarsgard) gives him the assignment to track down the mole, with the added wrinkle that Kathryn can\u2019t be dismissed as a possible suspect. A cyber-worm device called Severus that\u2019s capable of hacking into nuclear facilities has gone missing. The fate of the world, as it so often is, is said to be at stake.",
      "But, really, the state of George and Kathryn\u2019s marriage is what interests us. Extreme though their situation is, their union is one that, like any couple, is built on trust and devotion, even if their professional lives demand the inverse. When George, lying on top of Kathryn tells her he\u2019d do anything for her, she coos, \u201cWould you kill?\u201d It's a fair-enough test to the bounds of wedded bliss, sure, but her second question matters even more. \u201cWould you lie?\u201d",
      "Over that dinner \u2013 a scintillating set piece around a darkened dinner table inside their London town house \u2013 we can quickly gather just how much the truth means to George. He\u2019s renown for his powers with a polygraph. As a youngster, he even brought down his own father, uncovering his affair. \u201cI don\u2019t like liars,\u201d George says through clenched teeth.",
      "They\u2019re joined by Colonel James Stokes (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page); the in-house psychologist Dr. Zoe Vaughan (Naomie Harris); the carousing spy Freddie Smalls (Tom Burke); and the newest NCSC recruit, cyber specialist Clarissa (Marisa Abela). Both are paired off in clandestine relationships that quickly emerge, among other secrets. More than state secrets, infidelity dominates the conversation.",
      "Fassbender\u2019s spook is an agent of precision. He wears gleaming black-framed glasses. When only a few drops of sauce land on his cuff, he immediately withdraws to change his shirt. Hard as it would seem, Fassbender has found a character almost as dispassionate and monotone as his methodical assassin in David Fincher\u2019s \u201cThe Killer.\u201d",
      "This time, though, he's not a loner. Blanchett\u2019s Kathryn is kept more at a remove from us. She\u2019s mysterious and aloof \u2013 a femme fatale, maybe, we\u2019re led to wonder. An \u201caroma of hostility\u201d accompanies her, Zoe tells her in a psych evaluation. Is she the mole?",
      "This is an insular film, taking place mainly in crisply composed interiors, aside from the lake George occasionally fishes for bass in. There, in a fitting encapsulation of a movie full of smooth surfaces with currents twisting underneath, the camera gently rests on the water's surface.",
      "\u201cBlack Bag\u201d follows a run of agilely directed thrillers by Soderbergh made with screenwriter David Koepp ( \u201cPresence,\u201d \u201cKimi\u201d). They are both at the height of their almost-too-easy powers; the script, especially, is peppered with delectable dialogue. Their movie adopts the air of menace and suspicion of a John Le Carr\u00e9 novel, yet hinges on the sturdiness of its married couple, like a super spy version of Nick and Nora from \u201cThe Thin Man\" or a more cerebral \u201cMr. & Mrs. Smith.\u201d",
      "All of the supporting players \u2013 while they make up a fine ensemble \u2013 are ultimately playthings in their game of love. In a casting coup, a former James Bond \u2013 Pierce Brosnan \u2013 drops in late in the film as Arthur Stheiglitz, the head of NCSC. In his handful of scenes, Brosnan is rageful and ferocious, chomping into both Ikizukuri (prepared live fish) and the scenery.",
      "His presence both enlivens a movie already humming with the uber-cool chemistry of Blanchett and Fassbender while transforming \u201cBlack Bag\u201d into a twisty rejoinder to that notoriously skirt-chasing spy. Here, Mr. Bond, is how sexy monogamy can be.",
      "While directing a satellite to peer down upon his wife on some unknown mission in Europe, George explains their mystifying dynamic to Clarissa: \u201cI watch her, and she watches me. If she gets into trouble, I will do everything in my power to extricate her.\u201d",
      "In her response, Clarissa speaks for everyone: \u201cThat\u2019s so hot.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlack Bag,\u201d a Focus Features release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language including some sexual references, and some violence. Running time: 93 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "The hero at the heart of \u201cNovocaine\u201d can't feel pain",
      "Nathan Caine may not be able to feel pain, as the tagline for the new action-comedy \u201cNovocaine\u201d reads, but the same does not apply to audiences.",
      "Although he doesn\u2019t scream when his leg is impaled with an arrow or when he sticks his hand in a vat of frying oil, you might. I certainly did. Out loud. In a theater. With other people. There may have been some phrases uttered entirely involuntarily too. Were other people reacting in the same way, I wonder? I couldn\u2019t hear them over my own groans. Hooray for the communal experience, I guess?",
      "This is, in some ways, a film for people who thought John Wick wasn\u2019t stabby enough. It delights in the relentless mutilation of its hero, a regular guy (played by Jack Quaid ) with a rare condition that has rendered him immune from feeling any sort of discomfort to bodily harm. Unlike such high concept premises as \u201cCrank,\u201d congenital insensitivity to pain analgesia (or CIPA) is actually real. But it\u2019s not exactly a superpower, Nate explains. He can still die; it just might be because he hasn\u2019t emptied his bladder in many hours. Or because he's accidentally bitten his tongue off eating a sandwich. These are real concerns of his.",
      "His entire existence is devoted to preventing these kinds of crises, mostly through tried-and-true baby proofing techniques like using tennis balls on sharp corners. Like Kelly Ripa before a show, he only consumes \u201cnon-chewing food.\u201d",
      "Work is stable and dull as an assistant manager at a bank. And dating is out of the question; He spends most of his free time playing online video games. Quaid, even with his two movie star parents, is somehow believable as this cautious introvert, though everything is played with a light touch and a wink. The movie, written by Lars Jacobson and directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, even begins with the mournful R.E.M. anthem \u201cEverybody Hurts.\u201d",
      "Then Nate\u2019s life is changed one day when a pretty teller at the bank, Sherry (Amber Midthunder), asks him out to lunch, then to drinks and even spends the night. The next morning, things get even crazier: Sherry is taken hostage after a violent robbery at the bank. These guys are capital B bad (led by fellow nepo spawn Ray Nicholson) killing both the bank manager the cops outside. So what does Nate do? He steals a cop car and attempts to save her himself.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d pleads an injured cop as Nate hesitates before apprehending the car. It\u2019s hard to argue with the cop: Why not just let the professionals handle it, understaffed though they may be over the Christmas holiday? It would be a rather short and pointless movie if he did just leave it to the cops, but the impetus for this quest is a stretch to say the least. The conceit is missing some extra justification of why he felt like he was the only one who could do it, especially once he actually talks to said cops (Betty Gabriel and Matt Walsh).",
      "Like many things in \u201cNovocaine,\u201d it simply exists to open more avenues for his torture. This involves a fight in a restaurant kitchen, a visit to a tattoo parlor to get more information on one of the robbers, and a stop by a booby-trapped house. The script is self-aware enough to throw in a \u201cHome Alone\u201d reference, though not before you\u2019ve made one in your head.",
      "On the heels of some bad action comedies like \u201cLove Hurts,\u201d \u201cNovocaine\u201d is pretty enjoyable. It might have been born in the same elevator pitch incubator (what if non-stop violence!), but it\u2019s executed with some style and understanding of comedic timing. In one clever sequence, Nate persuades his psychotic captor to torture him as slowly as possible, buying time until his friend gets there as he pretends to feel the pain. \u201cNovocaine\u201d also kind of overstays its welcome, stretching on too long with too many endings. Still, it\u2019s an easy, if not entirely painless, watch.",
      "\u201cNovocaine,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cstrong, bloody violence, language throughout, grisly images). Running time: 110 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "A new study out Monday finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef is no less carbon-intensive than industrial beef",
      "For cattle fattened in fields instead of feedlots, the grass may be greener, but the carbon emissions are not.",
      "A study out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef produces no less planet-warming carbon emissions than industrial beef. The finding calls into question the frequent promotion of grass-fed beef as a more environmentally friendly option. Still, other scientists say grass-fed beef wins out on other factors like animal welfare or local environmental pollution, complicating the choice for conscientious consumers.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a large portion of the population who really do wish their purchasing decisions will reflect their values,\u201d said Gidon Eshel, a research professor of environmental physics at Bard College and one of the study's authors. \u201cBut they are being misled, essentially, by the wrong information.\u201d",
      "When it comes to food, beef contributes by far the most emissions fueling climate change and is one of the most resource- and land-intensive to produce. Yet demand for beef around the world is only expected to grow. And carefully weighing the benefits of grass-fed beef matters because in most parts of the world where beef production is expanding, such as South America, it\u2019s being done by deforesting land that would otherwise store carbon, said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Experts say this study's finding makes sense because it's less efficient to produce grass-fed cattle than their industrial counterparts. Animals that are fattened up in fields instead of feedlots grow more slowly and don't get as big, so it takes more of them to produce the same amount of meat.",
      "The researchers used a numerical model of the emissions produced across the process of raising beef, then simulated many herds of industrial and grass-fed cattle. It compared differences in how much food they would eat, how much methane and carbon dioxide they would emit and how much meat they would produce. Those differences mirror real-life scenarios; cattle in arid New Mexico and lush northern Michigan have different inputs and outputs.",
      "Eshel and his team also analyzed previous studies that examined how much cattle grazing promotes carbon storage, but found that even in the best-case scenarios, the amount of carbon that grasses could sequester didn\u2019t make up for the emissions of the cattle.",
      "Randy Jackson, a professor of grassland ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, said he has found similar results in his own research showing that grass-fed beef has higher emissions assuming the same demand. In fact, Eshel's team cited his work. But he worries that the study is too focused on minimizing emissions \u201cwithout concern for the environmental impacts beyond GHG load to the atmosphere,\u201d like biodiversity and soil and water quality, he wrote in an email.",
      "The American Grassfed Association, a nonprofit membership group for producers of grass-fed livestock, did not immediately provide a comment on the study.",
      "Jennifer Schmitt, who studies the sustainability of U.S. agricultural supply chains at the University of Minnesota and also wasn't involved in the study, said she thinks the paper \u201chelps us get a little closer to answering the question of maybe how much beef should we have on the landscape versus plant proteins,\u201d she said.",
      "Schmitt said maybe if beef was scaled back on a large enough scale and if farmers could free up more cropland for other foods that humans eat, the localized environmental benefits of grass-fed cattle could make up for the fact that they come with higher emissions.",
      "It would be harder to convince Eshel, however. He thinks climate change is \u201csecond to none\u201d when it comes to global problems and should be prioritized as such.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time imagining, even, a situation in which it will prove environmentally, genuinely wise, genuinely beneficial, to raise beef,\" Eshel said.",
      "For consumers who truly want to be environmentally conscious, he added, \"don't make beef a habit.\"",

      "Now the Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, has again halted food deliveries to a sprawling camp of over 20,000 people outside Tigray\u2019s regional capital, Mekele.",

In addition to life-saving food, the funds were spent on HIV medications, vaccines, literacy programs and jobs creation, as well as services for 1 million refugees hosted by Ethiopia.",

      "Aid agencies in Ethiopia had to apply to USAID for waivers to continue handing out U.S. grain. These have been secured, but USAID\u2019s payments system is still not functioning.",
      "As a result, a consortium of aid agencies in Tigray has had to stop distributions to the over 1 million people it has been responsible for feeding with U.S.-provided grain. It has no money to pay for fuel, trucks and drivers to distribute existing food stockpiles.",
      "That includes 5,000 metric tons of sorghum \u2013 enough to feed 300,000 people for a month \u2013 stuck in a storage facility in Mekele that could rot before it reaches those in need.",
      "\u201cThis is just one warehouse. There are several others across the region,\u201d said Teklewoini Assefa, head of the Relief Society of Tigray, part of the consortium. \u201cThis will create malnutrition, disease. If this situation continues, what follows? Death.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cEverything boils down to the payment system.\u201d",

      "Now, aid workers say many programs to improve nutrition have halted. Projects to deliver medicines and vaccines have stopped. Dozens of camps for displaced people have had water sources cut off.",
      "\u201cThe impact has been huge,\u201d said Ashenafi Asmelash, executive director of Mums for Mums, which has had two USAID- funded programs terminated. One helped build long-term resilience among farmers. The other helped improve the nutrition of children and new mothers.",

The aid cuts, which affect governments and their partners in the non-governmental sector, have shut down or disrupted projects tackling diseases ranging from malaria to AIDS.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump Administration's quest to \u201cMake America Health Again\u201d is targeting ultraprocessed foods",
      "In the Trump administration\u2019s quest to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d there may be no bigger target than ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation\u2019s new health secretary, has cited \u201chighly chemically processed foods\u201d as a chief culprit behind an epidemic of chronic disease in the U.S., including ailments such as obesity, diabetes and autoimmune disorders.",
      "Such foods are \u201cpoisoning\u201d people, particularly children, Kennedy said during Senate confirmation hearings. He has vowed to work to remove such foods from federal programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.",
      "\u201cI will do everything in my power to put the health of Americans back on track,\u201d he told lawmakers.",
      "Key to that goal, however, could be making sure that consumers understand basic facts about ultraprocessed foods and the role they play in daily meals.",
      "From sugary cereals at breakfast to frozen pizzas at dinner, plus in-between snacks of potato chips, sodas and ice cream, ultraprocessed foods make up about 60% of the U.S. diet. For kids and teens, it\u2019s even higher \u2014 about two-thirds of what they eat.",
      "That\u2019s concerning because ultraprocessed foods have been linked to a host of negative health effects, from obesity and diabetes to heart disease, depression, dementia and more. One recent study suggested that eating these foods may raise the risk of early death.",
      "Nutrition science is tricky, though, and most research so far has found connections, not proof, regarding the health consequences of these foods.",
      "Food manufacturers argue that processing boosts food safety and supplies and offers a cheap, convenient way to provide a diverse and nutritious diet.",
      "Even if the science were clear, it\u2019s hard to know what practical advice to give when ultraprocessed foods account for what one study estimates is more than 70% of the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Associated Press asked several nutrition experts and here\u2019s what they said:",
      "Most foods are processed, whether it\u2019s by freezing, grinding, fermentation, pasteurization or other means. In 2009, Brazilian epidemiologist Carlos Monteiro and colleagues first proposed a system that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo, not by nutrient content.",
      "At the top of the four-tier scale are foods created through industrial processes and with ingredients such as additives, colors and preservatives that you couldn\u2019t duplicate in a home kitchen, said Kevin Hall, a researcher who focuses on metabolism and diet at the National Institutes of Health.",
      "\u201cThese are most, but not all, of the packaged foods you see,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Such foods are often made to be both cheap and irresistibly delicious, said Dr. Neena Prasad, director of the Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 Food Policy Program.",
      "\u201cThey have just the right combination of sugar, salt and fat and you just can\u2019t stop eating them,\u201d Prasad said",
      "However, the level of processing alone doesn\u2019t determine whether a food is unhealthy or not, Hall noted. Whole-grain bread, yogurt, tofu and infant formula are all highly processed, for instance, but they\u2019re also nutritious.",
      "Here\u2019s the tricky part. Many studies suggest that diets high in such foods are linked to negative health outcomes. But these kinds of studies can\u2019t say whether the foods themselves are the cause of the negative effects \u2014 or whether there\u2019s something else about the people who eat these foods that might be responsible.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods, as a group, tend to have higher amounts of sodium, saturated fat and sugar, and tend to be lower in fiber and protein. It\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s just these nutrients that are driving the effects.",
      "Hall and his colleagues were the first to conduct a small but influential experiment that directly compared the results of eating similar diets made of ultraprocessed versus unprocessed foods.",
      "Published in 2019, the research included 20 adults who went to live at an NIH center for a month. They received diets of ultraprocessed and unprocessed foods matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients for two weeks each and were told to eat as much as they liked.",
      "When participants ate the diet of ultraprocessed foods, they consumed about 500 calories per day more than when they ate unprocessed foods, researchers found \u2014 and they gained an average of about 2 pounds (1 kilogram) during the study period. When they ate only unprocessed foods for the same amount of time, they lost about 2 pounds (1 kilogram).",
      "Hall is conducting a more detailed study now, but the process is slow and costly and results aren\u2019t expected until late next year. He and others argue that such definitive research is needed to determine exactly how ultraprocessed foods affect consumption.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s better to understand the mechanisms by which they drive the deleterious health consequences, if they\u2019re driving them,\u201d he said.",
      "Some advocates, like Prasad, argue that the large body of research linking ultraprocessed foods to poor health should be more than enough to spur government and industry to change policies. She calls for actions such as increased taxes on sugary drinks, stricter sodium restrictions for manufacturers and cracking down on marketing of such foods to children.",
      "\u201cDo we want to risk our kids getting sicker while we wait for this perfect evidence to emerge?\u201d Prasad said.",
      "Last year, former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf broached the subject, telling a conference of food policy experts that ultraprocessed foods are \u201cone of the most complex things I\u2019ve ever dealt with.\u201d",
      "But, he concluded, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have the scientific basis and then we\u2019ve got to follow through.\u201d",
      "In countries like the U.S., it\u2019s hard to avoid highly processed foods \u2014 and it's not clear which ones should be targeted, said Aviva Musicus, science director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which advocates for food policies.",
      "\u201cThe range of ultraprocessed foods is just so wide,\u201d she said.",
      "Instead, it\u2019s better to be mindful of the ingredients in foods. Check the labels and make choices that align with the current dietary guidelines, she suggested.",
      "\u201cWe have really good evidence that added sugar is not great for us. We have evidence that high-sodium foods are not great for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have great evidence that fruits and vegetables which are minimally processed are really good for us.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s important not to vilify certain foods, she added. Many consumers don\u2019t have the time or money to cook most meals from scratch.",
      "\u201cFoods should be joyous and delicious and shouldn\u2019t involve moral judgment,\u201d Musicus said.",

      "New Mexico has paired up with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association in a pilot U.S. initiative aimed at raising awareness about a disease that affects several million people in the country",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- New Mexico has paired up with the Alzheimer's Association in a pilot U.S. initiative aimed at raising awareness about a disease that affects several million people across the nation, including family members and friends who often provide countless hours of unpaid care.",
      "The joint campaign \u2014 a year in the making \u2014 features billboards, digital ads and social media posts. It was unveiled Wednesday, days after authorities confirmed that actor Gene Hackman died at his Santa Fe home of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "Hackman, like the majority of people with Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias, lived at home. His wife, Betsy Arakawa, was his caregiver but died from hantavirus, a rare, rodent-borne disease. Experts believe Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, was unable to seek help.",
      "The goal of the new partnership between the state and the Alzheimer's Association is to spark conversations within families and to educate the public on warning signs and treatments. It also aims to publicize support services for family members and other caregivers.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the whole point of the campaign \u2014 to start talking, to start thinking, to take some action,\u201d said Joey Long, a spokesperson with the state Aging and Long-Term Services Department. \u201cSo it's like, maybe they\u2019ve been confused. Well, let\u2019s talk about what that means.\u201d",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 7 million people are living with the disease in the U.S., where Alzheimer\u2019s is the seventh-leading cause of death. In New Mexico, estimates put the number of people with the disease at 46,000, with another 67,000 family members providing care at home within the last year.",
      "Alzheimer's kills more people in the U.S. than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined, according to statistics shared by the Alzheimer's Association, which is helping to fund research projects in dozens of countries around the world.",
      "One of the challenges is that only about half of the people who are living with the disease are ever diagnosed, said Jim Herlihy, a spokesperson for the association's Rocky Mountain region. The number of undiagnosed people is higher in communities of color, he said.",
      "Neurologists say it can take 20 years from the start of the disease taking shape in the brain to when it becomes recognizable and diagnosed, what Herlihy describes as a glacial pace.",
      "\u201cPeople think of this as either an old person\u2019s disease or something that happens to somebody else,\u201d Herlihy said. \u201cAnd unless it\u2019s happened in your family and you have seen a loved one decline from this disease, or you have been put into the role of being a caregiver, you don\u2019t realize the impact that this has.\u201d",

      "The billboards and ads are simple. One of them pictures a caution sign in the road that reads: \u201cHoney, you've been confused.\u201d The messages urge people to talk about it and to visit a website that includes a hotline for those who don't know where to start.",
      "A significant percentage of New Mexico's population is aging, which has spurred officials to find ways to educate and prepare state residents. In addition to the awareness campaign, the state is planning a series of community forums on the subject this spring in rural areas with high rates of the disease.",
      "The Alzheimer's Association is hoping the campaign will expand to other states."

      "President Trump's nominee to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is getting ready to appear before Congress",
      "NEW YORK -- Dr. David Weldon had been out of the national spotlight for more than 15 years when he was nominated to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But many anti-vaccine advocates knew him well.",
      "\u201cHe is one of us!! Since before our movement had momentum,\u201d the co-director of Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights wrote on Facebook. And on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Autism Action Network credited the former congressman with introducing legislation two decades ago \u201cto stop the vaccine pedocide.\u201d",
      "Weldon, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, needs to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate before he can lead the nation\u2019s top public health agency. His confirmation hearing is to be held Thursday.",
      "The 71-year-old retired Florida congressman is considered to be closely aligned with his presumptive boss, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who for years has been one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials declined to make Weldon or Kennedy available for an Associated Press interview.",
      "When he made the nomination announcement, Trump said Weldon \u201cwill proudly restore the CDC to its true purpose, and will work to end the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and Make America Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",
      "Today, the Atlanta-based agency has a more than $9 billion core budget. It had about 13,000 employees when Trump took office, but more than 500 were fired as part of a dramatic \u2014 and continuing \u2014 push by the president and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk to cut staffing across federal agencies.",
      "Weldon has no experience in federal public heath, but that isn't unusual. The last few presidential administrations \u2014 both Democratic and Republican \u2014 have appointed outsiders with no CDC experience.",
      "Unlike Weldon, however, those outsiders had been public health researchers or had run state health departments. He is an Army veteran and internal medicine doctor whose main claim to fame was representing a central Florida district in Congress from 1995 to 2009.",
      "After he left Congress, Weldon practiced medicine in Florida, taught at the Florida Institute of Technology, served as board chairman for the Israel Allies Foundation and made unsuccessful runs at federal and state elected office. In a March 1 letter to HHS, Weldon said that if confirmed he will resign from the foundation and from two Florida health-care organizations. He also promised to sell his holdings in funds investing in energy, pharmaceutical and health-care companies.",
      "Weldon was a leader of a Congressional push for research into autism\u2019s causes, which began around 2000. It was fueled by a controversial \u2014 and ultimately discredited \u2014 study by British researcher Dr. Andrew Wakefield that claimed to find a link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism.",
      "The action in Congress was driven largely by U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican whose grandson had autism. Weldon was a prominent voice in Burton\u2019s hearings and co-sponsored a bill that would give responsibility for the nation\u2019s vaccine safety to an independent agency within HHS \u2014 an idea that not everyone in public health opposes.",
      "But Weldon also rejected studies that found no causal link between childhood vaccines and autism, and accused the CDC of short-circuiting research that might show otherwise.",
      "Meanwhile, Weldon was a friend to practitioners of fringe medicine. When Weldon invited Wakefield to testify before Congress, he also brought in Dr. James \u201cJeff\u201d Bradstreet, who used alternative medicine to try to treat autistic children. Bradstreet died in 2015, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raided his office, of a gunshot wound that police labeled a suicide.",
      "Weldon later appeared in \u201cVaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,\u201d a 2016 documentary directed by Wakefield and produced by Del Bigtree, an activist who later became the manager of Kennedy\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign. In the movie, Weldon repeated suspicions and accusations about CDC that he\u2019d made as a congressman.",
      "Kennedy has argued that experts who advise the CDC on vaccine policy have conflicts from working with, or receiving money from, pharmaceutical companies. Those advisers routinely disclose conflicts in public meetings, but the CDC last week launched a web tool \u201cto increase the transparency of conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "At Thursday's hearing, Democrats are likely to press Weldon on his vaccine views and his plans for the agency under a health secretary who has shown disdain for it.",
      "Dr. Anne Schuchat worked at the CDC for 33 years before retiring in 2021, and twice served as acting director. She said she doesn\u2019t know Weldon, but that agency directors gradually develop an appreciation and respect for its work.",
      "If Weldon follows a similar pattern, she said, he could be a great asset: His Capitol Hill experience could help CDC secure funding and political support.",
      "\u201cWith an optimistic view, there\u2019s lot you can build on, with what he has on paper,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a pessimistic view, if he wants the job to tear the place down, that would be disappointing \u2014 and dangerous.\u201d",

The center-right Democratic Party of Kosovo, or PDK, followed with 20.95%, or 24 seats, and the conservative governing Democratic League of Kosovo, or LDK, with 18.27%, or 20 seats.

      "To form a cabinet, Kurti needs a simple majority in parliament, or 61 votes. While campaigning, he vowed not to ally himself with either the PDK or the LDK. However, it has been over a month since the vote and if Kurti fails, the president is entitled to tap another from any of the winning parties to do the job. If the other person doesn't come through, the country goes into an early parliamentary election.",
      "Kurti has been in power since 2021, the first time since independence in 2008 that Kosovo\u2019s parliament completed a full four-year mandate. However, he now faces the challenge of reviving an ailing economy after the United States and the European Union, Kosovo\u2019s main supporters and contributors, have suspended their financial assistance.",
      "Meanwhile, normalizing ties with Serbia, a condition for both countries to join the EU, remains stalled.",
      "The 2026 presidential election may pose yet another challenge for Kurti; the winning party usually elects the president, which needs at least 81 votes in parliament, two-thirds of the electoral body.",
      "Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, a decade since the end of the 1998-1999 war between Serbia and ethnic Albanian separatists that pushed Serbian forces out following a 78-day NATO air campaign. Serbia doesn\u2019t recognize Kosovo\u2019s independence."

      "Shaksaaz, a tailor in the Kashmiri city of Srinagar, inherited his passion for local Sufi music from his grandfather along with a meticulously preserved collection of cassette tapes from the 1970s, which he often listens to as he works",
      "SRINAGAR, India -- Farooq Ahmad Shaksaaz presses a button on his 1970 Sharp cassette player, and with a hefty clack the machine whirrs to life. As the Kashmiri tailor stitches, the machine crackles for a moment before Ghulam Ahmad Sofi's otherworldly voice fills his shop with verses about divine love and the pain of separation from the beloved creator of the universe.",
      "Shaksaaz, a tailor in the Kashmiri city of Srinagar, inherited his passion for local Sufi music from his grandfather along with a meticulously preserved collection of audio cassette tapes from the 1970s, which he often listens to as he works.",
      "He's part of a small, dedicated community that believes cassette tapes are the best way to listen to and archive the Sufi music of Indian-controlled Kashmir, where music inspired by local and central Asian Muslim saints has long been a deep expression of spirituality and emotion. Many people turn to the music for spiritual guidance, or seeking an escape from the region\u2019s long periods of street battles, shutdowns and security clampdowns.",
      "For decades, cassette players have carried the soul-stirring poetry of Sufi saints and the mystical melodies of Kashmiri instruments like the sarangi and santoor, and it's long been a local ritual for families to gather around the warm hum of a tape player. Even today, the region\u2019s traditional Sufi music gatherings are often recorded only on the disappearing audio format, which was widely used from the 1970s to the 1990s.",
      "While the music is increasingly available on digital formats, many Kashmiris say that it's best heard on cassette tapes.",
      "\u201cThere is something unique about this machine that for me plays recordings of spiritual guides,\u201d said Abdul Ahad, a carpet weaver. \u201cIt is a sacred ritual in itself to press the play button of a cassette player to listen to a song on spiritual moorings.\u201d",
      "Many of the most beloved albums were released by local record labels during the heyday of the audio cassette, but dedicated devotees of the genre are still bringing tape recorders to gatherings. Digital recorders are often unwelcome at these nightly music sessions, as Sufi music lovers say they blur together the distinct sounds of the different instruments.",
      "\u201cIt is a different experience to listen to music on a tape recorder,\" said Abdul Hamid Khan. \"Tapes are smooth and you can feel the sound of every instrument, you don\u2019t get that feel in these new players.\u201d",
      "Still, as tapes wear out and more music moves to digital streaming platforms and smartphones, the tactile and deeply personal listening experience of cassettes is becoming harder to keep going.",
      "Many families have been forced to part with their players due to mechanical failures, while others struggle to preserve their cherished cassette collections, some of which hold rare and irreplaceable recordings passed down through generations. Some collectors have turned to digitizing their old recordings to safeguard them for future generations.",
      "Only a few shops in Srinagar, the region\u2019s main city, sell tape recorders or blank tapes, and the availability of spare parts and skilled repair technicians has drastically dwindled.",
      "A handful of mechanics in the Kashmir Valley still cater to a dedicated population of Sufi music lovers, painstakingly restoring machines made by beloved Japanese brands like Sharp and Kenwood in the last century.",
      "Mohammad Ashraf Matoo, a self-taught mechanic, has spent years keeping decades-old cassette players running even as spare parts become increasingly scarce. He purchases non-functional recorders to extract usable components, and manufactures some parts himself to keep his customers' devices going. Once repaired, a well-functioning tape recorder is sold for a price between $150 and $850, depending on its brand and condition.",
      "Shaksaaz, a lifelong Sufi music devotee, called it a \u201cpersonal mission\u201d to preserve the legacy of cassette tapes.",
      "\u201cIt is a bridge to the past, a way to remain connected to our spiritual and cultural roots in this ever modernizing and digital world,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's sweeping cuts in foreign aid have impacted programs in northern Ivory Coast to counter the spread of al-Qaida and the Islamic State group",
      "KIMBIRILA-NORD, Ivory Coast -- With its tomato patches and grazing cattle, the Ivory Coast village of Kimbirila-Nord hardly looks like a front line of the global fight against extremism. But after jihadis attacked a nearby community in Mali five years ago and set up a base in a forest straddling the border, the U.S. committed to spending $20 million to counter the spread of al-Qaida and the Islamic State group here and in dozens of other villages.",
      "The Trump administration's sweeping foreign aid cuts mean that support is now gone, even as violence in Mali and other countries in the Sahel region south of the Sahara has reached record levels and sent tens of thousands refugees streaming into northern Ivory Coast.",
      "Locals worry they have been abandoned. Diplomats and aid officials said the termination of aid jeopardizes counterterrorism efforts and weakens U.S. influence in a part of the world where some countries have turned to Russian mercenaries for help.",
      "In Kimbirila-Nord, U.S. funding, among other things, helped young people get job training, built parks for cattle to graze so they are no longer stolen by jihadis on Malian territory, and helped establish an information-sharing system so residents can flag violent encounters to each other and state services.",
      "\u201cWhat attracts young people to extremists is poverty and hunger,\u201d said Yacouba Doumbia, 78-year-old chief of Kimbirila-Nord. \u201cThere was a very dangerous moment in 2020. The project came at the right time, and allowed us to protect ourselves.\u201d",
      "Over the last decade, West Africa has been shaken by extremist uprisings and military coups. Groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group have conquered large areas and killed thousands in the Sahel and have been spreading into wealthier West African coastal states, such as Ivory Coast, Benin and Togo.",
      "In 2019, President Donald Trump signed the Global Fragility Act that led to the initiatives in northern Ivory Coast. The U.S. goal in this area was to \u201cseize a narrowing prevention window,\u201d according to this year\u2019s congressional report about the implementation of the bipartisan legislation.",
      "Experts say local concerns help drive the popularity of extremist groups: competition for land and resources, exclusion, marginalization and lack of economic opportunities. Across the region, Islamic extremists have recruited among groups marginalized and neglected by central governments.",
      "\u201cIvory Coast is one of the few countries that still resist the terrorist threat in the Sahel,\u201d said a U.N. official working in the country who was not authorized to speak on the matter publicly. \u201cIf we do not continue to support border communities, a minor issue could send them into the arms of extremists.\u201d",
      "Trump issued an executive order in January directing a freeze on foreign assistance and a review of all U.S. aid and development work abroad. He charged that much of foreign aid was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.",
      "In 2020, when the jihadis struck a Malian village 10 kilometers (6 miles) away, Kimbirila-Nord in many ways fit the description of a community susceptible to extremism.",
      "The lives of Malians and Ivorians were intertwined. People crossed the border freely, making it easy for extremists, who like residents spoke Bambara, to access Kimbirila-Nord. Many residents did not have identity cards and few spoke French, leaving them with no access to states services or official information. Different ethnic groups lived next to each other but were divided by conflicts over scarce natural resources and suspicions toward the state. And young people did not have opportunities to make money.",
      "\u201cWe were very scared\u201d when the extremists attacked, said Aminata Doumbia, the head of the village's female farmers cooperative. \u201cEveryone was just looking out for themselves.\u201d",
      "The Ivorian government runs a program that provides professional training, grants and microloans. But access is difficult in villages such as Kimbirila-Nord.",
      "Kimbirila-Nord is home to refugees from Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea. Sifata Berte, 23, fled there with his family two years ago from Mali. He is not eligible for the government-run program, but got training through the project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and now works as an apprentice in an iron workshop.",
      "Other things the USAID-funded project set up included a network of community radios in local languages, so people could get access to information. It also used mobile government trucks to help tens of thousands of people across the region get their identity documents. And it brought people together with microcredit cooperatives and with a special committee of ranchers and farmers that helps resolve tensions over land.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s thanks to the project that we can sleep at night,\u201d Doumbia, the village chief, said. \u201cWe learned how to be together.\u201d",
      "Equal Access International, an international nonprofit, designed and implemented the U.S.-funded project.",
      "The USAID project also has been the only direct source of information on the ground in northern Ivory Coast on violent events for the U.S.-based Armed Conflict and Location & Event Data Project, the main provider of data on violence in the Sahel.",
      "Ivory Coast became known as a target for extremists in 2016, when an attack on the seaside resort of Grand Bassam killed tourists. In 2021, a string of attacks occurred near the country's northern border, but the violence has been largely contained after Ivorian authorities, Western governments and aid groups rushed into this impoverished and isolated part of the country with military build up and development projects.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. Africa Command provided over $65 million to projects in Ivory Coast, most of which \"focused on counterterrorism and border security\" in the northern part of the country, according to the group's website. The Pentagon said in a statement that it was \u201cnot aware of any budget cuts that have undermined counterterrorism training or partnership programs in Africa.\u201d",
      "Ivory Coast has the second-highest GDP per capita in West Africa, but according to the U.N. it remains one of the world\u2019s least developed countries. Many in remote villages like Kimbirila-Nord do not have access to running water.",
      "\u201cAt first we thought that we only had to solve these problems with a military solution,\u201d Famy Rene, the prefect of Korhogo, the region\u2019s capital, said. \u201cBut we saw that this was not enough. We had to put in place programs that strengthen the resilience of the population.\u201d",
      "Residents of Kimbirila-Nord had big plans before the U.S. froze aid. The U.S. was supposed to finance the first well in the village, help create a collective farm, and expand vocational training,",
      "Now they fear they have been left alone to deal with extremists.",
      "\u201cIf you forget, they will come back,\u201d said Doumbia, the village chief. \u201cAs long as there is war on the other side of the border, we must remain on a high alert.\u201d",

      "The massive blackout that began Friday night was the fourth in the last six months as a severe economic crisis plagues the Caribbean country. The Ministry of Energy and Mines attributed it to a failure at a substation in the suburbs of Havana.",
      "The latest power outage affected phone, internet and water services. Many families also could not cook because they use electric equipment to prepare their meals.",
      "Cuba suffered similar blackouts in October, November and December. The latest was the first of 2025 but in mid-February authorities suspended classes and work activities for two days due to a shortage of electricity generation that exceeded 50% in the country.",
      "The outages come as Cubans are experiencing a severe economic crisis that analysts have blamed on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a program of domestic measures that triggered inflation and, above all, the tightening of sanctions by the United States.",
      "Experts have said the electricity disruptions are a result of fuel shortages at power plants and aging infrastructure. Most plants have been in operation for more than 30 years.",
      "The government has contracted floating power generating plants from Turkey in recent months to meet peak demand, especially during the sweltering tropical summer. The government has also promised that dozens of solar power parks would begin operating in 2025.",

      "Jhoan Bastidas is just starting to make sense of it all",
      "MARACAIBO, Venezuela -- Jhoan Bastidas was deported from the United States and spent 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, watched by cameras and eating small meals that left him hungry.",
      "\u201cI was locked up all day in a little room \u2014 I counted the feet: 7 wide and 13 long \u2014 without being able to do anything, without a book, looking at the walls,\u201d Bastidas, 25, said in his father\u2019s middle-class home in the western city of Maracaibo, Venezuela.",
      "Three weeks after he was returned to Venezuela under President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, Bastidas is just starting to make sense of it all \u2014 how he is back in the once-prosperous hometown that he left as a teenager; how tattoos on his chest earned him a reputation as a criminal; and how he became one of the few migrants to set foot on the naval base best known for housing terrorism suspects.",
      "Bastidas and roughly 350 other Venezuelans who migrated to the U.S. are trying to piece their lives together after they were deported to their troubled country over the past few weeks. About 180 of them spent up to 16 days at the base in Guantanamo before being flown to Honduras by U.S. authorities and, from there, to Venezuela by the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "It is part of the White House\u2019s efforts to deport a record number of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Trump\u2019s government has alleged Venezuelans sent to the naval base are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which originated in the South American country, but it has offered little evidence to back that up.",
      "\u201cIt was all very hard; all those experiences were very hard,\u201d Bastidas said.\u202f\u201cYou have to be strong in the face of all those problems, you know, but I saw so much hate.\u201d",
      "More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left their homeland since 2013, when its oil-dependent economy came undone and Maduro became president. Most settled in Latin America and the Caribbean, but after the COVID-19 pandemic, they increasingly set their sights on the U.S.",
      "Venezuela has refused to take back its own citizens from the U.S. for years, with brief, limited exceptions such as the recent flights.",
      "Over the weekend, the U.S. government transferred hundreds of immigrants to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador after Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law to speed up deportations of alleged Tren de Aragua members. The Trump administration, however, has not provided any evidence to back up the gang-membership claim.",
      "The immigrants were transferred even as a federal judge issued an order temporarily barring deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to expedite mass deportations.",
      "Bastidas, his mother and siblings left Maracaibo in 2018, one of the harshest years of the country\u2019s protracted crisis. As they tested their luck in Peru and then settled in Colombia, people living in Venezuela lost jobs, formed long lines outside near-empty grocery stores and went hungry.",
      "Their hometown saw businesses shutter and entire families sell their belongings and move away. The hourslong power outages that became everyday occurrences starting in 2019 pushed even more people to abandon Maracaibo.",
      "He set off for Texas in November 2023, bankrolled by a brother whose promise of a car and a food delivery job in Utah convinced him to migrate.",
      "Bastidas turned himself in to U.S. authorities after reaching the border with Mexico and was taken to a detention facility in El Paso, Texas. He remained there until early February, when one morning he was handcuffed, driven to an airport and put in an airplane without being told where it was headed.",
      "After the aircraft landed, fellow passengers thought they were in Venezuela, but when he reached the door and only saw \u201cgringos,\u201d Bastidas said, he concluded they were wrong. When he saw \u201cGuantanamo\u201d written on the floor, it did not mean anything to him. He had never heard that word before.",
      "When inside the cell, Bastidas said, he could never tell the time of day because its only window was a small glass panel at the top of the door looking into the building. He said he only saw sunlight every three days for an hour, which was the recreation time he was allowed to spend in what he described as a \u201ccage.\u201d",
      "Bastidas said his hands and feet were shackled whenever he left his cell, including when he went to shower every three days.\u202f At one point, he and other detainees were given small Bibles, and they began praying together, reading Scripture loudly and placing their ears against the door to hear each other.",
      "\u201cWe used to say that the one who was going to get us out was God because we didn\u2019t see any other solutions. We didn\u2019t have anyone to lean on,\u201d Bastidas added.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond\u202fto requests for comment.",
      "Trump has said he planned\u202f to send \u201cthe worst\" to the base in Cuba, including members of the Tren de Aragua. Bastidas said he is not part of the gang and believes the U.S. authorities used his tattoos to wrongly catalog him as a member of the criminal organization.",
      "When asked which tattoos he thinks authorities misjudged, his father pulled down the neck of Bastidas\u2019 white T-shirt and pointed to two black, eight-pointed stars, each inked on one side of the chest, below the collarbones.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit attempting to block further transfers to Guantanamo alleging cruelty by the guards and suicide attempts by at least three people held there.",
      "Bastidas and other Venezuelans returned to Venezuela from Guantanamo on Feb. 20. Armed state intelligence service agents dropped them off at their homes.",
      "Bastidas spent the next two weeks resting. He then began working at a hot dog stand.",
      "Abandoned storefronts and homes are everywhere in Maracaibo, which once was a magnet for immigrants looking for good-paying jobs in and around nearby oil fields. But corruption, mismanagement and eventual U.S. economic sanctions saw production \u2014 and population \u2014 decline steadily.",
      "Few people might know Bastidas by name in his sweltering hometown, but practically everyone in Maracaibo knows someone who has migrated. So, news of the Venezuelans\u2019 transfer to Guantanamo was shared seemingly endlessly on social media and WhatsApp, setting off debates over their living conditions and alleged gang affiliations as well as the complex crisis that drove them to migrate in the first place.",
      "Bastidas is leaning into faith to ignore the noise and move forward.",
      "\u201cI see it as a kind of test that the Lord put me through,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has another purpose for me. It wasn\u2019t for me to be (in the U.S.), and he kept me there (in detention) for some reason.\u201d",

      "Le Parisien cited Macron as saying that Moscow\u2019s agreement wasn't needed for such deployment. \u201cUkraine is sovereign. If it asks for Allied forces to be on its territory, it\u2019s not up to Russia to accept or not,\" he said.",
      "Following Saturday\u2019s two-hour virtual meeting, Starmer challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to sign up to a ceasefire in its war against Ukraine if he is serious about peace, and said allies will keep increasing the pressure on the Kremlin, including by moving planning for a peacekeeping force to an \u201coperational phase.\u201d",
      "Around 30 leaders were involved in the call, including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and leaders from Australia, Canada and New Zealand, as well as officials from NATO and the European Union.",
      "It was the second such meeting in two weeks, meant to help Ukraine face a change of approach by the U.S. following the return of President Donald Trump, as well as gauging support for any future possible peacekeeping mission. Many more countries were involved this time than the previous meeting on March 2.",
      "According to Starmer, military planners will convene again in the U.K. on Thursday to progress practical plans to support Ukraine\u2019s future security."

      "A court in Georgia has handed another prison sentence to imprisoned former President Mikheil Saakashvili",
      "TBILISI, Georgia -- A court in Georgia on Monday handed another prison sentence to former President Mikheil Saakashvili, extending his total imprisonment to 12\u00bd years, in a verdict that he denounced as illegal.",
      "Saakashvili, who served as Georgia\u2019s president from 2004-2013, had previously been sentenced on charges of abuse of power and embezzlement that he and his defense have rejected as politically motivated.",
      "On Monday, the court sentenced him to four years and six months on charges of illegal border crossing. With his previous sentences accumulated, he now has to serve 12 years and six months behind bars.",
      "Saakashvili, speaking by videoconference, dismissed Monday's verdict as an \u201cabsolutely illegal, unjust sentencing of me for crimes I have not committed.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey want to annihilate me in prison,\u201d he said. \"But no matter what, I will fight till the end.\u201d",
      "Saakashvili, who led the so-called Rose Revolution protests in 2003 that drove his predecessor out of office, enacted a serious of ambitious reforms tacking official corruption as president of the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million. He also presided over a short but fierce war with Russia in 2008 that ended with the humiliating loss of its last footholds in two separatist territories, and he cracked down on protesters who charged that his zeal had mutated into autocracy.",
      "In 2012, Saakashvili\u2019s United National Movement party lost the election to the Georgian Dream party established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia. Georgian Dream has remained in power ever since, tightening its grip on democratic freedoms and drawing accusations from the opposition of steering the country away from the path toward European Union membership and back into Russia\u2019s sphere of influence.",
      "Saakashvili left for Ukraine in 2013, obtained Ukrainian citizenship and served as a governor of the country\u2019s southern Odesa region from 2015-16. He returned to Georgia in October 2021 to try to bolster opposition forces before nationwide municipal elections and was quickly arrested.",
      "The former president spent much of his time behind bars in a prison hospital after going on a hunger strikes and later claiming that he had been poisoned. He is currently receiving medical treatment at the Vivamedi Clinic, where he is being monitored for several chronic conditions, and his health reportedly worsens periodically, according to the clinic.",
      "Saakashvili's lawyer, Beka Basilaia, said that Monday's verdict again showed that Saakashvili is a political prisoner.",
      "\"As long as Georgian Dream remains in power, the judiciary is a farce and will make whatever decision it is instructed to,\u201d Basilaia said."

      "The paramedic group, known as the White Helmets, said it worked overnight, searching through debris and recovered 16 bodies, including five women and five children, and that 18 others were injured. The group and residents said the explosion occurred in a metal scrap storage space on the ground floor of the four-story building.",
      "The United Nations said in February that about a hundred have been killed from exploding ordnance during the last 13 years, adding that since the ouster of Bashar Assad in December, over 1,400 unexploded devices across Syria have been safely disposed of and 138 minefields and contaminated areas identified in Idleb, Aleppo, Hama, Deir-ez-Zor and Lattakia.",
      "Lattakia, a key port city, and Syria's coastal province recently witnessed a surge in violence, after gunmen loyal to Assad ambushed a security patrol. While the government's counter-offensive, alongside allied factions, crushed the insurgency, it led to widespread destruction and numerous cases of retaliatory attacks against members of the Alawite community, which the Assad family is part of.",
      "The clashes and revenge killings led to the deaths of more than 1,000 people.",

      "Since the mid-1980s, a number of organizations, primarily in northern Mexico, have launched informational campaigns and community-oriented interventions aimed at addressing drug use from a public health and social justice perspective, rather than a sec...",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Under warm strobe lights and pulsing house beats, a recent festival in Mexico City offered more than music, food and booze. Amidst the usual festival fare, a booth provided free, anonymous drug testing.",
      "The initiative, known as \u201cCheca tu Sustancia\u201d (Check Your Substance), is one of several recent efforts by Mexican civil society to reduce risk among people taking drugs. Spearheaded by the Instituto RIA, a Mexico-based drug policy research and advocacy organization, it aims to address drug use from a public health and social justice perspective, rather than a security one.",
      "In a well-lit corner of the festival, members of the Instituto RIA used reagents and laboratory porcelain plates to test substances that some of the partygoers planned to use and recorded the data. Their analysis uses color changes to indicate what\u2019s in the drug: It can reveal the presence of adulterants but not their exact proportion.",
      "They also offered test strips that can detect the presence of fentanyl and nasal sprays of naloxone, a medication designed to rapidly reverse opioid overdose.",
      "Also available were informational flyers detailing the effects of various psychoactive substances and what to do to reduce the risks associated with using them, including simple but critical measures like staying hydrated and eating well.",
      "While some partygoers seemed wary of the initiative, others approached it with curiosity.",
      "\u201c(There is) amazement, but also a little bit of fear, because there is a whole context of criminalization,\u201d said social psychology student Jessica Reyes Moreno, 27, a volunteer with Checa tu Sustancia.",
      "When unexpected substances are detected, users receive detailed information on what they are, about their risks, potential interactions with other substances and dosage adjustments, empowering them to make informed choices.",
      "When people understand that the focus is not on prohibiting but on offering information and safe, non-judgmental spaces where they can be heard, trust is built, said Reyes Moreno.",
      "\"I think it\u2019s information we should have. Because (drug use) is taboo, and if we're uninformed, we can overdose,\u201d said a 34-year-old Mexican partygoer, who requested anonymity due to his use of illicit substances.",
      "He said he feels there isn't enough information about illegal drugs in Mexico, and when there is, it's either confusing or all stigma. \"It\u2019s just \u2018Don\u2019t do it,\u2019 but there\u2019s no such thing as \u2018If you do it, take this precaution.\u2019\u201d",
      "The \u201cdon\u2019t do it\u201d approach sees abstinence as the solution. In contrast, harm reduction, as defined by Harm Reduction International, aims to minimize the negative health, social and legal effects of substance use by working with people without judgment or requiring them to stop using drugs.",
      "The approach focuses more on people \u2014 and their communities\u2014 than on the substance.",
      "\u201cWe never say, \u2018you shouldn\u2019t consume this,\u2019\u201d said Zara Snapp, a political scientist and director of the Instituto RIA. \u201cThe best way to reduce your risks is not to consume at all. But if you have made the decision to consume, we want you to have as much information as possible so you can take care of yourself.\u201d",
      "The prohibitionist, hardline approach of the war on drugs in Mexico has led to the perception of the user as someone who is necessarily associated with drug trafficking or criminal activities.",
      "Earlier this year, Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum unveiled her government\u2019s latest anti-drug campaign, \u201cStay away from drugs. Fentanyl kills,\u201d which centers on the synthetic opioid responsible in its deadliest year for more than 70,000 overdose deaths each year in the U.S. \u2014 now down to an estimated 52,000 deaths a year.",
      "Aimed at young Mexicans, the campaign frames drug use as a public health issue, but some of the videos and glowing neon billboards show scenarios in which death and loneliness (drug use) are contrasted with life and family (not using drugs). They read, \u201cChoose to be happy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that if I use drugs I won\u2019t be happy, or if I stop using drugs I\u2019ll be happy,\u201d said Lilia Pacheco, operational director of PrevenCasa A.C., a Tijuana-based organization that runs harm-reduction initiatives for opioid users, mostly deportees from the United States who report that they started using in that country.",
      "\u201cHow can we say that to someone who is using because they are cold, hungry or in withdrawal?\u201d she said.",
      "Mexico's health department did not immediately respond to inquiries regarding concerns that its latest campaign stigmatizes drug use.",
      "Dr. Carlos Magis, a professor at Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University\u2019s medical school and member of a working group on opioids, said that stigma poses serious challenges. He cited examples of health workers refusing treatment without abstinence, limited access to naloxone or the scarcity of public methadone clinics.",
      "A recent report by the Mexican Observatory of Mental Health and Drug Use, found that between 2013 and 2024, 5,901 people in Mexico were treated for emergencies related to opioid use, with it trending up.",
      "PrevenCasa reduces harm not by asking users to stop using, but by showing that their lives matter by providing them with safe injection equipment, showers, toiletries and social events like Friday movie nights.",
      "\u201cThese interventions improve quality of life, unlike a sign that says \u2018fentanyl kills you,\u2019\" said Pacheco. \u201cThe right to health should be universal.\u201d",
      "Both Pacheco and Snapp emphasized that collective care is at the heart of harm reduction efforts. Whether practiced in the facilities of organizations working on the border or at electronic music festivals, the goal is to break down social isolation and fear in concrete ways.",
      "\u201cThis is a service that will save lives...it\u2019s very forward-thinking,\u201d said a 43-year-old man, who requested anonymity because he is a user of illicit substances, after members of Instituto RIA tested his ecstasy at a recent festival.",
      "He said that drug testing kits are available in the United States, where he\u2019s from, but that in his experience so far, it\u2019s something people mostly do on their own or behind closed doors.",
      "The visibility and organization of Checa tu Sustancia was a surprise to him.",
      "\u201cI feel good that I\u2019m not doing anything wrong. I\u2019m just here to have fun, but now with peace of mind,\u201d he said with a smile. He then rejoined his friends and disappeared into the dancing crowd.",

      "Lawyers for convicted baby killer Lucy Letby and former executives at the hospital where she worked have asked a judge to halt an inquiry into the deaths after a panel of medical experts found no evidence of a crime",
      "LONDON -- Lawyers for convicted baby killer Lucy Letby and former executives at the hospital where she worked have asked to halt an inquiry into the deaths after a panel of medical experts found no evidence of a crime, a judge said Monday.",
      "Justice Kathryn Thirlwall announced the requests before hearing closing statements in the inquiry that began in September seeking accountability for staff and management for the harm to babies at Countess of Chester Hospital in northwest England.",
      "The inquiry was predicated on Letby's guilt, and Thirlwall had said she would not review the convictions after an appeals court upheld them. But lawyers for Letby said that if the convictions are overturned, the inquiry might reach the wrong conclusions, and 10 million pounds ($13 million) spent so far will have been a waste of taxpayer funds.",
      "\u201cIn short, it will defeat the purpose of a public inquiry, to fully and fearlessly understand the circumstances in which the babies died or became unwell,\" attorney Louise Mortimer wrote in a letter to Thirlwall.",
      "Thirlwall is expected to publish a final report in the fall.",
      "Letby, 35, is serving multiple life sentences with no chance of release after being convicted of seven counts of murder and attempting to murder seven other infants while working as a neonatal nurse at the hospital between June 2015 and June 2016.",
      "Prosecutors said Letby left little or no trace when she harmed babies: injecting air into their bloodstreams, administering air or milk into their stomachs via nasogastric tubes, interfering with breathing tubes or poisoning them with insulin. They said she was the only employee on duty in the neonatal unit when the children collapsed or died.",
      "But a group of 16 international medical experts in pediatrics and neonatology who reviewed the medical evidence concluded that natural causes or bad medical care led to the death or collapse of each newborn, Dr. Shoo Lee, a retired neonatologist from Canada, said last month.",
      "The panel also questioned the premise that there was an unexplained spike in deaths at the hospital. It said evidence of schedules that showed Letby was present during all the deaths was \u201cincomplete, selective and, therefore, meaningless.\"",
      "Letby\u2019s convictions are being examined by the Criminal Case Review Commission, which looks at potential miscarriages of justice. It could refer its findings to the Court of Appeal.",
      "Former executives at the hospital \u2014 chief executive Tony Chambers, medical director Ian Harvey, director of nursing Alison Kelly and human resources director Sue Hodkinson \u2014 asked for the public inquiry to be halted after the medical panel released its findings.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service has said two juries convicted Letby and three appellate judges had rejected her arguments that the prosecution expert evidence was flawed.",
      "Several related investigations remain active.",
      "Cheshire police announced last week that its investigation into corporate manslaughter at the hospital had been expanded and was now looking at individual suspects for gross negligence manslaughter.",
      "Letby's lawyer criticized that decision, based on the medical panel's findings.",
      "\u201cWe now have substantial and significant expert evidence which completely demolishes the prosecution case against Lucy Letby and points the finger in a very different direction to that which the police are currently looking,\u201d Mark McDonald said. \"It is time they take a step back and ask themselves whether have they made a huge mistake.\u201d",
      "A separate investigation is looking into other deaths and near-deaths of babies at the Countess of Chester Hospital and the Liverpool Women\u2019s Hospital when Letby worked there between 2012 to 2016.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will seek to dismiss the head of the internal security service",
      "JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday he will seek to dismiss the head of the internal security service this week, deepening a power struggle focused largely on who bears responsibility for the Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s effort to remove Ronen Bar as director of the Shin Bet comes as the security service investigates close aides of the prime minister. Netanyahu said he has had \u201congoing distrust\u201d with Bar, and \u201cthis distrust has grown over time.\u201d",
      "Bar responded by saying he planned to continue in the post for the near future, citing \u201cpersonal obligations\u201d to finish \u201csensitive investigations,\" free the remaining hostages in Gaza and prepare potential successors.",
      "Bar also criticized Netanyahu\u2019s expectation of a personal loyalty that contradicts the public interest. But he emphasized that he would respect any legal decision regarding his tenure.",
      "Israel\u2019s attorney general said Netanyahu must clarify the legal basis for his decision before taking any action.",
      "The Shin Bet is responsible for monitoring Palestinian militant groups, and recently issued a report accepting responsibility for its failures around the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack. It also criticized Netanyahu, saying failed government policies helped create the climate that led to it.",
      "While the army concluded in a recent report that it underestimated Hamas\u2019 capabilities, Shin Bet said it had a \u201cdeep understanding of the threat.\u201d In veiled criticism of the government, the agency said its attempts to thwart the threat were not implemented.",
      "\u201cThe investigation reveals a long and deliberate disregard from the political leadership from the organization\u2019s warnings,\u201d Bar's statement said.",
      "Netanyahu has resisted calls for an official state commission of inquiry into the Oct. 7 attack and has tried to blame the failures on the army and security agencies. In recent months, a number of senior security officials, including a defense minister and army chief, have been fired or forced to step down.",
      "Bar has been one of the few senior security officials since the Oct. 7 attack to remain in office.",
      "If successful in removing him, Netanyahu would be expected to appoint a loyalist in his place, slowing any momentum for the commission of inquiry. The prime minister said removing him would help Israel \u201cachieve its war goals and prevent the next disaster.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s proposed resolution for Bar\u2019s dismissal would need the approval of parliament, the Knesset, and it is likely he has support to pass it.",
      "However, a personnel decision of this magnitude must get the attorney general\u2019s approval, said Amichai Cohen, a senior research fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute think tank.",
      "In her letter to Netanyahu warning he could not go ahead without clarification, Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara added that he should \u201cpay attention to the fact that the role of the Shin Bet is not to serve the personal trust of the prime minister,\u201d according to a statement from her office.",
      "The two have a combative relationship, with the prime minister accusing Baharav-Miara of meddling in government decisions. Earlier this month, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, one of Netanyahu\u2019s biggest supporters, initiated the process of firing her.",
      "Cohen also called Netanyahu\u2019s decision \u201cvery problematic.\" He said it illustrates the conflict of interest regarding the Shin Bet findings around the Oct. 7 attack and the agency's investigations into connections between the prime minister\u2019s office and Qatar, a mediator in talks on the war in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu is angry that the Shin Bet is investigating members of his staff for their dealings with Qatar.",
      "Eli Feldstein, Netanyahu\u2019s former spokesperson, was reported by Israel\u2019s Channel 12 to have worked for a Doha-based firm that recruited Israeli journalists to write pro-Qatar stories. Israel\u2019s left-leaning daily, Haaretz, has reported that two other Netanyahu staffers, Jonatan Urich and Yisrael Einhorn, allegedly built a campaign to bolster Qatar\u2019s image ahead of the 2022 World Cup there.",
      "The Shin Bet, and Bar, have been closely involved with the Gaza hostage negotiations. Netanyahu recently removed Bar from the negotiating team and replaced him with a loyalist, Cabinet minister Ron Dermer. Israeli media have reported on policy differences between the negotiators, who have pushed for a hostage deal, and Netanyahu, who threatens to resume the war.",
      "The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a good-governance civil society group, called Netanyahu\u2019s announcement a \u201cdeclaration of war on the rule of law\u201d and claimed that he does not have the authority to take the step against Bar because of the investigations into his office.",
      "The group's chair, Eliad Shraga, called the announcement unlawful and \u201can extreme example of conflict of interest.\u201d",

      "Five months after the assault, she lay on a mat in a displacement camp in South Sudan's capital, rubbing her swollen belly. \u201cI felt like I wasn't heard ... and now I'm pregnant,\u201d she said. The Associated Press does not identify people who have been raped.",
      "Sexual assault is a constant risk for many women in South Sudan. Now one aid group is trying to bridge the gap with technology, to find and help survivors more quickly. But it's not easy in a country with low connectivity, high illiteracy and wariness about how information is used.",
      "Five months ago, an Israel-based organization in South Sudan piloted a chatbot it created on WhatsApp. It prompts questions for its staff to ask survivors of sexual assault to anonymously share their experiences. The information is put into the phone while speaking to the person and the bot immediately notifies a social worker there's a case, providing help to the person within hours.",
      "IsraAID said the technology improves communication. Papers can get misplaced and information can go missing, said Rodah Nyaduel, a psychologist with the group. When colleagues document an incident, she's notified by phone and told what type of case it is.",

Groups need to do certain things to guarantee how to safeguard that information and demonstrate that,\u201d said Gerardo Rodriguez Phillip, an AI and technology innovation consultant in Britain.",
      "IsraAID said its data is encrypted and anonymized. It automatically deletes from staffers' phones. In the chatbot's first three months in late 2024, it was used to report 135 cases.",
      "When the 28-year-old was raped, she knew she had just a few days to take medicine to help prevent disease and pregnancy, she said.",
      "One aid group she approached scribbled her information on a piece of paper and told her to return later to speak with a social worker. When she did, they said they were busy. After 72 hours, she assumed it was pointless. Weeks later, she found she was pregnant.",
      "IsraAID found her while doing door-to-door visits in her area. At first, she was afraid to let them put her information into their phone, worried it would be broadcast on social media. But she felt more comfortable knowing the phones were not personal devices, thinking she could hold the organization accountable if there were problems.",
      "She's one of tens of thousands of people still living in displacement sites in the capital, Juba, despite a peace deal ending civil war in 2018. Some are afraid to leave or have no homes to return to.",
      "The fear of rape remains for women who leave the camps for firewood or other needs. Some told the AP about being sexually assaulted.

      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order to freeze USAID funding during a 90-day review period is exacerbating the challenges. Aid groups have closed some services including psychological support for women, affecting tens of thousands of people.",

Will they find it engaging, will they trust it, is it safe?\u201d said Kirsten Pontalti, a senior associate at Proteknon Foundation for Innovation and Learning, an international organization focused on advancing child protection.",
      "Pontalti has piloted two chatbots, one to help youth and parents better access information about sexual reproductive health and the other for frontline workers focused on child protection during COVID.",

      "Migrants trek in camouflage through dry desert terrain. Dune buggies roar up to the United States-Mexico border barrier. Families with young children pass through gaps in the wall. Helicopters, planes, yachts, tunnels and jet skis stand by for potential customers.",
      "Laced with emojis, the videos posted by smugglers offer a simple promise: If you don\u2019t have a visa in the U.S., trust us. We\u2019ll get you over safely.",
      "At a time when legal pathways to the U.S. have been slashed and criminal groups are raking in money from migrant smuggling, social media apps like TikTok have become an essential tool for smugglers and migrants alike. The videos \u2014 taken to cartoonish extremes \u2014 offer a rare look inside a long elusive industry and the narratives used by trafficking networks to fuel migration north.",
      "\u201cWith God\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to continue working to fulfill the dreams of foreigners. Safe travels without robbing our people,\u201d wrote one enterprising smuggler.",
      "As President Donald Trump begins to ramp up a crackdown at the border and migration levels to the U.S. dip, smugglers say new technologies allow networks to be more agile in the face of challenges, and expand their reach to new customers \u2014 a far cry from the old days when each village had its trusted smuggler.",
      "\u201cIn this line of work, you have to switch tactics,\u201d said a woman named Soary, part of a smuggling network bringing migrants from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso, Texas, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that her last name would not be shared out of concern that authorities would track her down. \u201cTikTok goes all over the world.\"",
      "Soary, 24, began working in smuggling when she was 19, living in El Paso, where she was approached by a friend about a job. She would use her truck to pick up migrants who had recently jumped the border. Despite the risks involved with working with trafficking organizations, she said it earned her more as a single mother than her previous job putting in hair extensions.",
      "As she gained more contacts on both sides of the border, she began connecting people from across the Americas with a network of smugglers to sneak them across borders and eventually into the U.S.",
      "Like many smugglers, she would take videos of migrants speaking to the camera after crossing the border to send over WhatsApp as evidence to loved ones that her clients had gotten to their destination safely. Now she posts those clips to TikTok.",
      "TikTok says the platform strictly prohibits human smuggling and reports such content to law enforcement.",
      "The use of social media to facilitate migration took off around 2017 and 2018, when activists built massive WhatsApp groups to coordinate the first major migrant caravans traveling from Central America to the U.S., according to Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University focused on the migrant smuggling industry.",
      "Later, smugglers began to infiltrate those chats and use the choice social media app of the day, expanding to Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Migrants, too, began to document their often perilous voyages north, posting videos trekking through the jungles of the Darien Gap dividing Colombia and Panama, and after being released by extorting cartels.",
      "A 2023 study by the United Nations reported that 64% of the migrants they interviewed had access to a smart phone and the internet during their migration to the U.S.",
      "Around the time of the study's release, as use of the app began to soar, that Correa-Cabrera said she began to see smuggling ads skyrocket on TikTok.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a marketing strategy,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said. \u201cEveryone was on TikTok, particularly after the pandemic, and then it began to multiply.\u201d",
      "Last year, Soary, the smuggler, said she began to publish videos of migrants and families in the U.S. with their faces covered and photos of the U.S.-Mexico border with messages like: \u201cWe\u2019ll pass you through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, no matter where you are. Fence jumping, treks and by tunnel. Adults, children and the elderly.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of videos examined by the AP feature thick wads of cash, people crossing through the border fence by night, helicopters and airplanes supposedly used by coyotes, smugglers cutting open cacti in the desert for migrants to drink from and even crops of lettuce with text reading \u201cThe American fields are ready!\u201d",
      "The videos are often layered over heavy northern Mexican music with lyrics waxing romantically about being traffickers. Videos are published by accounts with names alluding to \u201csafe crossing,\u201d \u201cUSA destinations,\u201d \u201cfulfilling dreams\u201d or \u201cpolleros,\u201d as smugglers are often called.",
      "Narratives shift based on the political environment and immigration policies in the U.S. During the Biden administration, posts would advertise getting migrants access to asylum applications through the administration's CBP One app, which Trump ended.",
      "Amid Trump's crackdown, posts have shifted to dispelling fears that migrants will be captured, promising American authorities have been paid off. Smugglers openly taunt U.S. authorities: one shows himself smoking what appears to be marijuana right in front of the border wall; another even takes a jab at Trump, referring to the president as a \u201chigh-strung gringo.\u201d",
      "Comments are dotted with emojis of flags and baby chickens, a symbol meaning migrant among smugglers, and other users asking for prices and more information.",
      "Cristina, who migrated because she struggled make ends meet in the Mexican state of Zacatecas, was among those scrolling in December after the person she had hired to smuggle her to the U.S. abandoned her and her partner in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.",
      "\u201cIn a moment of desperation, I started searching on TikTok and, well, with the algorithm videos began to pop up,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me a half an hour\u201d to find a smuggler.",
      "After connecting, smugglers and migrants often negotiate on encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, doing a careful dance to gain each other's trust. Cristina, now living in Phoenix, said she decided to trust Soary because she was a woman and posted videos of families, something the smuggler admitted was a tactic to gain migrants' trust.",
      "Smugglers, migrants and authorities warn that such videos have been used to scam migrants or lure them into traps at a time when cartels are increasingly using kidnapping and extortion as a means to rake in more money.",
      "One smuggler, who asked to only be identified by his TikTok name \u201cThe Corporation\u201d due to fear of authorities tracking him down said other accounts would steal his migrant smuggling network's videos of customers saying to camera they arrived safely in the U.S.",
      "\u201cAnd there's not much we can do legally. I mean, it's not like we can report them,\u201d he said with a laugh.",
      "In other cases, migrants say that they were forced by traffickers to take the videos even if they haven't arrived safely to their destinations.",
      "The illicit advertisements have fueled concern among international authorities like the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, which warned in a report about the use of the technology that \u201cnetworks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and evasive, thus challenging government authorities to address new, non-traditional forms of this crime.\u201d",
      "In February, a Mexican prosecutor also confirmed to the AP that they were investigating a network of accounts advertising crossings through a tunnel running under the border fence between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. But investigators would not provide more details.",
      "In the meantime, hundreds of accounts post videos of trucks crossing border, of stacks of cash and migrants, faces covered with emojis, promising they made it safely across the border.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to cross and we\u2019re not scared,\u201d one wrote.",

      "The European Union is hosting a donor conference to garner support for a peaceful transition in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar Assad in December",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union hosts a donor conference for Syria on Monday to muster support to ensure a peaceful transition after President Bashar Assad was ousted by an insurgency last December.",
      "Ministers and representatives from Western partners, as well as Syria\u2019s regional neighbors, other Arab countries and U.N. agencies will take part in the one-day meeting in Brussels which will be chaired by EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.",
      "Syria will attend the conference \u2014 the ninth edition of its kind \u2014 for the first time, and will be represented by Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani. The event was organized in haste by the EU to try to take advantage of the change sweeping the country.",
      "The gathering comes at a precarious time. Syria's new leaders are trying to consolidate control over territory that was divided into de facto mini-states during nearly 14 years of civil war and to rebuild the country\u2019s economy and infrastructure. The United Nations in 2017 estimated it would cost at least $250 billion to rebuild Syria, while experts say that number could reach at least $400 billion.",
      "The prospects of economic recovery have been hampered by harsh Western sanctions that were imposed during Assad\u2019s rule and largely have not been lifted.",
      "The interim government will likely be looking to the Brussels conference to shore up its legitimacy in the eyes of the international community in hopes that the sanctions will be lifted, while also seeking short-term aid.",
      "But the EU in particular is in a quandary as not all has gone well recently.",
      "Last week, an ambush on a Syrian security patrol by gunmen loyal to Assad triggered clashes. Some factions allied with the new government launched sectarian revenge attacks -- primarily targeting members of Assad\u2019s Alawite minority sect -- that monitoring groups say killed hundreds of civilians over several days.",
      "In a statement, the EU called \u201cfor the full respect of Syria\u2019s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity,\u201d saying that it will only support \u201ca peaceful and inclusive transition, away from malign foreign interference, which guarantees the rights of all Syrians without distinction of any kind.\u201d",
      "Syria is also on the agenda of a meeting of EU foreign ministers that Kallas will chair separately Monday. The 27-nation bloc has begun to ease energy, transport and financial sector sanctions to encourage the new authorities, but remains wary.",
      "The country\u2019s interim rulers have struggled to exert their authority across much of Syria since the Islamist former insurgent group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, led a lightning insurgency against Assad.",
      "Former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa is now interim president, and on Thursday he signed a temporary constitution that leaves Syria under Islamist rule for five years during a transitional phase.",
      "While many were happy to see an end to the Assad family\u2019s dictatorial rule of more than 50 years, religious and ethnic minorities are skeptical of the new Islamist leaders and reluctant to allow Damascus under its new leadership to assert control over their areas.",
      "The EU can reintroduce the sanctions if things do not go to the liking of Western backers. At the same time, Syria's economy, infrastructure and institutions lie in tatters. As a failed state it could become another haven for extremists.",
      "People must make do with only a few hours of electricity each day, water supplies are unreliable and often unsafe, unemployment runs to 80% or 90%, and destruction is widespread. Many government employees and experts needed to rebuild fled after the 2011 Arab Spring democracy movement collapsed into conflict and authoritarian rule under Assad.",
      "The U.N. refugee agency said that last year some 7 million people had left their homes but remained in Syria. More than 4.7 million refugees are registered in neighboring countries, most in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Since Assad\u2019s fall though, almost 302,000 have returned.",
      "Despite the challenges, U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher, who will attend the conference, is upbeat. \u201cIt is now easier for us to operate in Syria and across Syria than it was under the Assad regime,\u201d Fletcher told reporters last week.",
      "\u201cI had excellent conversations with the caretaker authorities,\u201d he said, noting that al-Shibani in particular had helped to keep border crossings open.",
      "While the aim of Monday's conference is to generate aid pledges, it\u2019s also focused on meeting Syria\u2019s economic needs, and that requires calm. Infrastructure, health and education must be scaled up. Jobs and cash for work programs are needed so that Syrians can start to make a living.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- The videos roll through TikTok in 30-second flashes.",
      "Migrants trek in camouflage through dry desert terrain. Dune buggies roar up to the United States-Mexico border barrier. Families with young children pass through gaps in the wall. Helicopters, planes, yachts, tunnels and jet skis stand by for potential customers.",
      "Laced with emojis, the videos posted by smugglers offer a simple promise: If you don\u2019t have a visa in the U.S., trust us. We\u2019ll get you over safely.",
      "At a time when legal pathways to the U.S. have been slashed and criminal groups are raking in money from migrant smuggling, social media apps like TikTok have become an essential tool for smugglers and migrants alike. The videos \u2014 taken to cartoonish extremes \u2014 offer a rare look inside a long elusive industry and the narratives used by trafficking networks to fuel migration north.",
      "\u201cWith God\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to continue working to fulfill the dreams of foreigners. Safe travels without robbing our people,\u201d wrote one enterprising smuggler.",
      "As President Donald Trump begins to ramp up a crackdown at the border and migration levels to the U.S. dip, smugglers say new technologies allow networks to be more agile in the face of challenges, and expand their reach to new customers \u2014 a far cry from the old days when each village had its trusted smuggler.",
      "\u201cIn this line of work, you have to switch tactics,\u201d said a woman named Soary, part of a smuggling network bringing migrants from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso, Texas, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that her last name would not be shared out of concern that authorities would track her down. \u201cTikTok goes all over the world.\"",
      "Soary, 24, began working in smuggling when she was 19, living in El Paso, where she was approached by a friend about a job. She would use her truck to pick up migrants who had recently jumped the border. Despite the risks involved with working with trafficking organizations, she said it earned her more as a single mother than her previous job putting in hair extensions.",
      "As she gained more contacts on both sides of the border, she began connecting people from across the Americas with a network of smugglers to sneak them across borders and eventually into the U.S.",
      "Like many smugglers, she would take videos of migrants speaking to the camera after crossing the border to send over WhatsApp as evidence to loved ones that her clients had gotten to their destination safely. Now she posts those clips to TikTok.",
      "TikTok says the platform strictly prohibits human smuggling and reports such content to law enforcement.",
      "The use of social media to facilitate migration took off around 2017 and 2018, when activists built massive WhatsApp groups to coordinate the first major migrant caravans traveling from Central America to the U.S., according to Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University focused on the migrant smuggling industry.",
      "Later, smugglers began to infiltrate those chats and use the choice social media app of the day, expanding to Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Migrants, too, began to document their often perilous voyages north, posting videos trekking through the jungles of the Darien Gap dividing Colombia and Panama, and after being released by extorting cartels.",
      "A 2023 study by the United Nations reported that 64% of the migrants they interviewed had access to a smart phone and the internet during their migration to the U.S.",
      "Around the time of the study's release, as use of the app began to soar, that Correa-Cabrera said she began to see smuggling ads skyrocket on TikTok.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a marketing strategy,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said. \u201cEveryone was on TikTok, particularly after the pandemic, and then it began to multiply.\u201d",
      "Last year, Soary, the smuggler, said she began to publish videos of migrants and families in the U.S. with their faces covered and photos of the U.S.-Mexico border with messages like: \u201cWe\u2019ll pass you through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, no matter where you are. Fence jumping, treks and by tunnel. Adults, children and the elderly.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of videos examined by the AP feature thick wads of cash, people crossing through the border fence by night, helicopters and airplanes supposedly used by coyotes, smugglers cutting open cacti in the desert for migrants to drink from and even crops of lettuce with text reading \u201cThe American fields are ready!\u201d",
      "The videos are often layered over heavy northern Mexican music with lyrics waxing romantically about being traffickers. Videos are published by accounts with names alluding to \u201csafe crossing,\u201d \u201cUSA destinations,\u201d \u201cfulfilling dreams\u201d or \u201cpolleros,\u201d as smugglers are often called.",
      "Narratives shift based on the political environment and immigration policies in the U.S. During the Biden administration, posts would advertise getting migrants access to asylum applications through the administration's CBP One app, which Trump ended.",
      "Amid Trump's crackdown, posts have shifted to dispelling fears that migrants will be captured, promising American authorities have been paid off. Smugglers openly taunt U.S. authorities: one shows himself smoking what appears to be marijuana right in front of the border wall; another even takes a jab at Trump, referring to the president as a \u201chigh-strung gringo.\u201d",
      "Comments are dotted with emojis of flags and baby chickens, a symbol meaning migrant among smugglers, and other users asking for prices and more information.",
      "Cristina, who migrated because she struggled make ends meet in the Mexican state of Zacatecas, was among those scrolling in December after the person she had hired to smuggle her to the U.S. abandoned her and her partner in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.",
      "\u201cIn a moment of desperation, I started searching on TikTok and, well, with the algorithm videos began to pop up,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me a half an hour\u201d to find a smuggler.",
      "After connecting, smugglers and migrants often negotiate on encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, doing a careful dance to gain each other's trust. Cristina, now living in Phoenix, said she decided to trust Soary because she was a woman and posted videos of families, something the smuggler admitted was a tactic to gain migrants' trust.",
      "Smugglers, migrants and authorities warn that such videos have been used to scam migrants or lure them into traps at a time when cartels are increasingly using kidnapping and extortion as a means to rake in more money.",
      "One smuggler, who asked to only be identified by his TikTok name \u201cThe Corporation\u201d due to fear of authorities tracking him down said other accounts would steal his migrant smuggling network's videos of customers saying to camera they arrived safely in the U.S.",
      "\u201cAnd there's not much we can do legally. I mean, it's not like we can report them,\u201d he said with a laugh.",
      "In other cases, migrants say that they were forced by traffickers to take the videos even if they haven't arrived safely to their destinations.",
      "The illicit advertisements have fueled concern among international authorities like the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, which warned in a report about the use of the technology that \u201cnetworks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and evasive, thus challenging government authorities to address new, non-traditional forms of this crime.\u201d",
      "In February, a Mexican prosecutor also confirmed to the AP that they were investigating a network of accounts advertising crossings through a tunnel running under the border fence between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. But investigators would not provide more details.",
      "In the meantime, hundreds of accounts post videos of trucks crossing border, of stacks of cash and migrants, faces covered with emojis, promising they made it safely across the border.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to cross and we\u2019re not scared,\u201d one wrote.",
      "___",

      "The jury will deliberate after the closing arguments and jury instructions. Nine jurors and two alternates have heard the case.",
      "North Dakota District Court Judge James Gion told the jury last month when the trial began, \u201cYou are the judges of all questions of fact in this case,\u201d and to \u201cbase your verdict on the evidence.\u201d",
      "Dallas-based Energy Transfer and its subsidiary Dakota Access alleged defamation, trespass, nuisance and other offenses by Netherlands-based Greenpeace International, its American branch Greenpeace USA, and funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc. The pipeline company is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.",
      "The lawsuit stems from protests in 2016 and 2017 of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline and its Missouri River crossing upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The tribe for years has opposed the pipeline as a risk to its water supply. The pipeline has transported oil since mid-2017.",
      "Trey Cox, an attorney for the pipeline company, previously said Greenpeace \u201cplanned, organized and funded a game plan to stop construction\u201d of the pipeline, \u201cwhatever the cost.\u201d",
      "Cox also alleged Greenpeace paid outsiders to come into the area to protest, sent blockade supplies, organized or led protester trainings, passed \u201ccritical intel\u201d to the protesters and told untrue statements to stop the line from being built.",
      "He said a letter signed by leaders of Greenpeace International and Greenpeace USA and sent to Energy Transfer's banks contained an allegedly defamatory statement that the company desecrated burial grounds and culturally important sites during construction.",
      "Greenpeace's \u201cdeceptive narrative scared off lenders\u201d and the company lost half its banks, Cox said.",
      "Attorneys for the Greenpeace entities denied the allegations, saying there is no evidence, they had little or no involvement with the protests and the letter was signed by hundreds of organizations from dozens of countries, with no financial institution to testify the organization received, read or was influenced by the letter.",
      "Greenpeace representatives have said the lawsuit is an example of corporations abusing the legal system to go after critics and is a critical test of free speech and protest rights. An Energy Transfer spokesperson said the case is about Greenpeace not following the law, not free speech."

      "A German court has started hearing a Peruvian farmer\u2019s case against major energy company RWE",
      "HAMM, Germany -- A German court on Monday started hearing a Peruvian farmer's case against major energy company RWE, a lawsuit arguing that global warming fueled by the firm's historical greenhouse gas emissions ultimately poses a risk to his home.",
      "Experts say the case at the state court in Hamm, in western Germany, could set a significant precedent in the fight to hold major polluters accountable for climate change.",
      "Sa\u00fal Luciano Lliuya's lawsuit against RWE argues that the company\u2019s historical greenhouse gas emissions have fueled global warming, accelerating glacial melt above his hometown of Huaraz, Peru. As a result, Lake Palcacocha has swelled to dangerous levels, threatening the community with the risk of catastrophic flooding.",
      "RWE, which has never operated in Peru, denies legal responsibility, arguing that climate change is a global issue caused by many contributors.",
      "The mountains, glaciers and lakes \u201cgive us water, give us life,\u201d Lliuya said outside the courthouse, standing in front of photos of glaciers in the shape of mountains. But \u201cthe glaciers are melting, are disappearing bit by bit. Some lakes, lakes like Palcacocha \u2014 it's a risk to me, to more than 50,000 people who live in the zone at risk.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have waited 10 years for this day, this decisive day,\u201d he said to cheers from supporters. \u201cI'm very excited; I hope that everything goes well.\u201d",
      "The lead lawyer in the complaint, Roda Verheyen, said she was \u201ccalm but hopeful.\u201d She said that \u201cthere is no time to be lost, because the glaciers are melting every day.\u201d",
      "RWE \u201cis still one of the biggest emitters of CO2 in all of Europe,\u201d Verheyen said. \u201cThis is only a very first step \u2014 a trampoline for further cases of this kind\u201d that could target other emitters.",
      "RWE argues that the lawsuit is legally inadmissible and that it sets a dangerous precedent by holding individual emitters accountable for global climate change. It insists climate solutions should be addressed through state and international policies, not the courts.",
      "Judges and experts from Germany visited Peru in 2022, and the court is expected to consider on Monday and Wednesday expert reports on the possible risks to Lliuya's house. It wasn't immediately clear whether it will announce its conclusions on the case this week.",

      "Shopping for a new home",
      "Shopping for a new home? Ready to renovate your kitchen or install a new deck? You'll be paying more to do so.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on imported goods from Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 some already in place, others set to take effect in a few weeks \u2014 are already driving up the cost of building materials used in new residential construction and home remodeling projects.",
      "The tariffs are projected to raise the costs that go into building a single-family home in the U.S. by $7,500 to $10,000, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Such costs are typically passed along to the homebuyer in the form of higher prices, which could hurt demand at a time when the U.S. housing market remains in a slump and many builders are having to offer buyers costly incentives to drum up sales.",
      "We Buy Houses in San Francisco, which purchases foreclosed homes and then typically renovates and sells them, is increasing prices on its refurbished properties between 7% and 12%. That's even after saving $52,000 in costs by stockpiling 62% more Canadian lumber than usual.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty of how long these tariffs will continue has been the most challenging aspect of our planning,\u201d said CEO Mamta Saini.",
      "The timing of the tariffs couldn\u2019t be worse for homebuilders and the home remodeling industry, as this is typically the busiest time of year for home sales. The prospect of a trade war has roiled the stock market and stoked worries about the economy, which could lead many would-be homebuyers to remain on the sidelines.",
      "\u201cRising costs due to tariffs on imports will leave builders with few options,\u201d said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. \u201cThey can choose to pass higher costs along to consumers, which will mean higher home prices, or try to use less of these materials, which will mean smaller homes.\u201d",
      "Prices for building materials, including lumber, have been rising, even though the White House has delayed its tariffs rollout on some products. Lumber futures jumped to $658.71 per thousand board feet on March 4, reaching their highest level in more than two years.",
      "The increase is already inflating costs for construction projects.",
      "Dana Schnipper, a partner at building materials supplier JC Ryan in Farmingdale, New York, sourced wooden doors and frames for an apartment complex in Nassau County from a company in Canada that cost less than the American equivalent.",
      "Half the job has already been supplied. But once the tariff goes into effect it will be applied to the remaining $75,000, adding $19,000 to the at-cost total. Once JC Ryan applies its mark up, that means the customer will owe $30,000 more than originally planned, Schnipper said.",
      "He also expects the tariffs will give American manufacturers cover to raise prices on steel components.",
      "\u201cThese prices will never come down,\u201d Schnipper said. \u201cWhatever is going to happen, these things will be sticky and hopefully we\u2019re good enough as a small business, that we can absorb some of that. We can\u2019t certainly absorb all of it, so I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s going to be an interesting couple of months.\u201d",
      "Sidestepping the tariffs by using an alternative to imported building materials isn\u2019t always an option.",
      "Bar Zakheim, owner of Better Place Design & Build, a contracting business in San Diego that specializes in building accessible dwelling units, or ADUs, said Canada remains the best source for lumber.",
      "By sticking with imported lumber, Zakheim had to raise his prices about 15% compared with a year ago. He also has 8% fewer jobs lined up compared with last year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not about to go out of business, but it\u2019s looking to be a slow, expensive year for us,\u201d he said.",
      "On March 6, the Trump administration announced a one-month delay on its 25% tariffs on certain imports from Mexico and Canada, including softwood lumber. Tariffs of 20% on imports from China are already in effect. A 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports \u2014 50% on those from Canada \u2014 kicked in on March 12.",
      "Tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods slated to go into effect next month will raise the cost of imported construction materials by more than $3 billion, according to the NAHB. Those price hikes would be in addition to a 14.5% tariff on Canadian lumber previously imposed by the U.S., ratcheting up tariffs on Canadian lumber to 39.5%.",
      "Building materials costs overall are already up 34% since December 2020, according to the NAHB.",
      "Builders depend on raw materials, appliances and many other components produced abroad. About 7.3% of all products used in single-family home and apartment building construction are imported. Of those, nearly a quarter come from Canada and Mexico, according to the NAHB.",
      "Both nations also account for 70% of the imports of two key home construction materials: lumber and gypsum. Canadian lumber is used in everything from framing to cabinetry and furniture. Mexican gypsum is used to make drywall.",
      "Beyond raw materials, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners and an array of other home components are manufactured in Mexico and China, which is also a key source of steel and aluminum.",
      "The tariffs will mean higher prices for home improvement shoppers, said Dent Johnson, president of True Value Hardware, which operates more than 4,000 independently owned hardware stores.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that many products on the shelves of your local hardware store will eventually be affected,\u201d he said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press.",
      "Confusion over the timing and scope of the tariffs, and their impact on the economy, could have a bigger chilling effect on the new-home market than higher prices.",
      "\u201cIf consumers can\u2019t plan, if builders can\u2019t plan, it gets very difficult to know how to price product because you don\u2019t know what price you need to move it,\u201d said Carl Reichardt, a homebuilding analyst at BTIG. \u201cIf people are worried about their jobs, worried about the future, it\u2019s very difficult to make the decision to buy a new home, whatever the price.\u201d",
      "The uncertainty created by the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs policy will probably result in increased volatility for home sales and new home construction this year, said Robert Dietz, the NAHB's chief economist.",
      "Still, because it can take several months for a home to be built, the larger impact of from building materials costs are going to happen \u201cdown the road,\u201d Dietz said.",
      "The impact tariffs are having on consumers is already evident at Slutsky Lumber in Ellenville, N.Y.",
      "\u201cThere are not as many people getting ready for spring like they usually are,\u201d said co-owner Jonathan Falcon. \u201cIt seems like people are just cutting back on spending.\u201d",
      "Falcon also worries that smaller businesses like his will have a tough time absorbing the impact of the tariffs.",
      "\u201cThis is just like another thing that\u2019s going to be harder for small lumber yards to handle than the big guys and just sort of keep driving businesses like us to not make it,\u201d he said.",

      "Forever 21 has filed for bankruptcy protection for a second time as traffic in U.S. shopping malls fades and competition from online retailers like Amazon, Temu and Shein intensifies.",
      "F21 OpCo, which runs Forever 21 stores, said late Sunday that it will wind down the business in the U.S. under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while determining if it can continue as a business with a partner, or if it will sell some or all of its assets.",
      "\u201cWhile we have evaluated all options to best position the company for the future, we have been unable to find a sustainable path forward, given competition from foreign fast fashion companies, which have been able to take advantage of the de minimis exemption to undercut our brand on pricing and margin,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brad Sell said in a statement.",
      "The de minimis tax exemption lets shipments headed to U.S. businesses and consumers valued at less than $800 to enter the country tax free and duty free.",
      "Forever 21 stores in the U.S. will hold liquidation sales and the website will continue to run while operations wind down. The retailer's locations outside of the U.S. are run by other licensees and are not included in the bankruptcy filing. International store locations and websites will continue operating as normal.",
      "Authentic Brands Group owns the international intellectual property associated with the Forever 21 brand and may license the brand to other operators, F21OpCo said.",
      "Forever 21 first filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019. It was acquired by a consortium of parties including Authentic Brands Group and mall owners Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners.",
      "Forever 21 was founded in 1984 and, along with other fast-fashion chains like H&M and Zara, rode a wave of popularity among young customers in the mid-1990s. Their popularity grew during the Great Recession, when shoppers were seeking bargains. But Forever 21 went on an aggressive expansion just as shoppers were moving more online.",
      "Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a statement that part of the problem now is that Forever 21's stores are too big for its current needs and it's in malls with not enough foot traffic.",
      "\u201cForever 21 was always a retailer living on borrowed time. Over recent years it has been hit with dual headwinds from a weak apparel market and stiff competition from cheap Chinese marketplaces,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth things have eroded its standing and depleted its market share.\u201d"

      "The United States under President Donald Trump has launched a new campaign of intense airstrikes targeting Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The United States under President Donald Trump has launched a new campaign of intense airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels.",
      "This weekend's strikes killed at least 53 people, including children, and wounded others. The campaign is likely to continue, part of a wider pressure campaign by Trump now targeting the Houthis' main benefactor, Iran, as well.",
      "Here's what to know about the U.S. strikes and what could happen next:",
      "The Houthi rebels attacked over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, from November 2023 until January this year. Their leadership described the attacks as aiming to end the Israeli war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The campaign also greatly raised the Houthis' profile in the wider Arab world and tamped down on public criticism against their human rights abuses and crackdowns on dissent and aid workers.",
      "Trump, writing on his social media platform Truth Social, said his administration targeted the Houthis over their \u201cunrelenting campaign of piracy, violence and terrorism.\u201d He noted the disruption Houthi attacks have caused through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, key waterways for energy and cargo shipments between Asia and Europe through Egypt's Suez Canal.",
      "\u201cWe will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. and the United Kingdom began a series of airstrikes against the Houthis starting in January 2024. A December report by The International Institute for Strategic Studies said the U.S. and its partners struck the Houthis over 260 times up to that point.",
      "U.S. military officials during that period acknowledged having a far-wider target list for possible strikes. While the Biden administration didn't go too far into explaining its targeting, analysts believe officials largely were trying to avoid civilian casualties and not rekindle Yemen's stalemated war, which pits the Houthis and their allies against the country's exiled government and their local and international allies, like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "The Trump administration, however, appears willing to go after more targets, based on the weekend's strikes and public remarks made by officials.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News' \u201cFace The Nation\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s the mission here, and it will continue until that\u2019s carried out.\u201d",
      "Rubio added: \u201cSome of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us, and I can tell you that some of the facilities that they used are no longer existing, and that will continue.\u201d",
      "In two words: More attacks.",
      "The Houthis said last week they'll again target \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships traveling through Mideast waterways like the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, because of Israel's blocking of aid to the Gaza Strip. No rebel attack targeting commercial shipping has been reported as of Monday morning.",
      "However, the new U.S. campaign likely could inspire Houthi attacks at sea or on land beyond American warships. The rebels previously targeted oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, two countries deeply involved in Yemen's war since 2015.",
      "\u201cAlthough the U.S. has been striking at Houthi targets for over a year, the scope and scale of this new campaign, including the targeting of senior Houthi figures, marks a significant escalation in the conflict,\u201d analysts at the Eurasia Group said Monday.",
      "Gulf Arab countries \"will distance themselves from ongoing hostilities but now face threats to their major oil infrastructure. The Houthis will want to hit President Donald Trump where it hurts, oil prices.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Houthis likely will expand their possible targets for ship attacks, meaning shippers will continue to stay out of the region, said Jakob P. Larsen, the head of maritime security for BIMCO, the largest international association representing shipowners.",
      "Iran long has armed the Houthis, who are members of Islam\u2019s minority Shiite Zaydi sect, which ruled Yemen for 1,000 years until 1962. Tehran routinely denies arming the rebels, despite physical evidence, numerous seizures and experts tying the weapons back to Iran. That's likely because Tehran wants to avoid sanctions for violating a United Nations arms embargo on the Houthis.",
      "The Houthis now form the strongest group within Iran's self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance.\" Others like Lebanon's Hezbollah and the Palestinian militant group Hamas have been decimated by Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas that sparked Israel's war of attrition in the Gaza Strip. Allied Shiite militias in Iraq largely have kept their heads down since the U.S. launched retaliatory attacks last year over a drone attack that killed three American troops and injured at least 34 others at a military base in Jordan.",
      "While Iranian state television aired footage of civilian casualties from the weekend strikes in Yemen, top political leaders stayed away from suggestion Tehran itself would get involved in the fight. Revolutionary Guard chief Gen. Hossein Salami notably underscored the Houthis made their own decisions \u2014 while not offering any warning over what would happen if the strikes killed any members of the Guard's expeditionary Quds Force, who are believed to actively support the rebels on the ground.",
      "\u201cWe have always declared \u2014 and we declare again today \u2014 that the Yemenis are an independent and free nation in their own land, with an independent national policy,\u201d Salami said.",
      "Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz, speaking to ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, warned Guard officials training the Houthis \u201cwill be on the table too\u201d as possible targets for attack.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran is still trying to determine how to respond to a letter from Trump aiming to restart negotiations over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said Monday officials continue to review the letter and will respond \"after investigations are completed.\u201d",
      "Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi separately traveled Sunday to Oman, which long has been an interlocutor between Tehran and the West. The Houthis also operate a political office in the sultanate.",
      "The attacks on the Houthis are \u201ca not-so-subtle signal to Iran, as President Trump has been unequivocal in his insistence that Iran return to the negotiating table to deal with its nuclear program,\u201d the New York-based Soufan Center said in an analysis Monday."

      "The High Court in London on Monday dismissed an appeal from a small group of creditors who argued that the funding package was too expensive and favored bigger lenders. The appeal challenged the court\u2019s earlier decision to authorize the deal, which has been backed by lenders holding about 90% of the company\u2019s debt.",
      "The court said it would release the reasoning behind its decision at a later date.",
      "Thames Water, which has about 17 billion pounds ($20.9 billion) of debt, was in danger of running out of money within days if the court had not authorized the new funding. That would have forced the government to consider nationalizing the company.",
      "Both the government and Thames Water say water will continue flowing to customers regardless of what happens.",
      "Thames Water is at the center of nationwide anger over sewage spills that have fouled lakes, rivers and beaches at a time when water and sewage companies are seeking billions of pounds in rate increases to modernize their systems and cope with the demands of climate change and population growth.",
      "Consumers and politicians have criticized the company, arguing that Thames Water created its own problems by paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs. Company executives say the fault lies with regulators who kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of the cash it needed to fund improvements.",
      "Ofwat, which regulates water companies in England and Wales, in December approved a 35% increase in Thames Water\u2019s consumer charges over the next five years. The company argued that bills needed to rise 53% in order to finance needed projects and provide the financial returns necessary to attract investors."

    "story": [
      "In the Central Mamuju district of Indonesia\u2019s West Sulawesi, where the Budong-Budong River meets the sea, people have long feared crocodiles",
      "BUDONG-BUDONG, Indonesia -- Nearly seven months after a crocodile attack almost took her life, Munirpa walked to the estuary outside her home with her husband and her children, ready to brave a reenactment.",
      "Munirpa, who like many Indonesians only uses one name, recounted how one early morning in August, she threw her household garbage into a creek about 50 meters (164 feet) away from her house, as she normally would.",
      "She didn't see what was coming next.",
      "By the time she realized a crocodile had attacked her, the four-meter-long (13-foot) beast had already sunk its teeth into most of her body, sparing only her head. She fought hard, trying to jab its eyes. Her husband, hearing her screams, ran over and tried to pull her by the thigh out of the crocodile's jaws. A tug-of-war ensued; the reptile whipped him with its tail. Fortunately, he saved Munirpa in time, eventually dragging her out of the crocodile's grip.",
      "People have long feared the ancient predators in the Central Mamuju district of Indonesia\u2019s West Sulawesi, where the Budong-Budong River meets the sea. For Munirpa, 48, that fear turned into a brutal reality when she became one of nearly 180 recorded crocodile attack victims in Indonesia last year. Residents like her are learning to coexist with the crocodiles, a legally protected species in Indonesia, as they balance conservation with looking out for their safety. But as attacks rise, several residents and experts have called for better government interventions to stop the problem from getting even worse.",
      "Following the attack, Munirpa was hospitalized for a month and has had two surgeries. By February this year, her fear was still clearly visible, as were the scars on her legs and thighs.",
      "\u201cI am so scared. I don\u2019t want to go to the beach. Even to the back of the house, I don\u2019t dare to go,\" said Munirpa. \u201cI am traumatized. I asked my children not to go to the river, or to the backyard, or go fishing.\"",
      "In the villages surrounding the Budong-Budong River, like Munirpa's, crocodiles have become a daily topic of conversation. Their presence has become so common that warning signs now mark the areas where they lurk, from the river mouth to the waterways which were once a popular swimming spot for children.",
      "In 2024, there were 179 crocodile attacks in Indonesia, the highest number of crocodile attacks in the world, with 92 fatalities, according to CrocAttack, an independent database. Social media videos showing crocodile appearances and attacks in Sulawesi and other regions in Indonesia are also on the rise.",
      "The increase in attacks began about 12 years ago with the rise of palm oil plantations around the river mouth, said 39-year-old crocodile handler Rusli Paraili. Some companies carved artificial waterways, linking them to the larger part of the Budong-Budong River. That was when the crocodiles started straying, leaving the river and creeping to nearby residential areas, such as fish and shrimp ponds, he explained.",
      "Palm oil plantations now dominate the landscape in West Sulawesi, from the mountains to the coast, and patrolling for crocodiles has become part of people's daily routine. When residents check the water pumps in their ponds, they have no choice but to keep out an eye for the beasts \u2014 flashlights in hand, scouring up, down and across canals and waterways \u2014 resigned to the uneasy reality of sharing their home with a predator.",
      "The saltwater crocodile has been a legally protected species in Indonesia since 1999, making it an animal that cannot be hunted freely. As a top predator, there is also no population control in nature.",
      "Paraili, the crocodile handler, said that while the law protects crocodiles from being killed, the rise in attacks is a major concern. In response, he's taken care of some of the crocs in a specially-designed farm away from human populations. He's received some financial support from the government and community donations, as well as support from palm oil companies for the last five years.",
      "The farm has four ponds and around 50 reptiles. Some have names: Tanker, the largest, shaped like a ship, or Karossa, named after the sub-district the animal was caught after fatally attacking someone.",
      "When funds run low, he uses his own money to ensure they\u2019re fed, at least once every four days.",
      "Amir Hamidy, who studies reptiles at the National Research and Innovation Agency, worries the rise in attacks indicates that crocodile numbers are becoming far too dangerous. Hamidy supports better population control.",
      "Being a protected species \u201cdoes not necessarily mean that the population cannot be reduced when it is at a level that is indeed unsafe,\" he said.",
      "Around a year ago in Tumbu village, Suardi, who goes by one name, was harvesting coconuts when they fell into the river. When he went to retrieve them, he was attacked by a crocodile he initially didn't notice. He's since made a full recovery.",
      "Still, the experience has made him more cautious. \u201cYes, I am worried. But what else can we do,\" Suardi said. \u201cThe important thing is that we are careful enough.\u201d",
      "Along with Munirpa, Suardi is one of 10 people in the region who was attacked by a crocodile last year. Three of those attacked were killed.",
      "Suyuti Marzuki, who's head of West Sulawesi Marine and Fisheries Agency, said the crocodile habitat shift is making people's everyday activities \u2014 like harvesting coconuts, fishing or even disposing of garbage like Munirpa \u2014 very risky.",
      "Marzuki said the government is looking at possible options that can provide both safety and economic alternatives for residents.",
      "While he acknowledged that crocodile population numbers and ecosystems need to be protected, Marzuki also raised the possibility of bolstering the local economy through the crocodile skin trade. That industry is controversial because of conservation and animal welfare issues.",
      "Paraili, the crocodile handler, also urged serious government interventions.",
      "\"This is a matter of human lives. So when the government is not serious, then our brothers and sisters in the future \u2014 in 5 or 15 years \u2014 there will be even more who will die from being attacked by crocodiles,\u201d he said.",
      "Residents like Munirpa and Suardi are waiting for more immediate and realistic steps from the authorities to ensure their community's and families' safety.",
      "\u201cIt is enough that I've been bitten by a crocodile,\" Munirpa said. \u201cI won\u2019t let it happen to my children.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. shoppers stepped up their spending a just bit in February after a sharp pullback the previous month, signaling that Americans are shopping more cautiously as concerns about the direction of the economy mount.",
      "Retail sales rose just 0.2% in February, a small rebound after a sharp drop of 1.2% in January, the Commerce Department said Monday. Sales rose at grocery stores, home and garden stores, and online retailers. Sales fell at auto dealers, restaurants, and electronics stores.",
      "The small increase suggests Americans may be growing more wary about spending as the stock market has plunged and President Donald Trump's tariff threats and government spending cuts have led to widespread uncertainty among consumers and businesses.",
      "Some economists were relieved the numbers weren\u2019t worse. Still, many expect consumer spending will grow just 1% to 1.5% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, far below the 4.2% gain in the final quarter last year.",
      "\u201cConsumer spending is on track to slow sharply this quarter, but not by as much as we previously feared,\u201d Stephen Brown, an economist at Capital Economics, a consulting firm, said in an email.",
      "On Friday, a measure of consumer sentiment fell sharply for the third straight month and is now down more than 20% since December. Respondents to the University of Michigan's survey cited policy uncertainty as a leading reason for the gloomier outlook. While the respondents were divided sharply by party \u2014 sentiment about the current economy fell among Republican by much less than for Democrats \u2014 Republicans' confidence in the economy's future dropped 10%.",
      "Consumers from all income levels are feeling more strained, according to a slew of earnings reports over the past few weeks from major retailers including Walmart, Macy\u2019s and Dollar General.",
      "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer and a bellwether for the retail sector, released a weak outlook last month citing uncertainty around tariffs.",
      "February sales also fell last month at gas stations, clothing stores, and sporting goods stores. The figures aren't adjusted for prices, and the cost of gas also declined in February, which likely accounts for most of the drop. Excluding gas and autos, retail sales rose 0.5%, a healthier figure but still modest after a plunge of 0.8% in January.",
      "Also Monday, the National Association of Homebuilders said its index measuring builder sentiment fell three points to 39, the lowest level in seven months, as economic uncertainty dimmed builders' outlook and fewer potential buyers visited homes.",
      "\u201cEconomic uncertainty, the threat of tariffs and elevated construction costs pushed builder sentiment down in March,\u201d the group said. The homebuilders estimate tariffs will add $9,200 to the cost of a new home.",

      "Hiring has mostly held up and there are no signs that companies are laying off workers. As long as Americans have jobs, spending could remain resilient. But that is not assured.",
      "Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said Thursday that the overall economic picture for his customers is not ideal and the company said it would close around 100 stores.",
      "\u201cOur customers continue to report that their financial situation has worsened over the last year as they have been negatively impacted by ongoing inflation \u201d Vasos said during an earnings call. \u201cMany of our customers report that they only have enough money for basic essentials, with some noting that they have had to sacrifice even on the necessities.\u201d",
      "Spending patterns at Costco have changed to accommodate a soured view of the economy, including a shift toward ground beef and poultry instead of more expensive cuts of meat, said to Gary Millership, the company\u2019s chief financial officer.",
      "American Eagle Outfitters CEO Jay Schottenstein said angst is particularly high among younger customers.",
      "\u201cNot just tariffs, not just inflation,\" said Schottenstein. \"We see the government cutting people off. They don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to affect them. And when people don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know \u2013 they get very conservative.\u201d",
      "The retail sales report mostly just covers goods purchases \u2014 as well as restaurant sales \u2014 but there are signs Americans are cutting back spending on services as well.",

      "President Donald Trump has signed into law legislation funding the government through the end of September",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has signed into law legislation funding the government through the end of September, ending the threat of a partial government shutdown and capping off a struggle in Congress that deeply divided Democrats.",
      "Harrison Fields, White House principal deputy press secretary, said in a post on X that Trump signed the continuing resolution Saturday.",
      "The bill largely keeps government funding at levels set during Joe Biden's presidency, though with changes. It trims non-defense spending by about $13 billion from the previous year and increases defense spending by about $6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly $1.7 trillion.",
      "The Senate cleared the legislation on Friday in a 54-46 party line vote, with 10 members of the Senate Democratic caucus helping the bill advance to passage despite opposition from within their party \u2014 most vocally from colleagues in the House, who exhorted them to reject the bill out of hand.",
      "Senate Democrats argued for days over whether to force a shutdown, livid that Republicans in the House had drafted and passed the spending measure without their input. Democrats said the legislation shortchanges health care, housing and other priorities and gives Trump wide leeway to redirect federal spending even as his administration and the Department of Government Efficiency rapidly dismantle congressionally approved agencies and programs.",
      "In the end, enough of the Democratic senators decided a government shutdown would be even worse than letting the funding bill pass.",

      "A groundbreaking climate lawsuit heads to trial in Germany next week, as Peruvian farmer Sa\u00fal Luciano Lliuya challenges German energy giant RWE",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- As a crucial climate lawsuit heads to trial in Germany next week, experts say the case brought by Peruvian farmer Saul Luciano Lliuya against German energy giant RWE could set a significant precedent in the fight to hold major polluters accountable for climate change.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the first cases of its kind \u2014 a case brought by someone directly affected by climate change against a major greenhouse gas emitter \u2014 that has made it all the way to trial,\u201d said Noah Walker-Crawford, a research fellow at the London School of Economics and an adviser to the non-profit Germanwatch, which has been advising Lliuya.",
      "Lliuya\u2019s lawsuit against RWE argues that the company\u2019s historical greenhouse gas emissions have fueled global warming, accelerating glacial melt above his hometown of Huaraz, Peru. As a result, Lake Palcacocha has swelled to dangerous levels, threatening the community with the risk of catastrophic flooding.",
      "RWE, which has never operated in Peru, denies legal responsibility, arguing that climate change is a global issue caused by many contributors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sad and painful to see the glaciers melting,\u201d Lliuya, 45, told Associated Press in a video call from Germany. \u201cThere is a lot of concern from people in my community about the future, about the issue of water, because all the rivers that come down from the mountains are used for farming.\u201d",
      "Walker-Crawford said of all these cases around the world, this is the one that\u2019s gone the furthest.",
      "\u201cIt has already set a partial precedent in that the courts found it admissible in 2017, which means that the judges said the case is solid in legal terms,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, the court is hearing evidence, and we\u2019ll see whether the company\u2019s responsibility can be proven in this specific case.\u201d",
      "Sebastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, says the reason why the case is so significant is not the decision itself or the amount of damages sought, but the precedent it would set.",
      "\u201cIf we could use tort law to say that any fossil fuel corporation that has contributed significantly to climate change can be held liable for climate-related costs in proportion to their emissions, it could open the door for many similar cases worldwide,\u201d he said.",
      "The case could be \u201ca game changer\u201d, according to Murray Worthy, from Zero Carbon Analytics, a research group on climate change.",
      "\u201cThis case is absolutely crucial,\" Worthy said. \u201cWhile this is just one case focused on this one place in Peru, the wider implications are huge. The costs and damages from climate change could run to tens of trillions of dollars a year, and if fossil fuel companies at large are found to be responsible for those and need to pay those costs, it would completely change the finances and outlook for the entire fossil fuel industry.\u201d",
      "RWE is one of Germany\u2019s largest energy companies, historically recognized as a major producer of electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "RWE says the lawsuit is legally inadmissible and that it sets a dangerous precedent by holding individual emitters accountable for global climate change.",
      "\u201cIn our view, there is no legal basis for holding individual issuers liable for global phenomena such as climate change. Due to the large number of global emissions of greenhouse gases from both natural and human sources, as well as the complexity of the climate, it is not possible, in our opinion, to legally attribute specific effects of climate change to a single issuer,\u201d the company said in response to questions posed by AP.",
      "The company insists climate solutions should be addressed through state and international policies, not the courts.",
      "Walker-Crawford said the court is entering the evidence-gathering phase, examining whether Lliuya's home actually faces a significant risk of flooding.",
      "\u201cIf the court decides that the risk is high enough, it will then assess whether RWE\u2019s emissions can be scientifically linked to that risk,\u201d he said.",
      "Regardless of the case\u2019s final outcome, Walker-Crawford said it\u2019s likely to reinforce the legal foundation for future lawsuits.",
      "\u201cEven if the specific risk in this case isn\u2019t deemed high enough, the precedent that companies can be held liable for their climate impacts would still stand,\u201d he said.",
      "The case\u2019s outcome could also have financial repercussions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re already starting to see the impact of climate litigation on financial markets,\u201d Walker-Crawford said. \u201cResearch has shown that when climate cases against corporations move past major hurdles, it negatively affects the stock market value of the companies being sued. Investors are starting to take note of the significant financial liability climate litigation can pose.\u201d",
      "Lliuya, who also works as a mountain guide for tourists, said he started the lawsuit with little hope. Ten years on, that hope has grown.",
      "\u201cWhen the German judges visited my home and the lake in 2022, it gave me hope \u2014 hope that our voices were being heard and that justice might be possible,\" he said. \u201cWhatever the outcome, we have come a long way and I feel good about that,\u201d he said.",
      "The hearing will begin Monday.",

      "The replacements for NASA's two stuck astronauts are on their way to the International Space Station",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- The replacements for NASA\u2019s two stuck astronauts launched to the International Space Station on Friday night, paving the way for the pair\u2019s return after nine long months.",
      "Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams need SpaceX to get this relief team to the space station before they can check out. Arrival is set for late Saturday night.",
      "NASA wants overlap between the two crews so Wilmore and Williams can fill in the newcomers on happenings aboard the orbiting lab. That would put them on course for an undocking next week and a splashdown off the Florida coast, weather permitting.",
      "The duo will be escorted back by astronauts who flew up on a rescue mission on SpaceX last September alongside two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams on the return leg.",
      "Reaching orbit from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, the newest crew includes NASA\u2019s Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, both military pilots; and Japan\u2019s Takuya Onishi and Russia\u2019s Kirill Peskov, both former airline pilots. They will spend the next six months at the space station, considered the normal stint, after springing Wilmore and Williams free.",
      "\u201cSpaceflight is tough, but humans are tougher,\" McClain said minutes into the flight.",
      "As test pilots for Boeing\u2019s new Starliner capsule, Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched from Cape Canaveral on June 5. A series of helium leaks and thruster failures marred their trip to the space station, setting off months of investigation by NASA and Boeing on how best to proceed.",
      "Eventually ruling it unsafe, NASA ordered Starliner to fly back empty last September and moved Wilmore and Williams to a SpaceX flight due back in February. Their return was further delayed when SpaceX\u2019s brand new capsule needed extensive battery repairs before launching their replacements. To save a few weeks, SpaceX switched to a used capsule, moving up Wilmore and Williams\u2019 homecoming to mid-March.",
      "Already capturing the world\u2019s attention, their unexpectedly long mission took a political twist when President Donald Trump and SpaceX\u2019s Elon Musk vowed earlier this year to accelerate the astronauts\u2019 return and blamed the former administration for stalling it.",
      "Retired Navy captains who have lived at the space station before, Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly stressed that they support the decisions made by their NASA bosses since last summer. The two helped keep the station running \u2014 fixing a broken toilet, watering plants and conducting experiments \u2014 and even went out on a spacewalk together. With nine spacewalks, Williams set a new record for women: the most time spent spacewalking over a career.",
      "A last-minute hydraulics issue delayed Wednesday's initial launch attempt. Concern arose over one of the two clamp arms on the Falcon rocket\u2019s support structure that needs to tilt away right before liftoff. SpaceX later flushed out the arm's hydraulics system, removing trapped air.",
      "The duo's extended stay has been hardest, they said, on their families \u2014 Wilmore\u2019s wife and two daughters, and Williams\u2019 husband and mother. Besides reuniting with them, Wilmore, a church elder, is looking forward to getting back to face-to-face ministering and Williams can\u2019t wait to walk her two Labrador retrievers.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate all the love and support from everybody,\u201d Williams said in an interview earlier this week. \u201cThis mission has brought a little attention. There\u2019s goods and bads to that. But I think the good part is more and more people have been interested in what we\u2019re doing\u201d with space exploration.",

    "story": [
      "Florida\u2019s citrus growers are struggling to survive the one-two punch of hurricanes and disease",
      "LAKE WALES, Fla. -- As Trevor Murphy pulls up to his dad's 20-acre (8-hectare) grove in one of the fastest-growing counties in the United States, he points to the cookie-cutter, one-story homes encroaching on the orange trees from all sides.",
      "\u201cAt some point, this isn't going to be an orange grove anymore,\" Murphy, a third-generation grower, says as he gazes at the rows of trees in Lake Wales, Florida. \"You look around here, and it's all houses, and that's going to happen here.\u201d",
      "Polk County, which includes Lake Wales, contains more acres of citrus than any other county in Florida. And in 2023, more people moved to Polk County than any other county in the country.",
      "Hit in recent years by hurricanes and citrus greening disease, which slowly kills the trees, many growers are making the difficult decision to sell orange groves that have been in their families for generations to developers building homes to house the growing population.",
      "Others, like Murphy, are sticking it out, hoping to survive until a bug-free tree or other options arrive to repel the disease or treat the trees.",
      "When Hurricane Irma blasted through the state's orange belt in 2017, Florida's signature crop already had been on a downward spiral for two decades because of the greening disease. Next came a major freeze and two more hurricanes in 2022, followed by two hurricanes last year. A tree that loses branches and foliage in a hurricane can take three years to recover, Murphy said.",
      "Those catastrophes contributed to a 90% decline in orange production over the past two decades. Citrus groves in Florida, which covered more than 832,00 acres (336,698 hectares) at the turn of the century, populated scarcely 275,000 acres (111,288 hectares) last year, and California has eclipsed Florida as the nation's leading citrus producer.",
      "\u201cLosing the citrus industry is not an option. This industry is ... so ingrained in Florida. Citrus is synonymous with Florida,\u201d Matt Joyner, CEO of trade association Florida Citrus Mutual told Florida lawmakers recently.",
      "Nevertheless, Alico Inc., one of Florida\u2019s biggest growers, announced this year that it plans to wind down its citrus operations on more than 53,000 acres (21,000 hectares), saying its production has declined by almost three-quarters in a decade.",
      "That decision hurts processors, including Tropicana, which rely on Alico\u2019s fruit to produce orange juice and must now operate at reduced capacity. Orange juice consumption in the U.S. has been declining for the past two decades, despite a small bump during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "A prominent growers group, the Gulf Citrus Growers Association, closed its doors last year.",
      "Pressure on citrus farming is also growing from one of the state's other biggest industries: real estate.",
      "Florida expanded by more than 467,000 people last year to 23 million people, making it the third largest state in the nation. And more homes must be built to house that ever-growing population.",
      "Some prominent, multi-generational citrus families each have been putting hundreds of acres (hectares) of groves up for sale for millions of dollars, or as much as $25,000 an acre.",
      "Murphy owns several hundred acres (hectares) of groves and says he has no plans to abandon the industry, though last year he closed a citrus grove caretaking business that managed thousands of acres for other owners.",
      "However, he also has a real estate license, which is useful given the amount of land that is changing hands. He recently sold off acres in Polk County to a home developer, and has used that money to pay off debt and develop plans to replant thousands of trees in more productive groves.",
      "\u201cI would like to think that we\u2019re at the bottom, and we\u2019re starting to climb back up that hill,\u201d Murphy says.",
      "A whole ecosystem of businesses dependent on Florida citrus is at risk if the crops fail, including 33,000 fulltime and part-time jobs and an economic impact of $6.8 billion in Florida alone. Besides growers, there are juice processors, grove caretakers, fertilizer sellers, packing houses, nurseries and candy manufacturers, all hoping for a fix for citrus greening disease.",
      "Tom Davidson, whose parents founded Davidson of Dundee Citrus Candy and Jelly Factory in Lake Wales in 1966, says the drop in citrus production has impacted what flavor jellies the business is able to produce and the prices it charges to customers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really hoping that the scientists can get this figured out so we can we can get back to what we did,\u201d Davidson says.",
      "Researchers have been working for eight years on a genetically modified tree that can kill the tiny insects responsible for citrus greening. The process involves inserting a gene into a citrus tree that produces a protein that can kill baby Asian citrus psyllids by making holes in their guts, according to Lukasz Stelinski, an entomology professor at the University of Florida/Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences' Citrus Research and Education Center.",
      "It could be at least three years before bug-resistant trees can be planted, leaving Florida growers looking for help from other technologies. They include planting trees inside protective screens and covering young trees with white bags to keep out the bugs, injecting trees with an antibiotic, and finding trees that have become resistant to greening through natural mutation and distributing them to other groves.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like being a Lions fan before the Detroit Lions started to win games,\u201d Stelinski says. \u201cI'm hoping that we are making that turnaround.\u201d",

      "In response to a February court ruling that blocked some Biden-era programs, the Education Department has taken down online and paper applications for income-driven repayment plans.",
      "\u201cThis especially hurts anyone who\u2019s lost their jobs, including federal workers,\u201d said Natalia Abrams, founder and president of the Student Debt Crisis Center. \u201cA few months ago, they would have been able to get on a zero-dollar income-driven repayment plan.\u201d",
      "The removal of application materials also has caused confusion around the recertification process for borrowers already enrolled in repayment plans, experts say. Income-driven repayment plans take a borrower's finances and family size into account when calculating monthly payments, but borrowers must periodically demonstrate they still qualify.",
      "Adding to the uncertainty are layoffs at the Education Department, which oversees the federal loan system. The federal website for student loans and financial aid, StudentAid.gov, suffered an hours-long outage Wednesday, but the department has said it will continue to deliver on its commitments.",

      "Recertification confirms a borrower's financial situation. With some forms not currently available, borrowers who are unable to complete that process could be in jeopardy.",
      "If borrowers are already on an income-driven repayment plan, they should still be allowed to remain on that repayment plan if they are able to recertify their income.",
      "Abrams said it's also a good idea to take screenshots of your account's current status on the student aid website.",
      "State-specific and state-level resources are available for student borrowers. Congress members have teams charged with helping constituents if they are having trouble with a federal agency or struggling to contact a federal student loan servicer.",

      "Despite the thinning of the Education Department and President Donald Trump's dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, loan servicers still must consider a borrower\u2019s financial situation, Ba\u00f1ez said.",

      "\u201cIt's the most affordable option to repay my loans while living in Los Angeles working for the government on a government salary,\u201d said Fugate, 42. \u201cAnd it would mean my payments counted towards forgiveness.\u201d",
      "As of February, Fugate notified that her application was received and she had been notified of its status, but they didn't say when she would know if she was approved.",
      "\u201cAnd when I called recently, the machine said there was a four hour wait,\u201d she said.",
      "With income-driven repayment plans in limbo, Fugate isn't sure what her options are and hopes to one day have her federal loans behind her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been working for government for almost 10 years. After that much time, you don\u2019t do it for the glory,\u201d she said. \u201cI've spent most of my career giving back to other people. I don't mind serving people.

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, are potentially headed to a tough spot as it prepares to meet Tuesday and Wednesday",
      "WASHINGTON -- When Federal Reserve officials last met in late January, things looked pretty good: Hiring was solid. The economy had just grown at a solid pace in last year's final quarter. And inflation, while stubborn, had fallen sharply from its peak more than two years ago.",
      "What a difference seven weeks makes.",
      "As the Fed prepares to meet Tuesday and Wednesday, the central bank and its chair, Jerome Powell, are potentially headed to a much tougher spot. Inflation improved last month but is still high and tariffs could push it higher. At the same time, ongoing tariff threats as well as sharp cuts to government spending and jobs have tanked consumer and business confidence, which could weigh on the economy and even push up unemployment.",
      "The toxic combination of still-high inflation and a weak or stagnant economy is often referred to as \u201cstagflation,\u201d a term that haunts central bankers. It is what bedeviled the United States in the 1970s, when even deep recessions didn't kill inflation.",
      "Stagflation, should it emerge, is hard for the Fed because typically policymakers would lift rates \u2014 or keep them high \u2014 to combat inflation. Yet if unemployment also rises, the Fed would usually cut rates to reduce borrowing costs and lift growth.",
      "It's not yet clear the economy will sink into stagflation. For now, like businesses and consumers, the Fed is grappling with a huge amount of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. But even a mild version \u2014 with the unemployment rising from its current low level of 4.1%, while inflation stayed stuck above the Fed's 2% target \u2014 would pose a challenge for the central bank.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the tangled web they\u2019re in,\u201d said Esther George, former president of the Federal Reserve's Kansas City branch. \"You have inflation stickiness on the one hand. At the same time, you\u2019re trying to look at what impact could this have on the job market, if growth begins to pull back. So it is a tough scenario for them for sure.\"",
      "Fed officials will almost certainly keep their key rate unchanged at their meeting this week. Once the meeting concludes Wednesday, they will release their latest quarterly economic projections, which will likely show they expect to cut their rate twice this year \u2014 the same as they projected in December.",
      "The Fed implemented three cuts last year and then signaled at the January meeting that they were largely on pause until the economic outlook becomes clearer.",
      "Wall Street investors expect three rate reductions this year, in June, September, and December, according to futures prices tracked by CME Fedwatch, in part because they worry an economic slowdown will force more reductions.",
      "One development likely to unnerve Fed officials is the sharp jump in inflation expectations this month in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey. It showed the biggest increase in long-term inflation expectations since 1993.",
      "Such expectations \u2014 which basically measure whether Americans are worried inflation will get worse \u2014 are important because they can become self-fulfilling. If businesses and consumers expect higher costs, they may take steps that push up inflation, like demanding higher wages, which in turn can force companies to raise prices to offset higher labor costs.",
      "Some economists caution that the University of Michigan's survey is preliminary and for now based on only about 400 responses. (The final version to be released later this month typically includes about 800.) And financial market measures of inflation expectations, based on bond prices, have actually declined in recent weeks.",
      "The most recent inflation readings have been mixed. The consumer price index dropped last week for the first time in five months to 2.8% from 3%, an encouraging change. But the Fed's preferred price gauge, to be released later this month, is likely to be unchanged.",
      "The jump in inflation expectations is also a problem for the Fed because officials, including Powell, have said they are willing to let inflation gradually return to their 2% target in 2027, because expectations have generally been low. If other measures show inflation worries rising, the Fed could come under more pressure to get inflation down more quickly.",
      "\u201cI do worry when I see consumer expectations moving in the opposite direction,\u201d George said. \u201cI think you just have to keep an eye on that.\u201d",
      "The last time President Donald Trump imposed tariffs \u2014 in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 overall inflation didn't rise by much, in part because they weren't nearly as broad as what he is currently proposing and some duties, such as those on steel and aluminum, were watered down with loopholes. Now that Americans have lived through a painful inflationary episode, they are likely to be more skittish about rising prices.",
      "Powell referred such concerns in remarks earlier this month. He said tariffs could just have a one-time impact on prices without causing ongoing inflation. But that could change \u201cif it turns into a series\u201d of tariff hikes, he said March 7, or \u201cif the increases are larger, that would matter.\"",
      "\u201cWhat really does matter is what is happening with long-term inflation expectations,\u201d Powell added.",
      "A week after his comments, those expectations shot higher in the University of Michigan survey.",

      "Indian telecom operator Bharti Airtel says it has signed a deal with Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink to explore providing the U.S. satellite internet giant\u2019s services to customers in India, depending on government approval",
      "NEW DELHI -- Indian telecom operator Bharti Airtel said Tuesday it has signed a deal with Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink to explore providing the U.S. satellite internet giant\u2019s services to customers in India, depending on government approval.",
      "Musk has long wanted Starlink to enter the world\u2019s most populous market, but its entry into India has been delayed due to regulatory challenges, security concerns and opposition from domestic telecom giants like billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Jio.",
      "Airtel \u2014 India\u2019s second largest telecom operator \u2014 said in a statement that its deal with Starlink depends on whether the subsidiary of U.S. aerospace company SpaceX can receive government approval to begin operating in India.",
      "At least 40% of India\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people still don\u2019t have access to the internet and cheap satellite broadband is needed to bridge this gap, particularly in India\u2019s vast remote and mountainous areas.",
      "Musk\u2019s Starlink has at least 6,900 active satellites orbiting Earth that provide low-latency broadband, including to areas where internet previously has been completely unavailable.",
      "Last November, India\u2019s telecoms minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, said Starlink had yet to comply with security norms, and that a license for satellite communications services would be issued only after the company meets all the requirements.",
      "The announcement about the Airtel partnership comes weeks after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Musk in Washington where they discussed issues including space, mobility, technology and innovation.",
      "The deal will \u201cexplore how Starlink can complement and expand Airtel\u2019s offerings, and how Airtel\u2019s expertise in the Indian market complements SpaceX\u2019s direct offerings to consumers and businesses,\u201d the company's statement said.",
      "As part of the agreement, the two companies will explore offering Starlink equipment at Airtel\u2019s vast retail store network, Starlink services through Airtel to business customers, and using each other\u2019s network infrastructure to enhance coverage across India.",
      "The statement did not provide further details."

      "A recurring theme throughout the weeklong meeting of the nearly 3,000-member National People\u2019s Congress was the need to boost investment and consumer spending.",
      "How much will be done to translate words into action will only become clear in the months ahead as the ruling Communist Party juggles priorities. What is clear is that a burgeoning trade war with the United States has left the outlook for the coming months uncertain.",
      "The meeting ended in the absence of top political leader Zhao Leji, the chairman of the Standing Committee of the Congress. Zhao, who was supposed to host the closing session, had a respiratory tract infection, said Vice Chairman Li Hongzhong, who chaired the meeting in his place.",
      "The rubber-stamp parliament voted overwhelmingly to approve an annual government work report, with 2,882 votes for, one vote against and one abstention. Similar near-unanimous votes were recorded to pass the budget and an amendment to a law on deputies to the Congress, among other items.",
      "At stake is the health of the world's second largest economy, a major exporter of products to countries around the world and an important market for foreign companies from Apple to Volkswagen. A prolonged property crisis has sapped consumer and business confidence, depriving the economy of its past vitality. Now, a tariff war unleashed by U.S. President Donald Trump is compounding those problems.",
      "The Congress opened with the announcement of an economic growth target of \"about 5%\u201d for this year, a level that analysts said would be difficult to achieve with the measures detailed during this year's Congress.",
      "They include borrowing more money for a slew of initiatives, such as giving 300 billion yuan ($41.3 billion) in rebates to consumers who trade-in old cars and appliances for new ones. But much of the borrowing will go to supporting the housing market and local governments weighed down by debt.",
      "\u201cIt is unclear how much of a jolt this budget will provide to underlying domestic demand and reflation efforts, despite the sizeable rise in the deficit,\u201d Jeremy Zook, the lead China analyst for Fitch Ratings, said in a report.",

      "Private companies will also gain access to a higher share of loans than before, and financing for private businesses raised through bond issuance will be expanded, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said in the work report.",
      "Much rides on how far Trump pursues his trade wars with China and other countries.",
      "China has diversified its export markets in recent years, but the U.S. remains a vital trading partner. The greater fear is not the tariffs themselves but the health of the U.S. economy and demand for Chinese products, said Alicia Garcia Herrero, the chief Asia-Pacific economist for Natixis investment bank.",
      "Trump has raised tariffs on imports from China twice since taking office in January. China has shown no sign of backing down.",
      "\u201cIf the American side goes further down this wrong path, we will fight to the end,\u201d Commerce Minister Wang Wentao told journalists during the Congress.",
      "Asked about Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy, China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the law of the jungle would reign if all countries adopted a \u201cmy country first\u201d approach.",

      "KANSAS CITY, Kan. -- Dejan Joveljic scored in the 80th minute and Sporting Kansas City stormed back from a three-goal deficit to earn a 3-3 draw with Minnesota United on Saturday night, snapping a 10-match losing streak across all competitions dating to last season.",
      "Joveljic, who was acquired from the defending-champion Los Angeles Galaxy in the offseason, scored unassisted to help the club end the second longest skid in league history. Only FC Cincinnati's 14-match slide spanning the 2021-22 seasons was longer.",
      "Minnesota United (2-1-1) got a goal from Hassani Dotson in the 15th minute and another one from Tani Oluwaseyi in the 31st to take a 2-0 lead into halftime. Defender Morris Duggan had his first career assist \u2014 in his sixth appearance and fourth start \u2014 on Dotson's first goal this season. Bongokuhle Hlongwane notched his first assist this season on Oluwaseyi's first goal of the campaign after scoring eight last season.",
      "Oluwaseyi finished off his first career brace in the first minute of the second half for a 3-0 advantage. Joaqu\u00edn Pereyra earned his first assist of the season and the second of his career in 10 starts and 11 appearances over two seasons.",
      "Sporting KC got on the scoreboard in the 68th minute when D\u00e1niel Sall\u00f3i took a pass from defender Tim Leibold and scored. It was the first goal this season for Sall\u00f3i and the first assist for Leibold.",
      "Things got interesting in the 72nd minute thanks to an own goal by Duggan that made it 3-2.",
      "John Pulskamp totaled three saves for Sporting KC, which leads the all-time series 12-9-5.",
      "Dayne St. Clair had one save for Minnesota United.",
      "Minnesota United has a win and a tie in its last two trips to Children's Mercy Park after an 0-9-0 start.",
      "Sporting KC will host Los Angeles FC on Saturday. Minnesota United hosts the Los Angeles Galaxy on Saturday.",

      "Hamilton started eighth, and spent the first third of it behind the rear wing of Williams\u2019 Alex Albon. But, while the seven-time world champion hit the lead on lap 46 after those ahead pitted for fresh intermediate tires, Hamilton angrily stated over team radio that \u201cwe missed a big opportunity\u201d after subsequent traffic and a late stop dropped him back to ninth.",
      "Dropping a further place to tenth after Oscar Piastri overtook the Brit in the final lap did little to lighten Hamilton's mood.",
      "\u201cThe rain always mixes things up and strategy comes down to timing and a bit of luck,\u201d the 40-year-old said. \u201cWe took a gamble and made up places, but then boxing too late for Inters (intermediate tires) cost us, dropping us to the back of the top 10 with too much ground to recover.\u201d",
      "Hamilton also had trouble keeping his Ferrari in a straight line, showing just how much the Prancing Horse has to do to claw back its pace.",
      "\u201cI struggled with the balance, but it was an important race for learning more about the car and in different weather conditions, as well as gaining more experience working with a new team,\u201d Hamilton said.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- They have run through heartache and grief, battling illnesses and injuries as their bodies have aged. Some are now using wheelchairs, including the oldest who is 87.",
      "Despite it all, the Los Angeles Marathon's Legacy Runners have stuck to their mission: finish the race.",
      "On Sunday, the group of 92 marathoners, including 10 women, marked their 40th LA Marathon, participating in the 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer) race every year since the city's iconic event began in 1986.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re legacy runners, we just don\u2019t know when to quit,\u201d 77-year-old Lou Briones said.",
      "Briones even has finished the race on crutches after surgery. Since getting both knees replaced, he walks the race.",
      "\u201cYou gotta do it,\u201d Briones said. \u201cNo matter what the conditions are, you gotta be there at the starting line on race day.\u201d",
      "When Briones and others gathered at the starting line for the first LA marathon, President Ronald Reagan had just been reelected and few weeks prior the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded, shocking the country. Tom Bradley was serving as the first Black mayor of Los Angeles and the city was grappling with the spread of HIV/AIDS.",
      "Los Angeles was inspired to start its own marathon after the success of hosting the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, much like the beginning of the Boston Marathon in 1897 after the first marathon competition was held in the 1896 Summer Olympics. Los Angeles is now preparing to host its next Olympics in 2028.",
      "Five years after the LA Marathon started, event organizers began recognizing runners who had completed every race with a plaque. They continued to hold celebrations for the dedicated runners every five years.",
      "Around the 15th year, Briones decided he wanted to formalize the group. He and a friend printed out stickers with an email address and brought them to the marathon in 2002.",
      "\u201cWe went to the race and we just started yelling out,\u201d Briones said. \u201cWe\u2019d stick it right on their bib, and then after the race, most of them immediately sent an email. That was the beginning.\u201d",
      "Some Legacy Runners said they were inspired by U.S. runner Joan Benoit, who won the first Olympic women\u2019s marathon at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.",
      "May DuBois, 80, remembers watching the race on TV and seeing Benoit finish far ahead of the rest of the pack of runners. A classical pianist, she had never run in her life.",
      "Two years later, DuBois ran the same path as Benoit \u2014 starting and ending at the Memorial Coliseum \u2014 since back then, the LA Marathon route was the same as the Olympics. She said it felt just \u201clike running in the Olympics with everybody cheering us on.\u201d",
      "Now, she can\u2019t imagine going a day without running 3 to 5 miles (4.8 to 8 km).",
      "\u201cI\u2019m healthy, I look good, and I don\u2019t get tired. I never get sick, I don\u2019t even catch colds,\u201d said DuBois, who hosts a brunch to celebrate after each marathon.",
      "Each year, Legacy Runners are given the same bib number. They start meeting monthly for training about six months before the marathon.",
      "Cliff Housego, 76, started running after his father died at 48 from a heart attack. He decided he wanted to live long enough to see his grandchildren and even great-grandchildren.",
      "Over the years, Housego has gone through two divorces and lost his daughter. Through it all, the marathon has been a constant in his life.",
      "\u201cMany, many things could\u2019ve stopped me from being there,\u201d Housego said.",
      "At 83, Sharon Kerson realizes that, too.",
      "After a year of dealing with sickness and vertigo, Kerson completed her training last week at the West Los Angeles College track, the same place she first started running more than 40 years ago. She has run more than 600 marathons.",
      "She wore a rain jacket from the St. George Marathon in Utah, shorts from the San Francisco Marathon and a T-shirt from the 30th LA Marathon.",
      "\u201cI never was fast and I\u2019m not competitive at all,\u201d Kerson said, adding that her only goal each time is to finish.",
      "Rick Bingham began racing in a wheelchair a decade ago after injuring his Achilles tendon during a triathlon. At 87, he swims half a mile (0.8 kilometer) every other day and lifts weights. To train, he went 5 miles (8 kilometers) one day around his ranch in a wheelchair.",
      "Bingham has no plans to slow down. He wants to reach his 50th LA Marathon.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll only be 97 when I do that,\u201d he said.",
      "Bingham's commitment to remaining in the race has inspired Luis Gallardo to continue.",
      "Gallardo, 71, was planning to quit after his 38th marathon, when his knees gave out. But he began training again when Bingham offered him his extra racing wheelchair.",
      "\u201cWe went through too many things over the years, too many hardships,\u201d Gallardo said. \u201cTo do it with him is just a blessing.\u201d",
      "Gallardo\u2019s goal is now to reach the 50th LA marathon with Bingham.",
      "After that, he said, he will find a way to finish the race with his friend, even carrying him across the finish line if he has to."

      "The senior guard got off to a slow start, scoring just two points in the first half and missing all four 3-point attempts as Yale took a 37-32 advantage into intermission.

      "A transformation of women\u2019s soccer in Europe is well under way",
      "UMEA, Sweden -- Sprinkled around its small, shared office are trophies and mementos signifying the not-so-distant glory days of Swedish women\u2019s soccer team Ume\u00e5 IK.",
      "On one wall is the No. 60 jersey worn by its greatest ever player, Brazil superstar Marta. Across the corridor is a bookcase crammed with European and Swedish silverware and medals. Gathering dust in the corner of a room nearby is a trophy for the 2003 UEFA Women\u2019s Cup, the precursor to the Champions League.",
      "Indeed, it\u2019s only 21 years ago that the team from this small northern city virtually unknown outside Sweden was a back-to-back European champion.",
      "Now Ume\u00e5 is adjusting to its new status in women\u2019s soccer \u2014 languishing in Sweden\u2019s second division, playing before average attendances of around 400 spectators, and battling debts.",
      "A transformation of the women\u2019s game in Europe is well under way. As attendance figures and TV ratings rise, big-money clubs already well established in men\u2019s soccer \u2013 think Barcelona, Real Madrid, Chelsea \u2013 are taking over the show.",
      "Ume\u00e5 is among the unfashionable clubs of yesteryear who know they can no longer compete.",
      "\u201cNot to be harsh or anything, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible anymore,\u201d Ume\u00e5 coach Edvin Erfanian said about the club\u2019s chances of returning to the top of the European game. \u201cBut I don\u2019t necessarily see it as a bad thing. The product of women\u2019s football is a whole lot better than it was 20 years ago.\u201d",
      "The changing face of women\u2019s European soccer is best illustrated by comparing the lineup of the Champions League quarterfinals taking place this week to that of 20 years ago.",
      "On Tuesday, it\u2019s Real Madrid vs. Arsenal and Bayern Munich vs. Lyon. On Wednesday, it\u2019s Wolfsburg vs. Barcelona and Manchester City vs. Chelsea.",
      "Rewind to the 2004-05 season and the quarterfinalists included Bobruichanka Bobruisk (Belarus), Energy Voronezh (Russia), Trondheims-\u00d8rn (Norway), Turbine Potsdam (Germany), Torres (Italy), as well as Djurg\u00e5rden/\u00c4lvsj\u00f6 and defending champion Ume\u00e5 from Sweden.",
      "Arsenal, a rare example of a top men\u2019s club that also had a strong women\u2019s team in those days, is the only quarterfinalist from 20 years ago that remains competitive in the Women\u2019s Champions League today.",
      "The contrast in resources is considerable.",
      "Barcelona, the reigning European champion, generated 17.9 million euros ($19.5 million) in revenue in 2023-24, according to analysis from accountancy firm Deloitte. J\u00f6rgen Crovin, Ume\u00e5\u2019s sporting manager, estimates that Ume\u00e5\u2019s revenue last year was about $800,000.",
      "Ume\u00e5 IK is a club located around 400 kilometers (250 miles) from the Arctic Circle \u2014 the winters here are long and cold \u2014 and in a quiet university town populated by 130,000. The team has been surviving year-to-year, even week-to-week as recently as last November when a last-gasp crowdfunding campaign and donations from wealthy locals raised enough cash to keep the team afloat.",
      "Expectations and targets have been realigned. Being European champion again is a pipe dream for a squad containing many students and only three full-time professionals. Crovin joined in 2022 and says the players brought in during his time have all been free transfers. Chelsea, meanwhile, just made U.S. defender Naomi Girma the world's first million-dollar female player.",
      "Instead, returning to Sweden's top division and consolidating with a strong youth system and robust finances, while serving as a pipeline for the best players in the north of the country, is the best Ume\u00e5's soccer leadership can realistically hope for these days.",
      "\u201cWe just need to find our own way,\u201d Erfanian, a 28-year-old coach, told the AP. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the finances and, in the end, that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. ... For us, what we need to do is put our resources in the academy and create a good environment for young girls in the north part of Sweden.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s very different to the early years of this century when women\u2019s soccer wasn\u2019t such big business and Ume\u00e5 was a benchmark in the European game.",
      "In lore in these parts is the cold, gray day in February 2004 when an 18-year-old Marta, reportedly wearing flip-flops, arrived in Ume\u00e5 from Belo Horizonte with her cousin, Marina, and threw a snowball for the first time in her life. Within months, Marta was scoring in both legs of the Champions League final against FFC Frankfurt as Ume\u00e5 retained the title before losing the 2007 and \u201908 finals \u2014 by which time she was the Ballon d\u2019Or winner.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much a different world up there \u2014 really small place, really cold \u2014 and she adapted,\u201d Johanna Frisk, a teammate of Marta\u2019s at Ume\u00e5 and now a pundit for Swedish broadcaster Viaplay, told the AP. \u201cHer skills were on another level. She could do pretty much anything.\u201d",
      "Ume\u00e5 was a \u201cwinning machine,\u201d Frisk said. For Crovin, the club \u201craised the bar\u201d in terms of how much they trained and the ambition they had in using their money, pumped into the club from local and national businesses, to buy foreign players.",
      "\u201cUme\u00e5 was ahead of its time,\u201d Crovin said in an interview in a cluttered office the club now shares with the city\u2019s indoor floor hockey team.",
      "Sponsors started to leave and debts started to build for Ume\u00e5. Marta left after the 2008 season and the team hasn\u2019t won a major title since.",
      "Around that time, Europe\u2019s powerhouse clubs started taking women\u2019s soccer seriously. Paris Saint-Germain won its first major women's title in 2010 and soon was fueled by cash from the men\u2019s team\u2019s Qatari ownership. Barcelona won its first Spanish women's league title in 2011. Bayern Munich, which wasn\u2019t in Germany\u2019s top women's league during much of the 1990s, started winning cups and leagues in the 2010s. Manchester United\u2019s women's team was reformed in 2018, having been disbanded in 2005. Real Madrid\u2019s women\u2019s team was founded in 2020.",
      "With resources, infrastructure and a brand name behind them, the big-name women\u2019s teams are flourishing. Even in Sweden, Malm\u00f6 \u2014 the biggest men's club \u2014 relaunched a women's team in 2019 that just got promoted to the top division.",
      "According to a Deloitte report, the 15 top revenue-generating women\u2019s clubs whose financial results were available for analysis brought in more than 100 million euros (dollars) combined for the first time during the 2023-24 season, a year-on-year growth of 35%.",
      "\u201cInvesting in women\u2019s football is proving to be a good business decision, benefitting both brand recognition and the business models of football clubs,\u201d Jennifer Haskel, knowledge and insight lead in Deloitte's sports business group, said.",
      "It seems the best way to be a strong, financially sound women's team is to be linked to a successful men's club \u2014 or have an owner with deep pockets.",
      "Crovin says there are no immediate plans for Ume\u00e5 to be affiliated with the city's men's team, which also plays in the second tier in Sweden and doesn't have so strong a brand.",
      "Similarly in Germany, Turbine Potsdam \u2014 the Champions League winner in 2005 and \u201810 based outside Berlin \u2014 has slumped as hard as old rival Ume\u00e5 amid the changing financial landscape. It's also an independent women\u2019s team, with a recent co-operation with the Hertha Berlin men\u2019s team lasting only three years.",
      "Demoted in 2023 after 26 years in Germany's top division and now battling to avoid a return to the second tier after promotion last year, Turbine has struggled to bring through enough talented young players in recent years to get close to competing with powers like Bayern and Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "\u201cWe need money,\u201d Turbine president Karsten Ritter-Lang told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really difficult to find sponsors ... I\u2019m absolutely sure if we have enough money and we develop our sports school system, then it will be possible to be successful as an isolated women\u2019s football club.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "It is time: Millions of Americans are going through the annual March rite of filling out an NCAA Tournament bracket (or two or three)",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- When Bryce Yoder needs a study break this time of year, the college student flips on a TV and attends his favorite March Madness class \u2014 bracket science.",
      "The 19-year-old sports management major at Indiana University-Indianapolis studies hard to learn the secrets of picking winners in the nearly dozen NCAA Tournament bracket pools he hopes to enter before Thursday's first-round games. It takes time, patience and some lucky bounces to get those picks right.",
      "Yoder is hardly alone. Millions of Americans \u2014 from hard-core sports junkies to casual fans and school alumni to those with no rooting interest \u2014 engage in this annual national pastime by filling out a tourney bracket and seeing how they fare. Winning is possible, though few hold out much hope of a perfect bracket: The NCAA says the odds of that are 1 in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 if you wing it and a still-absurd 1 in 120.2 billion if you know a bit about hoops.",
      "For players like Yoder, it\u2019s more about proving he\u2019s the best.",
      "\u201cThe satisfaction of being right,\u201d he said in explaining why he fills out so many brackets. \u201cReally, it\u2019s about having the best bracket possible, whether that\u2019s with my friends and family or just the leaderboard over a random bunch of people that I\u2019ve never met. I\u2019m just so competitive.\u201d",
      "From online gambling to office pools to family contests, brackets are big business and a big distraction. A study released in 2023 by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a work outplacement firm, estimated $17.3 billion is lost in productivity during the three-week tourney. A Finance Buzz survey back then also found 36% of employees tune into the games during work hours, and nearly 25% use paid time off or sick days.",
      "Even elective surgery companies now advertise that customers can have mid-March procedures so they can recover \u2014 and watch basketball \u2014 at the same time.",
      "It seems almost unfathomable today, but brackets meant virtually nothing for about the first 50 years of the NCAA tourney, which dates to 1939 and this year is holding its 86th edition.",
      "During the '70s, though, the changes began in earnest.",
      "The NCAA tourney expanded from 25 to 32 teams in 1975, the first year leagues could send two teams. Seeding started in 1978, and the field grew to 40 in 1979 and to 48 in 1980 when organizers dropped the restriction on how many league teams could play.",
      "But the real revolution really with the 1979 title game between Michigan State and Indiana State. That Magic Johnson-Larry Bird matchup drew a 24.1 television rating, still the tourney record, and it gave everyone a glimpse into what college basketball's biggest event could become at the same time an 8-year-old boy named Charlie Creme looked into his future.",
      "\u201cI cut the (men's) bracket out of the newspaper in 1979 and had it on the pantry door in my family's kitchen,\" said Creme, now ESPN's women's basketball bracketologist. \u201cI was filling it out, making actual predictions and I couldn't wait till a game ended and I could run up to the pantry door and advance the next team in the tournament. Within a couple years, I was making my own brackets with big pieces of oak tag (paper) and a pencil and a ruler.\u201d",
      "Soon, he'd have company as the tourney grew.",
      "America's first all-sports network, ESPN, broadcast the 16 first-round games, 12 on tape delay, in 1980. CBS wrested the broadcast rights away from NBC in 1982 with a three-year deal for $16 million annually and the promise of expanded coverage including the first televised selection show.",
      "Suddenly, brackets mattered and broadcasters such as Dick Vitale stoked long debates over which teams belonged, which did not and who would win games. Live, daily telecasts on ESPN spurred interest, too, heading into 1985, the first 64-team field and introduced a future NCAA executive to fill out the bracket.",
      "\u201cThe first one I remember filling out was 1985,\u201d said Dan Gavitt, the son of Big East co-founder Dave Gavitt and now the NCAA senior vice president for basketball. \u201cI had four Big East teams in the Final Four and I was right on three of them. Boston College got beat by Memphis in in the regional finals.\u201d",
      "Gavitt, like Creme, was hooked and brackets became fashionable.",
      "Could it happen again on the women's side? Perhaps.",
      "After seeing ticket sales, television ratings and coverage of the sport soar in the last few years with more to come thanks to stars such as Paige Bueckers, Hannah Hidalgo and JuJu Watkins, Creme thinks women's brackets are on a similar trajectory.",
      "\u201cWe might be seeing 1985-95,\u201d Creme said. \u201cStar players in the men's game back then, stuck around longer. Right now we're in that period where Caitlin Clark played four years in college and as the rules stand now, JuJu Watkins has to play four years and Paige could if she wanted \u2014 she's not going to \u2014 but could stick around another year. That's where the men's game was in that period.\u201d",
      "In its infancy, the bracket phenomenon was geared to teenagers and college students like Yoder who watched multiple games.",
      "Soon, office pools and games among family members with entry fees and prize money became popular, too. In some cases, all you did was pluck a name out of a hat.",
      "Back then, the NCAA frowned on such practices, labeling it gambling. Today, the NCAA runs its own online bracket game as part of its \u201cfan engagement.\u201d",
      "Still, the prize pool only fueled interest. So did the 1980s national championship games that became must-see TV \u2014 and the upset factor.",
      "From surprising title runs by North Carolina State in 1983 and Villanova in 1985 to Princeton's near-upset of Georgetown in 1989, it seemed every team was in the mix and nobody would pick all the winners.",
      "\u201cThere will never be a perfect bracket,\u201d ESPN men's basketball bracketologist Joe Lunardi said. \u201cThat's just not going to happen. When Warren Buffet offered $10 million for perfect bracket, he knew he wasn't going to pay that out.\"",
      "Those daunting odds haven't stopped anyone from filling out brackets.",
      "\u201cIf I feel really strongly about a game, I'll probably pick the same outcome more times than not,\u201d Yoder said, referring to how he handles multiple brackets. \u201cBut I try to throw some silly type of stuff that wouldn't necessarily have a good chance of happening, like upsets, because that's just naturally going to happen.\u201d",
      "Figuring out how to pick teams and games has evolved the years.",
      "Selection committee members use tangible measures such as wins and losses, strength of schedule and NET rankings to round out the 68-team field. Other measures include quad victories, which vary in how they're compiled and applied. In an era of analytics, sites such as kenpom.com have become regular components for hard-core and casual fans.",
      "The NCAA certainly is paying attention.",
      "Gavitt said he filled out brackets in the early years of the NET just to see how reliable the rankings were to results And when the topic of expansion is broached, NCAA officials look to see how the potential new bracket would fit on a single printed page.",
      "The question, of course, is how far can this go and whether artificial intelligence can become the next big thing when it comes to picking winners.",
      "\u201cIf AI did it, then the analysis would not be as much fun or as interesting,\u201d Creme said. \"I don't know that the NCAA would ever go that far. I kind of hope not because I like the human element. If it's eliminated, if we know the AI formula, then it's sort of over.\"",

      "No matter how much you know about college basketball \u2014 if you\u2019re looking to follow the fun, make your own bracket, or even just understand what all the fuss is about \u2014 here are some key things to know.",
      "It's the basketball world's term to reference the upsets, chaos, remarkable plays and historic moments that are sure to happen in postseason tournaments.",
      "It all starts with teams playing a tournament against the other schools in their conference, which is the division that a school competes in during the regular season. One slip up there and a team could find itself \u201con the bubble,\u201d or at risk of missing the ensuing NCAA Tournament.",

      "The bracket formation process takes place the Sunday before the tournament begins, known as Selection Sunday.",
      "The term \u201cMarch Madness\u201d was first used by Henry V. Porter, a high school official in Illinois, in 1939. But the term wasn't officially used in reference to college basketball until 1982, when CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger used it during that year\u2019s coverage.",

      "Every year, millions of people fill out their own brackets in hopes of correctly guessing who will win each round. It\u2019s a nationwide phenomenon that takes over offices, families and friend groups, with spectators and sports bettors competing to see who will have the most accurate bracket.",
      "A huge reason why March Madness is so popular is its unpredictability. Lower-seeded teams regularly beat the higher-seeded ones, throwing brackets and predictions completely out of the window.",
      "Thirty-one of the 68 teams automatically qualify to play in the NCAA Tournament because they won their respective conference tournaments. The remaining 37 teams are chosen by that 12-person committee mentioned earlier.",

      "In 2011, when the tournament expanded from 64 to 68 teams, it also introduced the First Four round. That pits the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams against each other. The winners enter the traditional bracket.",
      "Well, you\u2019d be the first.",

Think about how well your mission's going and if you're lucky, you might get to stay longer,\u201d NASA's space operations mission chief and former astronaut Ken Bowersox said last week.",
      "Wilmore and Williams found themselves in the middle of a political storm when President Donald Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk announced at the end of January they would accelerate the astronauts' return and blamed the Biden Administration on keeping them up there too long.",
      "NASA officials stood by their decision to wait for the next scheduled SpaceX flight to bring them home, targeting a February return. But their replacements got held up back on Earth because of battery work on their brand new SpaceX capsule.",

      "Iguanas may have pulled off a 5000 mile voyage on a raft of floating vegetation to get to Fiji",
      "NEW YORK -- Researchers have long wondered how iguanas got to Fiji, a collection of remote islands in the South Pacific. Most modern-day iguanas live in the Americas \u2014 thousands of miles and one giant ocean away.",
      "They thought maybe they scurried there through Asia or Australia before volcanic activity pushed Fiji so far away.",
      "But new research suggests that millions of years ago, iguanas pulled off the 5,000 mile (8,000 kilometer) odyssey on a raft of floating vegetation \u2014 masses of uprooted trees and small plants. That journey is thought to be a record \u2014 further than any other land-dwelling vertebrate has ever traveled on the ocean.",
      "Scientists think that's how iguanas got to the Galapagos Islands off of Ecuador and between islands in the Caribbean. Initially they thought Fiji might be a bit too far for such a trip, but in a new study, researchers inspected the genes of 14 iguana species spanning the Americas, the Caribbean and Fiji. They discovered that Fijian iguanas were most closely related to desert iguanas from North America, and that the two groups split off around 31 million years ago.",
      "The researchers created a statistical model using that information and other tidbits about where iguanas live today and how they may spread. It suggested that the iguanas most likely floated to Fiji from North America.",
      "\u201cGiven what we know now, their result is by far the most strongly supported,\u201d said Kevin de Queiroz, an evolutionary biologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, who was not involved with the new study.",
      "The research was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
      "The journey from North America to Fiji could have taken a few months, but these desert iguanas would have been ideal passengers because they were adept at resisting dehydration and could have snacked on the plants underfoot.",
      "\u201cIf you had to pick a vertebrate to survive a long trip on a raft across an ocean, iguanas would be the one,\u201d said study author Simon Scarpetta from the University of San Francisco, in an email.",
      "Many Fijian iguana species are endangered, and an invasive green iguana roams the islands today, said study author Robert Fisher of the United States Geological Survey. Figuring out where these creatures came from can equip scientists with the tools to better protect them in the future.",

      "With her calm, warm demeanor, Ana has been trained to put patients at ease \u2014 like many nurses across the U.S. But unlike them, she is also available to chat 24-7, in multiple languages, from Hindi to Haitian Creole.",
      "That\u2019s because Ana isn\u2019t human, but an artificial intelligence program created by Hippocratic AI, one of a number of new companies offering ways to automate time-consuming tasks usually performed by nurses and medical assistants.",
      "It\u2019s the most visible sign of AI\u2019s inroads into health care, where hundreds of hospitals are using increasingly sophisticated computer programs to monitor patients' vital signs, flag emergency situations and trigger step-by-step action plans for care \u2014 jobs that were all previously handled by nurses and other health professionals.",
      "Hospitals say AI is helping their nurses work more efficiently while addressing burnout and understaffing. But nursing unions argue that this poorly understood technology is overriding nurses' expertise and degrading the quality of care patients receive.",
      "\u201cHospitals have been waiting for the moment when they have something that appears to have enough legitimacy to replace nurses,\u201d said Michelle Mahon of National Nurses United. \u201cThe entire ecosystem is designed to automate, de-skill and ultimately replace caregivers.\u201d",
      "Mahon\u2019s group, the largest nursing union in the U.S., has helped organize more than 20 demonstrations at hospitals across the country, pushing for the right to have say in how AI can be used \u2014 and protection from discipline if they decide to disregard automated advice. The group raised new alarms in January when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the incoming health secretary, suggested AI nurses \u201cas good as any doctor\u201d could help deliver care in rural areas. On Friday, Dr. Mehmet Oz, who\u2019s been nominated to oversee Medicare and Medicaid, said he believes AI can \u201cliberate doctors and nurses from all the paperwork.\u201d",
      "Hippocratic AI initially promoted a rate of $9 an hour for its AI assistants, compared with about $40 an hour for a registered nurse. It has since dropped that language, instead touting its services and seeking to assure customers that they have been carefully tested. The company did not grant requests for an interview.",
      "Hospitals have been experimenting for years with technology designed to improve care and streamline costs, including sensors, microphones and motion-sensing cameras. Now that data is being linked with electronic medical records and analyzed in an effort to predict medical problems and direct nurses' care \u2014 sometimes before they've evaluated the patient themselves.",
      "Adam Hart was working in the emergency room at Dignity Health in Henderson, Nevada, when the hospital's computer system flagged a newly arrived patient for sepsis, a life-threatening reaction to infection. Under the hospital's protocol, he was supposed to immediately administer a large dose of IV fluids. But after further examination, Hart determined that he was treating a dialysis patient, or someone with kidney failure. Such patients have to be carefully managed to avoid overloading their kidneys with fluid.",
      "Hart raised his concern with the supervising nurse but was told to just follow the standard protocol. Only after a nearby physician intervened did the patient instead begin to receive a slow infusion of IV fluids.",
      "\u201cYou need to keep your thinking cap on\u2014 that\u2019s why you\u2019re being paid as a nurse,\u201d Hart said. \u201cTurning over our thought processes to these devices is reckless and dangerous.\u201d",
      "Hart and other nurses say they understand the goal of AI: to make it easier for nurses to monitor multiple patients and quickly respond to problems. But the reality is often a barrage of false alarms, sometimes erroneously flagging basic bodily functions \u2014 such as a patient having a bowel movement \u2014 as an emergency.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re trying to focus on your work but then you\u2019re getting all these distracting alerts that may or may not mean something,\u201d said Melissa Beebe, a cancer nurse at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to even tell when it\u2019s accurate and when it\u2019s not because there are so many false alarms.\u201d",
      "Even the most sophisticated technology will miss will miss signs that nurses routinely pick up on, such as facial expressions and odors, notes Michelle Collins, dean of Loyola University\u2019s College of Nursing. But people aren't perfect either.",
      "\u201cIt would be foolish to turn our back on this completely,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe should embrace what it can do to augment our care, but we should also be careful it doesn\u2019t replace the human element.\u201d",
      "More than 100,000 nurses left the workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to one estimate, the biggest staffing drop in 40 years. As the U.S. population ages and nurses retire, the U.S. government estimates there will be more than 190,000 new openings for nurses every year through 2032.",
      "Faced with this trend, hospital administrators see AI filling a vital role: not taking over care, but helping nurses and doctors gather information and communicate with patients.",
      "At the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences in Little Rock, staffers need to make hundreds of calls every week to prepare patients for surgery. Nurses confirm information about prescriptions, heart conditions and other issues \u2014 like sleep apnea \u2014 that must be carefully reviewed before anesthesia.",
      "The problem: many patients only answer their phones in the evening, usually between dinner and their children\u2019s bedtime.",
      "\u201cSo what we need to do is find a way to call several hundred people in a 120-minute window -- but I really don\u2019t want to pay my staff overtime to do so,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Sanford, who oversees the center\u2019s health IT.",
      "Since January, the hospital has used an AI assistant from Qventus to contact patients and health providers, send and receive medical records and summarize their contents for human staffers. Qventus says 115 hospitals are using its technology, which aims to boost hospital earnings through quicker surgical turnarounds, fewer cancellations and reduced burnout.",
      "Each call begins with the program identifying itself as an AI assistant.",
      "\u201cWe always want to be fully transparent with our patients that sometimes they are talking to a human and sometimes they\u2019re not,\u201d Sanford said.",
      "While companies like Qventus are providing an administrative service, other AI developers see a bigger role for their technology.",
      "Israeli startup Xoltar specializes in humanlike avatars that conduct video calls with patients. The company is working with the Mayo Clinic on an AI assistant that teaches patients cognitive techniques for managing chronic pain. The company is also developing an avatar to help smokers quit. In early testing, patients have spent about 14 minutes talking to the program, which can pickup on facial expressions, body language and other cues, according to Xoltar.",
      "Nursing experts who study AI say such programs may work for people who are relatively healthy and proactive about their care. But that\u2019s not most people in the health system.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the very sick who are taking up the bulk of health care in the U.S. and whether or not chatbots are positioned for those folks is something we really have to consider,\u201d said Roschelle Fritz of the University of California Davis School of Nursing.",

      "The incomplete skull \u2014 a section of the left cheek bone and upper jaw \u2013 was found in northern Spain in 2022. The fossil is between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old, according to research published in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThe fossil is exciting,\" said Eric Delson, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIt's the first time we have significant remains older than 1 million years old in western Europe.\u201d",
      "A collection of older fossils from early human ancestors was previously found in Georgia, near the crossroads of eastern Europe and Asia. Those are estimated to be 1.8 million years old.",
      "The Spanish fossil is the first evidence that clearly shows human ancestors \u201cwere taking excursions into Europe\u201d at that time, said Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program.",
      "But there is not yet evidence that the earliest arrivals persisted there long, he said. \u201cThey may get to a new location and then die out,\u201d said Potts, who had no role in the study.",
      "The partial skull bears many similarities to Homo erectus, but there are also some anatomical differences, said study co-author Rosa Huguet, an archaeologist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain.",
      "Homo erectus arose around 2 million years ago and moved from Africa to regions of Asia and Europe, with the last individuals dying out around 100,000 years ago, said Potts.",
      "It can be challenging to identify which group of early humans a fossil find belongs to if there's only a single fragment versus many bones that show a range of features, said University of Zurich paleoanthropologist Christoph Zollikofer, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The same cave complex in Spain's Atapuerca Mountains where the new fossil was found also previously yielded other significant clues to the ancient human past. Researchers working in the region have also found more recent fossils from Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens.",

      "Schools are turning to AI-powered surveillance technology to monitor students on school-issued devices like laptops and tablets",
      "One student asked a search engine, \u201cWhy does my boyfriend hit me?\u201d Another threatened suicide in an email to an unrequited love. A gay teen opened up in an online diary about struggles with homophobic parents, writing they just wanted to be themselves.",
      "In each case and thousands of others, surveillance software powered by artificial intelligence immediately alerted Vancouver Public Schools staff in Washington state.",
      "Vancouver and many other districts around the country have turned to technology to monitor school-issued devices 24/7 for any signs of danger as they grapple with a student mental health crisis and the threat of shootings.",
      "The goal is to keep children safe, but these tools raise serious questions about privacy and security \u2014 as proven when Seattle Times and Associated Press reporters inadvertently received access to almost 3,500 sensitive, unredacted student documents through a records request about the district\u2019s surveillance technology.",
      "___",
      "The Education Reporting Collaborative, a coalition of eight newsrooms, is investigating the unintended consequences of AI-powered surveillance at schools. Members of the Collaborative are AL.com, The Associated Press, The Christian Science Monitor, The Dallas Morning News, The Hechinger Report, Idaho Education News, The Post and Courier in South Carolina, and The Seattle Times.",
      "___",
      "The released documents show students use these laptops for more than just schoolwork; they are coping with angst in their personal lives.",
      "Students wrote about depression, heartbreak, suicide, addiction, bullying and eating disorders. There are poems, college essays and excerpts from role-play sessions with AI chatbots.",
      "Vancouver school staff and anyone else with links to the files could read everything. Firewalls or passwords didn\u2019t protect the documents, and student names were not redacted, which cybersecurity experts warned was a massive security risk.",
      "The monitoring tools often helped counselors reach out to students who might have otherwise struggled in silence. But the Vancouver case is a stark reminder of surveillance technology\u2019s unintended consequences in American schools.",
      "In some cases, the technology has outed LGBTQ+ children and eroded trust between students and school staff, while failing to keep schools completely safe.",
      "Gaggle Safety Management, the company that developed the software that tracks Vancouver schools students\u2019 online activity, believes not monitoring children is like letting them loose on \u201ca digital playground without fences or recess monitors,\u201d CEO and founder Jeff Patterson said.",
      "Roughly 1,500 school districts nationwide use Gaggle\u2019s software to track the online activity of approximately 6 million students. It\u2019s one of many companies, like GoGuardian and Securly, that promise to keep kids safe through AI-assisted web surveillance.",
      "The technology has been in high demand since the pandemic, when nearly every child received a school-issued tablet or laptop. According to a U.S. Senate investigation, over 7,000 schools or districts used GoGuardian\u2019s surveillance products in 2021.",
      "Vancouver schools apologized for releasing the documents. Still, the district emphasizes Gaggle is necessary to protect students\u2019 well-being.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we could ever put a price on protecting students,\u201d said Andy Meyer, principal of Vancouver\u2019s Skyview High School. \u201cAnytime we learn of something like that and we can intervene, we feel that is very positive.\u201d",
      "Dacia Foster, a parent in the district, commended the efforts to keep students safe but worries about privacy violations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not good at all,\u201d Foster said after learning the district inadvertently released the records. \u201cBut what are my options? What do I do? Pull my kid out of school?\u201d",
      "Foster says she\u2019d be upset if her daughter\u2019s private information was compromised.",
      "\u201cAt the same time,\u201d she said, \u201cI would like to avoid a school shooting or suicide.\u201d",
      "Gaggle uses a machine-learning algorithm to scan what students search or write online via a school-issued laptop or tablet 24 hours a day, or whenever they log into their school account on a personal device. The latest contract Vancouver signed, in summer 2024, shows a price of $328,036 for three school years \u2014 approximately the cost of employing one extra counselor.",
      "The algorithm detects potential indicators of problems like bullying, self-harm, suicide or school violence and then sends a screenshot to human reviewers. If Gaggle employees confirm the issue might be serious, the company alerts the school. In cases of imminent danger, Gaggle calls school officials directly. In rare instances where no one answers, Gaggle may contact law enforcement for a welfare check.",
      "A Vancouver school counselor who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation said they receive three or four student Gaggle alerts per month. In about half the cases, the district contacts parents immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, families don\u2019t know. We open that door for that help,\u201d the counselor said. Gaggle is \u201cgood for catching suicide and self-harm, but students find a workaround once they know they are getting flagged.\u201d",
      "Seattle Times and AP reporters saw what kind of writing set off Gaggle\u2019s alerts after requesting information about the type of content flagged. Gaggle saved screenshots of activity that set off each alert, and school officials accidentally provided links to them, not realizing they weren\u2019t protected by a password.",
      "After learning about the records inadvertently released to reporters, Gaggle updated its system. Now, after 72 hours, only those logged into a Gaggle account can view the screenshots. Gaggle said this feature was already in the works but had not yet been rolled out to every customer.",
      "The company says the links must be accessible without a login during those 72 hours so emergency contacts \u2014 who often receive these alerts late at night on their phones \u2014 can respond quickly.",
      "In Vancouver, the monitoring technology flagged more than 1,000 documents for suicide and nearly 800 for threats of violence. While many alerts were serious, many others turned out to be false alarms, like a student essay about the importance of consent or a goofy chat between friends.",
      "Foster\u2019s daughter Bryn, a Vancouver School of Arts and Academics sophomore, was one such false alarm. She was called into the principal\u2019s office after writing a short story featuring a scene with mildly violent imagery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re being safe about it, but I also think it can be a bit much,\u201d Bryn said.",
      "School officials maintain alerts are warranted even in less severe cases or false alarms, ensuring potential issues are addressed promptly.",
      "\u201cIt allows me the opportunity to meet with a student I maybe haven\u2019t met before and build that relationship,\u201d said Chele Pierce, a Skyview High School counselor.",
      "Between October 2023 and October 2024, nearly 2,200 students, about 10% of the district\u2019s enrollment, were the subject of a Gaggle alert. At the Vancouver School of Arts and Academics, where Bryn is a student, about 1 in 4 students had communications that triggered a Gaggle alert.",
      "While schools continue to use surveillance technology, its long-term effects on student safety are unclear. There\u2019s no independent research showing it measurably lowers student suicide rates or reduces violence.",
      "A 2023 RAND study found only \u201cscant evidence\u201d of either benefits or risks from AI surveillance, concluding: \u201cNo research to date has comprehensively examined how these programs affect youth suicide prevention.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the right number of mental health counselors, issuing more alerts is not actually going to improve suicide prevention,\u201d said report co-author Benjamin Boudreaux, an AI ethics researcher.",
      "In the screenshots released by Vancouver schools, at least six students were potentially outed to school officials after writing about being gay, transgender or struggling with gender dysphoria.",
      "LGBTQ+ students are more likely than their peers to suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, and turn to the internet for support.",
      "\u201cWe know that gay youth, especially those in more isolated environments, absolutely use the internet as a life preserver,\u201d said Katy Pearce, a University of Washington professor who researches technology in authoritarian states.",
      "In one screenshot, a Vancouver high schooler wrote in a Google survey form they\u2019d been subject to trans slurs and racist bullying. Who created this survey is unclear, but the person behind it had falsely promised confidentiality: \u201cI am not a mandated reporter, please tell me the whole truth.\u201d",
      "When North Carolina\u2019s Durham Public Schools piloted Gaggle in 2021, surveys showed most staff members found it helpful.",
      "But community members raised concerns. An LGBTQ+ advocate reported to the Board of Education that a Gaggle alert about self-harm had led to a student being outed to their family, who were not supportive.",
      "Glenn Thompson, a Durham School of the Arts graduate, spoke up at a board meeting during his senior year. One of his teachers promised a student confidentiality for an assignment related to mental health. A classmate was then \u201cblindsided\u201d when Gaggle alerted school officials about something private they\u2019d disclosed. Thompson said no one in the class, including the teacher, knew the school was piloting Gaggle.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just (surveil) people and not tell them. That\u2019s a horrible breach of security and trust,\u201d said Thompson, now a college student, in an interview.",
      "After hearing about these experiences, the Durham Board of Education voted to stop using Gaggle in 2023. The district ultimately decided it was not worth the risk of outing students or eroding relationships with adults.",
      "The debate over privacy and security is complicated, and parents are often unaware it\u2019s even an issue. Pearce, the University of Washington professor, doesn\u2019t remember reading about Securly, the surveillance software Seattle Public Schools uses, when she signed the district\u2019s responsible use form before her son received a school laptop.",
      "Even when families learn about school surveillance, they may be unable to opt out. Owasso Public Schools in Oklahoma has used Gaggle since 2016 to monitor students outside of class.",
      "For years, Tim Reiland, the parent of two teenagers, had no idea the district was using Gaggle. He found out only after asking if his daughter could bring her personal laptop to school instead of being forced to use a district one because of privacy concerns.",
      "The district refused Reiland\u2019s request.",
      "When Reiland's daughter, Zoe, found out about Gaggle, she says she felt so \u201cfreaked out\u201d that she stopped Googling anything personal on her Chromebook, even questions about her menstrual period. She didn\u2019t want to get called into the office for \u201csearching up lady parts.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was too scared to be curious,\u201d she said.",
      "School officials say they don\u2019t track metrics measuring the technology\u2019s efficacy but believe it has saved lives.",
      "Yet technology alone doesn\u2019t create a safe space for all students. In 2024, a nonbinary teenager at Owasso High School named Nex Benedict died by suicide after relentless bullying from classmates. A subsequent U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights investigation found the district responded with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to some families\u2019 reports of sexual harassment, mainly in the form of homophobic bullying.",
      "During the 2023-24 school year, the Owasso schools received close to 1,000 Gaggle alerts, including 168 alerts for harassment and 281 for suicide.",
      "When asked why bullying remained a problem despite surveillance, Russell Thornton, the district\u2019s executive director of technology responded: \u201cThis is one tool used by administrators. Obviously, one tool is not going to solve the world\u2019s problems and bullying.\u201d",
      "Despite the risks, surveillance technology can help teachers intervene before a tragedy.",
      "A middle school student in the Seattle-area Highline School District who was potentially being trafficked used Gaggle to communicate with campus staff, said former Superintendent Susan Enfield.",
      "\u201cThey knew that the staff member was reading what they were writing,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt was, in essence, that student\u2019s way of asking for help.\u201d",
      "Still, developmental psychology research shows it is vital for teens to have private spaces online to explore their thoughts and seek support.",
      "\u201cThe idea that kids are constantly under surveillance by adults \u2014 I think that would make it hard to develop a private life, a space to make mistakes, a space to go through hard feelings without adults jumping in,\u201d said Boudreaux, the AI ethics researcher.",
      "Gaggle\u2019s Patterson says school-issued devices are not the appropriate place for unlimited self-exploration. If that exploration takes a dark turn, such as making a threat, \u201cthe school\u2019s going to be held liable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for that open free expression, it really can\u2019t happen on the school system\u2019s computers.\u201d",

      "SpaceX launched the Spherex observatory from California, putting it on course to fly over Earth\u2019s poles. Tagging along were four suitcase-size satellites to study the sun. Spherex popped off the rocket's upper stage first, drifting into the blackness of space with a blue Earth in the background.",
      "The $488 million Spherex mission aims to explain how galaxies formed and evolved over billions of years, and how the universe expanded so fast in its first moments.",
      "Closer to home in our own Milky Way galaxy, Spherex will hunt for water and other ingredients of life in the icy clouds between stars where new solar systems emerge.",
      "The cone-shaped Spherex \u2014 at 1,110 pounds (500 kilograms) or the heft of a grand piano \u2014 will take six months to map the entire sky with its infrared eyes and wide field of view. Four full-sky surveys are planned over two years, as the telescope circles the globe from pole to pole 400 miles (650 kilometers) up.",
      "Spherex won\u2019t see galaxies in exquisite detail like NASA\u2019s larger and more elaborate Hubble and Webb space telescopes, with their narrow fields of view.",
      "Instead of counting galaxies or focusing on them, Spherex will observe the total glow produced by the whole lot, including the earliest ones formed in the wake of the universe-creating Big Bang.",
      "\u201cThis cosmological glow captures all light emitted over cosmic history,\u201d said the mission\u2019s chief scientist Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different way of looking at the universe,\u201d enabling scientists to see what sources of light may have been missed in the past.",
      "By observing the collective glow, scientists hope to tease out the light from the earliest galaxies and learn how they came to be, Bock said.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t see the Big Bang. But we\u2019ll see the aftermath from it and learn about the beginning of the universe that way,\u201d he said.",
      "The telescope\u2019s infrared detectors will be able to distinguish 102 colors invisible to the human eye, yielding the most colorful, inclusive map ever made of the cosmos.",

It sports three aluminum-honeycomb cones, one inside the other, to protect from the sun and Earth's heat, resembling a 10-foot (3-meter) shield collar for an ailing dog.",
      "Besides the telescope, SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rocket provided a lift from Vandenberg Space Force Base for a quartet of NASA satellites called Punch. From their own separate polar orbit, the satellites will observe the sun\u2019s corona, or outer atmosphere, and the resulting solar wind.",

      "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday announced nearly three dozen deregulatory moves that he said would spur the U.S. economy by rolling back rules that have unfairly burdened industry. Many of the moves would affect landmark regulations aimed at protecting clean air and water.",
      "Industry generally applauded the proposed changes, while environmentalists worried about what would amount to historic rollbacks if they are approved. Here's a look at some of the 31 regulatory changes Zeldin announced:",
      "The Biden administration set limits on planet-warming emissions from existing gas and coal-fired power plants \u2013 a major step in the administration\u2019s effort to reduce greenhouse gases from the heavily polluting energy sector. Trump has long opposed such tough, climate-friendly limits and has instead promoted oil and gas development. Zeldin said the agency would reconsider the Biden administration standards to avoid constraining energy production.",
      "Coal plants emit toxic metals like mercury and the Biden administration issued a rule to severely limit those pollutants. Officials at the time said technology had progressed enough for these plants to do better. The EPA on Wednesday said nearly two dozen states had sued, arguing the rule was costly and a major burden, especially to coal plants. They also considering offering industry a two-year compliance extension while officials reconsider the rule.",
      "Hazardous metals like mercury and arsenic end up in the wastewater of steam-powered electric generating power plants like coal. These can have serious health effects including increasing cancer rates and lowering childhood IQ scores. The Biden administration tightened regulations of this wastewater. The EPA said it will revisit those \u201cstringent\u201d rules that are costly to industry and therefore may raise residential energy bills.",
      "Currently, treated wastewater generated from oil and gas drilling can be used in limited ways in certain western lands, such as for agriculture. Environmentalists say there can be a broad range of contaminants in the wastewater, some of which might not be known. The EPA said it will reconsider those rules and look at how the treated water could be used for other purposes like cooling data centers, fighting fires and other ecological needs. They say the current rules are costly, old and don\u2019t reflect the capabilities of modern treatment technologies.",
      "The Biden administration tightened safeguards against accidents for industrial and chemical plants that millions of people live near. The agency\u2019s risk management program added planning and reporting requirements for facilities and forced some to implement new safeguards. Accidents at these plants can be severe \u2013 a 2019 explosion at a Texas facility, for example, forced tens of thousands to evacuate, for example. Industry associations have criticized parts of the rule, such as requirements to publicly report sensitive information.",
      "Zeldin said Biden administration officials \u201cignored recommendations from national security experts on how their rule makes chemical and other sensitive facilities in America more vulnerable to attack.\u201d The EPA is reconsidering the rule.",
      "The EPA said it was reconsidering its mandatory greenhouse gas reporting program, which requires thousands of major industrial polluters to tell the agency about its emissions. Zeldin said the \u201cbureaucratic government program\u201d costs hundreds of millions of dollars and doesn\u2019t help air quality. Until now, the EPA said the data helped businesses compare their emissions to competitors and find opportunities to reduce them and lower costs.",
      "Zeldin vowed to review his agency\u2019s emissions standards for cars and trucks, calling the tightened emissions rules the \u201cfoundation for the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate.\u201d Nothing the Biden administration implemented required automakers to make and sell EVs or for consumers to buy them. Loosening standards would allow vehicles to emit more planet-warming greenhouse gases, but many automakers have already been investing in making their vehicles more efficient.",
      "The scientific finding, under the 2009 Clean Air Act, determined that planet-warming greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. It has been at the core of the nation\u2019s action against climate change. Trump had already directed the EPA to consider the finding\u2019s \u201clegality\u201d in an executive order. Experts say the impacts of climate change on human health and the environment are already clear, and that upending the finding would be devastating.",
      "This program enforced strict rules to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons, highly potent and planet-warming greenhouse gases used in refrigerators, air conditioners, heat pumps and more. HFCs, as they are known, are thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide and leak through equipment that uses compressed refrigerants. Dozens of countries around the globe have pledged to slash their use and production of the chemicals.",
      "This rule was intended to limit air pollution by restricting power plant smokestack emissions, and those from other industrial sites, across 11 states. Eliminating it would especially impact downwind neighborhoods that are burdened by pollution from ground-level ozone, or smog, that is out of their control. However, the Supreme Court had already put a hold on the rule last summer, ruling that states challenging it were likely to prevail.",
      "These seats have long been politicized given how influential they can be in setting national environmental policy. The board reviews \u201cthe quality and relevance of the scientific and technical information being used by the EPA or proposed as the basis for Agency regulations\u201d and agency research programs. Congress directed the agency to establish the board to provide the Administrator science advice in 1978. The committee can give \u201cindependent advice\u201d to the agency\u2019s Administrator specific to the nation\u2019s Ambient Air Quality Standards.",
      "Power plants and industrial facilities release particulate matter, or soot, that can easily pass through a person\u2019s lungs and into their bloodstream. Last year, the Biden administration tightened standards regulating soot in response to scientific research indicating existing regulations were insufficient. At the time, the EPA estimated its stronger regulations would save thousands of lives and prevent hundreds of thousands of cases of asthma and lost workdays annually. The Trump administration\u2019s EPA says these regulations are \u201ca major obstacle\u201d for companies and that the U.S. has low levels of soot.",
      "These EPA standards apply to pollutants known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects or other serious health problems. Industrial facilities are required to follow strict standards to monitor and limit the amount of these chemicals they release into the air. Last year, the EPA tightened standards surrounding ethylene oxide emissions, a human carcinogen commonly used as a sterilizer for medical equipment. The Trump administration said it is considering a \u201c2-year compliance exemption\u201d for facilities affected by these standards, among others.",
      "For decades, this EPA program has required states to reduce pollution that threatens scenic views in more than 150 national parks and wilderness areas, including in the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone. Zeldin said that the U.S. has made strides in improving visibility in national parks and that the program is being used as justification for shutting down industrial facilities and threatening affordable energy.",
      "The social cost of carbon is an EPA tool to weigh the economic costs and benefits of regulating polluting industries by putting a price tag on climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions \u2013 set at $190 per ton under the Biden administration\u2019s EPA. That calculation is used in cost-benefit analyses, and was intended to account for greenhouse gas emissions\u2019 impacts including natural disasters, crop damage, health problems and sea-level rise. Under the first Trump administration, carbon was pegged at around $5 per ton. An executive order Trump signed on his first day in office directs the EPA to consider eliminating this calculation entirely to advance his \u201cUnleashing American Energy\u201d policy.",
      "After coal is burned, ash filled with heavy pollutants including arsenic, lead and mercury is left behind and typically stored in giant pits under federal regulation. The EPA says it is now seeking to rapidly put regulation \u201cmore fully into state hands,\u201d which environmental groups fear could lead to weaker standards.

      "Another group, the National Union of Authors and Composers, which represents 700 writers, playwrights and composers, said the lawsuit was necessary to protect members from \u201cAI which plunders their works and cultural heritage to train itself.\"",
      "The union is also worried about AI that \u201cproduces 'fake books' which compete with real books,\u201d the union's president, Francois Peyrony, said.",

    "story": [
      "Japanese automaker Nissan says its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese automaker Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down after the company reported dismal financial results and its merger talks with Honda collapsed.",
      "Nissan Motor Corp. said in a statement Tuesday that Ivan Espinosa, who is now the company\u2019s chief planning officer, will take Uchida\u2019s place, effective April 1.",
      "Nissan stock edged up slightly at the opening but soon slipped about 1% in early Wednesday trading in Tokyo, highlighting investors' skepticism over what was announced late the previous day.",
      "Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003, has spent much of his Nissan career in Mexico and Southeast Asia, overseeing product planning including the drive toward electric vehicles, meaning he's an insider perhaps less willing to take drastic action.",
      "\u201cI sincerely believe that Nissan has so much more potential than what we're seeing today,\u201d Espinosa told reporters, while stressing that he needs time to come up with details for a turnaround.",
      "He stressed his love for Nissan, noting he has developed a deep understanding of what makes the company unique and valuable.",
      "Nissan said the company leadership needed to be \u201crenewed\u201d to achieve long-term growth. Uchida, who remains as a director, expressed confidence in Espinosa as \u201ca real car guy,\u201d and stressed he was handing over the baton of leadership to better unify company ranks.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Nissan will definitely make a comeback,\u201d he said, appearing at the hastily called news conference with Espinosa.",
      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate their businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",
      "Nissan is projecting a loss of 80 billion yen ($540 million) for the full fiscal year through the end of this month.",
      "When asked about talks with Honda and other possible partnerships, Espinosa declined comment, saying he needed more time.",
      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "Analysts said Nissan's future remains precarious, with little time left, but noted Nissan may need an outsider rather than an insider like Espinosa.",
      "Todd Duvick and Will Lee, auto analysts at CreditSights, believe the focus is still on a business turnaround, not the proposed integration with Honda.",
      "\u201cNot that a turnaround could not coexist with a Honda merger, but we view it as unlikely that Nissan would be open to becoming a subsidiary of Honda at this time, at least until the board has time to assess the effectiveness of Espinosa\u2019s strategy once it is unveiled and put into action,\u201d they said in a report.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010. Besides its proud legacy, Nissan also boasts solid engineering. It recently showed off its autonomous vehicle running on regular streets near its Yokohama headquarters.",
      "Uchida joined Nissan in 2003, job-hopping from major Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai, and worked with Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Renault SA of France before overseeing Nissan\u2019s China operations.",
      "Nissan was rescued from near bankruptcy by Renault in 1999. In 2018, Carlos Ghosn, the former superstar executive sent in by Renault, was arrested by Japanese authorities on various financial misconduct charges, including under-reporting his compensation. He later fled to Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.",
      "Nissan's tarnished corporate image after the Ghosn fiasco was a major challenge, Uchida said. So were the COVID-19 pandemic and broader shifts in the auto industry.",
      "Apart from Uchida's departure as chief executive, Nissan announced other sweeping managerial changes, including giving an expanded role to Guillaume Cartier, its chief performance officer, in global marketing and customer experience.",
      "Eiichi Akashi, corporate vice president of the Vehicle Planning and Vehicle Component Engineering Division, was named chief technology officer, succeeding Kunio Nakaguro.",
      "Teiji Hirata, a corporate vice president, will become chief \u201cmonozukuri\u201d officer and executive officer, responsible for manufacturing and supply chain management, replacing Hideyuki Sakamoto.",
      "Jeremy Papin, the chief financial officer, was also appointed to be an executive officer. There was no change for Stephen Ma, who serves as chairperson of Nissan's management committee in China.",

      "In less than a month, TikTok could have one or a few new owners, be banned again, or simply receive another reprieve to continue operating in the United States.",
      "Questions about the fate of the popular video sharing app have continued to linger since a law requiring its China-based parent company to divest or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19. After taking office, President Donald Trump gave TikTok a 75-day reprieve by signing an executive order that delayed enforcement of the statute until April 5.",
      "As he returned to Washington from his Florida home on Sunday, Trump told reporters that a deal could come soon. He did not offer any details on the interested buyers, but said the administration was in talks with \u201cfour different groups\u201d about TikTok.",
      "\u201cA lot of people want it and it\u2019s up to me,\u201d Trump said aboard Air Force One.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "If TikTok is not sold to an approved buyer by April 5, the original law that bans it nationwide would once again go into effect. However, the deadline for the executive order doesn't appear to be set in stone and the president has reiterated it could be extended further if needed.",
      "Trump\u2019s order came a few days after the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a federal law that required TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, to divest or be banned in January. The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users and came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok on national security grounds, which was halted by the courts before his administration negotiated a sale of the platform that eventually failed to materialize. He changed his position on the popular app during last year's presidential election and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters.",
      "The decision to keep TikTok alive through an executive order has received some scrutiny, but it has not faced a legal challenge in court.",
      "Although it\u2019s unclear if ByteDance plans to sell TikTok, several potential bidders have come forward in the past few months.",
      "Aides for Vice President JD Vance, who was tapped to oversee a potential deal, have reached out to some parties, such as the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI, to get additional details about their bids, according to a person familiar with the matter. In January, Perplexity AI presented ByteDance with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation.",
      "Other potential bidders include a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic advisor. Investors in the consortium say they\u2019ve offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. And if successful, they plan to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they say will provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, says he too has organized a consortium, which includes the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and is offering ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",
      "Trump said in January that Microsoft was also eyeing the popular app. Other interested parties include Trump\u2019s former Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and Rumble, the video site popular with some conservatives and far-right groups. In a post on X last March, Rumble said it was ready to join a consortium of parties interested in purchasing TikTok and serving as a tech partner for the company.",
      "Trump has said he is looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of TikTok. However, the administration hasn't provided details on what exactly that would entail, or what role the U.S. government could play in the future of the short-form video app.",
      "Some potential bidders have floated proposals that would allow the U.S. to invest or own a stake in the platform. Last month, Trump himself also said the U.S. could own part of TikTok through a new government-owned investment fund.",
      "Chinese officials, who would have to approve the deal, appear to have softened their stance on the issue compared to last year when Beijing called the push for divestment a \u201crobbers\u201d act.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in January that business operations and acquisitions \u201cshould be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed,\u201d Mao said.",
      "If ByteDance sits down to negotiate, the company would likely need to iron out major details with the U.S. over the proprietary algorithm that populates TikTok feeds as well as the flow of content between the U.S. and the rest of the world.",

      "Explorers have discovered the sunken wreckage of one of the first steel cargo ships to travel the Great Lakes",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Twenty years before the Titanic changed maritime history, another ship touted as the next great technological feat set sail on the Great Lakes.",
      "The Western Reserve was one of the first all-steel cargo ships to traverse the lakes. Built to break speed records, the 300-foot (91.4-meter) freighter dubbed \u201cthe inland greyhound\u201d by newspapers was supposed to be one of the safest ships afloat. Owner Peter Minch was so proud of her that he brought his wife and young children aboard for a summer joyride in August 1892.",
      "Then tragedy struck. As the ship entered Lake Superior's Whitefish Bay between Michigan and Canada on Aug. 30, a gale came up. With no cargo aboard, the ship was light and floating high in the water. The storm battered it until it cracked in half. Twenty-seven people perished that night, including the Minch family. The only survivor was wheelsman Harry W. Stewart, who swam a mile (1.6 kilometers) to shore after his lifeboat capsized.",
      "For almost 132 years the lake hid the wreckage. In July, explorers from the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society pinpointed the Western Reserve off Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The society announced the discovery Saturday at the annual Ghost Ships Festival in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Executive Director Bruce Lynn called the discovery one of the society's most significant finds.",
      "\u201cThere's a number of concurrent stories that make this important,\u201d Lynn said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cMost ships were still wooden. It was a technologically advanced ship. They were kind of a famous family at the time. You have this new ship, considered one of the safest on the lake, new tech, a big, big ship. (The discovery) is another way for us to keep this history alive.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel, the society's marine operations director, and his brother, Dan Ertel, spent more than two years looking for the Western Reserve.",
      "Lynn said this winter the brothers outlined a search grid. On July 22 they set out on the David Boyd, the society's research vessel. Heavy ship traffic that day forced them to alter their course, though, and search an area adjacent to their original grid, Lynn said.",
      "The brothers towed a side-scanning sonar array behind their ship. Side sonar scans to starboard and port, providing a more expansive picture of the bottom than traditional sonar mounted beneath a ship. About 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Whitefish Point on the Upper Peninsula, they picked up a line with a shadow behind it in 600 feet of water. They dialed up the resolution and spotted a ship broken in two with the bow resting on the stern. Each section was 150 feet (45.2 meters) long, suggesting they'd found the Western Reserve.",
      "Eight days later, the brothers returned to the site along with Lynn. They deployed a submersible drone equipped with high-intensity lighting and a high-resolution camera. The drone returned clear images of a portside running light that match the Western Reserve's starboard running light, which had washed ashore in Canada after the ship went down. That light was the only artifact recovered from the ship.",
      "\u201cThat was confirmation day,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cIt's pretty exciting.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel said that discovery gave him chills \u2014 and not in a good way. \u201cKnowing how the 300-foot Western Reserve was caught in a storm this far from shore made a uneasy feeling in the back of my neck,\" he said in a society news release. \"A squall can come up unexpectedly\u2026anywhere, and anytime.\u201d",
      "The Edmund Fitzgerald, a freighter that went down in a November 1975 storm that was immortalized in the Gordon Lightfoot song, \u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" sank off Whitefish Point within 100 miles of the Western Reserve. There were no survivors."

      "The southern Italian city of Naples was struck by a 4.4-magnitude quake early Thursday that caused only minor damage",
      "ROME -- The southern Italian city of Naples was struck by a 4.4-magnitude quake early Thursday that caused only minor damage and sent 11 people to the hospital, the most serious suffering contusions after part of a ceiling collapsed, officials said.",
      "The quake was the strongest in recorded history around the Phlegrean Fields, a sprawling area of ancient volcanoes that covers a broad swath of the Naples metropolitan area. It matched the magnitude of another quake in the same area last May that has put the population on alert.",
      "Residents shaken awake by the early-morning quake sought safety in the streets, as they did in May.",
      "The temblor, which loosened stone and cement from some facades, was centered just offshore from Pozzuoli, a seaside suburb bordering Naples. Mayor Gaetano Manfredi told reporters that one church, a seven-story residential building and another building were declared off-limits due to damage, and some schools were closed as a precaution.",
      "Inspectors were checking buildings for further damage, Manfredi said. \u201cWe are following with the greatest attention all of our structures, and are monitoring all events in real time,\u2019\u2019 the mayor said.",
      "In all, 11 people sought hospital treatment. One woman was injured after part of a ceiling fell, and several others suffered cuts from glass that broke in the quake, Manfredi said.",
      "Seismologists have reported a fresh increase in activity around the Phlegrean Fields over recent weeks. Authorities last summer conducted drills in preparation for a major emergency as the frequency of temblors increased.",
      "The area around the Phlegrean Fields, which encompasses western neighborhoods of Naples and its suburbs, is both seismically and volcanically active. The surface has been pushed up 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) since 2006, which is higher than prior to the last major event in 1984, but seismologists have emphasized it is impossible to predict when an eruption or stronger quake might occur.",
      "At least 500,000 people live in the zone most at risk should the volcano erupt. Italy's national institute for geophysics and vulcanology has called for a governmental plan to ensure that structures can withstand a quake of at least a magnitude 5.0.",

      "It's a different story for those who enter the reactor buildings, including the three damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. They must use maximum protection \u2014 full facemasks with filters, multi-layered gloves and socks, shoe covers, hooded hazmat coveralls and a waterproof jacket, and a helmet.",
      "As workers remove melted fuel debris from the reactors in a monumental nuclear cleanup effort that could take more than a century, they are facing both huge amounts of psychological stress and dangerous levels of radiation.",
      "The Associated Press, which recently visited the plant for a tour and interviews, takes a closer look.",
      "A remote-controlled extendable robot with a tong had several mishaps including equipment failures before returning in November with a tiny piece of melted fuel from inside the damaged No. 2 reactor.",
      "That first successful test run is a crucial step in what will be a daunting, decades-long decommissioning that must deal with at least 880 tons of melted nuclear fuel that has mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three ruined reactors.",
      "Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, says even the tiny sample gives officials a lot of information about the melted fuel. More samples are needed, however, to make the work smoother when bigger efforts to remove the debris begin in the 2030s.",
      "A second sample-retrieval mission at the No. 2 reactor is expected in coming weeks.",
      "Operators hope to send the extendable robot farther into the reactor to take samples closer to the center, where overheated nuclear fuel fell from the core, utility spokesperson Masakatsu Takata said. He pointed out the target area as he stood inside the inner structure of the No. 5 reactor, which is one of two reactors that survived the tsunami. It has an identical design as No. 2.",
      "Radiation levels are still dangerously high inside the No. 2 reactor building, where the melted fuel debris is behind a thick concrete containment wall. Earlier decontamination work reduced those radiation levels to a fraction of what they used to be.",
      "In late August, small groups took turns doing their work helping the robot in 15- to 30-minute shifts to minimize radiation exposure. They have a remotely controlled robot, but it has to be manually pushed in and out.",
      "\u201cWorking under high levels of radiation (during a short) time limit made us feel nervous and rushed,\" said Yasunobu Yokokawa, a team leader for the mission. \"It was a difficult assignment.\u201d",
      "Full-face masks reduced visibility and made breathing difficult, an extra waterproof jacket made it sweaty and hard to move, and triple-layered gloves made their fingers clumsy, Yokokawa said.",
      "To eliminate unnecessary exposure, they taped around gloves and socks and carried a personal dosimeter to measure radiation. Workers also rehearsed the tasks they'd perform to minimize exposure.",
      "The mission stalled early on when workers noticed that a set of five 1.5-meter (5-foot) pipes meant to push the robot into the reactor's primary containment vessel had been arranged in the wrong order.",
      "A camera on the robot also failed because of high radioactivity and had to be replaced.",
      "The workers' highest individual radiation dose was more than the overall average but still far below anything approaching a 100-millisievert five-year dose limit.",
      "Even so, a growing number of workers are concerned about safety and radiation at the plant, said Ono, the decommissioning chief, citing an annual survey of about 5,5,00 workers.",
      "In 2023, two workers splashed with contaminated sludge at a water treatment facility suffered burns and were hospitalized, though they had no other health problems.",
      "Yokokawa and a plant colleague, Hiroshi Ide, helped in the 2011 emergency and work as team leaders today. They say they want to make the job safer as workers face high radiation in parts of the plant.",
      "On the top floor of the No. 2 reactor, workers are setting up equipment to remove spent fuel units from the cooling pool. That's set to begin within two to three years.",

      "An hours-long outage on StudentAid",
      "WASHINGTON -- An hours-long outage Wednesday on StudentAid.gov, the federal website for student loans and financial aid, underscored the risks in rapidly gutting the Department of Education, as President Donald Trump aims to dismantle the agency.",
      "Hundreds of users reported FAFSA outages to Downdetector starting midday Wednesday, saying they were having trouble completing the form, which is required for financial aid at colleges nationwide. The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, a group of people who handle colleges' financial aid awards, also received reports of users experiencing technical issues and having trouble completing the FAFSA.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to get more clarity on why it\u2019s down,\" said Allie Bidwell Arcese, a spokeswoman for NASFAA. The Education Department hadn't shared any information on the outage, she said. \u201cThe maintenance and troubleshooting may be impacted by yesterday\u2019s layoffs.\u201d",
      "The developers and IT support staff who worked on the FAFSA form were hard hit in the Education Department's layoffs Tuesday, along with staff buyouts and the termination of probationary employees. In all, the Education Department has reduced its staff by half, to roughly 2,000, since Trump took office.",
      "A list of laid-off staff obtained and verified by AP shows more than 300 people cut from Federal Student Aid \u2014 two dozen of them from Federal Student Aid's technology division. That included the entire team responsible for systems supporting the FAFSA form, a person with knowledge of the outage told The Associated Press, speaking anonymously for fear of retaliation. While laid-off staffers are still technically employed until March 21, they had limited access to their email, phones and computers, making a response to the outage difficult, the person said. At one point Wednesday, about 70 people had joined a Teams call to try to pinpoint the cause of the outage.",
      "The call continued for hours. By Wednesday evening, the website carried a banner claiming \u201cPlanned Maintenance\u201d was underway, and login access was cut off.",
      "The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment on the outage.",
      "Problems with the FAFSA had vexed the administration of former President Joe Biden, drawing rebuke from Republicans. The form was overhauled last year in an attempt to simplify it, but technical problems blocked students from submitting forms or bungled financial aid calculations.",
      "Advocates say the frustration probably led thousands of students to give up on going to college at all. Last fall, U.S. colleges saw a 5% decrease in freshmen enrollment over the previous year, and it was deeper at colleges with large numbers of low-income students, according to the National Student Clearinghouse.",

      "In February, the administration announced deep cuts to National Institutes of Health grants for research institutions, a shift that could reduce the money going to some universities by over $100 million. Some schools already have shelved projects because of the cuts, which have been delayed temporarily by a court challenge.",

The Houthis on Sunday claimed to have thwarted \u201ca hostile attack the enemy was preparing to launch against our country.\u201d A U.S. official told ABC News that the Houthis fired 11 drones and one ballistic missile at the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier group in the Red Sea, none of which came close to hitting any U.S. vessels.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump called the Houthis \"sinister mobsters and thugs\" said their attacks \"emanate from, and are created by, IRAN.\"",
      "Trump said Iran is \"dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, 'Intelligence.'\"",
      "\"Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!\" Trump said.",
      "The Houthis claimed to have fired 18 ballistic missiles and a drone in two separate attacks over the previous 24 hours. All drones were downed by fighters -- 10 shot down by Air Force planes and one by Navy planes -- while the ballistic missile was not intercepted as it fell far short of the vessels, the U.S. official said.",
      "Trump described the U.S. strikes as \"decisive and powerful military action\" against the Iranian-backed group. The Houthis have been targeting Western-linked shipping and launching munitions into Israel since the fall of 2022, in protest of Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft and drones,\" Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday. \"We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"",
      "Lt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, the head of operations at the Joint Staff, told reporters at Monday's Pentagon press briefing that the U.S. struck 30 targets at multiple locations on Saturday and there were additional strikes conducted on Sunday. He said the operation continued Monday \"and it will continue in the coming days until we achieve the President's objectives.\u201d",
      "Grynkewich said targets included terrorist training sites, unmanned aerial vehicle infrastructure, weapons manufacturing capabilities and weapon storage facilities. They also included command and control centers, where \"several senior duty unmanned aerial vehicle experts were located on Sunday,\" as well as facilities that have been used to threaten shipping.",
      "The Yemeni Health Ministry said the strikes killed 53 people and injured 98 more. Grynkewich there were \u201cdozens of military fatalities\u201d from Saturday\u2019s strikes and that there are no indications of civilian casualties. He said the Pentagon was aware of reports of civilian casualties, and \u201cwe look at those closely when they do come in, but we have no credible indications.\u201d",
      "Speaking with reporters on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said he was not concerned about retaliatory strikes related to the latest American strikes.",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday that the strikes represented \"an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership, and two, holding Iran responsible.\"",
      "Detailing their latest attack on U.S. Navy vessels, the Houthis said in a Sunday statement that they will \"continue to ban the passage of Israeli ships through the zone of \u200b\u200boperations until the blockade on the Gaza Strip is lifted.\"",

      "President Donald Trump's administration made a calculated decision Saturday to ignore the judge's directive to turn around two flights containing hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "The verbal instructions from U.S. District Judge James Boasberg accompanied a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens currently in custody, which the judge issued less than two hours after Trump attempted to invoke the 18th century law to deport alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "Boasberg, in his order, explicitly told the government to turn around any aircraft that had already departed the country if they were still in the air. However, sources said top lawyers and officials in the administration made the determination that since the flights were over international waters, Boasberg's order did not apply, and the planes were not turned around.",
      "In a court filing late Sunday night, lawyers with the ACLU and Democracy Forward Foundation argued that the Trump administration may have committed a \"blatant violation\" of the court's directive by acting as if the order only applied to flights in U.S. airspace and individuals on American soil.",

      "Lawyers with the Department of Justice insisted in a court filing Sunday that they removed \"gang members\" pursuant to Trump's Alien Enemies Act proclamation before the court issued its order.",
      "However, lawyers representing some of the migrants argued that assertion not only conflicts with the timeline of events but also misconstrues when the United States loses jurisdiction of the noncitizens.",
      "\"Whether or not the planes had cleared U.S. territory, the U.S. retained custody at least until the planes landed and the individuals were turned over to foreign governments,\" the plaintiffs' filing said. \"And the Court could not have been clearer that it was concerned with losing jurisdiction and authority to order the individuals returned if they were handed over to foreign governments, not with whether the planes had cleared U.S. territory or had even landed in another country.\"",
      "Plaintiffs' attorneys said that based on publicly available information, it appears that two flights carrying migrants under the Alien Enemies Act landed after the court's verbal and written orders. They added that \"public comments made by Defendants and the President of El Salvador\" boasting about the court being \"too late\" to stop the deportations reinforces concerns that the Trump administration may have violated the order.",
      "\"Defendants could have turned the plane around without handing over individuals subject to the Proclamation and this Court's [Temporary Restraining Order],\" the lawyers argued.",

This is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately.\"",

      "The Kremlin has yet to agree, with Putin saying he was \"for it\" but also that he sought further security guarantees. Zelenskyy over the weekend accused Putin of \"prolonging\" the war.",
      "Zelenskyy on Sunday reiterated that sentiment, saying in his nightly address that \"Russia stole almost another week -- a week of war that only Russia wants.\" He said Ukraine would do anything to further diplomacy that would end the war, but that \"defense and resilience are paramount\"",

      "GENEVA -- Myanmar's people are already feeling the \u201ccrushing impact\" from the \u201csudden, chaotic withdrawal\" of U.S. and other humanitarian aid, an independent human rights expert said Monday, calling on the world community to do more.",
      "Tom Andrews, a monitor on rights in Myanmar commissioned by the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council, said he would appeal to its 47 member countries to issue a \u201cdeclaration of conscience against this unfolding disaster\u201d \u2014 a humanitarian crisis \u2014 \u201cand I will urge them to follow up those words with action.\u201d",

      "Andrews, a former Democratic congressman from the U.S. state of Maine, acknowledged that the specific fallout wasn\u2019t clear so far. The American embassy in Myanmar said on its website, in a statement dated Oct. 25, that the U.S. had provided $141 million in humanitarian aid since Oct. 1, 2023.",
      "Andrews said the cut in aid was \u201cunnecessary and cruel\u201d and ill-timed: A strong movement of national resistance and a weakening of Myanmar's military rulers has raised hopes of its people.",
      "Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, 2021, triggering widespread popular opposition. After peaceful demonstrations were put down with lethal force, many opponents of military rule took up arms, and large parts of the country are now embroiled in conflict.",
      "The violence is continuing: An airstrike Friday reportedly killed and injured dozens in a village held by resistance forces.",
      "Tuberculosis and HIV patients have been missing their medication for weeks; disabled children have been locked out of rehabilitation centers; rights groups have faced cuts in their ability to distribute food and water to people, he said.",
      "\"The sudden, chaotic withdrawal of support \u2014 support principally by the government of the United States \u2014 is already having a crushing impact on the people of Myanmar,\" Andrews said",
      "The Trump administration and many of its supporters have argued that the United States, the world's single largest humanitarian aid provider, has shouldered too much of the burden for too long.",
      "Andrews alluded to efforts by a chainsaw-wielding Elon Musk through the Department of Government Efficiency to reduce waste and spending in the U.S. government, including at the U.S. Agency for International Development, known as USAID \u2014 which has distributed many billions of dollars in foreign aid over the years.",
      "\u201cYou have this incredible rhetoric that is based upon nothing except creating headlines,\" Andrews said, to show how \"this entire program is going to be thrown into a wood chipper ... Well, it\u2019s innocent people who are being tossed into that wood chipper.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to take a stand about this,\u201d he added.",

    "story": [
      "Data reviewed by ABC News contradict dubious claims by Trump.",
      "As the U.S. Department of Education shrinks following massive layoffs at the agency, President Donald Trump and his allies continue to make dubious claims about the agency and education in the country.",
      "ABC News examined some of President Donald Trump's common complaints about the Department of Education and the state of education in the United States.",
      "Trump has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. ranks last in the world in education among developed countries while spending the most per pupil.",
      "\"So they rank the top 40 countries in the world, we are ranked No. 40th, but we are ranked No. 1 in one department: cost per pupil,\" Trump said at the White House last month. \"So we spend more per pupil than any other country in the world, but we're ranked No. 40.\"",
      "This claim is not true based on data reviewed by ABC News. The U.S. is not ranked last in education nor does it spend the most per pupil.",
      "The White House didn't respond to ABC News' request for information about Trump's claim. It's unclear which data Trump used to base his claims.",
      "Even though the country spends a lot per pupil, the Education Data Initiative found an average of $20,387 per year of federal, state and local spending. The amount is the third-highest per pupil (after adjusting to local currency values). The country is not last in any education statistic that ABC News has reviewed.",
      "The U.S. is above average in reading and science, and about average when it comes to scores in math, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). PISA is the industry standard for ranking students from different countries, according to education experts. There are roughly 40 member countries and economies in the OECD and about 40 more countries have participated in the last three assessments. It varies by year -- in 2015, 70 countries and economies participated; in 2018, 78 participated.",
      "In 2022, the most recently released data, roughly 81 countries took part in OECD's PISA assessments, which measure 15-year-olds' ability to use their reading, mathematics and science knowledge. The U.S. ranked ninth out of 81 in reading, 16th/81 in science, and 34th/81 in math, according to the 2022 PISA results.",
      "The PISA results debunk Trump's long-standing claim that \"we're at the bottom of every list.\"",
      "The next PISA data collection is taking place in 2025 -- and is expected to be released in September 2026, according to an OECD spokesperson.",
      "However, this is not to say American students are always high achievers. Some results on nationally administered exams have shown concerns as of late.",
      "America's fourth- and eighth-grade students' sliding reading scores worsened in 2024, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, dubbed the nation's report card, which is administered by the National Center for Education Statistics under the Department of Education. Compared to 2022, this year's average reading scores dropped by 2 points for both fourth- and eighth-grade assessments, according to the NCES data conducted between January and March 2024. That adds to the 3-point decrease for both grades in 2022.",
      "Despite the decline in reading, there was some recovery in math in 2024, but the increase has not returned students to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "And NCES also found nearly one third of U.S. students ended the 2023-2024 school year behind grade level in at least one academic subject.",
      "It is unclear whether this data will be collected in future years if the DOE is eliminated.",
      "The Trump administration has stated that through cuts at the Department of Education, they want to return education to the states.",
      "\"The president wants to return education back to the states, empower those closest to the people to make these very important decisions for our children's lives. And ... this is a first step in that process,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said to ABC News' Selina Wang when asked about the cuts at the DOE.",
      "Education is a local level-issue already as the federal education department only administers roughly 10% of public school funds nationwide, according to multiple education experts.",
      "The Department of Education does not administer curriculum or create lessons for the nation's students. It also does not set requirements for enrollment and graduation or establish or accredit schools or universities.",
      "In fact, curriculum comes from the states and local school districts. The education department doesn't teach the students taking standardized exams and assessments. The states already do that.",
      "The education department does hold schools accountable for enforcing non-discrimination laws based on race, gender and disability.",
      "The agency also administers funds for K-12 education support programs such as the Rural Education Achievement Program, which supports rural districts that may lack personnel and resources; Title I, which funds programs aimed at improving the performance of low-income and low-achieving schools; and grants for Individuals with Disabilities including the Transition and Postsecondary Programs for students.",
      "Not only does the department administer K-12 assistance, it also helps students pursue higher education through the office of Federal Student Aid through grants, work-study funds and low-interest loans.",
      "Finally, the DOE holds schools accountable for student achievement through the Every Student Succeeds Act, which requires each state to provide data on subject performance, graduation rates, suspensions, absenteeism, teacher qualifications and more.",
      "The Education Department's mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access, according to ed.gov.",
      "Trump has claimed, without evidence, that many Department of Education employees weren't going to work or doing a good job.",
      "\"Many of them don't work at all. Many of them never showed up to work. Many of them, many of them never showed up to work,\" Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.",
      "The White House did not respond to ABC News' request for comment about where Trump got this information.",
      "Based on dozens of interviews, ABC News reporting has not found any evidence of employees \"never\" showing up to work, as Trump claimed.",
      "ABC News has spoken to employees tasked with everything from conducting critical research projects to enforcing anti-discrimination laws for students based on race, gender and disability, among other characteristics.",
      "When the Department of Education cut nearly 50% of its workforce earlier this week, an email to those who remained employed said, \"Please know that these decisions were not made lightly, and in no way reflect on the dedication and hard work of those who are leaving.\"",
      "Joe Murphy, whose position as a management and data analyst was eliminated at the Department of Education earlier this week, said on Wednesday that he felt \"disposable.\"",
      "\"We got the sense that we were disposable in a certain sense, especially those of us in the data space,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Victoria DeLano was an Equal Opportunity Specialist in the education department's Office for Civil Rights serving people with disabilities. DeLano said she believes she was the sole employee within the OCR who was stationed in Alabama.",
      "\"It's horrifying that the Office for Civil Rights, to begin with, is understaffed, but then, when I was locked out of access to work last week, to think, OK, one more person that was taken out of the equation,\" Delano said.",
      "\"These students have no one else. They can still file complaints with OCR. Please understand OCR is understaffed at best, and OCR right now does not have external communication with you all. So I don't know where they turn,\" she added.",

      "The president made a rare visit to Department of Justice headquarters.",
      "When President Donald Trump spoke to employees of the Department of Justice Friday afternoon, he addressed many of the lawyers tasked with defending his policies in court across more than 120 lawsuits.",
      "For some of those attorneys it's been a challenging week, as judges in several cases have appeared skeptical of the government's arguments.",
      "While defending policies like the government's mass layoffs or the Pentagon's transgender service member ban, a number of DOJ attorneys have found themselves at a loss for words when trying to answer the questions asked of them.",
      "\"So, people with gender dysphoria can't be honest, humble, or have integrity. You think that's demeaning to people with gender dysphoria?\" U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes asked a DOJ attorney on Wednesday during a hearing on the service member ban.",
      "\"I can't answer that question,\" he responded.",
      "Reyes later rebuked each of the DOJ lawyers after they admitted that none of them had read any of the scientific studies used to support the ban in sworn court filings.",
      "During a contentious hearing in Maryland on Wednesday about Trump's mass firings -- which eventually led the judge overseeing the case to order approximately 20,000 government employees be reinstated -- a DOJ lawyer couldn't answer when a judge pressed him to confirm how many employees had been terminated.",
      "\"More than 50 or less than 50? ... More than 100 or less than 100? ... Less than 1,000?\" Judge James Bredar asked, to which the attorney replied that he couldn't make an estimate at that time.",
      "\"You don't know? ... Does anyone in the government know?\" the judge continued to press, only for the government's attorney to again say he doesn't know.",
      "For a hearing on an emergency order to block an executive order against the law firm Perkins Coie, the Department of Justice opted to send Chad Mizelle, Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff, to argue on behalf of the government. Mizelle's full-throated defense of the policy -- which bans lawyers from the firm from entering any government building -- led Judge Beryl Howell to remark that the sweeping nature of some of his arguments sent \"chills down my spine.\"",
      "\"When you say that if the president, in his view, takes the position that an individual or an organization or a company is operating a way that is not in the nation's interests, he can issue an executive order like this and take steps to bar that individual, that entity, that company from doing any business with the government, terminate whatever contracts, they've got, bar them from federal buildings?\" Howell said.",
      "\"I mean, that's a pretty extraordinary power for the president to exercise,\" the judge said.",
      "\"If he made a finding that there's a national security risk with a particular law firm, then yes,\" Mizelle replied.",
      "During Friday's address at the Justice Department, Trump alleged, without presenting evidence, that media organizations and the Democratic Party were colluding to challenge his administration -- and he urged the lawyers to fight back.",
      "\"They are horrible people. They are scum,\" Trump said of those who oppose him in court. \"We will have these cases where you cannot allow yourselves to be deflected. You just cannot let it happen. You have such a higher calling.\"",
      "Trump's visit to DOJ headquarters, during which he laid out his vision for the department and repeatedly suggested his appointees should jail his political enemies, was a departure from decades of post-Watergate norms where DOJ leadership has sought to maintain an appearance of independence from the White House on criminal matters.",

      "\"He was surrounded by many DHS agents, or people he believed to be DHS agents, and he believes that he saw or heard, during a call, one of them say that the White House wants an update on what's going on,\" Samah Sisay, a staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights who is representing Khalil, said at a press conference Friday.",
      "\"We have every reason to believe, as we allege in the petition, that many people within the executive branch of the government were involved, including the White House,\" Sisay said.",
      "Khalil took part in student protests at Columbia University calling for the institution to divest and cut ties with Israel, and he participated in negotiations with university administration.",
      "\"His one and only goal was to get Columbia University to divest from its complicity with Israeli government crimes in Gaza and the West Bank,\" said Ramzi Kassem, the director of CLEAR, a group representing Khalil.",
      "The White House and Columbia University did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "Columbia University said in a statement Thursday, \"We will continue to work to support our community, including protecting the privacy of our students, during this challenging time and we remain steadfastly committed to our values and our mission.\"",
      "The Trump administration has claimed that Khalil distributed \"pro-Hamas propaganda fliers with the logo of Hamas,\" without providing evidence.",
      "\"I have those fliers on my desk, they were provided to me by the Department of Homeland Security,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "\"All of this talk of flyers is just nonsense, there is no truth to it whatsoever,\" Kassem said.",
      "Khalil's attorneys said their briefing on the motion to compel the government to return Khalil to New York should be finished by early next week. His attorneys hope the judge will make a decision sometime next week.",
      "\"Mahmoud was moved across multiple state lines and subsequently transferred to a remote prison in Louisiana hours after filing his habeas petition, an intentional and retaliatory act and an attempt to interfere with the jurisdiction of the New York court,\" Sisay said.",
      "In the weeks leading up to his arrest, Khalil said he had been fearing for his safety as he and other Columbia University students advocating for the rights of Palestinians experienced increased doxing and harassment, his attorneys said.",
      "\"It's like an almost daily occurrence where Twitter, social media posts showing photographs of students, identifying where they're located, where they live, who they're associated with, while tagging ICE, while tagging DHS, while tagging the president, tagging the Secretary of State,\" Amy Greer, an attorney with Dratel & Lewis who is representing Khalil, said Friday.",
      "\"He's genuinely fearful that what's happened to him will happen to others,\" Greer said.",
      "Khalil's attorneys accused the Trump administration of retaliating against Khalil for his protests and activism in support of Palestinians arguing his speech is protected by the First Amendment.",
      "\"The Trump administration is taking an extraordinarily broad and unconstitutional view of how the material support for terrorism laws apply in these contexts,\" Brian Hauss, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU, said at the press conference.",
      "\"The Supreme Court was very clear in a case called Holder vs Humanitarian Law Project that the federal material supported terrorism laws do not apply to independent advocacy, even when that advocacy is explicitly supportive of a foreign designated terrorist organization, say a statement saying, 'I support Hamas,' if that statement is not coordinated with a foreign designated terrorist organization it is protected by the First Amendment,\" Hauss said.",
      "The First Amendment also protects the freedom of speech of individuals who are not American citizens, Hauss said. Khalil is a permanent resident of the U.S.",
      "\"Trump administration is punishing Mr. Khalil for his speech about Palestine. It is silencing him, and it is setting him up as an example to chill the millions of green card holders and other non-citizens around the country from saying anything that might draw President Trump's ire. That is textbook First Amendment retaliation,\" Hauss said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on X that the department \"will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",
      "Khalil's attorneys have denied that Khalil has any ties to Hamas and said his activism has been in support of Palestinian rights.",
      "Hauss added, \"If the administration can do this to Mr. Khalil because of his speech about Palestine, it can do it to any non-citizen who takes a position on hot button global issues, including the war between Russia and Ukraine, the tariffs being imposed against U.S. allies, or the rise of far right political parties in Europe.\"",
      "DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Khalil was detained by ICE \"in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism.\"",
      "\"Khalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,\" McLaughlin said in a statement Sunday night.",

      "The high-stakes race for Wisconsin Supreme Court has gotten most of the attention leading up to the April 1 election",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The high-stakes race for Wisconsin Supreme Court has gotten most of the attention leading up to the April 1 election. But it is not the only issue voters will decide when early voting begins Tuesday.",
      "Also on the ballot is a race for the battleground state's top education official who will guide policies affecting K-12 schools during President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "There is also a measure that would place the state's voter ID law into the state constitution.",
      "Both of those contests have sharp partisan divisions, even though the spending and national attention have been far less than those for the race for control of the state's highest court.",
      "Here is a closer look at what's at stake as voting begins Tuesday:",
      "The race to lead the state education department pits the teachers' union-backed incumbent, Jill Underly, against consultant Brittany Kinser, a supporter of the private school voucher program who is endorsed by Republicans.",
      "A third candidate lost the February primary, unable to chip away enough at Underly's key support. The day after her victory, the state teachers' union, which did not endorse in the primary, came out in support of Underly.",
      "Underly's education career began in 1999 as a high school social studies teacher in Indiana. She moved to Wisconsin in 2005 and worked five years for the state education department. She also worked as principal of Pecatonica Elementary School for a year before becoming the district administrator.",
      "Underly was elected as state superintendent in 2021 and is endorsed by the Wisconsin Education Association Council, which is the state teachers union, as well as the Wisconsin Democratic Party and numerous Democratic officeholders.",
      "Kinser, who is backed by the Wisconsin Republican Party, touts her past as a public school principal in her first television ad. But she doesn't mention it was a charter school. She worked for Rocketship schools, part of a national network of public charter schools and became its executive director in the Milwaukee region.",
      "In 2022, she left Rocketship to work for City Forward Collective, a Milwaukee education nonprofit that advocates for charter and voucher schools. She also founded a consulting firm that year where she currently works.",
      "Wisconsin is the only state where voters elect the top education official, but there is no state board of education. That gives the person who runs the Department of Public Instruction broad authority to oversee education policy, which includes dispersing money to schools and managing teacher licensing.",
      "Kinser has tried to brand Underly as being a poor manager of the Department of Public Instruction. She has keyed in on Underly's overhaul of state achievement standards last year.",
      "Underly said they better reflect what students are learning now, but bipartisan opposition included Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who served as state superintendent before being elected governor in 2018. Evers has not endorsed in the race.",
      "Kinser said the new standards lowered the bar for students and made it more difficult to see how schools and districts are performing over time.",
      "Underly tries to portray Kinser as nothing more than a lobbyist who doesn't care about public education. Kinser supports the state's private school voucher and charter school program, which Democrats and Underly are critical of. Opponents say those programs siphon money away from public schools.",
      "\u201cInstead of fighting for students, Kinser is standing with the far-right politicians who are trying to rip resources away from our schools,\" Underly said.",
      "Underly, who casts herself as the champion of public schools, also has tried to make the possible elimination of the U.S. Department of Education an issue in the race.",
      "Underly opposes dismantling the federal agency, while Kinser has said as long as the state continues to receive federal education funding, \u201cI am confident in our ability to navigate whatever changes Washington sends our way.\u201d",
      "Wisconsin\u2019s photo ID requirement for voting would be elevated from a state law to a constitutional amendment under a proposal on the ballot.",
      "Even if voters reject it, the voter ID requirement that has been in state law since 2011 will remain in place. The law didn't go into effect permanently until 2016, after a series of unsuccessful lawsuits.",
      "Republicans put the measure on the ballot, pitching it as a way to bolster election security and protect the law from being overturned in court.",
      "But Democratic opponents argue photo ID requirements are often enforced unfairly, making it more difficult for people of color, the disabled and poor people to vote.",
      "If voters agree to place the photo ID requirement in the constitution, it would make it more difficult for a future Legislature controlled by Democrats to change a law they have long opposed. Any constitutional amendment must be approved in two consecutive legislative sessions and by a statewide vote of the people.",
      "Wisconsin is one of nine states where voters must present a photo ID to cast a ballot and its requirement is the strictest in the country, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Thirty-six states have laws requiring or requesting that voters show some sort of identification at the polls, according to the conference."

      "Sunday's parade dates back to the turn of the 20th century and marks both St. Patrick\u2019s Day and Evacuation Day, which commemorates the day in 1776 when British troops left Boston after a protracted siege during the Revolutionary War.",
      "The 3.5-mile (5.6-kilometer) parade rolls through the neighborhood South Boston, a center of Irish-American heritage in a city where more than 1 in every 5 people are of Irish descent. The South Boston Allied War Veterans Council organizes the parade and this year\u2019s chief marshal is retired Navy Lt. Cmdr. Alanna Devlin Ball, who grew up in the neighborhood and represented the U.S. at the 2023 Invictus Games in Germany where she took home gold in powerlifting.",
      "\u201cLt. Cdr. Devlin Ball\u2019s 12 years career in the Navy serves as an inspiration to young women who seek to serve in today\u2019s military. We are grateful for her service, sacrifice and power of example,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Stephen Lynch, a South Boston native.",
      "The parade is scheduled to kick off slightly earlier in the morning than normal. Last year\u2019s events were marred by violence and public intoxication that officials say they hope to curb on Sunday.",
      "The goal of the parade is \u201ckeeping alive the tradition of honoring heritage and service,\u201d the war veterans council said in a statement.",
      "The parade also has been a source of political controversy in years past. The South Boston Allied War Veterans Council banned gay rights groups from marching in the parade up until a decade ago and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling upheld that right in the 1990s.",
      "Two gay and lesbian groups joined the parade in 2015. Organizers for one of the groups, Boston Pride, heralded the move as a point of progress at the time.",
      "Chicago held its St. Patrick's Day parade on Saturday. Philadelphia also celebrates on Sunday and New York City holds its parade Monday.",

      "It\u2019s a local threat to some and a full-on invasion to President Donald Trump",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Debates over President Donald Trump\u2019s hardline migration policies are focused on the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, to some a ruthless transnational criminal organization and to others the pretext for an overhyped anti-migrant narrative.",
      "Trump labeled the Tren de Aragua an invading force on Saturday when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a little-used authority from 1798 that allows the president to deport any noncitizen during wartime. Hours later, the Trump administration transferred hundreds of immigrants to El Salvador even as a federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations. Flights were in the air when the ruling came down.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act requires a president to declare the United States at war, giving him extraordinary powers to detain or remove foreigners to whom immigration or criminal laws otherwise protect. It had been used only three times \u2014 the last time to justify the detention of Japanese-American civilians during World War II.",
      "The Trump administration has not identified the more than 200 immigrants deported, provided any evidence they are in fact members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crimes in the United States.",
      "From the heartland to major cities like New York and Chicago, the gang has been blamed for sex trafficking, drug smuggling and police shootings, as well as the exploitation of the nearly 1 million Venezuelan migrants have crossed into the U.S. in recent years. Trump told Congress this month that a Venezuelan migrant found guilty of murdering 22-year-old nursing student Laken Riley on the University of Georgia campus was a member of the gang.",
      "The size of the gang is unclear as is the extent to which its actions are coordinated across state lines and national borders.",
      "The Venezuelan gang entered U.S. political discourse after footage from a security camera surfaced on social media last summer showing heavily armed men entering an apartment in the Denver suburb of Aurora shortly before a fatal shooting outside. In response, Trump vowed to \u201c liberate Aurora \u201d from Venezuelans he falsely said were \u201ctaking over the whole town.\u201d",
      "The city initially downplayed concerns. But most of the apartment complex was closed under an emergency order last month after officials said they suspected Tren de Aragua members in the kidnapping and assault of two residents.",
      "Most of the men seen in the video have been arrested, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement accusing them of gang membership.",
      "The Tren, which means \u201ctrain\u201d in Spanish, traces its origin more than a decade ago to an infamously lawless prison with hardened criminals in the central state of Aragua. It has expanded in recent years as more than 8 million Venezuelans fled economic turmoil under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s rule and migrated to other parts of Latin America or the U.S.",
      "Countries such as Peru and Colombia \u2014 all with large populations of Venezuelan migrants \u2014 have accused the group of being behind a spree of violence in a region that has long had some of the highest murder rates in the world. Some of its crimes have spread panic in poor neighborhoods, where the gang extorts local businesses and illegally charges residents for \u201cprotection.\u201d",
      "The gang operates as a loose network in the U.S. Tattoos, which are commonly used by Central American gangs, aren't required for those affiliated with the Tren, said Ronna Risquez, a Venezuelan journalist who wrote a 2023 book about the gang\u2019s origins.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump he took steps to designate the gang a \u201cforeign terrorist organization\u201d alongside several Mexican drug cartels. The Biden administration had sanctioned the gang and offered $12 million in rewards for the arrest of three of its leaders.",
      "Trump\u2019s executive order Saturday accused the gang of working closely with top Maduro officials \u2014 most notably the former vice president and one-time governor of Aragua state, Tareck El Aissami, \u2014 to infiltrate migration flows, flood the U.S. with cocaine and plot against the country.",
      "\u201cThe result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States,\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order alleged.",
      "Wes Tabor, who headed the Drug Enforcement Administration's office in Venezuela when the gang first came onto law enforcement radar, said Trump's decision to give the DEA and other federal agencies authority to carry out immigrant arrests is a \u201cforce multiplier\u201d that will curtail the Tren's activities in the U.S.",
      "Tabor said authorities need to build a robust database like it did when combating El Salvador's MS-13 containing biometric data, arrest information and intelligence from foreign law enforcement partners.",
      "\u201cWe have to use a hammer on an ant because if we don\u2019t it will get out of control,\u201d said Tabor. \u201cWe need to smash it now.\u201d",
      "In Venezuela, officials originally expressed bafflement at the U.S. interest in the Tren, claiming it had dismantled the gang after retaking control of the prison where the group was born.",
      "As Trump's immigration crackdown has intensified, they've conditioned their cooperation with U.S. deportation flights on progress in other areas in the long-strained bilateral relationship.",
      "Last month, authorities gave a hero's welcome to some 190 Venezuelan migrants deported by Trump, accusing the U.S. of spreading an \"ill-intentioned\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d narrative about the Tren in the U.S. They said most Venezuelan immigrants are decent, hard-working people and that U.S. officials were looking to stigmatize the South American nation.",
      "Over the weekend they protested the use of Trump\u2019s invocation of the wartime rules, likening it to the \u201cdarkest episodes in human history, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps.\u201d"

      "ATLANTA -- A judge has ordered Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to pay more than $54,000 in attorneys' fees and to turn over documents after finding that her office violated Georgia's Open Records Act.",
      "Attorney Ashleigh Merchant represents former Trump campaign staffer Michael Roman, one of the 18 people indicted in August 2023 along with President Donald Trump on allegations that they illegally tried to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss in Georgia. Merchant sued in January 2024, alleging that the district attorney's office had failed to turn over public records she had requested.",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Rachel Krause found that the failures to comply with the records law \u201cwere intentional, not done in good faith, and were substantially groundless and vexatious.\u201d Because Willis and her office \u201clacked substantial justification\u201d for not complying, Merchant is entitled to attorneys' fees and litigation expenses totaling just over $54,000, Krause found.",
      "Krause ordered Willis to search for and turn over all records responsive to Merchant's requests. The documents and payment are to be delivered within 30 days of Friday's order.",
      "A spokesperson for Willis' office said Monday that they plan to appeal the order.",
      "Merchant posted Krause's order on the social media platform X, writing, \u201cProud that we have judges willing to hold people in power accountable when they ignore the law!!!!\u201d",
      "Willis' office was \u201copenly hostile\u201d to Merchant and testimony showed that Merchant's requests \u201cwere handled differently than other requests,\u201d Krause wrote in her order. Open records officer Dexter Bond said during a hearing that he refused to communicate by phone with Merchant, even though it was his regular practice to call the requester if a request was unclear.",
      "Treating Merchant's requests this way \u201cindicates a lack of good faith,\u201d Krause wrote.",
      "Among the records Merchant sought were reports provided to Willis' office by companies hired \u201cto track the impact of Willis' statements to the media and whether such statements were viewed favorably by the public,\u201d according to a court filing. The filing says Willis began contracting with those companies just before she and her office sought to indict Trump, Roman and others.",
      "Merchant also asked for a copy of the non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement that employees of the district attorney's office are required to sign, as well as a list of attorneys Willis had hired.",
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals in December ruled that Willis and her office could not continue to prosecute the election interference case against Trump and others. Willis in January asked the Georgia Supreme Court to review and reverse that ruling, and the high court has not yet said whether it will take up the case.",
      "The intermediate appeals court's ruling was based on an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d created by a romantic relationship Willis had with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she had hired to lead the case. It was a bombshell filing by Merchant in January 2024 that first exposed that relationship publicly, alleging that the relationship created a conflict of interest that should disqualify Willis and her office from the case.",
      "A grand jury in Atlanta indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023, using the state\u2019s anti-racketeering law to accuse them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn Trump\u2019s narrow 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia. The alleged scheme included Trump\u2019s call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger urging him to help find enough votes to beat Biden. Four people have pleaded guilty. Trump and the others, including Roman, have pleaded not guilty.",
      "Even if the Georgia Supreme Court agrees to hear the case and eventually rules in Willis\u2019 favor, it seems unlikely that she will be able to prosecute Trump while he's the sitting president. But there are 14 other defendants, including Roman, who still face charges in the case."

      "CHINO HILLS, Calif. -- The recent desecration of an iconic Hindu temple in Southern California with anti-Hindu and anti-Indian government graffiti has heightened concerns among South Asian groups following a slew of such incidents over the past year.",
      "Devotees who arrived early morning on March 8 at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Chino Hills were shocked to find the words \u201cHindustan Murdabad,\u201d which means \u201cdeath to\u201d or \u201cdown with\u201d Hindus and India, scrawled on a pink stone sign bearing the temple\u2019s name, said Mehul Patel, a volunteer with the organization.",
      "Expletive-laden graffiti targeting India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi was written on one of the outer brick walls and abutting sidewalk, he said. San Bernardino Sheriff\u2019s officials have said they are investigating the incident as a hate crime and have not identified any suspects yet.",
      "Patel said the incident \u201cinvoked a sense of fear\u201d among community members. The impact was felt as far away as India, where most major media outlets reported the incident, and India's External Affairs ministry condemned the vandalism.",
      "\u201cWe condemn such despicable acts in the strongest terms,\u201d said ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal. \"We call upon the local law enforcement authorities to take stringent action against those responsible for these acts, and also ensure adequate security to places of worship.\u201d",
      "Patel said the vandalized temple had nearly 1,000 visitors every day, with thousands of people gathering during Diwali and temple festivals.",
      "\u201cWe do have security protocols in place, but such a violation still makes you think twice about how safe you really are, especially if you have young children,\" Patel said.",
      "The majestic temple, the largest in California, sits on a 20-acre lot along a freeway, its arches and domes carved out of pink sandstone and interior decked with white Italian marble. In October 2023, the organization built in Robbinsville, New Jersey, the largest Hindu temple outside India in the modern era. The Swaminarayan sect, a branch of Hinduism, oversees more than 1,300 temples and 5,000 centers around the world, according to the group's website.",
      "This is not the first time the global Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha, known as BAPS, has been hit by vandals. The organization\u2019s temple in Melville, New York, was tagged with similar writing on Sept. 16. Nine days later, their temple near Sacramento was hit, and there was also an incident at the Newark, California, temple in December 2023. Those incidents are also being investigated as hate crimes.",
      "The denigration of Modi, under whom Hindu nationalism has surged in India, appears to be a common thread in these vandalism incidents across the country. Other non-BAPS Hindu temples in the U.S. have also been attacked recently. In Hayward, California, Vijay\u2019s Sherawali Temple, dedicated to the Hindu Goddess Durga and run by a family of immigrants from Fiji, was vandalized in January 2024 with graffiti calling Modi a \u201cterrorist\u201d and with the words \u201cKhalistan Zindabad\u201d (Long live Khalistan).",
      "Khalistan is the name by which Sikh separatists refer to a sovereign state they hope to create in Indian state of Punjab, birthplace of Sikhism. A violent Khalistani insurgency in India was quelled by the government in 1984; India has declared it a terrorist movement. Activists in the diaspora are currently holding a nonbinding referendum across the United States to create an independent Khalistan; voting will take place in Los Angeles on March 23.",
      "In the summer of 2023, tensions escalated between India and Canada over allegations by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the Indian government had a hand in the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen who was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Columbia. In November 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice stated that an Indian government official plotted to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist leader, in New York who is spearheading the Khalistan referendum. In August, the FBI opened an investigation into a drive-by shooting that targeted Satinder Pal Singh Raju, a close associate of Nijjar, in Yolo County, California.",
      "The temple vandalism incidents in Northern California last year were condemned by local Sikh groups. Sikhs in the diaspora and in India are divided on the issue of Khalistan.",
      "Immediately after the incident in Southern California, the Coalition of Hindus of North America posted on X raising the possibility of a connection between the tagging incident and the upcoming Khalistan referendum in Los Angeles. Pushpita Prasad, a spokesperson for the group, said Thursday that regardless of who committed the crime, \u201cthis repeated assault on the freedom of Hindus to gather in their place of worship is unacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe go to a place of worship to find solace,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that place becomes a target, how do you find solace there?\u201d",
      "Prasad called for a robust discussion on what is driving these attacks against Hindu temples and acknowledge that anti-Hindu hate exists. She called for treating Hindu places of worship equally.",
      "Another South Asian group pointed out the perils of jumping to conclusions about perpetrators of a crime before an investigation has concluded. Without evidence, such assumptions only serve to further divide communities, said Prachi Patankar, board member of the interfaith Savera Coalition. Her group represents Indian Americans who are Hindu, Sikh, Muslim, Dalit or the people formerly regarded as \u201cuntouchables\u201d in the caste system, and those unaffiliated with religion.",
      "\u201cSuch incidents should never be used to scapegoat other minority religious communities such as the Sikh community, because it can lead to further criminalization or repression of the entire community,\u201d she said.",
      "Patel said it is important for the public to understand that Hindus are not a monolith and the Chino Hills temple is a nonprofit that does not represent any single government, leader or country.",
      "\u201cWe are a Hindu temple in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are Indian Americans. But people who are not of Indian origin who practice Hinduism worship here as well.\u201d",
      "He hopes surveillance video, which showed two suspects in the act of scoping the area and tagging the property, will help apprehend them.",
      "Members of the organization gathered in front of their temple on March 9 where a priest chanted the \u201cShanthi Path,\u201d a blessing and prayer for peace.",
      "\u201cWe prayed not just for our community, but also for the perpetrators,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWe believe in the right of people to express themselves, but to get their message out in a peaceful and not in a hateful way.\u201d",

      "For parents of kids with disabilities, advocating for their child can be complicated, time-consuming \u2014 and expensive",
      "WASHINGTON -- For parents of kids with disabilities, advocating for their child can be complicated, time-consuming \u2014 and expensive.",
      "Changes at the Education Department are likely to make the process even more difficult, advocates for kids with disabilities say.",
      "When a parent believes their child is not receiving proper services or school accommodations for a disability, they can seek remedies from their district. They can file complaints with their state, arguing the child's rights have been taken away without due process of law, or even pursue litigation in state or federal courts.",
      "Those processes often involve multiple sessions with hearing officers who are not required to be experts in disability law. Legal fees can cost tens of thousands of dollars for a single case. Legal aid and other advocacy organizations that can provide free assistance often have more demand for their services than they can meet.",
      "But filing a complaint with the Education Department has long been an option for families who can't afford a lawyer. They begin by filling out the Office for Civil Rights' online form, documenting the alleged instances of discrimination. From there, the agency's staff is supposed to investigate the complaint, often interviewing school district employees and examining district policies for broader possible violations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s known and has the weight of the federal government behind it,\u201d said Dan Stewart, managing attorney for education and employment at the National Disability Rights Network. \u201cThe process, the complaint portal, as well as the processing manual are all in public, and it does not require or typically involve lawyers.\u201d",
      "That option seems increasingly out of reach, advocates say.",
      "Under President Donald Trump, the Education Department\u2019s staff has been cut approximately in half \u2014 including in the Office for Civil Rights, whose attorneys are charged with investigating complaints of discrimination against kids with disabilities. The staff has been directed to prioritize antisemitism cases. More than 20,000 pending cases \u2014 including those related to kids with disabilities, historically the largest share of the office\u2019s work \u2014 largely sat idle for weeks after Trump took office. A freeze on processing the cases was lifted early this month, but advocates question whether the department can make progress on them with a smaller staff.",
      "\u201cThe reduction in force is simply an evisceration of the Office for Civil Rights\u2019 investigatory authority and responsibility,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that I can see that OCR can keep up with the backlog or with the incoming complaints.\u201d",
      "A federal lawsuit filed Friday challenges the layoffs at the Office for Civil Rights, saying they decimated the office's ability to process and investigate complaints.",
      "While the OCR process was not perfect, reducing the office\u2019s investigative staff will only worsen the challenges families face when seeking support for their kids, said Nikki Carter, an advocate for kids with disabilities and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cIt makes them feel hopeless and helpless,\u201d Carter said. \u201cBy reducing the number of employees to handle cases, by putting stipulations on certain cases, it only makes it feel intensified.\u201d",
      "Education Department officials insist the staff reductions will not affect civil rights investigations and the layoffs were \u201cstrategic decisions.\u201d",
      "In her state of Alabama, Carter said families face an uphill battle to finding legal representation.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t have the money for an attorney,\u201d she said. \u201cOr the representation they\u2019re getting is not the representation they feel like will be best for their child.\u201d",
      "Even if families can afford the high costs, a limited number of attorneys have the expertise to take on disability discrimination cases. Programs that offer free representation often have limited capacity.",
      "If the backlog of cases increases at the federal Office for Civil Rights, families may lose faith in how quickly the department will investigate their complaints, Stewart said. That may drive them to alternate pathways, such as filing state complaints.",
      "But state and local agencies haven't always had the capacity or understanding to handle education disability complaints, Stewart said, since those cases so often went to the U.S. Education Department.",
      "\u201cThey might not have the infrastructure or the knowledge or the staffing to take on the influx of cases,\u201d Stewart said.",
      "In a separate federal lawsuit filed Thursday, Democratic attorneys general argued the staff reductions at the Education Department may embolden school districts to ignore complaints of discrimination or harassment.",
      "\u201cStudents with current complaints will likely see no meaningful resolution, with cases backlogged due to the shortage of employees to resolve them,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cStudents facing discrimination, sexual harassment or sexual assault will lose a critical avenue to report their case.\u201d",

      "Morris resigned last year as pastor of Gateway Church in the Dallas suburb of Southlake after a woman accused him of sexually abusing her in the 1980s.",
      "The alleged abuse started in 1982 when the victim, referred to in the indictment as C.C., was 12 years old and Morris was a traveling evangelist staying in Hominy, Oklahoma, with her family, according to the attorney general\u2019s office. The abuse allegedly continued for four years.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The State Department says South Africa\u2019s ambassador to the United States, who was declared \u201cpersona non grata\u201d last week, has until Friday to leave the country.",
      "After Secretary of State Marco Rubio determined that Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool was no longer welcome in the U.S. and posted his decision Friday on social media, South African embassy staff were summoned to the State Department and given a formal diplomatic note explaining the decision, the department said.",
      "\u201cWe made the embassy aware that Ambassador Rasool has been found unacceptable by the United States to be a representative of his country,\u201d the State Department said.",
      "It said Rasool\u2019s diplomatic privileges and immunities expired Monday and that he would be required to leave the United States by Friday. It was not clear if he was in the U.S. now.",
      "Rubio announced his decision in a post on X as he was flying back to the United States from a Group of 7 foreign ministers meeting in Canada. In it, he accused Rasool of being a \u201crace-baiting politician\u201d who hates President Donald Trump.",
      "His post linked to a story by the conservative Breitbart news site about a talk Rasool gave earlier Friday in Johannesburg as part of a South African think tank\u2019s webinar. Rasool spoke about actions taken by the Trump administration in the context of a United States where white people soon would no longer be in the majority.",
      "Rasool was speaking by videoconference, and it was not clear if he was in South Africa, the United States or elsewhere.",
      "It is highly unusual for the U.S. to expel a foreign ambassador, although lower-ranking diplomats are more frequently targeted with persona non grata status.",
      "Rubio's decision was the latest Trump administration move targeting South Africa. Trump signed an executive order last month halting funding to the country. It criticized the Black-led South African government on multiple fronts, saying it is pursuing anti-white policies at home and supporting \u201cbad actors\u201d in the world like the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Iran.",
      "A statement last week from the office of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said it had \u201cnoted the regrettable expulsion\u201d of Rasool and called on its diplomatic officials \u201cto maintain the established diplomatic decorum in their engagement with the matter.\u201d",
      "\u201cSouth Africa remains committed to building a mutually beneficial relationship with the United States of America,\u201d the statement said."

      "CHICAGO -- Federal immigration agents violated the rights of 22 people, including a U.S. citizen, in immigration enforcement arrests during the first weeks of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, Chicago activists and attorneys alleged Monday.",
      "The arrests allegedly violate a 2022 agreement between Chicago groups and the federal government detailing how U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement officers can make \u201c collateral arrests,\u201d where agents detain others besides those being targeted. The agreement, following a lawsuit over 2018 immigration sweeps, covers Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky and Wisconsin, which are under the ICE office in Chicago.",
      "\u201cEvery time you hear from this administration about how they're rounding up gang members, terrorists, the worst of the worst, you need to take a dose of reality,\" said Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center, said at a news conference. \"You need to dig deeper to understand who exactly they are arresting.\u201d",
      "The NIJC detailed alleged violations in a federal complaint filed last week on behalf of advocacy groups in Chicago. Among other things, the agreement says ICE agents can make a warrantless arrest only when they have evidence that an individual is likely to escape.",
      "The groups are seeking the release of two people who remain detained, sanctions against arresting officers and more transparency in how the agency conducts its operations, among other things.",
      "ICE declined comment Monday, citing pending litigation.",
      "Aggressive immigration enforcement has been central to the Trump administration's agenda, particularly in places such as Chicago that are often called sanctuary cities because they limit cooperation between federal immigration agents and local police. To send a message, the Trump administration gathered top immigration officials in Chicago in January to kick off an enforcement operation with cameras rolling live.",
      "But there have been limited details on how the arrests are taking place and what practices are being used.",
      "While the 2022 settlement applied only to six states, the new federal complaint could have nationwide implications. For instance, advocates in other states could join the effort .",
      "Of those arrested, one was deported, 19 were released on bond and one was a U.S. citizen who was released after being handcuffed for hours. Most in the complaint do not have criminal records aside from one person with a driving under the influence charge, according to attorneys.",
      "Those detained include Abel Orozco Ortega, a 47-year-old man who was arrested Jan. 26 while returning to his suburban Chicago home after getting tamales for his family. According to the complaint, ICE was actually looking for one of his sons in his 20s who has the same name. Ortega, who is in the U.S. illegally, remains detained in Indiana.",
      "Family members said Monday that Ortega has no criminal record. His wife has breast cancer, they said, and, they have struggled to make mortgage payments without him.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all human, we deserve to be treated as such,\u201d his son Eduardo Ortega, a U.S. citizen, said at a news conference.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has invoked the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II, granting himself sweeping powers under a centuries-old law to deport people associated with a Venezuelan gang",
      "President Donald Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II, granting himself sweeping powers under a centuries-old law to deport people associated with a Venezuelan gang. Hours later, a federal judge halted deportations under Trump's order.",
      "The act is a sweeping wartime authority that allows non-citizens to be deported without being given the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge.",
      "Trump repeatedly hinted during his campaign that he would declare extraordinary powers to confront illegal immigration and laid additional groundwork in a slew of executive orders on Jan. 20.",
      "His proclamation on Saturday identified Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang as an invading force. U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, blocked anyone from being deported under Trump's proclamation for two weeks and scheduled a Friday hearing to consider arguments.",
      "In 1798, with the U.S. preparing for what it believed would be a war with France, Congress passed a series of laws that increased the federal government's reach. Worried that immigrants could sympathize with the French, the Alien Enemies Act was created to give the president wide powers to imprison and deport non-citizens in time of war.",
      "Since then, the act has been used just three times: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "During World War II, with anti-foreigner fears sweeping the country, it was part of the legal rationale for mass internment in the U.S. of people of German, Italian and especially Japanese ancestry. An estimated 120,000 people with Japanese heritage, including those with U.S. citizenship, were incarcerated during the war.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward preemptively sued Trump late Friday in federal court in Washington, D.C., saying five Venezuelan men being held at an immigration detention center in Raymondville, Texas, were at \u201cimminent risk of removal\u201d under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg blocked their deportation, prompting an immediate appeal from the Justice Department.",
      "Almost simultaneously, the Trump administration agreed to pay El Salvador $6 million to imprison about 300 alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang for one year.",
      "The agreement with El Salvador followed discussions between that country\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio about housing migrants in El Salvador\u2019s notorious prisons. Bukele\u2019s government has arrested more than 84,000 people, sometimes without due process, since 2022 in a crackdown on gang violence.",
      "ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said two flights Saturday may have carried people deported under Trump's proclamation, one to El Salvador and one possibly to Honduras. Boasberg said any such flights would have to be returned midair to the United States.",
      "For years, Trump and his allies have argued that America is facing an \u201cinvasion\u201d of people arriving illegally. Arrests on the U.S. border with Mexico topped 2 million a year for two straight years for the first time under President Joe Biden, with many released into the U.S. to pursue asylum. After hitting an all-time monthly high of 250,000 in December 2023, they plunged to less than 8,400 this February \u2014 the lowest levels since the 1960s.",
      "The act, Trump said in his inaugural address, would be a key tool in his immigration crackdown.",
      "\u201cBy invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil,\u201d he said. \u201cAs commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions.\u201d",
      "Critics say Trump is wrongly using the act to target non-state actors, not foreign governments.",
      "\u201cInvoking it in peacetime to bypass conventional immigration law would be a staggering abuse,\u201d the Brennan Center for Justice wrote, calling it \u201cat odds with centuries of legislative, presidential, and judicial practice.\u201d",
      "\u201cSummary detentions and deportations under the law conflict with contemporary understandings of equal protection and due process,\u201d the Brennan Center said.",
      "It's a new and untested argument. Trump has warned of the power of Latin American criminal gangs in the U.S., but only a tiny percentage of the people living illegally in the U.S. are criminals.",
      "Trump, in his wartime declaration on Saturday, said Tren de Aragua \u201cis perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion of predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\u201d He said the gang was engaged in \u201cirregular warfare\u201d against the United States at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Tren de Aragua originated in an infamously lawless prison in the central state of Aragua and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation\u2019s economy came undone last decade.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration designated Tren de Aragua and seven other Latin American crime organizations as \u201cforeign terrorist organizations,\u201d upping pressure on cartels  operating in the U.S. and on anyone aiding them.",
      "Congress\u2019 research arm said in a report last month officials may use the foreign terrorist designations to argue the gang's activities in the U.S. amount to a limited invasion. \u201cThis theory appears to be unprecedented and has not been subject to judicial review,\u201d the Congressional Research Service said.",
      "The Venezuelan government has not typically taken its people back from the U.S., except on a few occasions. Over the past few weeks, about 350 people were deported to Venezuela, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",

      "The deadliest twister in recorded U.S. history struck 100 years ago Tuesday, touching down in southeastern Missouri and tearing up everything in its 219-mile (352-kilometer) path for nearly four hours through southern Illinois and into Indiana.",
      "It left 695 people dead and more than 2,000 injured, not counting the casualties from at least seven other twisters that the main storm spawned which spun off through Kentucky and into Alabama.",
      "Modern standards qualify the so-called Tri-State Tornado as an F5, a mile-wide funnel with wind speeds greater than 260 mph (418 kph).",
      "Perhaps the best evidence of its destructive handiwork was found on the Logan School grounds: A wooden board measuring 4 feet (1.22 meters) long by 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) wide driven so deeply into the trunk of a maple tree that it could hold the weight of a man.",

But the force that it took to put that pine board into that maple tree, it really puts it all in perspective,\u201d said Mary Riseling, coordinator of the six-day remembrance. \u201cTo have one item that was witness to the force of those winds, it\u2019s a story all its own.\u201d",
      "The atmospheric stew that gave birth to the ferocious cataclysm was literally a perfect storm.

      "The storm took out 40% of the city of Murphysboro, 97 miles (156 kilometers) southeast of St. Louis. Its 234 deaths were the most of any municipality, with entire neighborhoods flattened. Other towns were virtually obliterated, too, including Annapolis, Missouri; Gorham, Illinois; and Griffith, Indiana.",

      "To this day, the west side of Murphysboro is peppered with small backyard structures that were temporary quarters until families could rebuild larger homes at the front of their lots.",
      "Dozens of families who toughed it out remain in Murphysboro, Riseling said. Jackson County Historical Society President Laura Cates Duncan said the commemoration honors those who died but also celebrates the resilience of those who carried on.",

      "A report on Monday said U.S. retailers broadly saw weaker revenue last month than economists expected, but it may not have been quite as bad as it seemed on the surface.",

Excitement at the time was also building about policies coming from Trump to accelerate growth. To be sure, hiring still remains relatively healthy, and that could help keep the economy growing. But the talk about recession by itself could sap confidence.",

      "Virtually no one expects the Fed to make a move Wednesday. The central bank has been keeping rates steady so far this year, preferring to see how conditions play out. Earlier, heading into the end of last year, it had been cutting rates sharply in hopes of relaxing pressure on the U.S. economy after high inflation had slowed.",
      "Wall Street's focus will be on what Powell says about the rest of the year. Expectations are still high the Fed may cut its main interest rate at least two or three times in 2025. The risk of cutting interest rates too quickly or aggressively is that it could push up inflation. But keeping rates too high for too long could also create unnecessary pain for the economy by slowing borrowing and overall activity.",

      "Attorneys for the Greenpeace entities denied the allegations, saying there is no evidence, they had little or no involvement with the protests and the letter was signed by hundreds of organizations from dozens of countries, with no financial institution to testify the organization received, read or was influenced by the letter.",
      "Greenpeace representatives have said the lawsuit is an example of corporations abusing the legal system to go after critics and is a critical test of free speech and protest rights. An Energy Transfer spokesperson said the case is about Greenpeace not following the law, not free speech."

      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department on Monday announced the creation of a task force to investigate Hamas for its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel as well as potential civil rights violations and acts of antisemitism by anyone supporting the militant group.",
      "Agents and prosecutors participating in Joint Task Force October 7, or JTF 10-7, will investigate and look to bring charges against Hamas militants directly responsible for the rampage in southern Israel, the department said.",

      "The attack killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and Hamas took 251 hostages.

      "The new task force will take over those pending charges, the department said.",
      "The announcement of the task force comes as President Donald Trump has issued what he has called a \u201clast warning\u201d to Hamas to release all remaining hostages held in Gaza. His administration has targeted universities over a perceived failure to squelch antisemitism on campus as well as foreigners who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.",

      "Monday's announcement said the task force, made up of prosecutors and FBI officials, also will investigate civil rights violations and potential acts of terrorism by anyone providing support or financing to Hamas.",
      "It did not define what sort of support would be illegal, though federal law makes it a crime to provide material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations such as Hamas.",

She said that less wind on Sunday had helped crews get a handle on the fires but that more fire activity was expected this coming week.",
      "One of the largest fires in Texas currently had burned about 14 square miles (36 square kilometers) near Fredericksburg, west of Austin, but was 40% contained by Sunday, she said.",
      "The winds that swept across Texas and Oklahoma were so strong that they turned over several tractor-trailers. Authorities have said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm caused by high winds in the Texas Panhandle on Friday.",
      "After touring the damage in Stillwater and Mannford, a city of about 3,000 located about 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of Tulsa, on Saturday, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt went on to survey the damage at his ranch outside of Oklahoma City, where his home there had burned to the ground.",

      "Boston\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day has long been known for a boozy good time",
      "BOSTON -- Tommy McCarthy\u2019s Irish bar just outside Boston\u2019s city limits pours more Guinness than almost anywhere in the U.S., yet come this St. Patrick's Day, the longtime owner of The Burren is stocking up on plenty of nonalcoholic options too.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s come a long way since we first opened,\u201d McCarthy said, who started slinging pints at the beloved establishment in 1996 after moving to the Boston area from West Clare, Ireland.",
      "There is perhaps no other holiday tied more to a city than St. Patrick's Day in Boston. According to historians, the city was the first in the country to throw a celebration for the patron saint of Ireland on March 17, 1737, as a way to support the city's wave of Irish immigrants.",
      "Yet while the holiday has become connected to heavy drinking over the centuries, a small but growing crowd has found ways to participate in the St. Patrick's Day parades, festivals and banquets without a buzz. They're doing so by turning to nonalcoholic beers, mocktails and solely sober spaces \u2014 even in the heart of Boston.",
      "\u201cSt. Patrick\u2019s Day is a huge drinking holiday. It is promoted absolutely everywhere,\u201d said Jackie Taylor who has been sober for 12 years.",
      "But she's found lots of ways to celebrate the holiday \u2014 whether out on the town or at home \u2014 without risking a situation where \"you might not make it out of there sober.\u201d",
      "Nonalcoholic drinks are popular on St. Patrick\u2019s Day weekend during The Burren's four days of Irish music shows, which can last 10 hours each. McCarthy said he\u2019s a Guinness drinker but sticks to the nonalcoholic brew when playing the fiddle.",
      "\u201cI top it up with the real creamy alcohol head,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re only getting a small bit of the alcohol, but you get the real cream. But you\u2019re also getting the taste of the real Guinness without the alcohol. It kind of beats all.\u201d",
      "Michelle Flynn, manager at the Brendan Behan Irish pub in Boston's Jamacia Plain, said most bars now serve nonalcoholic beers \u2014 a significant shift from decades ago.",
      "\u201cThe neighborhood, society, everything has changed, has shifted a 1,000% \u2014 especially in the youth,\u201d she said.",
      "It's not just bar owners noticing an uptick in a demand for nonalcoholic options. Young adults are drinking less than they were in decades past, according to polling by Gallup, which reported in 2023 that adults under 35 were less likely to say they use alcohol at least occasionally than they were in the early 2000s.",
      "Gallup also saw a decline in the share of young adults who drink regularly or say they sometimes drink \u201cmore than they think they should\u201d over the same time period.",
      "Michael Scelfo, chef and owner of four Boston area cocktail bars, said his businesses have served mocktails since he opened Cambridge-based Alden & Harlow 11 years ago. But after the pandemic, demand significantly increased.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really kind of an expected and formidable part of the menu now,\u201d he said, with bartenders putting just as much care into a mocktail's execution.",
      "For nearly 15 years, William Spencer Reilly has been throwing a \u201c Sober St. Patrick's Day \u201d in New York City \u2014 which kicks off after the parade with Irish bands, dancers and food \u2014 and may soon expand the mission to Boston.",
      "The sober event's founder and chairman has always had his eye on Boston \"for all the obvious reasons.\u201d",
      "According to Reilly, it's about refocusing the typically-booze forward festivities on celebrating Irish heritage and honoring St. Patrick, the priest born in the late fourth century who was enslaved in Ireland and later returned to promote the spread of Christianity. It's also a chance to break hurtful stereotypes of Irish people.",
      "When he first proposed the idea of a sober event on such a booze-heavy day, he was met with incredulity and doubt over public interest. Now he's in talks with Boston\u2019s local leaders and believes there\u2019s finally enough interest and support to branch out next year.",
      "People generally seem more interested in being healthier, said Scelfo. That includes how they choose to spend their holidays.",
      "\u201cThe perils and pitfalls of alcohol are well-documented when not used responsibly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an intelligent young generation that\u2019s focused on health and wellness. And I think that that\u2019s a great thing.\"",

      "But they are being unveiled against the backdrop of worsening economic forecasts, which have increased the need to find savings to allow the government to meet its self-imposed rules on future borrowing and spending.",
      "Ministers are expected to shelve plans not to raise personal independence payments (PIP), the main disability benefit in England and Wales, in line with inflation next year after pushback from within Labour.",

      "They argued the public interest would best served by putting Thames under government control through a Special Administration Regime, which was the same mechanism employed when energy company Bulb went bust.",
      "Critics of the deal also argued the 9.75% interest rate attached to the new debt made it too expensive an option for Thames.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 06:06:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The debate has sparked a wider dilemma about the broader purpose of welfare",
    "story": [
      "In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers.",
      "Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests.",
      "The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness.",
      "At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine.",
      "Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce.",
      "The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness.",
      "In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return.",
      "Mapping welfare trends",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. \"Cluster analysis maps\" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.",
      "As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.",
      "The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.",
      "Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.",
      "The data has thrown up answers.",
      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",
      "The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change.",
      "Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary.",
      "Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts.",
      "That's because all of this is in the context of what \"fiscal headroom\" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending.",
      "But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. \"We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,\" a source told me.",
      "\"Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous.\"",
      "Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work.",
      "And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs.",
      "That's why it's no exaggeration to say this month's explosive row about welfare will come to define this Government.",

    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolous Petropolous, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",

      "This follows a government review of the 2005 Gambling Act, and the publication of a white paper which introduces new measures to strengthen gambling harm legislation.",
      "Online slots are web versions of slot machines you see in a casino. The punter enters money and spins a wheel. If the symbols or pictures match, they could win money.",
      "The government said it was bringing in stake limits for them because they are \"a higher-risk gambling product associated with large losses, long sessions, and binge play\".",
      "But in a new documentary series on Radio 4, Stewart Kenny, who resigned from the board of the betting company in 2016, says the speed of the games is what makes them addictive.",
      "He says the gap between investment and results being \"only seconds\" means punters can \"repeat the dose\" at high speed.",
      "In addition to this, he says the machines provide \"plenty of noise and plenty of colours\", as well as near misses, which are \"fundamental to gambling addiction\".",
      "The Department for Culture Media and Sport said the Gambling Commission introduced requirements that changed speed and intensity of slots in 2021: \"This included a minimum speed of 2.5 seconds per spin, a ban on autoplay and features that increase play intensity, such as turbo, quick spin and slam stop, or give the illusion of 'false wins'.\"",
      "Gambling companies make a significant proportion of their profits from online slots. Acording to market data collected by the Gambling Commission up to December 2024, the profits from slots increased 15% year on year to a new high of \u00a3709m.

      "Mr Kenny no longer has any financial interest with the company, and receives no payment for taking part in the programmes.",
      "In the documentary series Changing the Odds, Mr Kenny teams up with journalist Lydia Thomas, who has reported on the betting industry for a decade, to chart 20 years since the 2005 Gambling Act. The act paved the way for the UK betting industry to revolutionise gambling and take it online.",
      "For many years, the UK has been the biggest online betting market in the world \u2013 with the industry worth \u00a315.6bn. Only recently has the United States overtaken as more states allow online gambling.",
      "And it is the move online that sparked Mr Kenny's worries when he was sitting on the board. He believes the internet by its very nature can be addictive and that adding online casinos in the mix has \"made the cocktail too strong\".",
      "Mr Kenny still enjoys gambling, and regularly bets on horse and dog racing, which he believes is a less addictive gambling product. But he criticises the industry for encouraging sports betting punters to move to online slots.",
      "\"I have always said I have been very relaxed about my kids opening up betting accounts. But, I would be horrified if my grandchildren open up a betting account.",
      "\"What the bookmakers do is, when you open a betting account at the age of 18 to have a bet, and you're a kid and you want to have a fiver on your local team, within 48 hours, the bookmakers will try and suck you into the highly addictive online casino by sending you free spins.\"",
      "Mr Kenny believes it is up to the government and regulators to make gambling safe.",
      "\"There's a balance here. If you want to bet, you should be allowed to bet. It's a free society. So you don't want to interfere with people's entertainment too much.  It's so easy to blame the betting companies. This is a matter for legislators.\"",
      "Flutter Entertainment said it recognised that the gambling industry had not always got things right in the past but said its UK business had \"evolved significantly in the years since Stewart's involvement, which ended over eight years ago\".",

      "But this is incredibly energy-intensive, making Grangemouth the most polluting site in Scotland.",
      "The cluster of business there were responsible for 7.2% of Scotland's emissions in 2022, according to the Just Transition Commission.",
      "Prioritising a carbon capture and storage scheme - called the Acorn Project - is seen as a vital step in reducing Grangemouth's carbon footprint.",
      "It would catch planet-warming gases before they enter the atmosphere, pipe them underground to St Fergus in Aberdeenshire and store them in depleted oil and gas wells under the North Sea.",
      "But the project missed out on the first round of UK government support and campaigners want a clear signal that it will be given full backing by ministers.",
      "One thing that is definitely going to be created at Grangemouth is a new import terminal to replace the closing refinery.",
      "That would mean the procession of tankers which deliver aviation fuel to Edinburgh Airport can be maintained.",
      "In the longer-term, a facility creating sustainable aviation fuel could use some of the skills of the existing workforce.",
      "It is on the political agenda.",
      "Since January, the UK government has mandated that 2% of UK jet fuel has to come from renewable sources - which means alternatives to fossil fuels. This will increase to 10% by the end of the decade.",
      "But there's been no commitment that Grangemouth will be the source of some of that fuel.",
      "The other potential options include a \"biorefinery\" which could use waste whisky and food in chemical production processes to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.",
      "Advanced recycling methods could also be developed which would produce high quality plastics able to be used in food packaging and health care.",
      "That would involve a process called \"cracking\" which breaks down the products into smaller molecules.",
      "It's a technique which is already carried out on fossil-fuel based chemicals at the Ineos site.",
      "Hydrogen will also play an increasingly important role in our economy over the coming decades as a clean energy, particularly in heavy transport and industry.",
      "Scotland's abundance of wind means generating green hydrogen from electricity has huge potential.",
      "Some hydrogen is already made at Grangemouth, and plans have previously been announced to significantly increase production by 2030.",
      "That hydrogen would then be used to displace gas to generate high temperatures in industrial processes.",
      "Grangemouth, however, does not currently have the right conditions to store hydrogen in significant quantities.",
      "Large underground salt caverns are ideal - but the nearest potential sites are in East Yorkshire and Cheshire.",
      "So either expensive storage units would have to be built above ground near Grangemouth, or the hydrogen would have to be piped hundreds of miles.",
      "The Project Willow report, when it's released, is expected to put figures to some of these propositions.",
      "It will cover the likely costs, the potential jobs and the value to the Scottish and UK economies.",
      "That will not be the end of the matter; in fact, it's barely the beginning.",
      "Attracting the public and private investment will be far more challenging than outlining the options.",
      "But talking about it early - and in a co-ordinated way - will surely maximise the chances of securing a long-term future for a site so intrinsically linked with fossil fuels."

    "story": [
      "The price of gold has hit the $3,000 per ounce mark for the first time as demand for the precious metal surges amid economic uncertainty over the impact of a global trade war.",
      "Gold touched a record $3,004.86 per ounce on Friday, with prices having risen by 14% since the start of 2025.",
      "Gold is seen as a safer asset for investors and is often sought after in times of economic instability.",
      "The escalating trade war between the US and many of its largest trading partners has unsettled financial markets and raised concerns about the impact on economies and consumers across the world.",
      "The introduction of tariffs, which are taxes charged on businesses importing goods from overseas, has fuelled fears of price inflation, which has driven investors to gold.",
      "When tariffs are imposed on goods, businesses face extra costs, which could be passed on through the price tags of the products sold to consumers - increasing the cost of living.",
      "On Thursday, US President Donald Trump threatened a 200% tariff on any alcohol coming to the US from the European Union (EU) in the latest twist of the trade war.",
      "The announcement was in response to the EU's plans for a 50% tax on imports of US-produced whiskey as part of the bloc's first retaliation to Trump's blanket tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to the US from any country.",
      "The US president has also raised levies on Chinese imports into the US to at least 20%.",
      "Trump threatens 200% tariff on alcohol from EU",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "\"In a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty and ongoing tariff changes, appetite for gold remains strong,\" said Suki Cooper, a precious metals analyst at Standard Chartered.",
      "Victoria Hasler, head of fund research at Hargreaves Lansdown, suggested there were two main drivers behind the gold price at present.",
      "\"Between Trump's tariffs and social media comments and the ongoing tensions in both the Middle East and Russia/Ukraine, uncertainty is high and seems to be rising,\" she said.",
      "\"Markets hate uncertainty. This dynamic has helped to drive the gold price to new highs.\"",
      "The second big driver was central banks buying up gold, Ms Hasler said, but the exact reasons for this were difficult to determine. \"It's probably safe to assume that at least part of the reason is a desire to diversify reserves away from US dollars.",
      "\"Both of the above drivers remain intact and I can't see them diminishing in the near future.\"",
      "Peaks and troughs of the gold price have occurred at some of the key moments in economic history. At the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2007, investors bought gold as a haven asset, which led to a rise in its price.",
      "Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, cited World Gold Council figures, which showed central banks had added some 1,045 tonnes of gold to their reserves last year - the third year in a row more than 1,000 tonnes had been bought.",
      "He said we were in an \"era in which gold is really starting to shine\".",
      "Since the metal dipped below $1,200 an ounce in late 2018, Mr Mould said prices had \"marched inexorably higher\", driven by several factors including the Covid pandemic and higher government deficits pushing investors to \"warm to gold once more\".",
      "\"Quite which of these issues is now the main driver of gold's renaissance is hard to divine, especially as Donald Trump's tariffs are prompting a debate about how inflationary (or stagflationary) they may prove to be, and how effective they may be at funding the new US President's hoped-for tax cuts,\" he said."

      "It is unclear who at Tesla wrote the letter as it is unsigned, or if Mr Musk was aware of it.",
      "Tesla's share price has dropped 40% since the start of the year. Mr Musk is the carmaker's chief executive and while some have argued his alignment with the Trump administration is hurting its brand, market analysts say the share fall is more about worries over Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.",
      "In the letter, Tesla said it was making changes to its supply chains to find as many local suppliers for its cars and batteries so it was less reliant on foreign markets.",
      "\"None the less,\" it warned, \"even with aggressive localisation of the supply chain, certain parts and components are difficult or impossible to source within the US.\"",
      "The US president has imposed an additional 20% tariff on all imports from China, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory levies including on cars. China is Tesla's second biggest market after the US.",

      "Asda revealed on Friday that sales, excluding fuel, fell almost 1% to \u00a321.7bn last year.",

    "summary": "The former banker may not have been elected to office before, but his experience managing global economic crises will help.",
    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",
      "But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PM",
      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

      "The latest clash came after new US tariffs on steel and aluminium came into effect on Wednesday, hitting imports of the metals with a blanket duty of 25% and ending exemptions from the duties that the US had previously granted for shipments from some countries, including from the EU and Canada.",
      "Canada and Europe - which are among America's biggest trade partners - called the new taxes unjustified and struck back with their own tariffs on a range of US products. The EU's measures are due to go into force 1 April.",

      "'It's giant threat to our livelihoods'",
      "The targeting of wine and whiskey is symbolic - there are few consumer goods more iconic than French Bordeaux or Tennessee whiskey. From a value standpoint, drinks trade is worth less than some of the other items facing tariffs.",
      "But Mary Taylor, a US-based importer of European wines, said the measures would be catastrophic for her business and industry, with an impact that would ripple out to restaurants, bars and distributors across the US.",
      "\"It just looks like a big, giant threat to our livelihoods,\"  she said.",
      "Ms Taylor, who brings in 2 million bottles a year, weathered the 25% tariff Trump put on certain EU bottles during his first term by expanding her distribution in Europe, but she said, \"200% is a whole different ball game\".",

      "Two US judges have ordered several federal government agencies to reinstate the jobs of probationary employees fired en masse by the Trump administration last month.",
      "In California, District Judge William Alsup called the sacking of these employees part of a \"sham\" strategy that aimed to circumvent proper procedures for reducing the federal workforce.",
      "His order - which was followed by another from Maryland - applies to thousands of probationary workers who were fired at a range of departments, including defence, energy, treasury, and veterans affairs.",
      "The Department of Justice says the firings were done based on guidance - rather than a directive - from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).",
      "The BBC has contacted OPM for comment.",

      "\"That should not have been done in our country,\" Judge Alsup said. \"It was a sham in order to avoid statutory requirements.\"",
      "Danielle Leonard, a lawyer representing a coalition of government employee unions, said probationary employees were targeted because they lacked the right to appeal.",
      "During the hearing, Judge Alsup also lamented the firing of a government worker in Albuquerque, New Mexico who had been given top marks for performance but was then issued a pink slip citing performance as the cause of their termination.",
      "\"I just want to say it is a sad day when our government would fire a good employee and say it's for performance when they know good and well that's a lie,\" Judge Alsup said.",

      "Ieva Mackeviciute lives in Kaunas, Lithuania's second-largest city, but works in the capital, Vilnius.",
      "She takes the hour-long train into her company's Vilnius office once a week, where she uses a car-sharing service to drive herself to client meetings throughout the day.",
      "Through an app, she can find where the nearest available car is, and drive off, paying by the minute - a system she finds convenient and flexible.",
      "Some providers even include parking in the price, and if she takes an electric car, it's even better, as they qualify for free parking around the city.",
      "\"The ability to move around a big city quickly, and not worry about parking, helps me have a more flexible schedule and better control of my time,\" says Ms Mackeviciute, 30, who works in communications.",
      "Yet despite being a regular car-sharing user, Ms Mackeviciute still owns a car in Kaunas, which she regularly uses for visiting family living in the countryside. And even while working in Vilnius, occasional issues with car sharing can disrupt Ms Mackeviciute's day.",
      "\"It can sometimes be hard to find a vehicle nearby. And sometimes, when you're in a rush the closest vehicle can have not one, but a few, maintenance lights on. While I do understand that fleet maintenance is a challenge, especially as a business grows, it is still disappointing,\" she says.",
      "When it comes to cars, most people feel like Ms Mackeviciute - they still want to own one.",
      "In the UK, for example, while 61% of people drive daily and 68% are worried about the rising cost of car ownership, 78% don't know what car sharing is, and fewer than 20% of Londoners would consider signing up to such a scheme, according to a report by car rental company SIXT.",
      "Despite brands like Zipcar being around since 2000, industry data shows car sharing to still be a niche service.",
      "There are just two million car sharing users in the UK, while around 35 million people still own a car.",
      "\"Consumers are still tied to exclusive access to their car. Clear scepticism about the ability for car-sharing options to provide a car to hand whenever they need it, and concerns about hassle, are the biggest issues,\" explains Felicity Latcham, associate partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants.",
      "\"This concern gets greater for families and older individuals who are particularly tied to being able to leave things in their vehicle.\"",
      "But the growing electrification of the car sharing market might be attractive to younger, eco-conscious drivers.",
      "In a 2023 McKinsey survey of 4,000 people in the UK, France and Germany, 32% of those in the Gen Z bracket said they wanted to use shared-mobility schemes more, wishing to reduce private car reliance.",
      "The survey also suggested that 50% of Gen Z also want their next car to be fully electric.",
      "The car-sharing industry is heading in that direction.",
      "Almost a quarter of European car sharing companies now offer a 100% electric fleet.",
      "A third of shared cars in the EU are electric vehicles, data from Statista shows. Meanwhile, Zipcar doubled its electric fleet in 2023 in the UK, with plans to go fully electric this year.",

      "Since July last year, users of the Bolt ride-sharing app - the Baltic states' answer to Uber - can also now book Spark vehicles.",
      "Spark founder Nerijus Dagilis is confident that the increasing availability of electric vehicles can get more people on board with car sharing, especially with the support of the city of Vilnius, which, on top of free parking for electric cars, allows them to be driven in bus lanes, too.",
      "\"Our customer pool is increasing every month, so that means we are creating a certain value for people, who prefer electric cars for sustainability reasons. It's becoming a daily habit for many people, especially families - we see more of them downsizing from two cars to one,\" says Mr Dagilis.",
      "\"The performance of electric cars is improving quickly, so while there is still some scepticism, as soon as an electric car can drive 500km on a single charge, I think people's anxiety should disappear.\"",

      "Since returning to office in January, Mr Trump has raised tariffs on all goods imported from China by 20%, and put taxes of 25% on Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay some of them until April.",
      "The president says he wants to force these countries to do more to stop flows of illegal drugs and migrants into America, to bring more manufacturing back to the US, and to address what he sees as unfair trade imbalances.",
      "But the duties are much broader in scope than last time, when they were phased in gradually and many products were granted exemptions.",

      "\"It's American businesses and consumers who will suffer.\"",
      "Businesses like Ms Ghazarian's are particularly exposed. China is still the number one supplier of electronic products to the US, with imports totalling $146bn (\u00a3112bn) in 2023, according to official data.",

      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",

Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",

      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",

      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",

      "She has kept an original private Facebook account: \"I cleanse it once a year, and check on photos and privacy of posts and where I have been tagged.\"",
      "Ms Smith has also become more aware of the terms and conditions of social media platforms.",
      "\"I follow AI trends and I know a lot of images are training AI models and we don't have ethical guidelines on how they can be used. That's another massive factor why I will never put my child on social media as the images can be used for whatever want.\"",
      "As scams become more sophisticated, research suggests that more people are concerned about the information they share online.",
      "In a report by Statista, 39% of respondents said they were worried about how companies use their online data, while a quarter (26%) admitted to using a VPN.",
      "There are a number of reasons why people might want to reduce their online profiles.",

      "\"What might be innocent information right now might be bring you into difficulties 10 years down the line, for example, if there's a change of laws, or political environment.\"",
      "Another issue is the explosion of AI, says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "\"Fraud is getting better and better, and one thing that is essential for all scams is having data,\" he says.",
      "AI is getting to the stage where it can impersonate people close to you. Add to that ability any personal information shared online, then you have a \"deadly combination\", says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "Also, information shared online about us is collected by data brokers and sold to advertisers.",
      "Mr Kaziukonis says the information is also available to scammers. \"It's the Wild West out there,\" he says.",
      "So what can we do to minimise our footprints?",
      "Firstly, it's important to think about how much information you share online.",
      "\"Don't share your home address anywhere, for example, accidently filming a video with a laptop in the background that has sensitive information on, and when you go online shopping don't add all details to every random website, for example, your date of birth,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "\"It could be leaked and used against you.\" He also advises using a different email address for websites that you sign up to. \"That limits the spamming.\"",
      "It's worth remembering that under data protection law, you have the right to ask a company what data they hold on you, and request that it is deleted.",
      "\"They have to comply as otherwise they can receive huge fines,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "Gus Hosein, executive director at charity Privacy International, recommends several ways to reduce your digital footprint.",

      "What you need to know about cookiesWhat is a VPN service?",
      "What you need to know about cookies",

      "\"The situation is pretty dire,\" she says.",
      "She advises it's a good idea to clear out the cookies on your browser from time to time, and reduce the cookies you accept.",
      "\"Also, you can stop some tracking. Google, for example, makes it possible to prevent tracking of your searches.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3911lv1pzko",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 22:16:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The former banker may not have been elected to office before, but his experience managing global economic crises will help.",
    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",
      "But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PM",
      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

    "story": [
      "The former head of Ofsted, Amanda Spielman, has criticised the education secretary and accused her of giving \"a great deal of time and attention\" to the teaching unions.",
      "Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Ms Spielman claims \"effective reforms are being reversed\" - referring to potential changes to academy schools' powers.",
      "The Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill is set to change the rules around how academies pay their staff and the material they can teach, which critics say threatens their autonomy.",
      "But the Department for Education (DfE) says its \"landmark\" reforms deliver on its mission to ensure all schools can attract and retain the best teachers.",
      "In a piece covering academies, qualifications, the curriculum and Ofsted itself, the ex-chief of the organisation says the education secretary should reconsider the reforms in the bill \"before the damage is done\".",
      "Ms Spielman stepped down as head of Ofsted at the end of 2023.",
      "An inquiry into Ofsted was launched that year, after the death of head teacher Ruth Perry, who died by suicide following an Ofsted inspection.",
      "Ms Spielman accuses the education secretary of using \"polished verbiage and jazz hands\" when announcing policies, and claimed some policies had been \"influenced by education union leaders and activists\".",
      "While education unions have supported the government in some areas, they have also been critical in others, including on the proposals for new Ofsted report cards.",
      "But Ms Spielman claimed the changes to Ofsted were being done \"to please unions\", by making it \"much less likely that inspection will detect weaknesses or convey a negative message.\"",
      "Speaking to Radio 4's World at One programme, Ms Spielman said she thought it was \"surprising\" that education unions were approached for comments on stories about Ofsted.",
      "A government source's comment, which said Ms Spielman should \"spend less time criticising the reforms this government is bringing, and more time reflecting on her failure at Ofsted\", was also put to the ex-Ofsted boss during the interview.",
      "She responded by saying it was \"fascinating because that's a union line\", reiterating her criticism of the organisations which she says have been \"attacking accountability and attacking inspection from long before I became chief inspector\".",
      "In The Telegraph piece, the ex-Ofsted head also says the government's proposals for academies will \"cut the autonomy of schools and school groups right back\".",
      "She says she is \"astonished by the speed and thoroughness with which Bridget Phillipson has moved to dismantle every main pillar of the system\".",
      "The schools bill, due to go before MPs again on Monday, includes measures to create a register of children who are not in school and allow local authorities to intervene if a child's home environment is assessed as unsuitable or unsafe.",
      "Several issues covered by the bill, including safeguarding, have been met positively by school leaders.",
      "More controversial and debated elements have been around academy reforms, which may limit academies' powers to manage their pay and working practices differently to schools run by local authorities.",
      "After facing opposition from academy leaders, the government has since clarified that it intends the pay framework to be a \"floor not a ceiling\", meaning academy bosses will still be able to pay teachers more if they choose to.",
      "Phillipson previously called political attempts to halt the bill \"utterly sickening\", telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme the children's bill was \"the single biggest piece of children safeguarding legislation in a generation\".",
      "Responding to Ms Spielman's claims, a DfE spokesperson said the bill, alongside other reforms, \"delivers on our mission for every child to have a good, local school, will get high-quality teachers into every classroom, and ensure that all schools can innovate to attract and retain the best talent\".",

      "However, the report suggests it is getting worse. The gap - which is measured using GCSE results - would reduce from 19 months to 15 months of learning if school attendance was the same for all pupils, it says.",
      "Natalie Perera, from the EPI, said it is the first time \"a very clear link\" has been made between how much children from the lowest income families attend school, and how far behind other pupils they have fallen.",
      "Her team looked specifically at children who have received free school meals in the past six years, which means the family income is less than \u00a37,400 a year after tax and not including benefits.",

      "When the Scottish Funding Council publishes its delayed annual assessment of the sector, it is expected to say that more than half of Scotland's institutions are running a deficit.",
      "They all face similar pressures, but some have done better than others at foreseeing the danger and planning for it.",
      "So what are the challenges facing the sector in Scotland?",
      "The level of student funding",
      "Scottish students get \"free tuition\". Undergraduates don't have to pay fees for their courses if they can secure one of the limited number of places.",
      "The Scottish government has committed to pay the tuition costs, which it does through the Scottish Funding Council (SFC).",
      "Universities Scotland, which represents the 18 institutions, says that level of funding has not kept pace with inflation or with the number of students.",
      "It says there has been a decade of under-investment by the Scottish government in the higher education sector.",
      "The figures differ according to how you measure inflation, but it told MSPs that funding per student had fallen by 39% in real terms.",
      "It says research funding from the government is down by 43% since 2014/15, and its members say Scotland has lost much of the sizeable lead it held over the rest of the UK in attracting research funding.",
      "While the Scottish government proudly points to its provision of \u00a31.1bn for the sector, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted that the \u00a31,810 fee per student has not changed for 15 years.",
      "But that's far from all the money allocated. With block grants for tuition, the average being spent per student was calculated as \u00a37,530 this year.",
      "Using a different measure for inflation, the IFS says spending per student is down by 22% since 2013. Half of that reduction has been in the most recent three years, when costs have been rising most steeply.",
      "The IFS said that while the surplus of Scottish universities stood at 5.2% in 2022/23, it has concerns that finances are getting rapidly worse.",
      "How does that compare with elsewhere?",
      "Undergraduates in the rest of the UK are required to pay fees, often building up debt to do so.",
      "These are capped at \u00a39,250 per year for a typical three-year degree course - less for part-time students, more for accelerated courses.",
      "Students from the rest of the UK must pay an equivalent amount to study at Scottish universities, although the cost is usually spread over the four years of a Scottish degree.",
      "While the number of Scottish students is capped, there is no limit on the number of undergraduates from elsewhere. As a result, they became an important source of income for Scottish institutions.",
      "However, the growth in funding per student has not kept up with inflation. It has been increased only slightly from \u00a39,000 in 2012.",
      "The maximum annual fee is going up next year by nearly \u00a3300 to compensate universities for the higher cost of employer National Insurance contributions from next month, but there is no equivalent increase for Scottish students funded through Holyrood.",
      "Because England and Wales have more open competition to recruit students - and attract their fee income - there have been sharper divergences in financial fortunes than you'll see in Scotland, where the SFC allocates places to institutions.",
      "The more prestigious Russell Group of research-rich universities have gone after the students that would previously have gone to middle-ranking institutions, leaving the latter financially flailing.",
      "The vice-chancellors of English universities complain that fees fail to cover the cost of educating undergraduates. Yet the total they receive is around \u00a32,500 per student higher than the funding for Scottish-based students doing courses in Scotland.",
      "With these shortfalls in income compared with costs, there had to be a new stream of funding, and that's where foreign fees have become a vital part of the solution - and the problem.",
      "The overseas recruitment drive",
      "UK universities have been on a recruitment splurge to draw in students from other parts of the world, charging them much higher fees than UK students \u2013 from about \u00a310,000 up to \u00a340,000 per year.",
      "The number of European Union students fell by half as Britain left the EU, but the numbers from other countries have soared. The share of foreign students has risen from one in 20 in the 1990s to more than one in four.",
      "For those with a prestigious reputation, including Scotland's older universities, the share of foreign students has been closer to 40%.",
      "The most recent figures show there were about 750,000 international students studying in the UK in 2022/23 - with the number of new arrivals almost doubling in the space of five years.",
      "This has brought controversy - about the quality of learning, standards of English language ability, and the surge in demand for student accommodation.",
      "It has also brought vulnerability if the demand for places falls away.",
      "Growth in foreign fees swelled university income, and the increase was most marked as the pandemic ended, reaching a peak in 2022.",
      "It fell by 5% the following year, and is thought to have continued falling - quite steeply for some universities.",
      "The volatility of that income stream reflects many international factors.",
      "A growing concern about universities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, becoming too dependent on Chinese students saw recruitment shift to other countries.",
      "Chinese recruitment remains high, but has stopped growing, and post-grads are down.",
      "Nigeria was one new target, encouraged by the UK government.",
      "But the market there depends on the strength of the Nigerian currency, which fell sharply and cut off the number of people who could afford to come to the UK.",
      "Dundee was one of the universities hit hard by the falling numbers.",
      "Numbers were also affected by visa restrictions.",
      "In order to meet pressure to cut immigration numbers, the Conservative government increased the annual fee for using the NHS and made it more difficult for graduates to reach the pay threshold for a work visa after they graduate.",
      "It also restricted visas for students' family dependents.",
      "The biggest cash cow among foreign students has been in taught post-graduate degrees.",
      "These tend to be older students with families who won't come if there is a restriction on partners and families.",
      "Some international markets are sensitive to the signals sent out by the UK government, including India, where UK visa changes and reports of attacks on Indian students in British universities can make the front page of national newspapers.",
      "A further factor is that competition has been growing.",
      "The UK used to see its main competitors for English-language degrees as the US, Canada and Australia.",
      "That now extends to about 20 countries, including Ireland and Singapore and extending to polyglot Holland and Germany.",
      "What about spending?",
      "To increase capacity for teaching and studying for all those additional students, universities have had to increase spending.",
      "And with more foreign fee income, they have been investing in buildings and equipment as well as more staff.",
      "Ten years ago, Edinburgh University had 35,000 students and an income of \u00a3819m, with expenditure of \u00a3793m.",
      "In 2023/24, student numbers were nearing 50,000 and income was at \u00a31.43bn, with expenditure of \u00a31.3bn.",
      "That level of increased activity is harder to handle where there are so many moving parts to the income.",
      "It becomes impossible if financial planners fail to see the risk that the growth in foreign student fee income can stall and reverse, while they continue with expansion plans, prestigious new buildings and more debt.",
      "So what happens next?",
      "An external inquiry will be carried out at Dundee University, which is expected to highlight major management failures and a shonky IT system for student recruitment.",
      "Its interim principal, Prof Shane O'Neill, says the financial crisis has \"challenged us to ask some very fundamental questions about the size, shape, balance and structure of the university\".",
      "Dundee's response points to job losses and a narrowing of course options for students. Fewer modules will be offered, and that may also be the case elsewhere.",
      "Subjects that don't bring in enough income will be vulnerable.",
      "Language departments are a common target when cuts are needed. There's not much research or consultancy income, and there's competition from commercial software.",
      "The Scottish Funding Council faces deficits in the majority of the institutions it funds, and pressure from Holyrood ministers to make sure the pain is eased and that no institution is allowed to fail.",
      "But money is tight, and there are limited powers to intervene because these are autonomous institutions.",
      "Dundee University to cut 632 jobs to plug \u00a335m deficit",
      "Edinburgh University to seek \u00a3140m in savings",
      "Record foreign student numbers at Scottish universities",
      "Some see sense in mergers, cutting out the duplication of back office costs and the notoriously high salaries of principals.",
      "Others see shared services and teaching space as the way to go, with other universities, colleges and with other organisations such as the NHS.",
      "And there may be value in a crisis such as this.",
      "With a period of rapid growth now ended, one principal told me this is the time to reflect on what university is for: how to re-shape Scotland's universities towards the needs of the next 20 to 30 years, using artificial intelligence in learning and teaching.",
      "On funding, that principal warned said we need to move on from the simplistic \"fee or free\" argument over tuition costs in Scotland.",
      "What comes out of that reflection matters profoundly to Scotland, to its people and to its economy.",
      "In the various scenarios for Scotland's economic future, universities form the one sector where there is world-leading expertise and reputation.",
      "Scotland punches above its weight. But if it is to continue doing so, it will have to change."

    "story": [
      "Netflix's latest big-budget film The Electric State, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt, is one of the most expensive movies ever made, and had some of the most scathing reviews in recent memory. But that doesn't mean it will flop.",
      "Film critics haven't minced their words when delivering their verdicts on The Electric State.",
      "It is \"a turgid eyesore\" and \"top-dollar tedium\", according to the Times. It's \"slick but dismally soulless\", declared the Hollywood Reporter, while the New York Times called it  \"obvious, garish and just plain dumb\".",
      "Paste pointed out its eye-watering budget, billing it as \"the most banal way you can spend $320m\". Warming to the theme, the magazine summed it up as \"one hell of an artistically neutered, sanitized boondoggle\".",
      "There have been some kinder reviews. Empire said it was \"breezily watchable\" and worth three stars, while the Telegraph awarded four stars to the \"Spielbergian treat\".",
      "But overall, its 15% Rotten Tomatoes score is a meagre return for any major film, especially one costing such a lot. The $320m (\u00a3247m) figure has been widely reported but neither confirmed nor denied by Netflix. It would make The Electric State the most expensive streaming film ever.",
      "Critics' opinions, however, have become more irrelevant in the streaming age. The bad reviews didn't stop The Electric State from going straight to number one on Netflix's chart after its release on Friday.",
      "It fits into Netflix making star-packed, entertaining and escapist movies that often get panned by reviewers - but are watched by hundreds of millions of subscribers.",
      "\"I would love to say that what I've written and what other critics have written will matter, but I just don't think it will,\" says Digital Spy movies editor Ian Sandwell.",
      "Sandwell awarded the film two stars out of five, noting that the action and visual effects are \"decent\", the robots are \"impressive\" and the finale is \"epic\".",
      "\"My main problem was they'd created this really impressive, visually spectacular world and then just told quite a generic seen-it-all-before story inside it,\" he says.",
      "Bad reviews might have put people off paying to see the film if it had been released in cinemas, he says. \"But on Netflix, I think it will still be absolutely massive. I don't think bad reviews will matter at all.\"",
      "While a critic's job is to analyse a movie, \"audiences probably do just want a big, spectacular blockbuster to watch at home, with two massive stars\", he adds.",
      "The Electric State follows Brown, Pratt and a succession of zany robots in an alternative version of 1990s America, where there has been a war between humans and intelligent bots.",
      "It also stars Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci and the voices of Woody Harrelson and Brian Cox, and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo - who have made four Marvel movies, including the wildly successful Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame.",
      "The Electric State is based on the graphic novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, although some critics pointed out that Netflix had missed the book's point about the perils of a consumerist society addicted to technology.",
      "The film is \"absolutely not\" value for money in terms of quality, says City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford.",
      "And it remains to be seen whether the film makes financial sense for Netflix, she says.",
      "The streaming giant's most popular ever film, 2021's Red Notice, has had 231 million views, according to Netflix's measurements.",
      "\"The Electric State will be hoping for that kind of performance, just as a $320m theatrically released movie would be aiming to break box office records,\" Luxford says.",
      "\"The higher the price, the higher the target for success, even with a business model as opaque as Netflix's.\"",
      "Red Notice, an action-packed art crime caper starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, has a lukewarm 39% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes - but a 92% audience rating.",
      "Other recent Netflix hits have been lapped up by viewers more than reviewers.",
      "Brooke Shields' lightweight multi-generational rom-com Mother of the Bride has a 13% critics' score, Jennifer Lopez's AI action thriller Atlas is on 19%, Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx's family spy escapade Back In Action has 29%, and Kevin Hart's heist comedy Lift is on 30%.",
      "They are enjoyable but forgettable - and easy to watch in the midst of potential distractions at home. The Hollywood Reporter described Atlas as \"another Netflix movie made to half-watch while doing laundry\" - summing up this new genre.",
      "In December, N+1 magazine quoted several screenwriters as saying a common request from Netflix executives is for characters to announce what they're doing \"so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along\".",
      "\"Electric State does feel like that,\" Sandwell continues, \"where there are just random big dumps of the characters explaining exactly what's happened, sometimes something we've seen recently, just in case you're not following along.",
      "\"But it does depend on the movie.\"",
      "Netflix does have serious and critically-acclaimed movies, too, of course, but they are often not such crowd-pleasers. Emilia Perez, which led this year's Oscar nominations, has not troubled the Netflix global top 10 charts.",
      "Another critic, Gav Squires, says many of Netflix's films are \"very average\", but don't usually have such astronomical budgets as The Electric State.",
      "\"Netflix know what they're doing,\" he says. \"They know that people are probably watching on a second screen, they're not paying full attention. So when they're putting stuff out that costs $30m that people aren't really watching and is kind of average, I'm not too fussed about it.",

      "It said at least five other applicants scored more highly than the four women and were therefore appointed, based on an \"objective assessment\".",
      "The women's case originally also included an equal pay claim, which a judge dismissed last May.",
      "The women later appealed against that ruling, and the equal pay claim has now also ended as part of the settlement.",
      "Analysis",
      "By Katie Razzall, BBC News culture and media editor",
      "So who's won?",
      "The BBC has not admitted liability. In other words, it has not accepted it did anything wrong.",
      "The presenters remain in their current roles. Apart from McVeigh, who was appointed a chief presenter on the BBC News channel in February 2024, the others will not return to the full presenter roles they had and then lost in the restructuring recruitment process, which sparked two years of attrition.",
      "Through that lens, it looks like a stalemate.",
      "The losers, though, are licence fee payers who have seen hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on BBC presenters who were off work on full pay for at least a year, on top of whatever the costs of this settlement add up to. That may never be made public.",
      "The pressure is on to justify the financial waste.",
      "Why did it take so long to reach an agreement?",
      "Both sides were entrenched. For two years, they were in conflict, with the presenters off screen for half of that time.",
      "Contracts are binding. Employees remain on full pay while internal disputes are resolved. But this one took a long time, and they continued to fight when they returned to work. Only, on the brink of the tribunal, was there a resolution.",
      "The BBC will have had licence fee payers in mind when weighing up whether to proceed to a full tribunal or settle. It apparently decided it wasn't worth going through three damaging weeks, with all the headlines and media attention that would have generated.",
      "A settlement is always likely to bring down costs. The impact of a tribunal can be substantial, and there is also the potential for appeals and further hearings that increase the financial impact.",
      "But the optics of the last two years, ending in a settlement, aren't good. And there is frustration inside the BBC about the impact of it all, at a time when budgets are shrinking."

    "story": [
      "Cher Horowitz has brought her life of Beverly Hills high fashion, friendship and matchmaking to London's West End, as classic 1990s teen film Clueless has been given a musical makeover.",
      "Clueless has been brought to the stage by the film's original writer and director Amy Heckerling - who says keeping the 90s theme was integral to the show.",
      "Heckerling insists she has \"no interest in being modern\" - which will come as a relief to the audiences who grew up quoting \"As if!\" and aspiring to Cher's plaid and Prada-filled wardrobe.",
      "The story follows the life of the na\u00efve and lovably spoiled teenager, who plays matchmaker with her friends before ultimately finding love herself.",
      "An adaption of Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless captured the teen spirit of the 90s and inspired countless school dramas like Mean Girls, Gossip Girl and Legally Blonde.",
      "The stage version has songs in the form of an original score by singer-songwriter KT Tunstall.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Tunstall says the film was \"omnipotent\" in the 90s and influenced everything from the clothes people wore to the music people listened to.",
      "The Scottish singer, best known for songs like Black Horse and the Cherry Tree and Suddenly I See, says working on the show was a \"dream project\".",
      "She says the original soundtrack was a big inspiration, and describes the music as \"a mixtape of all your favourite 90s bangers\".",
      "The process of creating the soundtrack for Clueless: The Musical was intense for Tunstall, who says it's no easy feat to add music to an adaptation of a film that didn't originally have it.",
      "\"You really have to think about whether a song fits the structure and flow of the story and whether it actually helps the audience understand the narrative better,\" she says.",
      "Heckerling says she actually wishes the film had been a musical because \"there were natural moments in the script where characters could have sung\".",
      "\"Those types of films weren't very common in the 90s but I'm glad we could add in music now,\" she says.",
      "Critics had mixed thoughts about the new songs - the Guardian called them \"disappointingly flat-footed\" in a two-star review and said the lyrics \"too often serve as exposition rather than raising the emotional drama\".",
      "Similarly, the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish wrote that the show has \"numbers designed to sound in keeping with the period but which are so generic they don't ring with real-world authenticity\".",
      "But What'sOnStage praised Tunstall's \"infuriatingly catchy tunes\" and Glenn Slater's \"nifty, witty lyrics\".",
      "For Emma Flynn, who is making her West End debut as Cher, the music has another important function in the show - it allows characters to easily share their inner thoughts with the audience.",
      "\"In the film you hear these really funny inner monologues of Cher, but the great thing about this show is you can hear all of the character's thoughts, which makes you feel more connected to them.\"",
      "Flynn has been praised by critics, with the Evening Standard noting her \"powerfully-sung breakout performance\" and describing it as channelling \"both Alicia Silverstone in the original movie and Sabrina Carpenter today, while making the role entirely her own\".",
      "Co-star Keelan McAuley, who plays nerdy Josh, tells the BBC he loves the play's nostalgia factor.",
      "\"The flip phone was the most advanced technology they had in the 90s and there's something so enchanting about a time where there was no access to social media,\" he says.",
      "Nostalgia fest",
      "The show stays almost entirely true to the 1995 film, with everyone sporting the latest 90s fashions, carrying a glitzy pager, and listening to angsty teen bangers on a Walkman.",
      "While it may feel like a nostalgia fest, Heckerling admits she doesn't \"like to stick to real life\", and even her sunny film was far from the reality of what the 90s were like for most teenagers in LA, with race riots and other political problems.",
      "The Independent's three-star review says the show \"sticks to the original movie like chewing gum to the underside of a school desk\" at first, but changes tack by the second half.",
      "\"[Director Rachel] Kavanaugh and Heckerling gain the confidence to part ways a bit from the movie's script, and to let the story's heart show,\" Alice Saville wrote.",
      "For Tunstall, what sets Clueless apart from traditional rom-coms and high school dramas is that there isn't a typical villain and there's no nastiness or bad intentions from the main characters.",
      "Jane Austen famously thought her main character wouldn't be a widely liked heroine, but Tunstall says she is often people's favourite character because of her honesty and depth.",
      "\"People can relate to her on a deeper level, like how she is trying to process the death of her mother and help keep her family in order.",
      "\"Those themes are universal and that's what makes this story so enduring.\""

      "The 69-year-old took over the family business after her brother Gianni was murdered in 1997, with many unsure whether she had what it takes to steer the fashion house.",

      "But she proved the doubters wrong, anointing herself in the process as a global fashion icon.",
      "She leaves the job as \"one of the most successful female designers in modern fashion history\", Cartner-Morley added.",

      "As singer and Versace ambassador Dua Lipa put it in a tribute on Instagram: \"No-one does it like you @donatella_versace!!!!!\"",
      "She did it all with \"grit, kindness and, even in the troughs of addiction, an infectious sense of humour\", the Telegraph's head of fashion Lisa Armstrong wrote.",
      "However,  Versace \"never set a fashion agenda\" under Donatella as it had under her brother, Armstrong added - but her \"nose for a story could nevertheless produce fashion magic\".",
      "Her magic moments included dressing Jennifer Lopez in the green jungle dress at the 2000 Grammy Awards, generating so much interest that Google created its image search function.",
      "As former Miu Miu design director Dario Vitale takes over, Donatella will now become an ambassador for the Versace brand.",
      "The big question is what that means for both the company and Donatella herself, who has poured her life into the company, dealing with grief, drug addiction and divorce along the way?",
      "Speculation is growing over whether the company will be sold to the Prada Group by its current owner Capri Holdings.",

      "Prada has been credited with developing a strong vision in recent years, which has translated to healthy sales during a climate of slowdown in the fashion economy.",
      "Imran Amed, CEO of The Business of Fashion, told the BBC World Service that \"Versace is one of the most iconic brands in the fashion industry\" and has \"a very clear design and brand DNA\".",
      "He believes it \"would be a mistake to dilute\" the company or merge it with another, so hopes that if Versace is bought, the vision is to grow it into something bigger.",
      "Amed said Versace makes about $1bn (\u00a3772m) a year, while rivals such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci make $20bn (\u00a315.5bn) and $8bn (\u00a36.2bn) respectively.",
      "Some have touted that Versace's failure to expand into the beauty industry and other affordable luxuries is why it has been left behind financially by its rivals.",
      "Luisa Zargani, Milan bureau chief for Women's Wear Daily, said Donatella had probably stepped back because she knows a \"moment of creative upheaval\" is coming for the brand.",
      "\"There has been a lot of talk about the future of Versace and for the last few years she has been very involved with all her charity work, so she will continue to do [that] while continuing to be part of the Versace family,\" she told BBC News.",
      "Zargani said Donatella \"has always championed young designers\" such as Christopher Kane, Jonathan Anderson and Anthony Vaccarello, and she expects her to continue to be involved as Vitale moves from Miu Miu.",
      "\"[Vitale] is a very solid designer, he's very steady, very creative and has been key in building Miu Miu, so I'm sure she has had her input in this,\" Zargani added.",
      "Friedman said Donatella had probably been thinking about her succession plan \"for a while\".",
      "\"There's a lot of turmoil in the luxury industry at large, and she may have decided it was time for a change,\" she told the World Service's Newshour.",
      "Friedman called her replacement \"a very talented designer\", adding: \"He's been working behind the scenes at Miu Miu for two years and it has been the single hottest brand in fashion over that time period.\"",
      "Vitale has helped steer the brand to record profits, which she said was \"mind boggling\" when \"every other brand in the fashion world has declined during that period\".",
      "Versace herself can be proud of how she has successfully transformed from her brother's muse to a fashion powerhouse, Friedman added.",
      "\"She wasn't the person toiling away with pattern-making back in the atelier, but she really did prove herself, and more credit to her.\"",
      "Donatella's final show earlier this month was staged in a tram station in northern Milan, drawing some of the world's biggest celebrities - once again showcasing how her star power has helped keep the brand a talking point in the fashion world.",
      "Friedman said the show, which featured the brand's signature bold aesthetic, \"reflected the fuzziness around the fate of Versace\" by lacking any clear direction.",
      "Her exit was not announced at the show, but many speculated it was coming because the collection featured references to her late brother's final designs from autumn/winter 1997.",
      "Everyone is now talking about what Donatella does next.",
      "A book or documentary about her would undoubtedly be well received. She is also an advocate for several women's and LGBTQ charities, so could increase her input into those in the future. But she will continue to cast a shadow over the catwalk."

      "At a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor.",
      "Given Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.",
      "His autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.",
      "Ms Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe.",
      "\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.",
      "Dr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.",
      "\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"",
      "Dr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.",
      "He said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.",
      "The couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.",
      "His partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said.",
      "\"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\"",
      "Laura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers.",
      "\"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained.",
      "Ms Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself.",
      "Jeffery Gomez said he couldn't understand how no one checked in on the couple for such a long while.",

    "summary": "The Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni feud has shone a light on a part of the entertainment industry that many of those within it would rather remain invisible.",
    "story": [
      "The lawsuits between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni have shed light on a secretive group of people in Hollywood who operate behind the scenes to keep a lid on fallouts and scandals. But in recent years their role has shifted - and their challenges multiplied",
      "Listen to Steven read this article.",
      "\"She's a phony, but I guess the public likes that\u2026\" This is the line that actress Joan Crawford is said to have declared about film star Bette Davis.",
      "The back-and-forth sniping between the pair played out in public in the 1930s and 40s. \"Bette is a survivor... She survived herself,\" Crawford also apparently remarked.",
      "Their tempestuous relationship was so notorious that in 2017 it was made into an Emmy award-winning TV series, Feud.",
      "Hollywood rivalries are of course nothing new \u2013 yet conflicts today rarely play out so publicly. That might be why the dispute between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, which spilled out into the open in December 2024, is still in the headlines three months on.",
      "The subsequent legal battle brought to light a fallout during production of the film It Ends With Us. After the promotional and cinematic run had ended, the pair \u2013 who didn't appear on the red carpet together at the premiere in New York \u2013 filed lawsuits against each other.",
      "Lively has accused Baldoni and others of carrying out a smear campaign against her after she complained about alleged sexual harassment on set. Baldoni, meanwhile, has accused Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds and their publicist of carrying out a smear campaign against him, and claims that she tried to take over control of the film. Both sides deny all allegations.",
      "What emerged as this all played out is that crisis PR managers had been employed. Legal representatives for Lively obtained numerous text messages between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and the crisis team he retained, led by Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake. Ms Nathan was alleged to have texted Ms Abel, \"You know we can bury anyone.\"",
      "Lively has now reportedly taken on the CIA's former deputy chief of staff Nick Shapiro to advise on her legal communications strategy.",
      "While the outcomes of the lawsuits remain to be seen, the feud has cast the spotlight on an industry that would ordinarily remain largely invisible: that is, the publicity machine at work behind the scenes in Hollywood.",
      "\"On every set, there are fights, liaisons\u2026 there are all sorts of things that go on,\" explains Richard Rushfield, founder and columnist at Hollywood newsletter The Ankler. \"Hollywood is a world full of very messy people coming together for these giant projects, where they put together teams quickly to make these things and disband immediately after.",
      "\"Between all that a lot of stuff goes on, and they deal with it quietly \u2013 they're very obsessive about controlling the narrative. When this stuff explodes into the public, beyond control, it makes everyone very nervous.\"",
      "But the world of the Hollywood PR has shifted in recent years, partly because of the growth of social media, which has changed the relationship between celebrities and fans, bringing them into direct contact and removing some of the mystique.",
      "So, what does that mean for the people whose job it is to keep a lid on the industry's messy reality?",
      "From Tom Hardy to Sarah Jessica Parker",
      "Few fallouts have spilled out into the open in recent years \u2013 and those that did were picked over simply because they're so rare. Actor Dwayne Johnson revealed \"a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating\" with his Fast & Furious co-star Vin Diesel, in a 2018 interview.",
      "The stars of another action film, Mad Max: Fury Road, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, are reported to have filmed many of their scenes separately.",
      "And then there were the alleged tensions between Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker, who were co-stars of Sex and the City, which ran for six years. In 2018, after Parker offered condolences for Cattrall's brother's death, Cattrall responded on social media, calling Parker a \"hypocrite\" and stating, \"You are not my family. You are not my friend.\"",
      "But behind the scenes, hundreds of other spats will never see the light of day. \"Some of a publicist's best work may never be seen,\" says Daniel Bee, a publicist and brand consultant based in Los Angeles, \"because it stopped something that was wrong, or re-crafted something to a different narrative, or pointed the light in a different direction.",
      "\"The most interesting stuff I've ever done as a publicist is the stuff nobody will ever know about.\"",
      "'Powerful forces at play'",
      "Since Daniel Bee started out as an entertainment publicist in 1997, he has observed a shift in the wider industry. \"I started my career in the British media, there were 11 national newspapers competing with each other. It was a bear pit, hard work, and it was getting to know individuals via relationships.",
      "\"Now, you're up against an anonymous algorithm and accounts where you don't know who you're up against. It's harder to control than ever before.\"",
      "Certainly, social media has posed challenges for those attempting to control narratives around major films and their stars \u2013 while also heralding new forms of \"dark arts\" through which publicists can attempt to shape opinion.",
      "Dating apps could be in trouble \u2013 here's what might take their place",
      "Nasa needs saving from itself \u2013 but is this billionaire right for that job?",
      "Sneaky Britain? How our moral compasses are changing",
      "\"There has always been an army of advisors and consultants doing PR voodoo,\" says Eriq Gardner, entertainment law expert and founding partner of Puck News. \"While I'd love to say the public is media-literate and savvy enough to read between the lines to see the spin, the truth is there are a lot of powerful forces at play and sometimes a large amount of misinformation.\"",
      "So-called PR voodoo is different now that a celebrity \u2013 or their fans \u2013 can access an audience of millions with a click.",
      "While the publicists of previous eras might only have had to worry about print and broadcast platforms, smartphones and social media mean today's digital landscape is a wild west where anyone can shape their own narrative. A badly judged post or comment can damage an actor's career.",
      "But the flipside is a whole new medium in which PRs can practise their \"voodoo\".",
      "Astroturfing and ways to 'cause mischief'",
      "One of the tactics is \"astroturfing\" \u2013 or disguising an orchestrated campaign as a spontaneous up-swelling of public opinion.",
      "This works by manipulating public opinion and creating a false impression of grassroots support (hence the name) or opposition, often coordinated through social media accounts in a way that seems organic.",
      "The practice isn't new, but has been given new life with the advent of social media algorithms.",
      "\"It's deliberately planting disinformation, or twisted versions of the truth, in certain sections of social media,\" says Carla Speight, founder of the PR Mastery app. \"The aim is the halfway point of influential where they will get a bit of traction, but so that it's not too obvious \u2013 you wouldn't hire a Kardashian to do it.",
      "\"It's built up in layers,\" she continues. \"It's like playing a very sinister game of chess. You're putting all the pieces in the right places, just the right amount of mixed-up information, and then you just watch it explode.\"",
      "Although the posts might appear to be genuine public opinion, in fact it's a faked crowd \u2013 whether that's made up of bots or real people, who can be paid to coordinate their posts.",
      "\"All it takes is one or two people to create a meme and put it with the right people,\" says Ms Speight. \"It needs to appear as a trend, and then it's gone. Something is dripped here, something else over there, and when it's done well\u2026 it causes a bit of mischief.\"",
      "Reinventing an age-old tactic?",
      "But all of this is simply a new platform for an age-old trend that has been going on long before the advent of social media, according to Mr Bee. \"Undetected smear campaigns have always been a thing,\" he points out.",
      "\"Previously it would have been a publicist whispering to a diarist of a national newspaper. The issue with digital media is it's anonymous and untraceable.\"",
      "What has changed, he continues, is that audiences have become savvier. \"Whereas before, a quite subservient audience would just take what was given to them in the media, with natural scepticism, curiosity, and a greater level of information, I think people use more critical thinking.\"",
      "Eriq Gardner is less convinced: \"I'm not sure the public approaches what they read with enough scepticism.\"",
      "And yet those in the industry are often alert to it. According to Ms Speight, \"Usually, there's a distinct sort of tell, and it may be the PR thing where we have 'spidey senses' and we can sort of see it, but you're asking, 'Where has that come from? Who started that?' And when there's never a specific place to point it to, that's usually a tell-tale sign.\"",
      "The Hollywood ecosystem",
      "What's clear, though, is that, with studios providing some publications with significant advertising revenue, as well as supplying talent for special events and front covers, revelations often emerge elsewhere in the media.",
      "\"When [scandals] come out, it's usually from places outside of Hollywood,\" argues Mr Rushfield. \"The Harvey Weinstein story was broken by The New York Times and the New Yorker.\"",
      "It was The New York Times that first reported Lively's legal complaint in December. \"It's one of the few places that can afford to do that, and then everyone else jumped in so nobody was sticking their neck out.\" Baldoni filed a $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times in December, although a federal judge indicated this week that it might be dismissed.",
      "Even when bigger outlets break news about Hollywood disputes, the growing dominance of social media means that stories might not have the same cut-through they had previously.",
      "Doreen St Felix, a writer who was previously an editor on Lena Dunham's newsletter, recently wrote in The New Yorker that stories of harassment and abuse, for example, now receive a \"curdled, cynical, and exhausted reception\" \u2013 this, less than a decade after the emergence of the MeToo movement.",
      "She went on to claim that: \"The late 2010s genre of #MeToo reportage cannot thrive on today's volatile internet. Information is misinformation and vice versa. Victims are offenders and offenders are victims.\"",
      "Sometimes, however, the best way for publicists to prevent stories being amplified is by bypassing social media entirely when reacting to a scandal.",
      "\"If you give it to the press first, they don't quote as many of the comments on social media,\" says Ms Speight. \"You control the narrative completely, because the comments come afterwards.\"",
      "Mr Rushfield points out that very little of the revelations in the entertainment press comes out because someone \"uncovered\" something. \"Almost everything you read is there because somebody placed it there \u2013 somebody is dictating a story.\"",
      "What viewers want",
      "None of this industry would exist if the appetite weren't there and if the viewing public didn't want to unpick details about their lives \u2013 and rifts. And yet attitudes towards celebrity have undoubtedly changed since the advent of social media.",
      "\"It's now a two-way communication, which it never was before,\" points out Mr Bee. \"It was generally celebrities, or lawyer or government or whatever, just saying something that gets reported, and that message is conveyed. Now, you have to be prepared for a two-way conversation.\"",
      "But he thinks there are different attitudes to the media today than in the era of celebrity gossip magazines. Nodding to the UK, he continues: \"We had the Leveson Inquiry, we're about to get an ITV drama about phone hacking \u2013 it's as if the curtain has been lifted.\"",
      "As for the Lively and Baldoni lawsuits, it's not clear how these will play out \u2013 but the very fact that it has so unusually spilled into the public domain is a reminder of how well-oiled the Hollywood publicity machine is the rest of the time. And that is unlikely to change soon.",

      "According to new analysis by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) - which looked at pupil performance after the Covid-19 pandemic - children from the lowest income families are now up to 19 months behind peers by the time they are 16 years old.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told BBC Panorama Covid had led to a \"serious and profound shift\" in attitudes to attendance. She said lockdowns had cast \"a long shadow\" over the life chances of the youngest children.",
      "The latest statistics for persistent absence show 15% of primary children in England have missed at least one in ten days of school this school year - up from about 8% before Covid.",
      "It comes as the gap between the poorest students and other pupils had mainly narrowed before the pandemic, following years of effort by schools.",
      "However, the report suggests it is getting worse. The gap - which is measured using GCSE results - would reduce from 19 months to 15 months of learning if school attendance was the same for all pupils, it says.",
      "Natalie Perera, from the EPI, said it is the first time \"a very clear link\" has been made between how much children from the lowest income families attend school, and how far behind other pupils they have fallen.",
      "Her team looked specifically at children who have received free school meals in the past six years, which means the family income is less than \u00a37,400 a year after tax and not including benefits.",

      "It is five years since the UK went into lockdown, when schools closed to most children.",

      "His parents, Ruby and Charles, really notice the difference between Emaan and his older brother. During the pandemic, Emaan barely went out and met other people.",

      "What do you think it could be?",
      "The answer is noise - and its impact on the human body goes far beyond damaging hearing.",

      "It's just a crisis we don't talk about.",
      "So I've been investigating when noise becomes dangerous, chatting to the people whose health is suffering and seeing if there's any way of overcoming our noisy world.",
      "I started by meeting Prof Clark in an eerily silent sound laboratory. We're going to see how my body reacts to noise and I've been kitted out with a device that looks like a chunky smartwatch.",
      "It's going to measure my heart rate and how much my skin sweats.",
      "You can join in too if you have some headphones. Think about how these five sounds make you feel.",
      "The one I find really grating is the traffic noise from Dhaka, Bangladesh, which has the title of the noisiest city in the world. I immediately feel like I'm in a ginormous, stressful traffic jam.",
      "And the sensors are picking up my agitation - my heart rate shoots up and my skin is sweating more.",
      "\"There's really good evidence that traffic noise affects your heart health,\" says Prof Clark, as the next sound is prepared.",

      "LISTEN: Is noise an invisible killer?",
      "But why is sound changing my body?",
      "\"You have an emotional response to sound,\" says Prof Clark.",
      "Sound is detected by the ear and passed onto the brain and one region \u2013 the amygdala \u2013 performs the emotional assessment.",
      "This is part of the body's fight-or-flight response that has evolved to help us react quickly to the sounds like a predator crashing through the bushes.",
      "\"So your heart rate goes up, your nervous system starts to kick in and you release stress hormones,\" Prof Clark tells me.",
      "All of this is good in an emergency, but over time it starts to cause damage.",
      "\"If you're exposed for several years, your body's reacting like that all the time, it increases your risk of developing things like heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke and type 2 diabetes,\" says Prof Clark.",
      "Insidiously, this even happens while we're fast asleep. You might think you adapt to noise. I thought I did when I lived in a rental near an airport. But the biology tells a different story.",
      "\"You never turn your ears off; when you're asleep, you're still listening. So those responses, like your heart rate going up, that's happening whilst you're asleep,\" adds Prof Clark.",
      "Noise is unwanted sound. Transport - traffic, trains and aeroplanes \u2013 are a major source, but so too are the sounds of us having a good time. One person's great party is another's insufferable noise.",
      "I meet Coco at her fourth-floor flat in the historic Vila de Gr\u00e0cia area of Barcelona, Spain.",
      "There's a bag of freshly picked lemons tied to her door gifted by one neighbour, her fridge contains a tortilla cooked by another and she offers me fancy cakes made by a third neighbour who's training in patisserie.",
      "From the balcony you can see the city's famous basilica, the Sagrada Familia. It is easy to see why Coco has fallen in love with living here, but it comes at a huge price and she thinks she'll be forced to leave.",
      "\"It's extremely noisy\u2026 it's 24-hour noise,\" she tells me. There's a dog park for owners to walk their pooches which \"bark at 2, 3, 4, 5am\" and the courtyard is a public space that is used for everything from children's birthday parties to all-day concerts finished off with fireworks.",
      "She gets out her phone and plays the recordings of the music being blasted out so loud it makes the glass in her windows vibrate.",
      "Her home should be a refuge from the stress of work, but the noise \"brings frustration, I feel like crying\".",
      "She has been \"hospitalised twice with chest pain\" and \"absolutely\" thinks noise is causing the stress, which is damaging her health. \"There is a physical change that I feel, it does something to your body, for certain,\" she says.",
      "In Barcelona there are an estimated 300 heart attacks and 30 deaths a year just from traffic noise, according to researcher Dr Maria Foraster, who has reviewed evidence on noise for the World Health Organization.",
      "Across Europe noise is linked to 12,000 early deaths a year as well as millions of cases of severely disturbed sleep as well as serious noise annoyance which can impact mental health.",
      "I meet Dr Foraster at a caf\u00e9 that is separated from one of Barcelona's busiest roads by a small park. My sound meter says the noise from the distant traffic is just over 60 decibels here.",
      "We can easily chat over the noise without raising our voices, but this is already an unhealthy volume.",
      "The crucial number for heart health is 53 decibels, she tells me, and the higher you go the greater the health risks.",
      "\"This 53 means that we need to be in a rather quiet environment,\" says Dr Foraster.",
      "And that's just in daytime, we need even lower levels for sleep. \"At night we need quietness,\" she says.",
      "Although it is not just about the volume, how disruptive the sound is and how much control you have over it affect our emotional response to noise.",
      "Dr Foraster argues the health impact of noise is \"at the level of air pollution\" but is much harder to comprehend.",
      "\"We are used to understanding that chemicals can affect health and they are toxic, but it's not so straightforward to understand that a physical factor, like noise, affects our health beyond our hearing,\" she says.",
      "A loud party can be the fun that makes life worth living and someone else's intolerable noise.",
      "The sound of traffic has the greatest impact on health because so many people are exposed to it. But traffic is also the sound of getting to work, doing the shopping and taking the children to school. Tackling noise means asking people to live their lives differently - which creates problems of its own.",
      "Dr Natalie Mueller, from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, takes me for a walk around the city centre. We start on a busy road \u2013 my sound meter clocks in at over 80 decibels \u2013 and we head to a quiet tree-lined avenue where the noise is down to the 50s.",
      "But there is something different about this street \u2013 it used to be a busy road, but the space was given over to pedestrians, cafes and gardens. I can see the ghost of an old crossroads by the shape of the flowerbeds. Vehicles can still come down here, just slowly.",
      "Remember earlier in the lab, we found that some sounds can soothe the body.",
      "\"It is not completely silent, but it's a different perception of sound and noise,\" Dr Mueller says.",
      "The initial plan was to create more than 500 areas like this, termed \"superblocks\" - pedestrian-friendly areas created by grouping several city blocks together.",
      "Dr Mueller performed the research projecting a 5-10% reduction in noise in the city, which would prevent about \"150 premature deaths\" from noise alone each year. And that would be \"just the tip of the iceberg\" of the health benefits.",
      "But in reality only six superblocks were ever built. The city council declined to comment.",
      "Urbanisation",
      "The dangers of noise though are continuing to grow. Urbanisation is putting more people into noisy cities.",
      "Dhaka, Bangladesh, is one of the fastest growing megacities in the world. This has brought more traffic and given the city a cacophonous soundtrack of honking horns.",
      "Artist Mominur Rahman Royal earned the label of the \"lone hero\" as his silent protests have focused attention on the city's noise problem.",
      "For about 10 minutes each day, he stands at the intersection of a couple of busy roads with a big yellow placard accusing drivers who honk their horns loudly of causing a massive nuisance.",
      "He took on the mission after his daughter was born. \"I want to stop all honking from not only Dhaka, but from Bangladesh,\" he says.",
      "\"If you see the birds or trees or rivers, no one's making noise without humans, so humans are responsible.\"",
      "But here there are the beginnings of political action too. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who's the environment adviser and minister for the government of Bangladesh, told me she was \"very worried\" about the health impacts of noise.",
      "There is a crackdown on honking horns to get the noise levels down - with an awareness campaign and stricter enforcement of existing laws.",
      "She said: \"It's impossible to get it done in one year or two years, but I think it is possible to ensure that the city becomes less noisy, and when people feel that, they feel better when it's less noisy, I'm sure their habit will also change.\"",
      "The solutions to noise can be difficult, complicated and challenging to solve.",
      "What I'm left with is a new appreciation for finding some space in our lives to just escape the noise because in the words of Dr Masrur Abdul Quader, from the Bangladesh University of Professionals, it is \"a silent killer and a slow poison\".",

    "story": [
      "A cancer charity has said it is \"angry and frustrated\" that ministers and health officials have not approved the provision of a life-extending prostate cancer drug through the NHS in England.",
      "The drug, abiraterone, has been available in Scotland and Wales for two years for high-risk patients whose cancer has not yet spread, but not in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "In a letter to Prostate Cancer UK, seen by the BBC, Health Minister Karin Smyth said the decision by NHS England, following a lengthy review, was \"based on overall affordability\" and that \"it would not be appropriate to intervene\".",
      "The government said urgent advice had been requested on the issue.",
      "The charity said it was a \"dire and urgent situation in England\" with \"a bureaucratic blockage denying men this treatment\".",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We understand the frustration and upset of some patients who cannot access this potentially life-saving treatment. Ministers have requested urgent advice on the issue.\"",
      "Although not a cure, abiraterone can help stop prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body.",
      "In England and Northern Ireland, the drug is only approved for men with very advanced prostate cancer which has spread already.",
      "In Wales and Scotland, people with the disease that has not yet spread can also get it.",
      "Research has shown that for these earlier stage patients, the survival rate after six years is improved and that the drug halved the rate of progression of the cancer.",
      "The charity says many lives could be extended by the drug, given the findings from a trial called Stampede, published in 2022.",
      "It found improved odds of survival among men given the drug alongside usual care, and concluded that abiraterone should be considered a new standard treatment.",
      "According to figures from NHS England, each year about 8,400 patients have high-risk prostate cancer that has not yet spread.",
      "Using the Stampede assumptions, 672 of those men could die prematurely without access to abiraterone.",
      "In October 2023, BBC News spoke to Giles Turner, a retired banker living in Sussex. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier that year but was told that abiraterone could not be obtained on the NHS in England.",
      "He chose to pay for treatment with the drug at \u00a3250 a month. He told us then that he felt \"very fortunate\" to be able to afford it, but outraged for others who could not.",
      "At the time, NHS England said it was reviewing the drug's use for a wider range of men.",
      "However, in December 2024 it told Prostate Cancer UK that \"it has not been possible to identify the necessary recurrent headroom in revenue budgets\".",
      "Because abiraterone is a generic drug which has gone \"off patent\" and is licensed for only one group of prostate cancer patients, there is a complicated process to get it approved for wider use.",
      "Each year, NHS England can make \"discretionary\" investment decisions with a specialist advisory group, but it has chosen not to for this drug.",
      "Smyth's letter earlier this month said the process had to look at \"the overall budget impact of introducing a new treatment based on patient volumes\", and ministers would not intervene.",
      "Mr Turner said he was \"stunned\" that nearly one-and-a-half years after the BBC report, NHS England had not caught up with NHS Scotland and NHS Wales.",
      "He has spent \u00a320,000 so far on his treatment, and said he felt it was wrong that while expensive new patented drugs treatments could be funded, abiraterone - costing the NHS \u00a377 per pack per month - could not be."

    "summary": "As part of Your Voice, Your BBC, we answer questions from you on government plans to scrap NHS England.",
    "story": [
      "The government has announced NHS England will be abolished to \"cut bureaucracy\" and reform how the National Health Service is run.",
      "The changes will not impact anyone's access to the NHS - it will still be free at the point of use and cover all the services it does already.",
      "Around 9,000 administrative roles are being cut at NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care as part of the changes - amounting to roughly half of all roles at the two organisations.",
      "As part of Your Voice Your BBC, we asked for your questions on the plans and what they could mean for you - below we have answered them for you.",
      "What does NHS England do?",
      "NHS England is the administrative body which manages how health services up and down the country are run. It is made up primarily of managers and officials, not the doctors and nurses providing care in hospitals.",
      "The government provides it with money and tells it what its priorities are for the health service - for example, that might be cutting waiting times or improving cancer survival rates.",
      "NHS England's role is to funnel the money it is given into different parts of the health service and work out how to juggle resources in order to bring about the change the government wants to see.",
      "In 2012, NHS England was given more independence by the Conservative-led government. They said doing so would prevent politicians from interfering too much in how front line services are run - but critics say that change has made it harder to carry out reform or drive improvement.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer believes that overhauling management structures will put NHS in England \"back into democratic control\" and free up money for front-line services.",
      "NHS England is also responsible for other functions like overseeing training and collecting data, as well as managing GP services.",
      "There are separate organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so these changes only impact England.",
      "Did this decision come out of the blue?",
      "Within the NHS and Westminster, the writing has been on the wall for NHS England for some months.",
      "Even in the latter years of the Tory government, health ministers expressed frustration that they were not in charge of the day-to-day running of the health service.",
      "When Labour came into power, it was clear Health Secretary Wes Streeting wanted more control of the NHS and saw a lot of duplication and bureaucracy.",
      "NHS England's chief executive Amanda Pritchard recently said she would step down at the end of the March and a number of her senior leadership team have followed suit.",
      "In that respect, it was clear there was going to be significant reform - but this is as big a change as you could possibly get at the heart of the NHS management structure.",
      "What is a 'quango' - and why do ministers think 'bureaucracy' is a problem?",
      "These are two words we have heard the government use a lot when setting out why it is scrapping NHS England and bringing the health service under closer government control.",
      "In this context, bureaucracy is a stand-in word for a system that is particularly complicated, or requires excessive amounts of administration, paperwork, regulations or layers of management.",
      "Starmer made it clear he thinks this sort of admin is getting in the way of delivering health services.",
      "We also heard him describe NHS England as the \"world's largest quango\" - a term that stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "In short, quangos are bodies like regulators and advisory groups, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by central government. They do things on behalf of the government, but are not directly controlled by ministers.",
      "They range from big organisations like NHS England, Network Rail and the Environment Agency to smaller ones like the British Film Institute and Gambling Commission.",
      "Their numbers have fallen by more than half since 2010 because David Cameron's coalition government abolished nearly 300 - but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Labour has set up more than 20 since winning the election last July, including Great British Energy and Skills England.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - when the latest figures were published - was \u00a3353bn.",
      "Will there be more control over decision-making and budgets locally?",
      "We do not yet know all of the detail about how health services in England will be managed in the future but it is likely that some of the responsibilities NHS England currently holds will be devolved down to regional bodies.",
      "One of the arguments being made about NHS reform is that if you move decision-making down to a local level and nearer to patients, it will be health leaders who are more attuned to the needs of patients in the area making those calls.",
      "They will know what local populations need and where the weaknesses are - and that, in theory, could improve services for patients in different parts of the country.",
      "Will this mean an increase in funding to the NHS and better access to medicines?",
      "Thursday's announcement was not about funding - that is expected in the summer.",
      "We already know NHS is getting an uplift of about 3-4% next year and we do not yet know what spending will look like beyond that.",
      "But government sources believe scrapping NHS England will save the government \u00a3500m a year.",
      "On access to medicines, it is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - which is separate from NHS England - which sets the guidelines on what treatments are judged affordable and cost effective.",
      "When a new drug is produced by the pharmaceutical industry, the institute will decide if the NHS can afford it and whether it is better than other drugs that are used.",

      "All private clinics, hospitals and hospices where services are provided by healthcare professionals are legally required to be registered with HIS.",
      "Eddie Docherty, director of quality assurance and regulation at HIS, said: \"Having a cosmetic treatment is a serious undertaking that should only be entered into with due consideration of the very real risks to an individual's health and safety.",
      "\"Bringing together the injecting of Botox, alcohol and a party atmosphere reduces people's judgement, and their ability to properly provide consent and consider the real risks.",

      "Jackie Partridge, clinical director of the Dermal Clinic in Edinburgh, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that such parties were \"really, really dangerous\"",
      "She said dermal fillers were more dangerous than Botox as they can block the blood supply to the skin and cause \"skin death\".",
      "She said: \"If that were to happen in a medical clinic, there's another prescription medication that can be used to dissolve the dermal filler to get out of that dangerous scenario,\" she said.",

      "She said: \"It is very frustrating when there is a double standard out there between somebody like ourselves and others who are registered with HIS versus someone who has done a few hours-long course and might have been a taxi driver, plumber or beautician",
      "\"They then start stabbing the public with something which is a very powerful, prescription-only medication.\"",
      "Ms Partridge added that those in the industry were \"desperately seeking tighter regulation\".",
      "She added: \"If you are going to a home environment, the standards of cleanliness are not going to be there, there are going to be infection control risks, there's going to be very limited patient safety.",

    "story": [
      "Children should completely avoid \"slushy\" ice drinks containing glycerol, which can make them very ill, until they are at least eight years old, say researchers calling for official health advice to change.",
      "The researchers studied the cases of 21 two-to-seven-year-olds in the UK and Ireland who needed emergency treatment soon after drinking a slushy product.",
      "The brightly coloured drinks are designed to appeal to children - but most contain the naturally occurring sweetener glycerol, instead of sugar, to stop them freezing solid and give the slushy effect.",
      "Current Food Standards Agency (FSA) advice says under-fives should avoid the drinks and under-11s should have no more than one.",
      "The advice is due to concerns that if a young child drinks a slushy too quickly, glycerol intoxication could cause shock, hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) and loss of consciousness.",

      "four needed brain scans",
      "one had a seizure",
      "The children all recovered and were discharged from hospital, with advice to avoid slushies.",
      "Parents not aware",
      "Lead study author Professor Ellen Crushell, from Dublin, warned that the 21 cases looked at in the study could be the \"tip of the iceberg\", although she stressed that thousands of children drink slushies worldwide every day without suffering ill-effects.",
      "There could be a \"milder cohort\" who may not need hospital treatment but still suffer symptoms such as \"nausea and vomiting\", she added.",
      "The paediatricians behind the study - all working in the UK and Ireland - say it's difficult for parents to work out how much glycerol is contained in slushy ice drinks.",
      "Recommendations based on a child's weight are hard for parents to interpret, they say, and how quickly a slushy is drunk and whether it's taken with a meal or after exercise can also be factors in the side-effects experienced.",
      "\"Estimating a safe dose is therefore not easy,\" the researchers say, who recommend changing the advice based on a child's age instead.",
      "Dr Sally Anne Wilson, chair of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine's safer care committee, told BBC Breakfast: \"As a parent you want to make sensible decisions for what you buy your child and if you're not aware that there's glycerol in the slushie and what that can do, then you're not going to have any qualms about buying the said slushie.\"",
      "Dr Wilson said age-based advice on the drinks is difficult because there's a variation in children's weight, but added \"there's definitely an argument\" for increasing the minimum age because it would solve that problem.",
      "One reason for the recent rise in children becoming ill may be the lower sugar content of the slushies, which is attractive to parents, the study says.",
      "In countries with no sugar tax, they contain much more glucose and often no glycerol at all, the authors say.",
      "Rebecca Sudworth, director of policy at the Food Standards Agency, said it was considering the finding of the review \"carefully\".",
      "\"We continue to strongly encourage parents to follow [our] advice which is that slushie drinks should not be given to children under four years old. Retailers are also advised to make parents fully aware of this guidance.\"",
      "The FSA added: \"While the symptoms of glycerol intoxication are usually mild, it is important that parents are aware of the risks - particularly at high levels of consumption.\"",

    "story": [
      "Michael Gove has told the Covid inquiry it was \"ludicrous\" to suggest he tried to force through a deal for a new ventilator made by the electronics giant Dyson without proper safety checks.",
      "Emails show a senior official at the health watchdog warned that the former cabinet office minister was trying to \"circumvent the regulatory process\" in March 2020.",
      "Messages between staff at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said Mr Gove did not \"appreciate the level of risk involved\" and was working to a \"totally unrealistic\" timescale.",
      "A provisional order for 10,000 machines was placed at the time, but the deal was scrapped after Dyson failed to win regulatory approval.",
      "No public money was spent on the prototype.",
      "Dyson said it never intended to make a profit from the venture and wrote off around \u00a320m in research and development costs.",
      "Ventilator Challenge",
      "In March 2020, as Covid was spreading across northern Italy, there was a frantic attempt by health authorities to get hold of ventilators to help patients breathe.",
      "The NHS had between 6,000 and 8,000 in stock but modelling suggested it needed 30,000 by the end of June and 90,000 by November to cope with a predicted influx of patients.",
      "On 16 March 2020, the government launched the 'Ventilator Challenge' - a drive to encourage domestic UK suppliers to develop new machines or modify existing designs.",
      "The project was overseen by cabinet office officials and involved the MHRA, which helped draw up initial specifications and squeezed an approval process that would usually take 18-24 months into just weeks.",
      "A number of major companies were involved, including the carmakers Ford and McLaren, and the electronics giant Dyson.",
      "At the time, the company's founder Sir James Dyson held a number of telephone conversations with government officials, including the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson.",
      "The Covid inquiry was shown WhatsApp messages then sent between ministers and government advisers suggesting Sir James was concerned about the pace of project.",
      "On 20 March 2020, Mr Johnson wrote that \"Dyson [was] freaking\" and called for \"Action this day\".",
      "Minutes later ex health secretary Matt Hancock replied, \"I have also received the same. I will talk to Dyson and Michael [Gove] and sort it.\"",
      "Asked about the deal at the inquiry, the government's then chief commercial officer, Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, said it was the only example he could recall in the pandemic where he was asked to put a contract in place \"against commercial guidance\".",
      "Five days later, on 25 March, Boris Johnson wrote another WhatsApp message to the same group saying that: \"Dyson has a ventilator ready to go\u2026 It's safe, effective and loses less oxygen. Rhys Williams has blocked it under the misapprehension that oxygen passes through the motor. That is total b****cks.\"",
      "He accused officials of \"fiddling while Rome burns\" and added: \"Sorry but I'm on a mission. Dyson knows what he's doing and won't risk his global brand reputation delivering dodgy ventilators.\"",
      "'Totally unrealistic'",
      "Sir Gareth said, at that point, the Dyson prototype pushed air from a fan directly into the lungs of patients, something that could cause safety concerns.",
      "The Dyson team did subsequently \"fix\" that part of the design, he added.",
      "Later on 25 March, Sir Gareth wrote to Sir John Manzoni, a top civil servant in the cabinet office, saying that Michael Gove was \"INSISTENT we place an order with Dyson\u2026 contingent on passing clinical and passing MHRA approvals.\"",
      "A provisional \u00a3100,000 order was then placed for the Dyson prototypes, and an email from Michael Gove's private office set out a number of actions that needed be taken quickly including: \"The MHRA and Sir Gareth Rhys Williams to ensure by the end of Friday, [that] the Dyson product has been tested and approved by MHRA\u2026 [and] the final product has started to be manufactured.\"",
      "The following day Graeme Tunbridge, the director of devices for the MHRA, wrote to colleagues warning that Michael Gove was \"keen to press forward with Dyson's proposal to a timescale that is totally unrealistic.\"",
      "He added that Mr Gove \"did not appreciate the level of risk involved in the manufacture and use of ventilators\" and \"wanted to circumvent the expedited regulatory process that has been put in place\".",
      "\"MHRA are doing everything we can to support this but absolutely will not cut any corners when it comes to the issues of critical patient safety,\" he wrote.",
      "Giving evidence to the inquiry, Mr Gove denied he had tried to pressure the MHRA in any way, or that the focus on Dyson meant resources could not be devoted to bids from other companies.",
      "\"Just imagine the situation, if you will, a minister \u2013 Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson \u2013 says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It's inconceivable,\" he said.",
      "The former minister said that the Dyson prototype ultimately \"did not get through testing\" and \"whenever confronted with brute facts about safety or otherwise, I would always accept them.\"",
      "He denied that his private office was instructing the regulator to approve the device saying the language used was simply \"shorthand for 'we would hope that it had been tested and if tested satisfactorily [then] approved by the MHRA to that timescale'\".",
      "In the end the government said the Ventilator Challenge helped scale up the production of three existing models, and approved one new design by the medical devices firm Penlon.",
      "In total, an extra 14,000 devices were delivered over three months, fewer than the government originally planned for as doctors identified other ways of treating the most severe Covid cases.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgev3dvz3jo",
    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 06:06:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The debate has sparked a wider dilemma about the broader purpose of welfare",
    "story": [
      "In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers.",
      "Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests.",
      "The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness.",
      "At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine.",
      "Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce.",
      "The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness.",
      "In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return.",
      "Mapping welfare trends",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. \"Cluster analysis maps\" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.",
      "As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.",
      "The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.",
      "Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.",
      "The data has thrown up answers.",
      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",
      "The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change.",
      "Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary.",
      "Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts.",
      "That's because all of this is in the context of what \"fiscal headroom\" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending.",
      "But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. \"We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,\" a source told me.",
      "\"Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous.\"",
      "Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work.",
      "And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs.",
      "That's why it's no exaggeration to say this month's explosive row about welfare will come to define this Government.",

    "story": [
      "The work and pensions secretary has insisted her planned overhaul to benefits rules will be fair, as Labour MPs wait for details of expected welfare cuts.",
      "Liz Kendall said the plans, to be published on Tuesday, would put rising benefits expenditure on a \"sustainable footing\".",
      "The government insists changes are required to reduce ballooning spending on health benefits, which are predicted to continue rising in the coming years.",
      "But the move has faced opposition with Labour ranks, and has already led charities to warn of the potential impact on vulnerable claimants.",
      "Ministers have already abandoned plans for a one-year freeze to PIP payments, after disquiet from MPs.",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "The proposals to be unveiled on Tuesday are the result of months of work to bear down on rising claims for health-related benefits in the wake of the Covid pandemic and ensure the system is not trapping some claimants out of work.",
      "But they are being unveiled against the backdrop of worsening economic forecasts, which have increased the need to find savings to allow the government to meet its self-imposed rules on future borrowing and spending.",
      "Ministers are expected to shelve plans not to raise personal independence payments (PIP), the main disability benefit in England and Wales, in line with inflation next year after pushback from within Labour.",
      "It is thought that instead the changes announced on Tuesday will now focus on eligibility for PIP, which recipients claim following an assessment to help meet daily living costs from long-term physical or mental health conditions.",
      "Spending on PIP, which is claimed by some people in work, is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill and is projected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "Top-up payments under Universal Credit linked to claimants' health are also expected to feature in the plans. Some of the money saved is expected to be spent on helping jobless claimants back into work.",
      "Speaking in the Commons, Social Security Minister Sir Stephen Timms said the package would look to tackle \"incentives to inactivity\" in the system.",
      "Although he did not offer details, he said the government's proposed changes would promote more \"personalised support\" to help those on benefits find employment opportunities.",
      "But he admitted speculation in the run-up to the official announcement had been a source of \"anxiety\" for claimants, adding: \"I'm sad that that's happened, and that people have been concerned.\"",
      "Kendall said the government would not \"shy away from the decisions that we believe are right to give opportunities to people who can work\" but would also maintain \"security for those who can't\".",
      "She added the changes would ensure \"trust and fairness in the social security system, and to ensure it's there for people who need it now, and for years to come.\"",
      "Labour MPs have been invited to briefings by Downing Street over the past week, but there is significant concerns among many backbenchers.",
      "The Conservatives' shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately questioned Kendall on reports about unease among the Cabinet.",

      "The biggest contributor to this would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.",
      "Claimant numbers, for PIP and Universal Credit payments, have increased significantly in the four years since the pandemic, driven by an increase in those claiming for mental and behavioural problems as their main condition.",

      "How does it save money?",
      "How does it increase the incentives for people to find a job?",
      "And how does it protect those it has concluded are unquestionably reliant on the state, once it has defined who they are?",

      "Charities and MPs warn Starmer over benefits changes",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "Does cutting benefits actually work?",
      "There are two big picture issues the government is wrestling with.",
      "Firstly, there is a towering benefits bill which is projected to continue skywards.",
      "We have seen ministers in recent weeks, from the prime minister down, try to make what they see as the moral case for cutting that bill.",
      "Secondly, the economic backdrop is even worse than it was: the economy is smaller, inflation is higher and interest rate expectations are higher than at the time of the last Budget in the autumn.",
      "The Resolution Foundation, a think tank with a focus on those on low-to-middle income families, also says the number of people in work is falling at a pace consistent with a recession and the chancellor's room for manoeuvre, which was already limited, has vanished.",
      "Both the benefits bill and the economic backdrop point in the same direction, then: a conclusion from ministers the benefits bill has to come down.",
      "The question, then, is how to do it.",
      "In broad terms, it looks like it will become harder to get the personal independence payment, or PIP, which is designed to help those who need extra financial support because of long term physical or mental health concerns.",
      "But it no longer looks like PIP will be frozen for a year, which, after accounting for rising prices, would amount to a cut.",
      "It is also expected that there will be changes to universal credit, with a narrowing of the gap between what is paid to those who are looking for work and those who, due to health issues, are not.",
      "The current system, ministers believe, creates perverse incentives: it is currently rational to try to make the case that you are unable to work as this way you get more money.",
      "The cuts will amount to \u00a35-6bn and around \u00a31bn will be allocated to helping get people back into work.",
      "The Conservatives don't oppose the government's plan to drive down the benefits bill, but question whether its approach is adequately thought through and can work.",
      "There are concerns among some Labour MPs who ask how fair this will be, who will miss out and whether the most in need of support will be adequately supported.",
      "There is also, too, among Labour MPs an awareness that plenty of their constituents passionately believe the benefits bill has to shrink.",
      "It is, of course, possible to hold both these views at the same time.",
      "It is the job of ministers to try to address both these concerns.",
      "It won't be easy.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 06:06:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The debate has sparked a wider dilemma about the broader purpose of welfare",
    "story": [
      "In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers.",
      "Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests.",
      "The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness.",
      "At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine.",
      "Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce.",
      "The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness.",
      "In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return.",
      "Mapping welfare trends",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. \"Cluster analysis maps\" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.",
      "As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.",
      "The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.",
      "Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.",
      "The data has thrown up answers.",
      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",

      "Speaking at a press conference in Westminster, Farage said the defections demonstrated how his party was \"broadening and deepening\".",

      "More controversial and debated elements have been around academy reforms, which may limit academies' powers to manage their pay and working practices differently to schools run by local authorities.",

      "It comes as a leading think tank cut its UK growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 as it downgraded prospects for the global economy over trade war concerns.",
      "The government has made boosting growth its main priority, but the Conservatives said Labour's taxes were harming growth and called on Reeves to set out a \"real plan\".",
      "Reeves told regulators at the 40-minute meeting that the current level of bureaucracy made it \"too slow to get things done\".",
      "\"There are a number of things over the last decade or so that have held back growth, and one of them - if we are honest and you know better than anyone - is the regulatory landscape,\" she said.",

      "The OECD said that for the world economy, growth would slow from 3.2% in 2024 to 3.1% in 2025, largely as a result of the trade tensions sparked by US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on imports into the US.",
      "In response to the OECD's forecast, Reeves said: \"This report shows the world is changing, and increased global headwinds such as trade uncertainty are being felt across the board.\"",
      "The UK economy shrank unexpectedly in January, contracting by 0.1%, which was weaker than forecast, driven mainly by a decline in the manufacturing sector.",
      "Ahead of Monday's meeting with regulators, Reeves said. \"By cutting red tape and creating a more effective system, we will boost investment, create jobs and put more money into working people's pockets.\"",
      "Changes announced by the government include streamlining the environmental regulatory process for major projects including Lower Thames Crossing (subject to planning approval) and future ones such as a Heathrow expansion.",
      "Meanwhile, environmental guidance, including hundreds of pages on protection of bats, will be reviewed, while environmental permits for some low-risk and temporary projects will be removed.",

      "The meetings are focussing on the principles of reform \u2013 not the detail.",
      "The escalating costs and numbers of people designated as unfit for work were set out in a slideshow presentation.",

      "Broadly speaking, though, the parliamentary party has accepted the argument that \u2013 without reform \u2013 the welfare bill is going to become unsustainable in years to come.",
      "And Labour strategists believe that appearing to get a handle on welfare is an essential weapon in the anti-Reform UK armoury.",
      "The strongest argument the government can muster in favour of reform is that too many people who are regarded as long-term sick are in effect thrown on the unemployment scrapheap when, with the right help, they could engage in the world of work.",
      "And it's understood that the Treasury won't swallow up all of the welfare savings.",
      "Kendall will be able to redirect a significant sum \u2013 perhaps as much as \u00a31bn \u2013 into the kind of intensive support which some claimants would need to get off benefits.",
      "This, of course, would be expected to lead to savings in due course but won't bring instant rewards.",

      "Starmer says benefit system unfair and indefensible",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Another argument being made is that the system currently provides a perverse incentive which encourages sickness over work.",
      "If you were to be assessed as having a limited capacity to work or undertake work-related activity you could be paid around \u00a3400 more a month than someone who is unemployed actively looking for work.",
      "That gap is likely to be narrowed.",

      "The Department for Work and Pensions has consulted with charities, but even before the Green Paper has seen the light of day some of those organisations have been firing off denunciatory press releases.",
      "The state of the public finances means the Treasury needs to rein in spending if the chancellor is to meet her own fiscal rules, including having debt fall as a share of national income on a five-year horizon.",
      "The expectation is that PIP payments will be frozen next year \u2013 so their value will erode - and that some of those in receipt of PIP are likely to face re-assessment and may lose their payments entirely.",
      "Loyalty tested to the limit?",

      "We have spoken to some of them who listened to the PM make the case for welfare reform at a private meeting on Monday, or who attended the private meetings on Wednesday.",
      "An attendee said there was too little detail to reach a definitive view but cutting disabled benefits was likely to be a red line. Others were more outspoken.",
      "One told us: \"People won't wear it. The costs of being disabled aren't going down.",
      "\"They cant just force this through like the winter fuel cut.\"",
      "Another said: \"If we're freezing PIP that is unforgivable.",

      "\"But punishing those who are especially vulnerable and have severe disabilities is unacceptable.\"",
      "Another added: \"The government needs to stop talking about everyone who is on disability benefits as if they are all the same because they are not.\"",

      "\"This is still a live conversation,\" one MP said.",
      "Some MPs also felt that the timing of the welfare cuts was wrong.",
      "For example, they said NHS waiting lists needed to come down first \u2013 which should also bring savings in PIP and incapacity benefits - and should be done against the backdrop of a growing, not stagnant, economy.",

      "However one of the 36 signatories to the group's supportive letter to Kendall has withdrawn her name.",
      "Stoke South MP Allison Gardner said on social media that her name should not have been included, because the letter didn't do enough to  reflect the needs of those with severe disabilities who simply can't work.",

      "\"There is a collision coming,\" a Labour insider tells me. Sir Keir Starmer has long been up for fights with his party. But with controversy around every corner, who are the tribes in the party in 2025, and might they fight back?",
      "The party's history is crammed with bitter bust-ups, years when MPs seemed most comfortable to be fighting each other, rather than political rivals.",
      "With a squeeze on benefits coming, there is unease on the back, and the front benches, including in cabinet. The decision on winter fuel payments still causes resentment, and new plans for immigration coming in a white paper later in the spring are likely to be controversial too.",
      "A long-time party observer says: \"Put three Labour people in a room and you'll have a faction.\"",
      "Sir Keir's allies seem pretty confident Labour's ditched that habit of constant scrapping. But No 10 is worried enough to be inviting MPs into Downing Street to make their pitch for the changes to welfare, knowing there'll be upset from the usual suspects and hoping there won't be too much of a backlash on the soft left.",
      "It's also grappling with the massive group of MPs elected last year, with some eager backbenchers actively trying to make Sir Keir's case, unkindly branded by one source as \"toadies\" trying to suck up to the leadership.",
      "So how will the \"usual suspects\", the \"softies\", the \"newbies\" and the \"toadies\" shake down?",
      "There has always been criticism of Sir Keir from the left-hand edge of Labour, not least because he spent the first couple of years in charge squeezing out the hard left, and even kicked out some MPs after the general election for voting against him over the cap on benefits for families with more than two children.",
      "It's common for MPs like Diane Abbott or Nadia Whittome to take pot shots at the prime minister's plans. But now this group is much smaller and less influential than it once was, it can't do much damage on its own. Gone are the days when the Socialist Campaign Group held sway with Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 there are only around 30 MPs in the group these days. But unhappiness about the coming welfare cuts spreads its tentacles far further.",
      "One of those arguing against them told me the vast majority of Labour MPs were in the \"group of resistance\" \u2013 and \"privately some of the cabinet are very against it.\"",
      "There is a whiff of opportunity to force Sir Keir to back down, some believe. \"There is a chance that the old left and the soft left come together,\" another MP tells me.",
      "A source on the left of the party tells me there's \"potential to broaden this out and team up with people who don't want to see benefits cut after 15 years of austerity. The challenge for us on the left is to work with those people - then we'll have a sizeable rebellion.\" It is \"breathtaking\" to see new MPs backing undisclosed changes to benefits for disabled people, they add.",
      "They point to the rebellion against Tony Blair in 1997 when 47 Labour MPs voted against the new government over - you guessed it - cuts to benefits. One hundred MPs abstained. It didn't change the policy, just as a rebellion of that kind of size wouldn't change it this time either, given the PM's huge majority. But it shocked ministers, still in the pomp of their massive victory that year. Could this do the same?",
      "Downing Street evidently is worried - but the resistance on the soft left so far seems, well, rather soft.",
      "Another source tells me there are lots of colleagues who are expressing discomfort, and there are fault-lines, but it's not organised. Some of those who would rather like there to be a rebellion seem to also rather like the idea of someone else organising it.",
      "Rebellions do need organising, effort, energy, and an eagerness to make sparks fly. They also need leaders willing to put their head above the parapet. While the concern is strong, the appetite for a big spat when the plans eventually get to Parliament is less so, at least for now.",
      "It's symbolic of where power is held in the party right now. \"The soft left has been obliterated,\" a senior Labour figure tells me, adding: \"I'm not sure No 10 has the story right and I fear it will be handled badly, but on welfare \u2013 they have got no choice.\"",
      "Ministers are trying to make a moral argument - that sorting out welfare is a mission, that it's better for people's well-being and health to have a job. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, will almost inevitably make that case when he joins us in the studio tomorrow. That argument was made by Labour in the election and in its manifesto. But the second part of the expected plans - squeezing payments to disabled people who may already be struggling - was not.",
      "None of the hordes of Labour MPs elected for the first time in 2024 had taking cash from the worst off on their campaign leaflets or Facebook posts. But are the newbies, barely a year into the job, the kind of tribe to cause trouble? Of course, it's important to note they don't all think the same but talking to some of them, there are some characteristics you can trace.",
      "Remember more than half of Labour's MPs \u2013 243 out of 406 \u2013 are completely new, so understanding their centre of gravity is hugely important. And it seems very different to the previous generations.",
      "One of the newbies told me: \"Even more than the welfare stuff, the moment that was most revealing about how different we are to 1997 was the 3% defence target and the aid cuts.\" This wasn't met with any more resistance than the resignation of International Development Minister Annaliese Dodds and a \"few rumblings\" from inside the party - but for most of the 2024 intake it was a \"no-brainer\", given the need to spend more on defence as the world becomes less secure.",
      "It's not just that Labour's recruits are different, but they note their political upbringing is different too: \"We have come of age politically in a time when chaos is the norm and the world feels like it is continually going to hell\" \u2013 so cutting aid and other policies that are uncomfortable for moderates a generation above \"are not that troubling\".",
      "Indeed, some of the newbies have been unkindly branded \"toadies\" by others, as another source describes them - not just accepting some of the leadership's tougher plans, but even egging them on, busy writing public letters, or giving supportive interviews.",
      "Whether on welfare, defence or planning, another MP describes them as \"pop-up pressure groups\", publicly calling for No 10 to push its reforms harder, and further.",
      "\"Aren't they hilarious?\" a party veteran jokes, gently mocking the ambition of those involved, suspicious that the leadership may have gently encouraged a few aspirant MPs to make their case vigorously and loudly.",
      "A government source acknowledges there is a significant chunk of MPs who want to be helpful to the leadership, but with many in marginal seats, \"they are not swots, they are street fighters\" who are closer to their voters' concerns. They're telling the leadership they can give them space to be more radical on welfare, immigration or getting houses built.",
      "For now, whatever the motivation of the usual suspects, No 10 can enjoy a level of unity in the governing party.",
      "It's also plain that the political operation in government has improved since the summer, in part due to his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, credited by many for bringing a new discipline to the party. \"There is only one tribe,\" a senior figure told me, \"it's Morgan McSweeney's \u2013 it's his way or the high way \u2013 his people are controlling things at the moment.\" That's described differently by others, who say: \"It's Keir's party now.\" And an increasingly confident prime minister abroad has more clout at home.",
      "But the rows over welfare that will bubble up this week and the chancellor's decisions in the Spring Statement next week still certainly matter. Not every MP or activist agrees with the decisions being taken by the centre - but with a whopping majority, the risk is not about losing votes.",
      "It's about a direction of travel and the perception of the party to the public. It matters in the next few weeks on the inside of government because managing unhappiness takes up political time, energy and effort. It matters outside because rows over policy, whether welfare or immigration, create headlines, and headaches, and the danger of giving the public the impression that the party in charge is not pulling together.",
      "That's acknowledged by a government source observing the journey Sir Keir's Labour Party has been on: \"We were united against the hard left, then we were united against the Tories\" - but as the government settles in, it's less clear what the party is united on now.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd3jr7e4n3o",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 18:36:23 GMT",
    "summary": "The government is to set out details of how it will save billions of pounds from the working welfare bill.",
    "story": [
      "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is set to unveil details of how the government plans to cut billions of pounds from the working-age welfare bill.",
      "The focus will be on reducing spending on health-related and disability benefits.",
      "That bill is rising rapidly and many argue it needs to be curbed for the sake of the UK's public finances \u2013 as well as the economic and individual benefits of getting people back into work.",
      "But this is not the first government to seek savings from the welfare budget, and to try to encourage more people into employment.",
      "And charities are warning about the adverse impact on vulnerable recipients.",
      "There are three broad approaches which the government is believed to be examining:",
      "Cutting the level of benefit paymentsTightening the eligibility for benefitsAttempting to get people off benefits and into work",
      "Cutting the level of benefit payments",
      "Tightening the eligibility for benefits",
      "Attempting to get people off benefits and into work",
      "BBC Verify has examined the past 15 years of policies in this area to see what might be effective \u2013 and what risks being counterproductive.",
      "Cutting payments",
      "The working-age health and disability benefits bill has certainly been increasing in recent years, and is rising rapidly.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the official forecaster, has projected that total state spending on these benefits for people in the UK aged between 18 and 64 will increase from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "That would represent an increase from 1.7% of the size of the UK economy to 2.2%.",
      "By 2030, around half of the expenditure is projected to be on incapacity benefit, which is designed to provide additional income for people whose health limits their ability to work.",
      "The other half is projected to be on Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which are intended to help people of working age with disabilities manage the additional day-to-day costs arising from their disability.",
      "One straightforward way for ministers to curb this projected rise would be to hold payments flat in cash terms, rather than allowing them to rise in line with prices each year.",
      "\"Reducing award amounts is the easiest way to get savings in the short term,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.",
      "Freezing incapacity benefits in cash terms until 2030 would save \u00a31bn a year, according to the Resolution Foundation.",
      "But you can only receive incapacity benefit if your income and savings are below a certain level, so freezing payments would impact people who are worse off.",
      "Also, people on disability benefits such as PIP are considerably more likely to be in poverty and material deprivation.",
      "Under previous governments between 2014 and 2020, most working-age benefits did not rise in line with inflation - to save money.",
      "And from 2015, more and more people claimed incapacity benefit.",
      "So cutting the value of individual payments might save some money up front, but still not have a dramatic impact on the overall bill in the longer term if claimants continue to rise.",
      "Tighten eligibility",
      "Rather than cutting the value of these benefits for all recipients, the government could seek to save money by making it harder for people to claim them in the first place.",
      "For instance, the previous government had proposed making it harder for people with mental health conditions to claim PIP, arguing that the monthly payment was not proportionate to the additional financial needs created by their conditions.",
      "But it is important to note that efforts to change the eligibility criteria for these benefits over the past 15 years have not yielded the results hoped for.",
      "PIP was introduced in 2013 to replace the old Disability Living Allowance, with the intention it would lead to savings of \u00a31.4bn a year relative to the previous system by reducing the number of people eligible.",
      "PIP was initially projected to reduce the number of claimants by 606,000 (28%) in total.",
      "Yet the reform ended up saving only \u00a3100m a year by 2015 and the number of claimants rose by 100,000 (5%).",
      "Another attempt in 2017 to limit access to PIP was also reversed.",
      "The reason was that many people appealed against refusals that had been triggered by the tightened eligibility criteria. Also, the emergence of cases in the media which seemed unfair meant ministers, often under pressure from their own backbench MPs, ultimately ordered the eligibility rules to be relaxed.",
      "Official decisions not to award PIP and incapacity benefit to claimants are still often challenged and around two-thirds are ultimately decided in the challenger's favour at an independent tribunal.",
      "\"Britain's chequered history of benefit reform shows that the government should proceed cautiously, rather than rush ahead to find savings which could backfire,\" says Louise Murphy of the Resolution Foundation.",
      "Encourage work",
      "Another way for the government to try to achieve savings is by encouraging more people to come off these benefits and enter work.",
      "Around 93% of incapacity benefit claimants are not in work and the same is true of 80% of PIP claimants.",
      "One potential route to increase employment rates could be regular reassessments of people in receipt of incapacity benefit and a requirement for them to start looking for jobs if they are found to be fit for work.",
      "The fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit in the early 2010s has been attributed by the OBR to reassessments of a large number of people in receipt of an older form of the benefit.",
      "However, an aggressive or onerous reassessment regime could risk imposing distress on people who are unable to work and could also create unexpected distortions in the system.",
      "The OBR has suggested the sanctions introduced to the wider benefits system by the last government, requiring people judged fit to work to be actively looking for employment or risk losing their benefits, had the counterproductive effect of increasing the incentive for people to try to claim incapacity benefits (for which these work-searching requirements did not apply).",
      "Another potential policy avenue to boost employment rates is through providing much greater support to find jobs.",
      "Some advocate increasing government investment in official schemes, working with employers, to help people to enter the workplace.",
      "There have been various schemes designed to achieve this over the past 15 years, though they have not been on a large scale.",
      "Evaluations have shown some positive employment effects from them.",
      "However, the OBR concluded last year that the evidence base was still limited and did not suggest such programmes have, so far, made a \"significant contribution\" to getting people into work.",
      "That implies the official forecaster may hesitate to assume greater state investment in these schemes will pay for itself through higher employment and tax revenues, and result in net savings in public expenditure.",
      "Nevertheless, some experts argue it would make sense for the government to re-assess more regularly whether people in receipt of health and disability benefits are still unable to work and - if their circumstances are found to have changed - to provide them with additional support to get into the workforce.",
      "\"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.",
      "Correction 17 March: an earlier version of this article wrongly stated the percentage of claimants' appeals upheld, based on DWP appeals. The article has been updated to reflect the full proportion, upheld at independent tribunal.",

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to slash the costs of regulation with an \"active government\".",
      "In a speech, he said politicians had chosen to hide behind quangos and he took aim at a \"cottage industry of checkers and blockers slowing down delivery for working people\".",
      "But the key announcement was the abolition of the \"world's largest quango\", NHS England, which works with the government to agree funding and priorities, and oversees the delivery of services.",
      "He announced the government was bringing it back under the control of the Department of Health.",
      "Incoming governments have often sought to cut the number of quangos - but what are they and what do they do?",
      "What is a quango?",
      "Quango stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation, but the government calls them \"arm's length bodies\". They are organisations such as regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled from Whitehall.",
      "They range from huge organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",
      "How many quangos are there?",
      "The number of quangos has fallen by more than half since 2010 but there are still more than 300 across the UK.",
      "Under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, nearly 300 were axed - dubbed the \"bonfire of the quangos\" - in an attempt to improve accountability and cut costs.",
      "Despite Sir Keir indicating he would also like to reduce the role of quangos, the new Labour government has set up more than 20 since winning power.",
      "These include Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals, and Skills England, which aims to support people in finding jobs.",
      "Asked earlier this week if the government was planning another \"bonfire of the quangos\", Downing Street said the PM wanted to see a more \"active and agile state\", rather than \"outsourcing\" decisions to other bodies.",
      "How much do they cost?",
      "Almost 60% of day-to-day government spending is channelled through quangos, with 90% of this going to the largest 10 bodies.",
      "The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - the latest published figures - was \u00a3353.3bn.",
      "Why are they controversial?",
      "Campaign groups like the TaxPayers' Alliance have long criticised quangos, claiming they allow ministers to dodge responsibility for mistakes and can be inefficient and costly.",
      "The Institute for Government think tank says in some cases scrapping public bodies can save money and improve how services are delivered.",
      "It gives the example of how absorbing JobCentre Plus into the Department for Work and Pensions helped cut the department's workforce and office space by a third.",
      "But the think tank argues abolitions also cost money and time in the short term, with services disrupted when powers are transferred.",

      "Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events.",
      "What is the Spring Statement and when is it?",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March.",
      "It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings to Parliament, and alongside this will make her Spring Statement on the economy.",
      "After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond.",
      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to \"give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "That means no big policy announcements are expected on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand.",
      "With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing.",
      "The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029-30 financial year has been wiped out.",
      "Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". Her two main rules are:",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the Treasury has drafted plans for several billion pounds of spending cuts.",
      "It is understood welfare spending is in the firing line, but other government departments will also see budgets pruned.",
      "The government already had concerns about the rising number of benefit claimants and Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system.",
      "The government is also seeking to reorganise the civil service to reduce bureaucracy. It has already announced that NHS England will be scrapped, and other quangos and regulators are also expected to be axed.",
      "The Treasury has blamed global economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty over the outcome of conflicts in Ukraine and Middle East, for raising government borrowing costs.",
      "Possible other announcements that are being reported include:",
      "Reducing the \u00a320,000 tax-free annual limit in cash ISAs, to encourage more people to invest their savings in stocks and shares Confirming details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the prime minister's announcement that UK defence spending will rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",

      "Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax.",
      "The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all.",
      "Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze beyond this to raise about \u00a37bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi.",
      "Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so \"would hurt working people\" and \"take more money out of their payslips\".",
      "Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish, with the Office for National Statistics describing the situation as one of \"weak growth\".",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, while the latest monthly figures show it contracted by 0.1% in January.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand.",
      "Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation."

      "In April 2010, when Gordon Brown was prime minister.",

      "The UK has a 20% standard VAT rate, which could potentially mean the UK being hit by a substantial reciprocal tariff from the US.",
      "While the UK is not yet retaliating, the European Union has already confirmed it plans to impose tariffs on 26bn euros (\u00a322bn) a year worth of goods imported from America.",
      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",
      "Moreover, the vast majority of economists are also extremely sceptical about the likelihood of tariffs achieving many of these goals.",

      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",

      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolous Petropolous, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",

      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",

      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolous Petropolous, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",

    "summary": "The president once derided attempts to develop new green technology as a \"green new scam\" - but his deal could help boost the US's potential in the sector",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Esme read this article",
      "Donald Trump's return to the White House is a \"major blow to global climate action\". So said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, after he was elected in November.",
      "Since taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from what is considered the most important global climate pact, the Paris Climate Agreement. He has also reportedly prevented US scientists from participating in international climate research and removed national electric vehicle targets.",
      "Plus, he derided his predecessor's attempts to develop new green technology a \"green new scam\".",
      "And yet despite his history on the issue of climate, Trump has been eager to make a deal with the Ukrainian president on critical minerals. He has also taken a strong interest in Greenland and Canada \u2013 both nations rich in critical minerals.",
      "Critical mineral procurement has been a major focus for Trump since he took office. These minerals are crucial in industries including aerospace and defence, but intriguingly, they have another major use too - to manufacture green technology.",
      "So, could Trump's focus on obtaining these minerals have a knock-on effect, and help unlock the US's potential in the green technology sector?",
      "The Elon Musk effect?",
      "Trump's right-hand man understands more than most the importance of critical minerals in the green transition. Space X and Tesla \u2013 the companies Elon Musk leads - rely heavily on critical minerals like graphite (in electric vehicles), lithium (in batteries) and nickel (in rockets).",
      "Elizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium.",
      "She says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors.",
      "Within two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Such has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: \"Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.\"",
      "He went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow.",
      "The US position in the global race",
      "The weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: \"The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Failure to do so, it warned, could cause \"defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies\".",
      "China's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers.",
      "\"China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,\" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.",
      "Daisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. \"You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country.\"",
      "Some minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply \u2013 like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray.",
      "China has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock).",
      "\"China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,\" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC.",
      "She says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten.",
      "What is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).",
      "\"I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,\" he says. \"It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money.\"",
      "As he puts it, it is a \"happy coincidence\" that this could end up supporting green technology.",
      "The key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector.",
      "A stark warning for the US",
      "In the early days, the green transition was \"framed as a burden\" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward.",
      "The Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels.",
      "By August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (\u00a3382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor.",
      "And yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer.",
      "But Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening.",
      "\"The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,\" explains Ms Gray.",
      "\"Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US.\"",
      "Whispers of another executive order",
      "There could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a \"Critical Minerals Executive Order\", which could funnel further investment into this objective.",
      "The exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants.",
      "Although work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. \"If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years.\"",
      "As a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed \"big, beautiful bill\" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month.",
      "Analysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment.",
      "MIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the \"battery belt\" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive.",
      "He adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years.",
      "If Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation.",
      "Carl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. \"In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA.\"",
      "He also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA \u2013 although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. \"If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess.\"",
      "But the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. \"When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement.\"",
      "For those in the climate space, Trump is certainly not an environmentalist. What's clear is he is not concerned with making his legacy an environmental one but an economic one - though he could achieve the former if he can be convinced it will boost the economy.",

      "His order - which was followed by another from Maryland - applies to thousands of probationary workers who were fired at a range of departments, including defence, energy, treasury, and veterans affairs.",

      "\"That should not have been done in our country,\" Judge Alsup said. \"It was a sham in order to avoid statutory requirements.\"",
      "Danielle Leonard, a lawyer representing a coalition of government employee unions, said probationary employees were targeted because they lacked the right to appeal.",

      "Responding to the first ruling, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Judge Alsup of singlehandedly \"attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the executive branch\".",

      "The site, which is the most popular in the UK among young gamers aged eight to 12, has been dogged by claims of some children being exposed to explicit or harmful content through its games, alongside multiple reported allegations of bullying and grooming.",
      "But its co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki insisted that the company is vigilant in protecting its users and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on the site.",
      "When asked what his message is to parents who don't want their children on the platform, Mr Baszucki said: \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox.\"",
      "\"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions,\" he told BBC News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Responding to the interview, Mumsnet boss Justine Roberts said parents on the forum had spoken of how they struggled to manage their children's use of Roblox.",

      "Gaming giant",
      "US-based Roblox is one of the world's largest games platforms, with more monthly users than Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation combined. In 2024 it averaged more than 80 million players per day \u2013 roughly 40% of them below the age of 13. Its vast empire includes some 40 million user-generated games and experiences.",
      "In the UK the Online Safety Act, which comes in to force in April, has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms.",
      "But Mr Baszucki says he remains confident in Roblox's safety tools and insists the firm goes above and beyond to keep its users safe.",
      "\"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many,\" he says.",
      "\"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement.\"",
      "Players who choose not to display what he calls \"civility\" can face temporary time-outs and longer bans, and Roblox claims to analyse all communications that pass between members on the platform, increasingly using more advanced AI systems and other tech to do so \u2014 and anything flagged is sent for further investigation.",
      "In November last year, under 13s were banned from sending direct messages, and also from playing in \"hangout experiences\" which features chat between players.",
      "Safety filters bypassed",

      "While the filters caught our attempts to overtly move the conversation onto a different platform, we found easy ways to re-word requests to chat elsewhere and make suggestions about playing more adult games.",
      "When we showed the Roblox boss these findings, he argued that our example highlighted the comparative safety of Roblox: that people felt they had to take content which might breach Roblox's rules to other platforms.",
      "\"We don't condone any type of image-sharing on our own platform, and you'll see us getting more and more, I think, way beyond where the law is on this type of behaviour,\" Mr Baszucki says.",
      "He admits there is a delicate balance between encouraging friendships between young people, and blocking opportunities for them come to harm, but says he is confident Roblox can manage both.",
      "We also put to him some Roblox game titles that the BBC has discovered were recommended by the platform to an 11 year-old recently, including:",
      "'Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP''Special Forces Simulator'''Squid Game''Shoot down planes\u2026because why not?'",

      "Mr Baszucki describes his younger self as \"less of a gamer, and more of an engineer\", and the pair's first company was an education software provider called Knowledge Revolution. But they soon noticed that kids weren't only using the product to do their homework.",
      "\"They wanted to play and build stuff. They were making houses or ships or scenery, and they wanted to jump in, and all of that learning was the germination of Roblox,\" he says.",
      "The name Roblox was a mash-up of the words \"robot\" and blocks\" \u2013 and it stuck. The platform grew quickly in popularity \u2013 and there were also early warning signs of its future issues.",
      "Mr Cassel noticed some players \"starting to act out\" and not always behaving in a \"civilised\" way a couple of months after it launched, recalls Mr Baszucki.",
      "He says the roots of building a \"trust and safety system\" therefore began \"very, very early\" and that in those earlier days there were four people acting as safety moderators.",
      "\"It kind of is what launched this safety civility foundation,\" he adds.",
      "But despite attracting decent numbers, it was a year later, when the firm launched its digital currency Robux, that it really started to make money.",
      "Players buy Robux and use it to purchase accessories and unlock content. Content creators now get 70% of the fee, and the store operates on dynamic pricing, meaning popular items cost more.",
      "Mr Baszucki says there was some initial resistance among the leadership team about Roblox becoming more than a hobby for its players, with the introduction of a digital economy.",
      "Robux stayed, and the firm is now worth $41bn (\u00a331bn).",
      "Its share price has fluctuated since it went public in 2021, but overall Roblox shares are worth about one third more than they were six months ago, at the time of writing. Like many big tech firms its value peaked during Covid, when lockdowns meant millions of people were indoors.",
      "Mr Baszucki compares his experience of building Roblox with how Walt Disney may have felt about his creations.",
      "He describes his job as \"a little like having the opportunity he had a long time ago when he was designing the Magic Kingdom\", and is focused on Roblox's ongoing evolution into a Metaverse-style experience where people go about their daily lives in a virtual world, in avatar form.",
      "They have also been public in their ambitions to eventually attract 10% of the world's gamers.",

      "Then Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China, and overnight Deena found herself paying a 25% surcharge on every cable and component she imported \u2013 up from zero previously.",

      "At the same time, the US president is now targeting Mexico - another major electronics supplier. And while domestic manufacturing in the US has increased, partly due to tariffs, it is still limited by higher costs and stricter regulations.",

      "Research suggests that companies pass on a large proportion of the costs of tariffs by putting up prices. Earlier this month Corie Barry, boss of US electronics retailer Best Buy, said that the \"the vast majority\" of the new tariffs will \"probably be passed on to the consumer\" because vendors in the industry have such small margins.",
      "In February, Taiwanese firm Acer said the price of its laptops would likely rise by 10% based on the 10% duties in place on China at the time, while US group HP has warned its profits would be lower because of the tariffs.",

      "During Mr Trump's first term, companies such as Apple successfully secured exemptions for products, and we may yet see carve-outs.",

      "Fears of a US economic slowdown could also make him change course.",
      "For the time being, though, tensions look likely to escalate. China, Mexico and Canada have vowed to retaliate against any US duties imposed on them, and this week Mr Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium only to row back at the last minute.",
      "He plans to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the rest of the world soon, and threatened tariff increases of up to 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail.",
      "There is a risk this could drive up the price of tech goods around the world if China is forced to relocate manufacturing to countries where labour costs are higher. Moreover, countries may hit back with tariffs on imported US technology.",

      "A group of scientists due to work together for months at a remote Antarctic research station has been rocked after a member of the team was accused of assault.",
      "About 10 researchers typically stay at the South African-run base, which sits about 170km (about 105 miles) from the edge of the ice shelf and is difficult to reach.",
      "But a spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC \"there was an assault\" at the station, following earlier allegations of inappropriate behaviour from inside the camp.",
      "In a further message seen by the BBC, the South African environment ministry said it was responding to the concerns with \"utmost urgency\".",
      "South Africa's Sunday Times, which was first to report the story, said members of the team had pleaded to be rescued.",
      "The ministry also said that those in the team had been subject to \"a number of evaluations that include background checks, reference checks, medical assessment as well as a psychometric evaluation by qualified professionals\", which all members had cleared.",
      "The Sanae IV research base is located more than 4,000km from mainland South Africa and harsh weather conditions mean scientists can be cut off there for much of the year.",
      "The current team were expected to be at the Sanae IV base until December.",
      "South African research expeditions have been taking place since 1959. The team to the Sanae IV base typically comprises a doctor, two mechanics, three engineers, a meteorological technician and a couple of physicians.",
      "These expeditions, with harsh weather conditions mandating a lot of time spent in a confined indoor space, normally run without incident, and team members have to undergo a range of psychological assessments before travelling.",
      "But on Sunday, South Africa's Sunday Times reported that one member of the team had sent an email warning of \"deeply disturbing behaviour\" by a colleague and an \"environment of fear\".",
      "A South African government spokesperson told the BBC that the alleged assault was triggered by \"a dispute over a task the team leader wanted the team to do \u2013 a weather dependant task that required a schedule change\".",
      "Incidents in Antarctica are rare, but not unprecedented. In 2018 there were reports of a stabbing at the Russian-operated Bellingshausen research station.",
      "Psychologists point to the effect that isolation can have on human behaviour.",
      "\"One thing we know from these rare occurrences, when something bad happens in enforced isolation or capsule working, is that it's often the small things, tiny things that can blow up into conflict,\" said Craig Jackson, professor of workplace health psychology at Birmingham City University, and a chartered member of the British Psychological Society.",
      "\"So issues about hierarchy, about workload allocation, even small things about leisure time or rations or food portions can rapidly flare up to become something much larger than they typically are,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Gabrielle Walker, a scientist and author who has been on expeditions to Antarctica, said working in such close proximity to a small group of colleagues had risks.",

      "Sources within the Antarctic research community have told the BBC that South Africa has access to an ice-capable ship and aircraft if needed.",
      "But any rescue operation would have to contend with the harsh climate, with temperatures well below freezing and the possibility of strong winds.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has said \"many\" pardons issued by Joe Biden are void because the former president signed them with \"autopen\" - a device which reproduces a person's signature - rather than by hand.",
      "Trump did not provide evidence for his claim - which was posted on Truth Social.",
      "BBC Verify has found several instances of Biden signing pardons by hand rather than by autopen.",
      "And a sample presidential signature is used on US government documents when they are stored in the Federal Register - a digital archive. This was the case under Trump as well as under Biden.",
      "Legal experts also told us that there is nothing in US law which would invalidate pardons signed by autopen.",
      "Did Biden sign pardons using autopen?",
      "On Truth Social, Trump said that: \"The 'Pardons' that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!\".",
      "Trump didn't specify which pardons he was referring to but he has previously referred to the house select committee investigating the 6 January riots as the \"unselect committee\", and has criticised Biden for pardoning family members.",
      "BBC Verify looked through official photographs of Biden in the White House and ones posted on the official White House X account and found a number of examples of him signing pardons by hand.",
      "In October 2022, Biden was pictured signing an order pardoning those in jail for marijuana possession.",
      "In the same year, he also signed a pardon for non-violent offenders.",
      "It is not known whether Biden has signed any pardons only using autopen.",
      "In May last year, CNN did report that he signed a bill for a one-week extension for federal aviation funding using autopen.",
      "BBC Verify has asked Biden's office for his record of using autopen and the White House for the evidence behind Trump's claim.",
      "Trump appears to have taken his cue from the Oversight Project - part of the Conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation - which has claimed that Biden's 19 January pardons - of some family members and political figures including Anthony Fauci - all had the same autopen signature.",
      "We have asked the Heritage Foundation for its workings. Previously, it has highlighted other Biden documents which it says had autopen signatures, along with screenshots taken from the Federal Register.",
      "The register is the official, daily publication of various presidential and other government documents - which all have a standard signature created from a single sample.",
      "A National Archives spokesperson told the fact-checking website Snopes that: \"At the beginning of each administration, the White House sends a sample of the President's signature to the Federal Register, which uses it to create the graphic image for all Presidential Documents published in the Federal Register,\"",
      "We looked through presidential documents archived by the Federal Register under both Trump administrations and found identical signatures on documents.",
      "That includes Trump's pardons for the 6 January rioters.",
      "Trump had already signed these pardons by hand, as this video showed in January.",
      "Are documents signed with autopen legally binding?",
      "Legal experts who we spoke to told us that there is nothing in US law which says official documents signed by US presidents - including pardons - are not legally binding if they were signed with autopen.",
      "Andrew Moran, a politics professor at London Metropolitan University, says that previous presidents have used autopen before.",
      "\"On lower-level importance documents, it's not unusual for an autopen to be used.",
      "\"But I would have thought that with something as serious as a pardon Biden would have actually signed it [by hand]\", he said.",
      "A 2005 memo from the Department of Justice during the Bush administration stated that the President does not have to physically sign a bill for it to become law.",
      "\"The President may sign a bill within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the President's signature to such a bill, for example by autopen\", the memo said.",
      "Although George W. Bush did not use autopen himself, President Obama used it in 2011.",
      "Autopen has also been used by earlier presidents including JFK and Harry Truman.",
      "Can presidents declare pardons void?",
      "Professor Erin Delaney, director of the Global Centre for Democratic Constitutionalism at UCL, says that an attempt by Trump to rescind Biden's pardons would be a \"violation of unwritten constitutional norms\".",
      "Critically, he would not be able to pursue this action without prosecuting, or re-prosecuting the individuals who were given immunity, she argues.",
      "Legally challenging Biden's pardons because of autopen would also call into question other aspects of US governance that use automatic signatures, such as bills passed by Congress and signed into law by the president, she added.",
      "Professor Moran says that a president revoking his predecessor's pardon is extremely rare.",
      "\"Historically, the only example I'm aware of is towards the end of Andrew Johnson's presidency in the 1860s, when he issued some pardons which were revoked before they were accepted. But that's a very small number.",
      "\"If he [Trump] decides that he wants to go after the people who were pardoned, that will end up in the courts and then that would become the point where the constitution is really tested\", he said.",

      "However, the situation now is very different to last August. Military analysts estimate two-thirds of the 1,000 sq km gained at the outset have since been lost.",
      "Any hopes that Ukraine would be able to trade Kursk territory for some of its own have significantly diminished.",
      "Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had \"accomplished its task\" by forcing Russia to pull troops from the east and relieve pressure on Pokrovsk.",

    "summary": "The prime minister hopes to achieve solid support as he visits the UK and France, writes Lyse Doucet.",
    "story": [
      "Two European politicians, dressed symbolically in red and white, sent a message last week to Canada on social media declaring \"we've got your back\".",
      "Also signalling support was King Charles, who planted a red maple tree on the grounds of Buckingham Palace and wore his Canadian medals during a high-profile visit to a naval warship.",
      "Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney has arrived in Paris before heading to London on Monday - a day after his 60th birthday - for his first foreign visit hoping to achieve more than symbolic encouragement. He wants solid support from allies.",
      "Not only is Canada being targeted, like Europe, by a raft of swingeing US tariffs, but Donald Trump is making it clear he wants to take over his northern neighbour.",
      "\"We appreciate all the symbolic gestures but we need more public backing,\" a Canadian official told me in a voice which underlined the nervous disbelief shared by most Canadians \u2013 Trump is not joking when he calls Canada the United States's \"51st state\".",
      "The official messaging from Ottawa about Carney's trip underlines his priorities - finance and fortifying security \u2013 a natural fit for the economist who headed the central banks in both Canada and the UK. A statement from his office said his visit is meant \"to strengthen two of our closest and longest-standing economic and security partnerships\".",
      "His itinerary is full of great symbolism too.",
      "Carney revealed it on Friday during his first speech as prime minister when he hearkened back - with a shiny polish -  to the origins of this former colony. He hailed \"the wonder of a country built on the bedrock of three peoples: indigenous, French and British\".",
      "So there's a third destination on this whistle-stop tour \u2013 Iqaluit, the capital of Canada's northernmost territory of Nunavut and homeland of its Inuit people. That stop, the statement emphasised, was to \"reaffirm Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty\".",
      "Spectacular Arctic and northern terrain makes up 40% of the land mass of the world's second largest country. Protecting it is a critical Canadian concern in the midst of intensifying rivalry among world powers in the Arctic region, which has drawn in the US, Russia, China and more; it's the cold war of all cold wars.",
      "And there's a personal twist. Carney was born in the small town of Fort Smith in the Northwest Territories, which lies next to Nunavut.",
      "His schedule underlines that he also needs to be a quick study in a new skill - retail politics. A federal election, which has to be held by October, is expected to be called very soon. Carney needs to prove that he can engage with voters, in English and French, as naturally as he does with bankers and finance bosses.",
      "And he needs a proper political mandate. He secured a whopping 86% of the vote when his Liberal Party chose to replace Justin Trudeau, who stepped down as prime minister amid growing calls to resign from his own party after a decade at the top.",
      "But Carney doesn't have a seat in parliament; he still doesn't have the vote of Canadians.",
      "His Liberal party has just experienced a dramatic reversal, a \"Trump bump\" as well as a Trudeau one. The party which seemed certain to lose, and lose badly, is now tied with its main Conservative rivals in the polls.",
      "Looking like a world leader, and understanding the world of tariffs and trade, is a good look when you are running for high office in the dark shadow of an external threat.",
      "\"I think part of the purpose of Mark Carney's trip to Europe is to show that he can talk internationally to other like-minded powers at this very important moment,\" reflects the eminent Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan.",
      "Back home, voters will decide if that is what counts.",
      "Carney is certain to talk Trump tactics, in private, with France's President Emmanuel Macron and Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. They've both taken great pains to flatter the US president in public, and press their case behind closed doors.",

      "Watch: Trump and Macron's history of intense handshakes",
      "Watch: Trump and Macron's history of intense handshakes",
      "Canada's new top talker has been talking tough.",
      "A week ago, when Carney won his party's leadership contest, he invoked Canada's national sport, ice hockey, which has long been locked in rivalry with US teams. \"Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,\" Carney declared to rousing applause.",
      "\"Make no mistake, Canada will win.\"",
      "But everyone knows this is no game. Carney described this escalating trade war as \"the greatest crisis of our lifetime\". More than 80% of Canada's exports cross the border to the US.",
      "And while there have been a few reports of Canadians flying the US flag, a recent poll by the Angus Reid Institute underlined that a thumping 91% of Canadians reject becoming the 51st state.",
      "Canada says too little, too late as Trump flip-flops on tariffs",
      "Canada says too little, too late as Trump flip-flops on tariffs",
      "On Friday, in Ottawa's icy cold weather, Carney struck a warmer tone, highlighting how he and Trump share a background in business, including real estate.",
      "\"The president is a successful businessperson and dealmaker. We are his largest client in so many industries,\" he remarked. \"Clients expect respect and working together in a proper commercial way.\"",
      "Carney says he \"looks forward\" to speaking with President Trump. But the fact it will be a call, not a visit, is a measure of this moment. Traditionally, the first foreign visit of a Canadian leader is to the US - its closest neighbour and most trusted partner.",
      "On Monday, Carney is expected to sit down with King Charles, Canada's head of state. The British monarch recently expressed his \"deepest affection\" for Canada, and is said to have already penned a private letter to the new prime minister.",
      "In his non-political role, showing love in public may be the limits of the King's power. But even that sends a message to the American president.",
      "Sir Keir has described Canada as \"an ally, and a very important ally too\". But last week, the head of Britain's Liberal Democrats Ed Davey called on him to show more public support for Canada to oppose the \"shocking attacks\" on its sovereignty.",
      "This may be a week of that old adage in diplomacy and politics \u2013 \"to do something and be seen to be doing it\"."

      "What is Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang targeted by Trump?",
      "What is the act?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act grants the president of the United States sweeping powers to order the detention and deportation of natives or citizens of an \"enemy\" nation without following the usual processes.",
      "It was passed as part of a series of laws in 1798 when the US believed it would enter a war with France.",
      "The act states that \"whenever there shall be a declared war [...] or any invasion or predatory incursion shall be perpetrated, attempted, or threatened\" against the US, all \"subjects of the hostile nation or government\" could be \"apprehended, restrained, secured and removed, as alien enemies\".",
      "When else has it been used?",
      "The act has only been previously used three times - all during times of conflict involving the US.",
      "It was last invoked in World War Two, when people of Japanese descent - reportedly numbering about 120,000 - were imprisoned without trial. Thousands were sent to internment camps.",
      "People of German and Italian ancestry were also interned during that time.",
      "Before that, the act was used during the War of 1812 and World War One.",
      "What's Trump said - and what's been the reaction?",
      "Though this is the first time the act has been used by Trump, it is not the first time he has mentioned it.",
      "At his inaugural address in January, he said he would invoke the act to \"eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil\".",
      "In his proclamation on Saturday, Trump invoked the wording of the act by accusing TdA of threatening an \"invasion\" against the US. He declared its members \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies\".",
      "Trump's decision has been criticised by rights groups. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued to stop the removals on the grounds that the US was not at war.",
      "Speaking to BBC News on Sunday, Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU, said: \"There's no question in our mind that the law is being violated.\"",
      "A federal judge attempted to stop the use of the law to carry out the deportations, but the White House said this had had \"no lawful basis\", and that the removals had already taken place.",
      "Reacting to a news article covering the judge's order, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele wrote on social media: \"Oopsie... Too late.\"",
      "Venezuela criticised Trump's use of the act, saying it \"unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration\" and \"evokes the darkest episodes in the history of humanity, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps\".",
      "Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said in a statement that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act was illegal.",
      "\"The only reason to invoke such a power is to try to enable sweeping detentions and deportations of Venezuelans based on their ancestry, not on any gang activity that could be proved in immigration proceedings\", she added."

      "Tren de Aragua was originally a prison gang that Hector Guerrero Flores turned into a \"transnational criminal organisation\", according the US state department, which is offering a reward of $5m for information that could lead to his arrest.",
      "Guerrero Flores, 41, was in and out of Tocor\u00f3n for more than a decade.",

      "Luis Izquiel, a criminology professor at the Central University of Venezuela, told the BBC that the union controlled a section of the railway that crossed Aragua and would extort contractors and sell jobs on work sites.",
      "Tren de Aragua has under Guerrero Flores's leadership expanded into Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile and diversified from extorting migrants into sex-trafficking, contract killing and kidnapping.",
      "How big is the gang?",
      "By most accounts, Tren de Aragua spread out of Venezuela when the country entered a humanitarian and economic emergency in 2014 that made crime less profitable, and now is believed to have nodes in eight other countries, including the US.",
      "The group, in part, operates by forming alliances and partnerships with local criminal organisations.",
      "In Ecuador, for example, the gang is believed to work with groups loosely affiliated with Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, while in Colombia some have alleged that they have worked with members of the left-wing National Liberation Army guerrilla group, or ELN.",

      "Others have estimated its membership at roughly half that figure.",
      "A prosecutor in Chile has called Tren de Aragua a \"brutal organisation\" that uses murder and torture to achieve its aims.",

      "He said the gang was engaged in \"irregular warfare\" against the US at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Shortly after taking office in January, Trump also declared Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organisation, placing the group in the same category as the Islamic State and Boko Haram, Nigeria's Islamist militants.",

    "summary": "Dhaka and Islamabad are growing closer after years of mistrust, but what does this mean for India?",
    "story": [
      "The dramatic political developments in Bangladesh that led to prime minister Sheikh Hasina being ousted last year have thrown up many surprises - including Dhaka's growing closeness with one-time foe Pakistan.",
      "Last month, after decades of troubled relations, the two countries began directly trading for the first time, with Dhaka importing 50,000 tonnes of rice from Pakistan. Direct flights and military contacts have also been revived, visa procedures have been simplified, and there are reports of co-operation on security matters.",
      "The countries - separated by the landmass of India - have deep, painful historical ties. The animosity between them goes back to 1971, when Bangladesh - then known as East Pakistan - launched a struggle to gain independence from Islamabad. India supported the Bengali rebels during the nine-month war which led to the formation of Bangladesh.",
      "While the scars from that period run deep, Dhaka had cordial relations with Islamabad between 2001 and 2006, when a coalition of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami governed the country.",
      "This changed during Hasina's 15-year rule from 2009 - when she was strongly backed by Delhi and maintained a distance from Pakistan. But after she fled to India following mass protests against her government, ties seem to be thawing.",
      "\"For the past 15 years, the Pakistan-Bangladesh relationship was on a slightly difficult trajectory,\" says Humayun Kabir, a former senior Bangladeshi diplomat, adding that the relationship seems to now be returning to that of \"two normal neighbours\".",
      "The developments are being watched closely, particularly in India, which has a long history of hostile relations with Pakistan.",
      "Relations between Dhaka and Delhi have been frosty since Hasina's exit. India has not reacted to Bangladesh's demands to extradite her to face charges of crimes against humanity, money laundering and corruption. Hasina denies the accusations against her.",
      "Some experts think the reviving of relations between Dhaka and Islamabad is a strategic move.",
      "\"Pakistan and Bangladesh have a tactical relationship at the moment. Together, they want to represent a pushback against the dominance of India,\" says Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani academic who is a senior fellow at King's College in London.",
      "There have been other developments apart from starting direct trade.",
      "Muhammad Yunus, head of the interim Bangladesh government, met Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at multilateral forums several times in recent months.",
      "And then there is a growing military relationship.",
      "A high-level Bangladeshi military delegation made a rare visit to Pakistan in January and held talks with influential army chief General Asim Munir. The Bangladeshi navy also participated in a multinational maritime exercise organised by Pakistan off the Karachi coast in February. .",
      "Veena Sikri, who was India's high commissioner to Bangladesh between 2003 and 2006, describes the growing closeness between Dhaka and Islamabad as a \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\" moment.",
      "During her tenure in Dhaka, she said, India repeatedly raised the issue of \"Indian insurgents getting trained inside Bangladesh with the support of the ISI [Pakistan's intelligence agency] and a section of the Bangladeshi military\".",
      "\"We even provided evidence to Bangladeshi authorities,\" she said.",
      "Authorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh denied these allegations at the time.",
      "The long, porous border between India and Bangladesh makes it relatively easy for armed insurgent groups from India's north-eastern states to cross over from Bangladesh. But, after Hasina's Awami League came to power in 2009, it cracked down on these groups and dismantled their bases.",
      "So the revival of military ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan is \"a major security concern for India\", says Ms Sikri.",
      "\"It's not just the military relationship. The Pakistani establishment is also reviving ties with Bangladeshi Islamist parties like the Jamaat-e-Islami, which supported Islamabad during Bangladesh's independence war,\" she adds.",
      "The Yunus administration's press office has flatly rejected Indian media reports that senior ISI officials have visited Dhaka. It has also described reports that claim Pakistani operatives were working to reopen a camp of an Indian insurgent group in Bangladesh as \"baseless\".",
      "Pakistan's military did not respond to BBC questions on India's concerns over the future role of the ISI in Bangladesh.",
      "Analysts say Bangladeshi politicians are aware that, given the close economic and linguistic ties, Dhaka cannot afford to take an anti-India stance.",
      "And despite apprehensions in Delhi, Bangladeshi diplomats argue that ties with Pakistan cannot be normalised unless issues related to the 1971 war are resolved.",
      "During the war, hundreds of thousands of Bengalis were killed and tens of thousands of women were raped. The war ended with more than 90,000 Pakistani security and civilian personnel surrendering to the joint command of Indian and Bangladeshi forces in what is seen as a humiliating chapter in Islamabad.",
      "Bangladesh has demanded a formal apology from Pakistan for the atrocities committed during the war but Islamabad has shown no inclination to do so.",
      "\"Pakistan needs to own the crimes that had taken place during the independence war,\" said Mr Kabir, the former Bangladeshi diplomat. \"We had also raised the issue of the division of pre-1971 assets between the two nations in several bilateral meetings with Pakistan.\"",

    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolous Petropolous, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",
      "The UK Parliament's climate change committee had a similar finding in its 2024 report on decarbonisation in the country."

      "LISTEN: Is noise an invisible killer?",
      "But why is sound changing my body?",
      "\"You have an emotional response to sound,\" says Prof Clark.",
      "Sound is detected by the ear and passed onto the brain and one region \u2013 the amygdala \u2013 performs the emotional assessment.",
      "This is part of the body's fight-or-flight response that has evolved to help us react quickly to the sounds like a predator crashing through the bushes.",
      "\"So your heart rate goes up, your nervous system starts to kick in and you release stress hormones,\" Prof Clark tells me.",
      "All of this is good in an emergency, but over time it starts to cause damage.",
      "\"If you're exposed for several years, your body's reacting like that all the time, it increases your risk of developing things like heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke and type 2 diabetes,\" says Prof Clark.",
      "Insidiously, this even happens while we're fast asleep. You might think you adapt to noise. I thought I did when I lived in a rental near an airport. But the biology tells a different story.",
      "\"You never turn your ears off; when you're asleep, you're still listening. So those responses, like your heart rate going up, that's happening whilst you're asleep,\" adds Prof Clark.",
      "Noise is unwanted sound. Transport - traffic, trains and aeroplanes \u2013 are a major source, but so too are the sounds of us having a good time. One person's great party is another's insufferable noise.",

      "I meet Dr Foraster at a caf\u00e9 that is separated from one of Barcelona's busiest roads by a small park. My sound meter says the noise from the distant traffic is just over 60 decibels here.",
      "We can easily chat over the noise without raising our voices, but this is already an unhealthy volume.",
      "The crucial number for heart health is 53 decibels, she tells me, and the higher you go the greater the health risks.",
      "\"This 53 means that we need to be in a rather quiet environment,\" says Dr Foraster.",
      "And that's just in daytime, we need even lower levels for sleep. \"At night we need quietness,\" she says.",
      "Although it is not just about the volume, how disruptive the sound is and how much control you have over it affect our emotional response to noise.",
      "Dr Foraster argues the health impact of noise is \"at the level of air pollution\" but is much harder to comprehend.",
      "\"We are used to understanding that chemicals can affect health and they are toxic, but it's not so straightforward to understand that a physical factor, like noise, affects our health beyond our hearing,\" she says.",
      "A loud party can be the fun that makes life worth living and someone else's intolerable noise.",
      "The sound of traffic has the greatest impact on health because so many people are exposed to it. But traffic is also the sound of getting to work, doing the shopping and taking the children to school. Tackling noise means asking people to live their lives differently - which creates problems of its own.",
      "Dr Natalie Mueller, from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, takes me for a walk around the city centre. We start on a busy road \u2013 my sound meter clocks in at over 80 decibels \u2013 and we head to a quiet tree-lined avenue where the noise is down to the 50s.",
      "But there is something different about this street \u2013 it used to be a busy road, but the space was given over to pedestrians, cafes and gardens. I can see the ghost of an old crossroads by the shape of the flowerbeds. Vehicles can still come down here, just slowly.",
      "Remember earlier in the lab, we found that some sounds can soothe the body.",
      "\"It is not completely silent, but it's a different perception of sound and noise,\" Dr Mueller says.",
      "The initial plan was to create more than 500 areas like this, termed \"superblocks\" - pedestrian-friendly areas created by grouping several city blocks together.",
      "Dr Mueller performed the research projecting a 5-10% reduction in noise in the city, which would prevent about \"150 premature deaths\" from noise alone each year. And that would be \"just the tip of the iceberg\" of the health benefits.",
      "But in reality only six superblocks were ever built. The city council declined to comment.",
      "Urbanisation",
      "The dangers of noise though are continuing to grow. Urbanisation is putting more people into noisy cities.",
      "Dhaka, Bangladesh, is one of the fastest growing megacities in the world. This has brought more traffic and given the city a cacophonous soundtrack of honking horns.",

      "\"If you see the birds or trees or rivers, no one's making noise without humans, so humans are responsible.\"",
      "But here there are the beginnings of political action too. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who's the environment adviser and minister for the government of Bangladesh, told me she was \"very worried\" about the health impacts of noise.",
      "There is a crackdown on honking horns to get the noise levels down - with an awareness campaign and stricter enforcement of existing laws.",
      "She said: \"It's impossible to get it done in one year or two years, but I think it is possible to ensure that the city becomes less noisy, and when people feel that, they feel better when it's less noisy, I'm sure their habit will also change.\"",
      "The solutions to noise can be difficult, complicated and challenging to solve.",
      "What I'm left with is a new appreciation for finding some space in our lives to just escape the noise because in the words of Dr Masrur Abdul Quader, from the Bangladesh University of Professionals, it is \"a silent killer and a slow poison\".",

    "summary": "The Emmy-winning star of \"Succession\" earned an Olivier Award for portraying 26 different characters in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" in London. And now, she's bringing her chameleonic performance to Broadway.",
    "story": [
      "Sarah Snook set the record straight for us: Her last name is pronounced \"Snuke\" (like nuke), not \"Snook\" (as in book or took).",
      "On Broadway this spring, she's neither Snuke nor Snook, but 26 completely different people. The 37-year-old Australian is chameleonic in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\" changing accents, wigs, and gender to tell the story of a man who makes a spiritual bargain to appear eternally young, while his portrait reflects the hideousness of his actions.",
      "The show has suspense, horror, humor, and also a lot of heart. \"People don't often credit Oscar Wilde with something heartfelt,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, he has a lot of pathos,\" Snook said. \"I think there's a lot of empathy for the human condition \u2013 I think, you know, seeing the soul as a real thing and as a part of your body, personality, spiritual makeup that one might need to protect and look after.\"",
      "It's a performance for which Snook won an Olivier (the British theater award) during the show's run in London's West End.",
      "Oscar Wilde published the story (his only novel) in 1890. Victorian critics called it \"poisonous\" and \"morally depraved.\" Now, almost a century-and-a-half later, the tale feels resonant. Snook said today is an interesting time to come to this story, \"where we have such an image-based culture and ability to construct a visual image to sell to anyone online, on Instagram. And part of the reason of playing multiple different characters is about choosing which mask is the right mask, which is the public/private mask that we show of ourselves.\"",
      "After making her name known abroad, Snook is now beloved by American audiences as Siobhan \"Shiv\" Roy, the cutthroat billionaire she played as the scion of a family empire on the TV series \"Succession.\" The saltiness of her Shiv garnered Snook legions of fans, and several awards.",
      "But Snook initially didn't want to audition for Shiv because, she says, she couldn't relate to her being beautiful and wealthy. \"Yeah, there was nothing in myself that I could see as, like, reflective or accessible in that character,\" she said.",
      "Like Dorian Gray, Shiv is an anti-hero, and Snook's been drawn to those complicated characters for a long time: \"I watched a ton of Disney films when I was a kid, and all I wanted to be was Ursula and Scar, all the villains, all the people who had seeming more complexity to why they were that in the first place.\"",
      "Snook discovered that complexity for herself during one of her first acting gigs back home in Adelaide: \"I used to do fairy parties. It was such a good training ground, 'cause kids, man, they tell you if they're not interested.\"",
      "Was she heckled? \"Yeah. Like, 'Fly! Lemme see you fly! Come on! Why can't you fly? Show us!'\"",
      "Kip Williams, the director and adapter of \"Dorian Gray,\" arrived at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney the year that Snook had just left. \"There was this word around school that there was this incredible red-headed actress, so my radar as a director was up for Sarah from the beginning,\" he said.",
      "Williams knew that he wanted to collaborate with Snook, and felt that a single actor could embody all the facets of Wilde's legendary work. \"Oscar Wilde talks about this notion that life is one grand act of theater, and that people are always in a form of performance where they are either revealing or concealing parts of themselves,\" Williams said. \"So, the form of this piece \u2013 one performer playing all of these 26 characters \u2013 is an expression of that idea.\"",
      "It is with technology that Williams illuminates humanity. He calls it \"cine-theater\" \u2013 combining live performance with cameras, large screens, and pre-recorded videos.",
      "So, is it fair to call this a one-woman show? \"I think it is definitely a one-person show,\" Williams said, \"but it is also, paradoxically, an ensemble piece. The camera team and the crew are kind of like her co-performers. They dance with her on stage \u2013 literally, one moment.\"",
      "A dance that feels intimately familiar to Snook: \"The feeling of a camera really close to you and not having that disrupt your train of thought or your flow, I think that's something that was really useful in 'Succession,' 'cause we kind of absorbed them as extra characters in the scene,\" she said.",
      "Snook has a few extra characters in her own life, too. She got married during the pandemic and has a young daughter. But as it turns out, Sarah Snook has not bitten off more than she can chew.",
      "\"So, this is your Broadway debut. Is the pressure off since you've already had such a successful run?\" I asked.",
      "Snook replied, \"Actually, one thing that Kip said on the first day of rehearsals is, 'You can only eat an elephant one spoonful at a time.' 'Yeah, sure. Okay. I'll do it that way.'\"",
      "\"So you think you've eaten the whole thing by now?\"",
      "\"No, now I've gotta eat the Broadway part of the elephant!\" Snook laughed.",

    "summary": "Ruth Marcus, a longtime op-ed writer for the Washington Post, quit on Monday after, she said, her column criticizing owner Jeff Bezos was killed by publisher.",
    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",
      "Marcus' resignation on Monday overshadowed a newsroom reorganization plan introduced by Murray, including separating workflows for the Post's digital and print products.",

      "Discussion Questions",
      "1. Amy Griffin spent much of her adult life determined to move forward, never letting herself stop to look back. What do you think eventually motivated her to want to revisit her past and then to tell her story? Talk about the courage it takes to confront one's past\u2014and to share it with the world. Have you ever decided to divulge something about yourself that you once felt was impossible to share?",
      "2. Amy was a star student in her small Texas town, and she became a high-achieving businesswoman after arriving in New York. Talk about ambition as a trauma response. Do you think Amy believed she could outwork (and outrun) her past? How can \"The Tell\" serve as a reminder that people who appear to \"have it all\" are not always as they seem?",
      "3. A physical therapist tells Amy: \"There's something your body is telling you that you don't want to hear.\" How did her body's message manifest? What messages has your body sent you over the years? What makes it hard for you to listen to the messages your body sends?",
      "4. John supports Amy's decision to try therapy with Olivia and he works to keep the family's life afloat at home while she takes time to process what she's uncovered. But John also understands his own limits, telling Amy when she needs to find outside support so he can just be her husband. How does he know when to place this boundary? How does Amy react to this? Have you ever had to place a difficult boundary to preserve a relationship?",
      "5. Would you try psychedelic-assisted therapy? Why or why not?",
      "6. \"I needed to find the evidence that would confirm my memories,\" Amy writes in her journal. Why do you think Amy needs others to confirm what she knows to be true?",
      "7. What did you learn from \"The Tell\" and from Amy's sessions with Lauren about how memory works? Consider the distinction between memory storage and memory recall, for instance. What did you find most surprising?",
      "8. \"My daughters were asking me to participate in life, and in our relationship, in a way that I could not.\" How do Amy's children both trigger her memories\u2014and help her heal?",
      "9. For years, Amy remembers so many details around the abuse, but not the abuse itself. She saw clues, but not the full picture of her trauma. How did \"The Tell\" make you consider\u2014or reconsider\u2014your own life events and memories? Is there anything you might be unable or unwilling to remember? Have you ever surprised yourself by \"unlocking\" an unexpected memory?",
      "10. Amy begins to feel that justice will bring her closure. How was Paul's story both a helpful\u2014and unfortunately rare\u2014example for Amy? How does it affect her when she realizes her own story might not have such a tidy or satisfying outcome?",
      "11. What was it like for her to tell her parents? Have you ever had to have a difficult conversation with your parents about your childhood? What did you learn through that conversation\u2014about yourself or about them?",
      "12. Amy was raised in a traditional patriarchal Texas culture. Children were expected to both respect and obey their elders.

      "With nearly 700 species of bacteria inhabiting the human mouth, experts say maintaining good oral hygiene could benefit both heart and brain health.",
      "There is growing evidence suggesting good oral health could help prevent Alzheimer's disease. One study in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease\u00a0found that people who flossed regularly had a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's than those who did not.",
      "However, researchers caution there is still limited research. The observational studies do not prove that flossing directly prevents Alzheimer's disease.",
      "\"When you think about it, what is poor gum health, poor dental health? It's really a bacterial infection,\" explained Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor. \"When you have chronic infection, chronic inflammation, we know that chronic inflammation increases your risk for heart disease, for cerebrovascular disease, brain disease. It's really important to control these things.\"",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 4 in 10 U.S. adults 30 years or older have some form of periodontal disease.",
      "In addition to causing inflammation, the bacteria associated with gum disease produce enzymes that can be directly toxic to nerves, Gounder said. They also weaken the blood-brain barrier, allowing toxins and other bacteria to enter the brain.",
      "Research shows that these oral bacteria can increase amyloid in the brain \u2014 a protein plaque connected with Alzheimer's disease.",
      "The mouth-to-brain pathway occurs when bacteria from dental problems enter the bloodstream.",

      "Former heart surgeon and television host Dr. Mehmet Oz testified Friday before the Senate Finance Committee over his nomination to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.",
      "The GOP-led committee will next schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate, where he is likely to be approved given the Republican majority.",
      "If confirmed, Oz would be the administrator charged with overseeing the nearly $1.5 trillion spent by the federal government on Medicare and Medicaid. The two health insurance programs for seniors and poor Americans make up\u00a0more than a third\u00a0of the budget.",
      "Medicare\u00a0covers around 65 million people, through programs run directly by the federal government or contracted out to private insurers.\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0supports around 85 million, through programs administered primarily by state governments overseen by CMS.",
      "CMS also sets rules that affect private health insurance, including overseeing the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces.",

He lost that Senate race to Democrat John Fetterman, in a\u00a0narrow contest\u00a0where abortion had ranked as a top issue for voters.",
      "Oz's priorities for Medicare and Medicaid",
      "Oz outlined a vision for the agency focused in large part on modernizing its systems and tools, addressing waste and fraud and incentivizing Americans to make healthier lifestyle choices.",
      "\"Some of these decisions are not difficult. Some of them need to be simplified. And some of them need to be reminded frequently,\" Oz told senators of the healthier lifestyle choices he wants to encourage, adding later that \"the idea of giving incentives to patients is an idea that I think is a worthy one, especially for Medicaid beneficiaries.\"",
      "It will be up to Oz to finalize or abandon some major changes to Medicare and Medicaid sought by the Biden administration, like\u00a0a pricey proposal\u00a0in November to expand coverage to drugs used for weight loss like Wegovy and Ozempic.",
      "Oz did not directly address the proposal during the hearing. But he did promise to continue the Medicare drug price negotiation program launched by the Biden administration, from the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"It's the law. I'm going to defend it and use it,\" Oz told senators.",
      "He also voiced support for allowing states to add work requirements in Medicaid. Oz also said he wants work requirements to be defined broadly, to include activities like going to school or volunteering at a church.",
      "\"I don't think you need to use paperwork to prove a work requirement. And I don't think that should be used as an obstacle, a disingenuous effort to block people from getting on Medicaid,\" he said.",
      "Oz criticizes Medicare Advantage",
      "During Friday's hearing, Oz singled out Medicare Advantage as one of the biggest sources of waste and abuse within the insurance industry.",
      "Just over\u00a0half of seniors\u00a0have opted for these plans offered by private insurers but paid for by taxpayers, according to the latest federal data, instead of \"original Medicare\" coverage.",
      "He cited\u00a0reports\u00a0showing spending on the private alternatives outpacing traditional Medicare coverage as \"upside down\" what it should be, questioning spending by plans and efforts by brokers to persuade seniors to sign up.",
      "He also criticized the practice of \"upcoding\" within Medicare Advantage, where providers or plans bill for treating patients as sicker than they actually are.",
      "\"A part of this is just recognizing there's a new sheriff in town. We actually have to go after places and areas where we're not managing the American people's money well,\" Oz said.",
      "Oz calls for limiting prior authorization",
      "Oz also faced questions over the significant authority he would wield over private health insurance.",
      "On Monday, CMS proposed making several moves to reverse Biden administration expansions to the insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, like shortening the open enrollment period and excluding DACA recipients from coverage. In 2022, Oz said that the law \"caused havoc on our health care system\" and that he \"wouldn't have voted for it.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz criticized health insurance companies misusing prior authorization - sometimes delaying treatment until doctors and patients can persuade insurers that it is necessary - as \"a pox on the system.\"",
      "\"We're spending money, wasting money, trying to do a process that should be automated. I would argue we could limit the number of preauthorized procedures to a thousand,\" he told senators.",
      "Republicans optimistic Oz will be confirmed",
      "In social media posts last month, Oz\u00a0has touted\u00a0\"great conversations\" with key Republicans he would need to win over for his nomination. Multiple Republicans at Friday's hearing said they were optimistic Oz would be confirmed.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the Republican chair of the Senate's health committee, was among those to sit down with Oz last month. Cassidy is one of four medical doctors in the Senate.",
      "\"Great meeting with Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. It will be great to have a doctor in charge,\" Cassidy\u00a0posted\u00a0on Feb. 5.",
      "Oz was the fourth of Trump's health official picks to face questioning from senators. It comes a day after a hearing for Dr. David Weldon was abruptly canceled, after the White House\u00a0withdrew his nomination\u00a0to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "A majority of senators on the Senate's health committee advanced Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the president's nominee to head the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Marty Makary, the pick to head the Food and Drug Administration, on Thursday.",
      "Oz's potential new supervisor, Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was narrowly confirmed by the Senate a month ago.",
      "Democrats criticized Oz's past",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on committee, during the hearing accused Oz of \"dodging Medicare and Social Security taxes.\" Wyden said a tax loophole has \"benefited Dr. Oz by $440,000 in the last three years.\"",
      "During the hearing, Oz did not respond to the allegation. A memo from the committee's Democratic staff had concluded that Oz may have underpaid his taxes based on a questionairre he submitted, his tax returns and financial disclosures.",
      "\"Now, the doctor will testify about his concern for Medicare's well being, yet he is unwilling to pay the same taxes that millions of Americans pay out of every paycheck,\" Wyden said.",
      "The president's pick to head CMS has earned criticism from some Senate Democrats for months, who have cited Oz's past embrace of \"alarming pseudoscience,\" record of anti-abortion statements and worries over conflicts of interest.",
      "As part of an ethics agreement published last month, Oz said he will resign from positions at several companies, including the nutritional supplement company iHerb and the drugmaker Housey Pharma. He also pledged to divest from several healthcare companies, including insurance giant UnitedHealth Group.",
      "After the Senate race, Oz had been advertised as iHerb's global advisor. He continued to promote iHerb's supplements on social media after his nomination.",
      "He has also continued to republish past excerpts from his show in recent years after the Senate race, like a clip he shared on Sept. 4 from a sponsored interview about Medicare Advantage coverage. In 2020, Oz would later propose that Medicare Advantage should be expanded to all Americans.",
      "In the clip, Oz said that enrollment in Medicare Advantage had grown 70% since he started his show.",

      "Multiple factors are pushing the costs for building or fixing up home, according to the trade group. U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China are driving up materials costs, while Mr. Trump's trade threats have also stoked market volatility, making housing developers and homebuyers reluctant to take on financial risks.",
      "Uncertainty around when U.S. levies could take effect and how long they could remain in place is making real estate developers reluctant to commit to new projects, impeding home construction. Prospective homebuyers, many of whom have been sidelined by rising mortgage rates, now also face higher costs due to tariffs.",
      "Greg Kraut, co-founder and CEO of KPG Funds, a New York-based property design and development firm, said such concerns are weighing heavily on the housing industry.",

      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Trump's tariff barrage has spooked investors and soured consumers on the economy, with many fearing that his trade policies will trigger inflation and slam economic growth. The S&P 500 last week briefly moved into so-called \"correction\" territory, meaning the index had tumbled 10% from its most recent high, although it regained some ground on Friday.",

      "\"First of all, you aren't alone \u2014 a lot of people are panicking,\" TIAA wealth management director Doug Ornstein told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Don't overreact, but it might be appropriate to take some action.\"",

      "Risk tolerance is sometimes assessed in a quiz (such as this one from Vanguard) that asks hypothetical questions about your approach towards investing, such as whether you might sell a bond if it lost money in a short period of time.",
      "\"How do I think about risk, and how do I feel about risk emotionally and psychologically \u2014 all of that is completely valid to consider,\" TIAA's Ornstein said.",
      "But it's also important to consider your risk capacity, which involves a more complicated calculation including data such as your age and your retirement horizon. That offers a more objective way to assess risk than your emotional reaction to losing money on investment.",
      "\"Both things are really important: How you feel about risk, and what resources do you have\" to manage that risk, he noted.",
      "Is your time horizon really what you think it is?",
      "Workers often think about their investment horizon as the number of years they have left in the workforce, which might seem daunting to a Gen Xer who is getting closer to retirement.",
      "But the truth, which might not be intuitive to some workers, is that this timeframe is likely much longer than you expect, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Let's say someone is 60 and plans to retire at 67 \u2014 they don't have a lot of time for the market to recover\" before they retire, he noted. \"But if you retire at 67 and live to 95, most of your money will probably remain invested for next 20, 25, 30 years.\"",
      "He added, \"We'll see a lot of ups and downs, bull and bear markets, presidential administrations, and economic cycles over the next 20 to 30 years, so what is happening right now shouldn't dictate a massive change.\"",
      "In other words, someone whose retirement is just a few years away might have an actual investment time horizon of 30 years, which means sticking to their financial plan.",
      "More generally, trying to time the market, or trading individual stocks in an effort to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, considerable research\u00a0has found.",
      "Is your investment portfolio sufficiently diversified?",
      "Although it's important not to overreact when markets are rocky, rebalancing your investments can be a good idea is such periods, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Buy and hold works well when the market is just going up and up,\" he said. When markets head south, \"It may be a good time to consider rebalancing into a more diversified mix of investments.\"",
      "For instance, that means not only checking your mix of equities and fixed income, but also your mix of sub-asset classes within those categories. Adding international stocks, for instance, on top of your S&P 500 index fund could help spread the risk, as well as considering different types of fixed income investments aside from Treasuries.",
      "And don't forget to tend to your emergency savings, given that having a cash buffer can help in times of financial stress and keep you from raiding your retirement account, noted Transamerica's Collinson. Her group's research found that 37% of workers have tapped their retirement accounts, suggesting that many people use their 401(k)s as an emergency fund.",
      "Workers can ask their employers to set aside a portion of their paycheck in another bank account that they earmark for emergency savings. Some employers also are starting to enroll workers in accounts specifically designed for emergencies, a change that was enabled by the Secure 2.0 retirement law.",
      "\"The research indicates many workers lack adequate emergency savings,\" she said. \"Now is the time to find out how to build that up.\"",

    "story": [
      "Some signs of the U.S. economy's trajectory, including consumer sentiment\u00a0plunging to a two-year low, U.S. stocks\u00a0sinking\u00a0and President Trump's foreign trade policy creating a climate of uncertainty for U.S. businesses, are pointing downward. There's also another, less-closely watched index that is showing signs of trouble ahead.",
      "The Russell 2000, a stock index made up of small companies, is down more than 18% since its peak in November when Mr. Trump was elected. The index initially rose on optimism that the new administration would create a more business-friendly environment, but that sentiment has changed amid an escalating trade war with some of the U.S.'s closest allies. Mass federal layoffs initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also created tremendous uncertainty for businesses.",
      "Now, the small-cap index is headed toward a bear market, defined by a decline of 20% or more from its most recent high.",
      "\"Some small caps like the Russell 2000 were outperforming the S&P 500 after the election, presumably on the theory that there was going to be substantial deal activity, because these companies are more likely to be acquired and merge than the largest of the large-caps,\" Daniel Hornung, former deputy director of the National Economic Council, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There was a sense that there was going to be deregulation and easier environment for transactions to occur, but there's a huge amount of uncertainty hanging over the economy and markets right now that makes it really difficult for transactions to happen,\" Hornung explained.",
      "Broad-based tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, plus 25% levies on steel and aluminum threaten to raise costs for both businesses and consumers. Smaller companies with tighter profit margins have a harder time absorbing greater input costs compared to larger ones.",
      "Canary in the coal mine",
      "The Russell 2000 comprises small companies across a variety sectors, and is widely considered to be a benchmark for small U.S. stocks. Unlike the tech-heavy S&P 500, it is not weighted toward a particular industry.",
      "Small companies are more exposed to market shocks than larger ones, given that they operate on thinner margins and typically have higher borrowing costs, making the index more sensitive to changes in the economy.",
      "\"It's more diversified at the sectoral level, so it is more representative of U.S. growth dynamics,\" Skanda Amarnath, a macroeconomist and executive director of Employ America, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some of the Russell 2000 companies include commercial jet engine company FTAI Aviation, grocery chain Sprouts Farmers Market, plant-based food company Beyond Meat, and language learning tool Duolingo.",
      "Not pointing to a recession",
      "While the Russell 2000 is only two percentage points away from entering bear market territory, Bank of America Research economists say it's not pricing in a recession, and they still expect the economy to grow this year.",
      "\"Historically in recessions the Russell 2000 has sold off close to 40% on average,\" said Jill Carey Hall, head of U.S. small- and mid-cap strategy at Bank of America Research. \"So it's not pricing in greater than a 50% probability of a recession at this point.\"",
      "Still, small businesses could face significant profit margin erosion with tariffs in place.",
      "Based on the levies currently in place on Canada, Mexico and China, and assuming retaliatory tariffs, Bank of America estimates that the earnings hit could be three times larger for small caps than for large caps.",
      "\"These companies have much thinner margins, so a rise in input costs hurts them more,\" Carey Hall said.",

      "Consumers anticipate inflation climbing at an annual rate of 4.9% during the next year, their highest expectations since 2022.

      "The Trump administration's recent changes to student loans are causing frustration and confusion for some borrowers.",
      "In response to a February court ruling that blocked some Biden-era programs, the Education Department has taken down online and paper applications for income-driven repayment plans.",
      "\"This especially hurts anyone who's lost their jobs, including federal workers,\" said Natalia Abrams, founder and president of the Student Debt Crisis Center. \"A few months ago, they would have been able to get on a zero-dollar income-driven repayment plan.\"",
      "The removal of application materials also has caused confusion around the recertification process for borrowers already enrolled in repayment plans, experts say. Income-driven repayment plans take a borrower's finances and family size into account when calculating monthly payments, but borrowers must periodically demonstrate they still qualify.",
      "Adding to the uncertainty are layoffs at the Education Department, which oversees the federal loan system. The federal website for student loans and financial aid, StudentAid.gov, suffered an hours-long outage Wednesday, but the department has said it will continue to deliver on its commitments.",
      "\"It's been wave after wave of bad news for student borrowers,\" said Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "Guidance for those with student loans",
      "All borrowers currently enrolled in income-driven repayment plans should \"get a sense of when your recertification deadline is and get a sense of what options are available to you if the form is not available online to recertify your income,\" Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "Recertification confirms a borrower's financial situation. With some forms not currently available, borrowers who are unable to complete that process could be in jeopardy.",
      "If borrowers are already on an income-driven repayment plan, they should still be allowed to remain on that repayment plan if they are able to recertify their income.",
      "Abrams said it's also a good idea to take screenshots of your account's current status on the student aid website.",
      "State-specific and state-level resources are available for student borrowers. Congress members have teams charged with helping constituents if they are having trouble with a federal agency or struggling to contact a federal student loan servicer.",

      "\"Try saying something like, 'I need your help to understand how to get into an affordable repayment option, which I'm entitled to under the law,'\" Ba\u00f1ez said. \"'Even though this federal department has taken down these applications, I need your help.'\"",
      "Despite the thinning of the Education Department and President Donald Trump's dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, loan servicers still must consider a borrower's financial situation, Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "\"You can see if you can get temporary forbearance or a deferment of payments for financial hardship,\" she said.",
      "State attorneys general also take inquiries from student borrowers.",
      "Jessica Fugate, a government relations manager for the city of Los Angeles, said she was less than a year from student loan forgiveness under the Biden-era Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives outstanding loans after 120 payments.",

      "\"It's the most affordable option to repay my loans while living in Los Angeles working for the government on a government salary,\" said Fugate, 42. \"And it would mean my payments counted towards forgiveness.\"",
      "In February, Fugate received confirmation that her application was received and had been notified of its status, but they didn't say when she would know if she was approved.",
      "\"And when I called recently, the machine said there was a four hour wait,\" she said.",
      "With income-driven repayment plans in limbo, Fugate isn't sure what her options are and hopes to one day have her federal loans behind her.",
      "\"I've been working for government for almost 10 years. After that much time, you don't do it for the glory,\" she said. \"I've spent most of my career giving back to other people. I don't mind serving people. I just feel this was an agreement they made with the public, and so we're owed that. And it's a lot of us. And we're not just numbers.\"",
      "Debbie Breen, 56, works at an agency on healthy aging in Spokane, Washington. Breen said she has worked in the nonprofit sector for more than 10 years and that nearly all those years counted toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",

    "title": "Hundreds of federal offices to start to empty this summer due to DOGE cuts: AP",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doge-cuts-hundreds-federal-offices-start-empty-summer/",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Mar 2025 07:35:18 -0400",
    "summary": "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices nationwide this summer under a frenetic and error-prone push by DOGE to scrap leases it says waste money.",
    "story": [
      "Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices across the country this summer under a frenetic and error-riddled push by Elon Musk's budget-cutting advisers to terminate leases that they say waste money.",
      "The White House's Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk heads, maintains a list of canceled real estate leases on its website, but internal documents obtained by The Associated Press contain a crucial detail: when those cancellations are expected to take effect. The documents from inside the General Services Administration, the U.S. government's real estate manager, list dozens of federal office and building leases expected to end by June 30, with hundreds more slated over the coming months.",
      "The rapid pace of cancellations has raised alarms, with some agencies and lawmakers appealing to DOGE to exempt specific buildings. Several agencies are facing 20 or more lease cancellations in all, including the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Many of the terminations would affect agencies that aren't as well-known but oversee services critical to many Americans.",
      "They span from a Boise, Idaho, office of the Bureau of Reclamation - which oversees water supply and deals with disputes across the often-parched American West, to a Joliet, Illinois, outpost of the Railroad Retirement Board, which provides benefits for railroad workers and their survivors.",
      "The lease terminations don't mean all the locations will close. In some cases, agencies may negotiate new leases to stay in place, downsize their existing space or relocate elsewhere.",
      "\"Some agencies are saying: 'I'm not leaving. We can't leave,'\" said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official who now represents building owners with government leases at Arco Real Estate Solutions. \"I think there's going to be a period of pushback, a period of disbelief. And then, if necessary, they may start working on the actual execution of a move.\"",
      "DOGE says GSA has notified landlords in recent weeks that it plans to terminate 793 leases, focusing mostly on those that can be ended within months without penalty. The group estimates those moves will save roughly $500 million over the terms of the leases, which in some cases were slated to continue into the 2030s. The Bureau of Reclamation cancellation in Boise, for instance, would take effect Aug. 31 and is expected to save a total of $18.7 million through 2035.",
      "But DOGE's savings estimates - a fraction of Musk's $1 trillion cost-cutting goal - haven't been verified and don't take into account the costs of moves and closures. The group hasn't released any information about what they would mean for agencies.",
      "\"My initial reaction is this is just going to cause more chaos,\" said Jim Simpson, an accountant in Arizona who helps low-income people file taxes and serves on an IRS panel that advocates for taxpayers. \"There's a lot of room to help with government efficiency, but it should be done surgically and not with a chainsaw.\"",
      "Simpson said he was surprised to learn that dozens of IRS offices, including local taxpayer assistance centers, were facing upcoming lease cancellations. He refers clients there to get paperwork to file returns and answer IRS inquiries, and he said losing services would \"cause a lot of anxiety\" and delay refunds.",
      "DOGE scrapping some lease cancelations due to mistakes",
      "Plans to cancel the leases at several of the IRS centers and other sites were in error and have been rescinded, according to a person with direct knowledge of the changes who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity in order to avoid retaliation. Those changes aren't reflected yet on DOGE's list, which only removed one and added dozens more in its latest update published Thursday.",
      "The GSA walked back the cancellation of a Geological Survey office in Anchorage, Alaska, for instance, after learning it didn't have termination rights, according to the person familiar with the matter.",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Monday that he'd convinced DOGE to back off lease terminations planned for the National Weather Center in Norman, a Social Security office in Lawton and the Indian Health Services office in Oklahoma City. But all three leases remained on DOGE's list of cancellations as of Thursday.",
      "GSA's press office didn't respond to inquiries.",
      "DOGE push took many by surprise",
      "While there was already a bipartisan push to reduce the government's real estate footprint, the mass cancellations blindsided an industry known for its stability.",
      "Landlords who'd been expecting government agencies to remain tenants \u2014 for several more years in some cases under their existing leases \u2014 were stunned. Some agencies learned from building managers, not their federal partners, that their leases were being canceled, according to real estate managers.",
      "Some cancelations could incur extra costs",
      "Becker, whose firm is tracking the DOGE lease cancellations, and other observers said they expect some agencies will be unable to move their personnel and property out of their spaces within such tight timelines. That may force some agencies to pay additional rent during what's known as a holdover period, undermining DOGE's stated goal of saving taxpayer money.",
      "The Building Owners and Managers Association, which represents the commercial real estate industry, told landlords in a recent advocacy alert to be prepared to seek payment from any federal government tenants who stay beyond their leases.",
      "Asked about plans for buildings with leases that will soon expire, the IRS didn't respond. A Social Security Administration spokesperson downplayed the impact of its offices losing leases, saying many were \"small remote hearing sites,\" didn't serve the public, were already being consolidated elsewhere or planned for closure.",
      "Several other agencies provided little clarity - saying they were working with GSA to consider their options, in statements that were nearly identical in some cases.",
      "But a spokesperson for the Railroad Retirement Board expressed concern over the upcoming lease cancellations of its offices in Joliet, Illinois, and eight other states, saying it was working to \"maintain a public-facing office presence for the local railroad community.\"",
      "Trimming federal real estate was already underway",
      "Government Accountability Office official David Marroni told a congressional hearing last week that the push to unload unnecessary federal real estate was \"long overdue,\" saying agencies have for too long held onto unnecessary space. But he warned the downsizing must be deliberate and carefully planned to \"generate substantial savings and mitigate the risk of mistakes and unexpected mission impacts.\"",
      "That process had already started before Musk's team arrived, with the federal government's real estate portfolio steadily declining over the last decade. Indeed, critics of DOGE say if it were truly interested in cost-cutting it could learn from GSA, whose mission even before Mr. Trump took office was to deliver \"effective and efficient\" services to the American public.",
      "A law signed by former President Joe Biden before he left office in January directed agencies to measure the true occupancy rates of leased spaces by this summer. Those that didn't meet a target of 60% use rate over time would be directed to dispose of their excess space.",
      "\"There is a logical and orderly way to do this,\" Rep. Greg Stanton, an Arizona Democrat, said at last week's hearing. Instead, he said, DOGE is pursuing a reckless approach that threatens to harm the delivery of public services.",
      "Industry observers cautioned that each situation is different and it will take months or years to understand the full impact of the lease cancellations.",
      "\"It really depends on the terms. But it is a shock, there is no question, that all of a sudden, boom, in six weeks all these things have happened,\" said J. Reid Cummings, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of South Alabama. \"It's like a blitzkrieg.\""

      "The SSA last month\u00a0announced a restructuring initiative that gives all employees the option to accept \"voluntary separation incentive payments\" to leave the agency, as part of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE's effort to cut costs\u00a0by culling the federal workforce. Led by billionaire Elon Musk, DOGE has\u00a0abruptly terminated thousands of federal workers\u00a0over the last three weeks, causing turmoil across multiple departments.",
      "The deadline for SSA workers to accept the \"voluntary separation incentive payments\"\u00a0is Friday, March 14. Those who opt in must leave the agency by April 19.",
      "Last month, the agency said it aims to cut the size of its workforce by 7,000 people, focusing on workers and jobs that don't \"provide mission critical services.\"",
      "Former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley, who led the agency under the Biden administration from December 2023 to November 2024, expects the actual number to be closer to 10,000 workers. The agency currently employs roughly 57,000 people.",
      "\"Everybody who can is going to take that early out, but I think that 7,000 number is conservative,\" O'Malley said Thursday at a panel discussion on recent changes at the agency and how they could affect customer service, held by the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI), a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization.",
      "\"They are all going to take it,\" he said, adding that employees who choose to stay, will risk losing their jobs without a bonus.",
      "\"They are communicating to people if you don't take the cash and get out now, you are taking the chance of being fired and playing the game of Russian Roulette that follows,\" said O'Malley, who believes the changes being implemented at the agency will \"cause a total system collapse of social security.\"",
      "The amount of the SSA incentive payments being offered individual workers depends on the employee's classification, or where they stand on the federal payscale. The highest-tier worker would receive a maximum of $25,000.",
      "O'Malley is also concerned that offering to buy workers out in the name of efficiency amounts to the \"greatest amount of waste in operational history by paying people not to work.\"",
      "Security vunerabilities",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday threatened to impose tariffs on wines, Champagnes and other alcoholic products imported to the U.S. from France and other European countries in response to raised tariffs the European Union placed on American whiskey.",
      "In a post to Truth Social, the social media company the president owns, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will retaliate against the European Union after it announced Wednesday that it would be increasing tariffs on U.S.-made whiskey to 50%.",
      "\"If this tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% tariff on all wines, champagnes, & alcoholic products coming out of France and other E.U. represented countries,\" he wrote. \"This will be great for the wine and champagne businesses in the U.S.\"",
      "Mr. Trump accused the EU of being \"one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world.\"",
      "Since returning to office, the president has threatened tariffs, and imposed the levies, on a host of major U.S. trading partners. On Wednesday, he increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, prompting retaliatory action from the EU.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Wednesday that the countermeasures from the EU are worth 26 billion euros, or $28 billion. The tariffs, set to take effect April 1, target a range of U.S. exports, including beef, poultry, bourbon, jeans and peanut butter.",
      "\"We deeply regret this measure,\" von der Leyen said. \"Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business, and worse for consumers. They are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy. Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up.\"",
      "The U.S. exported $1.2 billion in wine and related products in 2024, including more than $167 million to the EU, according to the Department of Agriculture. It is the top importer of wine, bringing in nearly $4.9 billion worth in 2023. France and Italy were the top partners for importing both wine and Champagne into the U.S.",
      "Champagne is a sparkling wine from the Champagne region in northeast France. If it is made outside of that region, it is called sparkling wine.",
      "Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group representing the U.S. spirits industry, called the EU's announcement to reimpose heightened tariffs on American whiskey \"deeply disappointing\"",
      "\"Reimposing these debilitating tariffs at a time when the spirits industry continues to face a slowdown in U.S. marketplace will further curtail growth and negatively impact distillers and farmers in states across the country,\" Swonger said in a statement. \"We urge the U.S. and EU governments to come to a resolution that gets our spirits industry back to zero-for-zero tariffs.\"",
      "According to the Distilled Spirits Council, a retaliatory tariff imposed in 2018 during Mr. Trump's first term, caused exports of U.S.-made whiskey to drop 20%. But over the last three years, exports to the EU grew nearly 60% from $439 million in 2021 to $699 million in 2024, the trade group said.",
      "Since returning to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has made tariffs a key area of his economic agenda, though the levies have sparked concerns of a recession and roiled the stock market. The president declined to rule out the possibility of an economic downturn, telling Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday that \"there is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"the most important thing America has ever had\" when asked whether they would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it.\"",
      "Lutnick added, \"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here.\"",
      "The president's trade war escalated this month with 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tax on goods imported from China, taking effect last week. Beijing imposed retaliatory measures that went into force Monday that target U.S. farmers with levies of 15% on chicken, wheat and corn, and 10% on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit.",
      "The president, however, swiftly reversed course on the levies on imports from Mexico and Canada, pausing the tariffs covered under a 2020 trade deal negotiated during his first administration until April 2. That agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, covers the majority of goods imported from Mexico. Those that are not subject to the deal, however, still face tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also exempted other products from his planned tariffs, including providing a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers that were bracing to be hit hard\u00a0by the levies on vehicle parts and components imported from Canada, Mexico and China.",

      "On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump imposed a blanket 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum, significantly impacting Canada, the largest foreign supplier of these metals to the U.S. An additional 25% tariff on most Canadian goods is set to go into effect on April 2.",
      "Experts warn these hikes could lead to increases in consumer prices, but Mr. Trump has justified them in part by saying he's protecting American manufacturers and incentivizing Canada to crack down on drug crime.",
      "However, in interviews and social media posts, Mr. Trump has exaggerated the size of the U.S.trade deficit with Canada and the amount of fentanyl coming over the northern border. The president also misrepresented Canada's tariffs on U.S. dairy and lumber products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has tariffs above 200% on U.S. dairy products",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"In Canada, we find that they're charging us over 200% for dairy products\u2026 And when I left, we had that well taken care of, but under Biden they just kept raising it.\"",
      "Details: President Trump has suggested Canada unfairly put tariffs of over 200% on American dairy products during President Biden's term, but the level has been unchanged since before Biden took office.",
      "The over 200% tariffs on U.S. dairy products are only triggered if U.S. dairy exports exceed certain yearly duty-free limits, and U.S. dairy manufacturers say they have never been close to exceeding these limits.",
      "Additionally, these tariffs were negotiated during the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump signed during his first term. Canada's published tariff lists for 2020 and 2025 show tariffs on U.S. dairy products have remained unchanged from the end of his first term through the end of President Biden's term. For example, both lists show the same tariff rate of 245.5% for any cheese products above the duty-free limit.",
      "Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman told told CBS News the dairy tariffs are in place to \"protect our farmers and families.\" Canada is the second-largest importer of U.S. dairy, purchasing about $1.1 billion worth in 2024.",
      "The U.S. sold roughly double the amount of dairy to Canada as Canada sold to the U.S. last year, according to trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that Canada has a \"tremendously high tariff\" on lumber while the U.S. charges \"a tiny fraction of that\"",
      "President Trump said March 7: \"They have a tremendously high tariff, give you the exact numbers in a little while coming out, on lumber. So, they sell us lumber, they have a tremendous tariff. They make it impossible for us to sell lumber or dairy products into Canada, but our numbers are a tiny fraction of that, almost non-existent.\"",
      "Details: On March 4, Canada imposed a tariff of 25% on softwood lumber from the U.S., a rate that is high compared to recent history.",
      "But Mr. Trump did not mention these tariffs are part of Canada's response to the 25% levies on most Canadian goods, including lumber, that the Trump administration initially announced in early March, which are now expected to take effect on April 2.",
      "Before this trade escalation, Canada had imposed zero tariffs on U.S. softwood lumber for years, according to Dustin Jalbert, a senior economist at Fastmarkets who covers wood products.",
      "\"It's certainly true that right now there are tariffs in place, but that was not the case before the kickoff of the trade war. These are retaliatory to what the U.S. instigated, if you will, in early March,\" Jalbert said.",
      "The U.S. had previously placed duties on imported softwood lumber, with tariffs on Canadian lumber rising from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",
      "Trump's false claim that the U.S. has a $200 billion trade deficit with Canada",
      "President Trump\u00a0said\u00a0March 13:\u00a0\"In the case of Canada, we're spending $200 billion a year to subsidize Canada.\"\u00a0And on Feb. 26 he said: \"The tariffs will make it impossible for them to sell lumber or anything else into the United States. And all I'm asking to do is break even or lose a little bit, but not lose $200 billion.\"",
      "Details: Mr. Trump has repeatedly exaggerated the U.S.-Canada trade deficit, claiming it's as large as $200 billion.",
      "In fact, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services with Canada in 2024 was closer to $35.7 billion, according to the latest trade data released from the U.S. Census Bureau on March 6.\u00a0 That trade deficit narrowed from $40.6 billion in 2023.",
      "For goods alone, the U.S. bought $70.6 billion more in goods from Canada than it sold in 2024, down from $72.3 billion in 2023.",
      "The overwhelming driver of the deficit with Canada is that the U.S. buys a lot of unrefined oil from the country, according to Julian Karaguesian, a lecturer at the department of economics at McGill University.",
      "\"A lot of Canadian economists say if you take out energy, Canada is running a small deficit with the United States,\" Karaguesian said.",

In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the U.S.-Canada border, accounting for roughly 0.2% of all fentanyl seized by CBP that year.

By letting the waiver lapse, the banks may no longer access U.S. payment systems to conduct major energy transactions.",
      "The Russian financial institutions that had been exempt from sanctions included Vnesheconombank, Bank Financial Corporation Otkritie, Sovcombank, Sberbank, VTB Bank, Alfa-Bank, Rosbank, Bank Zenit, Bank Saint-Petersburg and the Central Bank of Russia.",
      "The decision to further restrict access to American banking systems makes it harder for other countries to buy Russian oil, thus limiting its global supply. It could lead to a price spike of up to $5 per barrel more, a notable jump after lower prices in recent weeks.",
      "But the stiffer restrictions also come as the Trump administration is trying to convince Russia to accept terms of a proposed 30-day ceasefire to end the war in Ukraine. President Trump on Thursday said U.S. officials are meeting with \"President Putin and others\" and having \"very serious discussions.\"",

      "The people said Paul was demoted from his position because he clashed with the DOGE's alleged push to share tax information with multiple agencies. The news also comes as the IRS plans to institute massive cuts to its workforce.",

      "The IRS is drafting plans to cut its workforce by as much as half through a mix of layoffs, attrition and incentivized buyouts as part of President Trump's efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. The administration is closing agencies, laying off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection and offering buyouts to almost all federal employees through a \"deferred resignation program\" to quickly reduce the government workforce.",
      "Already, roughly 7,000 probationary IRS employees with roughly one year or less of service were laid off from the organization in February.",
      "But the mass layoffs of probationary workers are now in doubt after a federal judge in California on Thursday ruled that their terminations by the Office of Personnel Management were unlawful and ordered six federal agencies to reinstate\u00a0the employees. The decision by U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco followed a legal challenge brought by a group of unions against the Trump administration.",

      "Paul is not the first government official to be demoted after voicing concern about access to sensitive systems and taxpayer data.",

      "After 30 years of service, Michelle King, the SSA's acting commissioner, stepped down from her role in February after refusing to provide DOGE access Social Security recipient information, according to two people familiar with the official's departure who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. King was replaced by Leland Dudek, who oversaw the SSA's fraud investigation office.",
      "\"The series of IRS officials who have put the law above their personal job security join a line of public servants, stretching back to Treasury and IRS leaders during the Nixon era, who have resisted unlawful attempts by elected officials to weaponize taxpayer data and systems,\" Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of the Tax Law Center at New York University School of Law, said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Sweeping 25% tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminum imports\u00a0could cause prices on a range of consumers foods, including cars and washing machines, to rise. Components used in manufacturing and for construction such as nails, could also become more expensive.",
      "Anything that's made with metal, from homes and cars to canned foods and beverages could soon get a new and higher price tag.",
      "\"All manufacturing that uses steel or aluminum, or uses something that uses steel and aluminum will be affected,\" international trade expert Christine McDaniel, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dr. Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow and director at the Pacific Research Institute, a right-leaning think tank, called the forthcoming tariff impact \"a barn burner,\" leading to higher prices and an economic slowdown.",
      "He added that all \"broad-based core commodities\" are vulnerable to price hikes as a result of the levies. In addition to automobiles and electronics, which rely heavily on metals, that includes less obvious goods like canned goods, whose prices could rise if packaging costs jump.",
      "\"We are going to see it in places you don't expect it,\" Winegarden said.",
      "American consumers likely to see higher prices on cars and more",
      "Car, truck, bus and tractor parts were the largest import category by volume last year, that will be covered under the tariffs, according to the United States International Trade Commission.",
      "American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, said the new tariffs \"will add significant costs for automakers, suppliers and consumers\" in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Inevitably, some of those added costs will be passed along to consumers.",
      "\"It is not easy for American companies that use steel and aluminum in production to find it elsewhere, so we'll see increases in prices. Makers of vehicles will face higher costs, which will be passed on to consumers,\" Layna Mosley, politics and international affairs professor at Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Metal parts on doors, window frames and other hardware used in the construction of housing will also be subject to the levies, leading to growing costs for homebuilders.",
      "Jim Tobin, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders, pointed to estimates showing that the metal tariffs could add up to $10,000 to the cost of a home, although he noted it is likely to take months for the impact to become clear. \"Those costs are going to be passed on to the ultimate homeowner or renter,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Machine parts, including steel wires, screws and more are also likely to be hit, raising the price of a broad range of appliances from dishwashers and dryers to garbage disposals and air conditioners.",
      "\"Just look around the house. Anything that has steel or aluminum in it will be exposed to tariffs,\" McDaniel said.",
      "Gym and sports equipment will also be tariffed, though manufacturers may have stockpiled some materials in anticipation of the tariffs going into effect, enabling them to head off price hikes for a short period, Mosley noted.",
      "Higher price for aluminum cans",
      "In addition to automakers, construction projects and possibly defense contractors, the tariffs would also increase costs to \"food processing and packaging including can manufacturers,\" Satyam Panday, chief economist, U.S. and Canada, S&P Global Ratings, said in a recent report.",
      "Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said in an earnings call last month said that the company imports aluminum for its cans, and that if tariffs make them more expensive, it could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.",
      "\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"",
      "\"Tariffs and non-tariff barriers tend to disproportionately burden the small and midsize businesses,\" added Panday. \"Profits are likely to be squeezed at the margin. To the extent businesses can pass on the rising cost, consumers would also eventually see their prices increase. Overall, pressure on inflation would rise just as markets and consumers are appearing to be sensitive to inflationary expectations.\"",
      "For Brooklyn-based brewery Talea, the tariffs on aluminum, which the company uses for its beer cans, could lead to higher operating costs, co-founder LeAnn Darland recently told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady. Darland said she hopes to share any increased costs with suppliers, because she's not sure consumers will be willing to swallow any price hikes.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:31:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Consumers, businesses and investors are increasingly jittery about the risks of a protracted slump. So what exactly is a recession?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump sparked concerns this week when he declined to rule out the possibility of a U.S. recession this year. Asked on Fox news if he expects such a slump, Mr. Trump said, \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also seemed to leave open the possibility of a downturn, telling CBS News in an interview on Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"worth it\" even if they lead to a recession.",
      "While it is notoriously hard to predict a recession, there are definitive criteria that must be met in order for a business cycle to be considered recessionary. Here's what to know.",
      "What is a recession, and who decides if we're in one?",
      "A recession is generally defined as a broad-based, persistent decline in economic activity. The more popular metric is that a recession is two straight quarters of negative economic growth, although in fact there's more to it than.",
      "Recessions are identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a non-profit, nonpartisan research group that dates U.S. business cycles. To determine if the economy has entered a recession, NBER evaluates six key indicators: real personal income; non-farm payroll employment; employment as measured by the household survey; personal consumption; manufacturing and trade sales; and industrial production.",
      "More specifically, NBER looks at the depth of the changes in these indicators, how broadly a slump is affecting different industries and how long a downturn lasts. The upshot: In a recession, the decline in economic activity must be significant, sustained and widespread, rather than limited to a particular sector.",
      "Could the U.S. tumble into a recession anytime soon?",
      "For now, economic data suggest that's unlikely. Although layoffs around the country are rising, the U.S. labor market continues to create jobs at a decent clip. Despite economic growth slowing, it's not expected to fall off a cliff. In fact, Julia Pollack, chief economist at career site ZipRecruiter, notes that four of the six signals tracked by the NBER point to continued economic expansion.",
      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Still, cracks are appearing that could portend a sharper downturn down the road. Retail spending, which is the lifeblood of the economy, is\u00a0waning, while measures of consumer confidence show a\u00a0sharp deterioration of late. Investor concerns about the Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on other nations has also slammed stock prices, which could further pressure spending.",
      "\"Negative consumption is concerning because consumer spending is backbone of U.S. economy,\" Pollack said. \"And it's not just that spending fell. Sentiment has fallen, household budgets are squeezed and consumers are more vulnerable to shocks, which has heightened recession fears.\"",
      "Sweet added, \"Right now, your traditional causes of a recession aren't flashing red, but we just have this suffocating effect of all the uncertainty around trade and fiscal policy and immigration.\"",
      "Lutnick, the Commerce Department chief, defends Mr. Trump's economic policies, saying they will boost economic activity.",
      "\"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here,\" he told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "What signals would point to a recession?",
      "The clearest sign would be a steady increase in job losses and a jump unemployment. In a recession, consumers pare spending and businesses pull back on investment. That typically leads to a slowdown in hiring and rise in layoffs.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate did tick up last month, to 4.1% from 4%, though that is still quite low. But employers added 151,000 jobs, a sign that businesses are still seeking to hire workers and enough payroll gains to keep unemployment in check.",
      "Many economists monitor the number of people who seek unemployment benefits each week, a gauge that indicates whether layoffs are worsening. Weekly jobless claims\u00a0remain low.",
      "Who is most vulnerable in a recession?",
      "Most Americans would feel the impact of a recession in one way or another, for weaker hiring to tepid wage gains. Among people who are employed, those who entered the labor market last tend to be the first to lose their job in a recession, noted Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at the Groundwork Collective, a left-leaning economic think tank.",
      "\"So you see the people who are hardest to reach as we reach full employment are the first to get laid off. That includes lower wage workers, black workers, Latino workers. Those who have the hardest time getting a job when times are good are first to lose jobs when times are bad,\" he said.",
      "Americans who carry debt on their homes and can't make minimum payments also can face foreclosure in a downturn, locking a generation out of building household wealth.",
      "\"That's one reason why recessions are so damaging, because it's the least among us that get hurt the most when downturns come,\" Jacquez said.",

      "In a post to Truth Social shared just after midnight, Mr. Trump claimed without evidence that Biden himself did not sign the pardons he issued to the members of the Jan. 6 select committee, staff members, and officers from the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department and U.S. Capitol Police who testified before the panel.",
      "Biden signed the \"full and unconditional pardon\" for any offenses arising from the committee's activities on Jan. 19, one day before he left the White House. Others who received preemptive pardons were Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley and several Biden family members.",
      "What did Trump say about Biden's pardons?",
      "Mr. Trump claimed that the pardons his predecessor issued to the select committee members are \"hereby declared void, vacant, and of no further force of effect, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen.\" The president wrote that Biden did not sign the pardons and \"did not know anything about them,\" though Mr. Trump did not provide evidence about the circumstances surrounding Biden's clemency decision.",
      "He said the select committee members \"should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level.\"",
      "A representative for Biden did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "The pardons were issued to the House members who served on the panel in response to Mr. Trump's threats on the campaign trail that he would target them if elected to a second term. He had accused the former and current lawmakers of destroying evidence and committing a \"major crime\" during their probe, and told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in December that \"everybody\" who served on the committee \"should go to jail.\"",
      "Last July, Mr. Trump circulated a social media post accusing former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, the committee's vice chair, of being \"guilty of treason\" and promoting \"televised military tribunals.\"",
      "The president's latest message shared to Truth Social suggests that his administration may investigate Cheney and the others who served alongside her on the Jan. 6 committee.",
      "What is an autopen signature?",
      "Patented in the early 1800s and used by Thomas Jefferson, the autopen is a device used to replicate handwritten signatures.",
      "Presidents have signed documents and correspondence using an autopen for decades. According to Smithsonian Magazine, Harry Truman was the first president to use autopen, and it was said to have been used frequently by President John F. Kennedy. But Barack Obama became the first president to use an autopen for legislation when he directed it to be used to sign an extension of the Patriot Act while in France in May 2011.",
      "President George W. Bush's administration weighed in on the legality of signing legislation with an autopen in 2005, when the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded that \"the president need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.\"",
      "\"Rather, the president may sign a bill within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the president's signature to such a bill, for example by autopen,\" then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General Howard Nielson, Jr., wrote in an opinion for the White House counsel.",
      "As to the pardon power, the Constitution gives the president the exclusive authority to grant clemency, with few limits. And in 2024, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit found that pardons or commutations do not have to be issued in writing.",
      "\"We readily determine that nothing in the Constitution restricts the president's exercise of the clemency power to commutations that have been rendered through a documented writing,\" the unanimous 4th Circuit panel wrote.",
      "While the court found that a writing \"will generally be the means of proving to a third party that the act has occurred,\" it noted that \"a clemency warrant or, indeed, any writing, is not required for the president to exercise this authority under the Constitution.\"",
      "The case before the 4th Circuit also involved Mr. Trump and claims raised by James Rosemond, who is serving life sentences for numerous offenses arising from his role in drug trafficking and a murder. Rosemond claimed that Mr. Trump told two supporters, former Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown and his wife, during a telephone call in December 2020 that his sentence had been commuted.",
      "But Rosemond was not among those who received written clemency warrants during Mr. Trump's first term, and his petition was listed after the president left the White House in January 2021 as \"pending.\"",
      "The judges who issued the decision are Steven Agee, appointed by Bush, Stephanie Thacker, named by Obama, and Allison Jones Rushing, nominated by Mr. Trump.",

    "summary": "Presidents are given the extraordinary power by the 227-year-old law to order the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizens who are 14 years or older and come from countries staging an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Saturday night temporarily blocked President Trump from removing immigrants under a wartime law known as the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act of 1798\u00a0after the president announced earlier in the day that he would enforce the law. Despite the ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador on Saturday, 137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said.",
      "The White House and Justice Department have said they had already been removed from the country when the judge made his ruling.",
      "The judge's ruling was in response to a federal civil lawsuit filed Saturday by a group of five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails against President Trump and other administration officials.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked the 227-year-old wartime law earlier Saturday.",
      "The lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., by attorneys with the ACLU and Democracy Forward argues the Alien Enemies Act is \"a wartime measure that has been used only three times in our Nation's history: the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.\"",
      "In a new filing late on Sunday, the plaintiffs in the case accused the Trump administration of violating the judge's order, alleging that the court had made it clear any planes in the air at the time the order was issued should return to the U.S. In the motion filed overnight, the plaintiffs requested \"that the Court immediately direct the government to submit one or more sworn declarations from individuals with direct knowledge of the facts clarifying\" the timing of the flights carrying the individuals to Ecuador in relation to the issuance of the court's order.",
      "Presidents are given the extraordinary power by the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act\u00a0to order the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizens who are 14 years or older and come from countries staging an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
      "James E. Boasberg, chief judge of the District Court for the U.S. District of Columbia, on Saturday implemented a temporary restraining order preventing their deportations for 14 days. The Justice Department appealed that decision, arguing the D.C. court has no authority over the case because none of the five men are in the district. Four are being held in detention in Texas and one in New York. They further argued that invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is \"speculation.\"",
      "Then, following an emergency hearing Saturday evening, Boasberg expanded his order to include \"all noncitizens in U.S. custody\" who are covered by Mr. Trump's move to invoke the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\"We are thrilled the judge recognized the severe harm our plaintiffs would face if removed,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney leading the lawsuit against Mr. Trump's proclamation, following Boasberg's decision. \"The President's use of the Alien Enemies Act is flat out lawless.\"",
      "Boasberg also appeared to verbally indicate that any deportation flights that were currently in the air with migrants subject to this order on board should be returned to the U.S., although that directive was not part of his written order.",
      "Social media posts from Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele indicated at least one flight carrying deported individuals had arrived in his country after the order. In one post, Bukele commented on a news story about the ruling by writing, \"Oopsie\u2026 Too late.\" That post was shared by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House Communications Director Steven Cheung.",
      "The Trump administration insists it did not defy the court order. The Justice Department, which has appealed the ruling, said in a court filing that several people \"had already been removed from United States territory under the Proclamation before the issuance of this Court's second order.\" It noted that the five men covered by the first temporary restraining order had not been deported.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Sunday said, \"The Administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order,\" also saying the order came after the deportation flight to El Salvador had left the country.",
      "The lawsuit states that Mr. Trump is \"expected to authorize immediate removal of noncitizens that the Proclamation deems to be alien enemies, without any opportunity for judicial review.\"",
      "\"It also contorts the plain language of the Act: arrivals of noncitizens from Venezuela are deemed an 'invasion' or 'predatory incursion' by a 'foreign nation or government,' where Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, is deemed to be sufficiently akin to a foreign nation or government,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "As such, the government can identify any Venezuelan in the U.S. as a member of that gang, regardless of facts, and seek to deport them, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement responding to the ruling that, \"Tonight, a DC trial judge supported Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans. TdA is represented by the ACLU. This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump's power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk.\"",
      "The lawsuit further argued that the Alien Enemies Act \"has only ever been a power invoked in time of war, and plainly only applies to warlike actions: it cannot be used here against nationals of a country \u2014 Venezuela \u2014 with whom the United States is not at war, which is not invading the United States, and which has not launched a predatory incursion into the United States.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that Mahmoud Khalil, an activist who is being detained by federal immigration authorities, is \"going to leave \u2014 and so are others.\"",
      "\"We're going to keep doing it,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old who was born in Syria to Palestinian parents, served as a negotiator on behalf of students during Columbia University's 2024 student encampment protests. He was arrested March 8 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and detained in New Jersey before being transported to a federal detention facility in Louisiana. Officials were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, Khalil's attorney said, but when they were informed that he was in the U.S. as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that, too.",
      "Rubio said after the arrest that the administration would be revoking the visas and green cards \"of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",
      "On Sunday, when asked whether he could provide evidence to support a link to terrorism, or whether Khalil was simply espousing a controversial political point of view, Rubio cited news footage, saying \"these guys take over entire buildings, they vandalize colleges.\"",
      "\"Negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus, that vandalized buildings,\" Rubio said. \"That's a crime in and of itself, that they're involved in being a negotiator, the spokesperson.\"",
      "The secretary of state explained the thought process, which he called \"very simple,\" outlining that when someone entered the U.S. with a visa \u2014 whether as a student or tourist \u2014 they do so as a \"guest.\"",
      "\"And if you tell us, when you apply for a visa, 'I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events,' that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America,\" Rubio said. \"If you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa.\"",
      "Neither Rubio nor the White House have provided evidence that Khalil supported Hamas in any way other than support for the protesters at Columbia University, and Khalil's lawyers say he is being punished for exercising his right to protest. Khalil's attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the case, and declare that his arrest and detention violate the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.",
      "A top ICE official in New York said in a court filing on Thursday that ICE charged Khalil as \"removable \u2026 in that the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe that his presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "Rubio said that if Khalil had said he planned to enter the U.S. to become a \"spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down,\" preventing students from attending classes and resulting in vandalization of buildings, \"we never would have let him in.\"",
      "More broadly, Rubio said the administration \"every day now\" is approving visa revocations, suggesting that if the visa led to a green card, that has implications for the green card process as well.",
      "Asked whether people with pro-Palestinian views would be the sole target having their visas revoked, Rubio said members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang would be targeted as well, adding that \"we don't want terrorists in America.\"",
      "\"We don't want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety,\" Rubio said. \"It's that simple.\"",

    "story": [
      "Johannesburg\u00a0\u2014 The Trump administration expelled South Africa's Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool on Friday, giving him 72 hours to leave the country. In a social media post, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Rasool a \"race-baiting politician who hates America\" and President Trump.",
      "In a diplomatic notice, the Department of State said that it would no longer recognize Ambassador Rasool as a \"member of the [South African] mission from today, March 17,\" adding that \"his privileges and immunities will cease\" and that he was \"persona non grata\" in the United States.",
      "The expulsion came after Rasool, during a webinar hosted by the South African Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection, accused Mr. Trump of pursuing policies and practices that the diplomat characterized as \"a white supremacist response to growing demographic diversity in the United States.\"",
      "Rasool was expelled just two months after he arrived in Washington to serve as his country's envoy.",
      "\"Improving our relationship with the United States of America is a priority for us,\" South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa told journalists on Monday, calling the U.S. \"our second largest trading partner after China.\"",
      "\"We have noted the displeasure that has been expressed by the United States, particularly about the remarks he made,\" Ramaphosa said, adding that he expected Rasool to return to Pretoria and \"give me a full report.\"",
      "It's the latest in a string of incidents that have seen a marked deterioration of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and South Africa since Mr. Trump took office for his second term in January.",
      "Speaking on South African television on Saturday, the country's foreign minister said the decision by the U.S. to expel Rasool, who previously campaigned against the country's racist Apartheid regime, was \"unprecedented and regrettable,\" before adding: \"We need to find time to engage with each other behind closed doors, where the U.S. can raise their concerns with us, and we can also raise our concerns with them, because it is not helpful to engage in megaphone and Twitter diplomacy.\"",
      "A pro-Hamas, anti-Israel ambassador to the U.S.?",
      "Rasool's appointment to head the South African diplomatic mission in the U.S., by the ruling African National Congress party, was a contentious one even before he arrived in Washington, dividing opinions within the country's new Government of National Unity (GNU). The ANC had to build the coalition government to maintain power after failing to win a significant enough majority in the last elections to govern on its own.",
      "\"Rasool's appointment was opposed by all of the other political parties in the GNU, and was the first large point of contention between the parties,\" Wiliam Gumede, a professor of public management at Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, explained to CBS News.",
      "\"Eventually, the non-ANC partners caved in,\" Gumede said, which led to Rasool getting the job.",
      "\"He is perceived to be pro-Iran and Hamas, as well as strongly anti-Israel, which is largely why it was felt he was the wrong choice for the ambassador post,\" Gumede told CBS News.",
      "Rasool has long been a controversial figure in South African politics, having spoken favorably of the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization Hamas, and even\u00a0boasting of his ties with the group's leadership. He is a strong backer of the case South Africa filed with the United Nations' top court, accusing Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. Israel has vehemently rejected that accusation, arguing that its war in the Palestinian enclave has been a legitimate self-defense against Hamas following the group's Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack.",
      "Gumede said he believed the way for Ramaphosa to ease the tension with Washington was for the South African president to publicly label Rasool's comments \"unacceptable,\" while also giving a detailed acknowledgement of how important relations and aid from the U.S. are to South Africa.",
      "The analyst said if such measures were not taken by Pretoria to smooth the relationship, the impasse could deepen, with significant implications for South Africa.",
      "\"I fear the next step steps could be targeted economic sanctions against South Africa, which would mean we are in danger of losing 300,000 to 400,000 direct jobs in the country, as well as hundreds of thousands more jobs through indirect channels,\" he said.",
      "\"It's not too late,\" Gumede added. \"President Trump has a lot of South Africans in his inner circle. We need to engage them and put together a team of non-ANC partners from the Government of National Unity to travel to the U.S. and engage the Trump team. The relationship is simply too important not to.\"",

      "U.S. fighter aircraft shot down about 11 drones the Houthis launched over the course of several hours Sunday morning local time, a U.S. official said. The Houthis also launched a ballistic missile that crashed into the water well short of the USS Harry S. Truman, the official said.",
      "Mr. Trump in January signed an executive order re-designating the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. Mr. Trump had designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization in Jan. 2021, but former President Joe Biden removed the designation shortly afterward due to limitations it would place on delivering humanitarian aid to Yemen, although the Biden administration went on to label the group as a \"Specially Designated Global Terror Group\" in 2024.",
      "Saturday's strikes came as the Houthis out of Yemen have been disrupting transit in an important Red Sea transit point for global shipping for months, and the group said earlier this week that it would resume attacks on Israeli ships in response to Israel's blockage of aid to Gaza. The U.S., Israel and the United Kingdom have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen, but Rubio said that while the Biden administration responded to previous attacks with retaliatory strikes, the new strikes are \"not a one-off.\"",
      "\"This is not a message,\" Rubio said. \"This is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping.\"",
      "The secretary of state said that over the last 18 months, the Houthis have \"struck or attacked 174 Naval vessels of the United States,\" along with 145 attacks on commercial shipping.",
      "\"So we basically have a band of pirates, you know, with guided precision anti-ship weaponry and exacting a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world,\" Rubio said. \"That's just not sustainable.\"",
      "Asked how long the campaign will last, Rubio said it will continue until the Houthis \"no longer have the capability to do that.\" He also acknowledged that he's heard no talk of ground raids so far and doesn't think there's \"a necessity for it right now.\"",
      "Rubio said as of Saturday night, \"some of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us,\" adding that \"some of the facilities that they use are no longer existing, and that will continue.\"",
      "\"We're not going to have people sitting around with the missiles attacking the U.S. Navy,\" Rubio said. \"It's not going to happen. Not under President Trump.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump's extraordinary order is breathtaking in its scope and has little precedent in U.S. history.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to order the swift detention and deportation of all Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang, treating them like wartime enemies of the U.S. government.",
      "In his proclamation, the president argued the Venezuelan gang was \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,\" the legal threshold for invoking the 227-year-old war authority.",
      "The president directed the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice to \"apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove every\" Venezuelan migrant, 14 or older, who is deemed to be part of Tren de Aragua and who lacks U.S. citizenship or permanent residency.",
      "Those subject to the law would be eligible to be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without any of the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, which include opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they would be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws.",
      "But Mr. Trump's directive was dealt an almost immediate blow on Saturday, after a federal judge agreed to block the government from deporting anyone in U.S. immigration custody subject to the president's Alien Enemies Act proclamation.",
      "At the request of a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, James Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., temporarily blocked those deportations through a 14-day temporary restraining order. Deportation flights in the air with deportees subject to Mr. Trump's decree should return to the U.S., Boasberg indicated during a hearing Saturday evening.",
      "Earlier Saturday, Boasberg issued another order blocking the deportation of five Venezuelan migrants in immigration detention who the ACLU said were at risk of being expelled under Mr. Trump's directive.",
      "\"We are thrilled the judge recognized the severe harm our plaintiffs would face if removed,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney leading the lawsuit against Mr. Trump's proclamation. \"The President's use of the Alien Enemies Act is flat out lawless.\"",
      "The Justice Department forcefully denounced the court order. \"Tonight, a DC trial judge supported Tren de Aragua terrorists over the safety of Americans. TdA is represented by the ACLU,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump's power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk.\"",
      "As Mr. Trump's proclamation was litigated in Washington, the U.S. deported more than 260 migrants to El Salvador over the weekend, including Venezuelans with alleged ties to Tren de Aragua. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele posted a video showing some of the deportees being escorted by armed soldiers and police, having their heads shaved and marched into a prison.",
      "A senior administration official said 137 of the 261 deportees sent to El Salvador were alleged Venezuelan gang members expelled under the Alien Enemies Act. Another 101 Venezuelans were deported under regular immigration law, the official said. The group, the official added, also included 21 Salvadorans accused of MS13 gang membership and two \"special cases\" that Bukele described as gang leaders wanted by El Salvador's government.",
      "In a filing on Sunday, the Justice Department said the alleged Venezuelan gang members \"had already been removed from United States territory\" under the Alien Enemies Act before the court order barring the expulsions.",
      "The White House denied it had defied the judge's order. \"The Administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist (Tren de Aragua) aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory.\"",
      "Leavitt added, \"A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrier full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's extraordinary order is breathtaking in its scope and has little precedent in U.S. history. The law it cites, enacted 22 years after the Declaration of Independence, references invasions and incursions staged by \"any foreign nation or government.\"",
      "The centuries-old statue has been invoked only a few times in American history, including during World War I and World War II, when U.S. officials cited it to surveil and detain foreigners from Italy, Germany and Japan.",
      "But never before has the Aliens Enemies Act been invoked to target migrants from countries with which the U.S. is not actively at war or with the premise that a non-state actor is staging an invasion or incursion of the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump in his order argued Tren de Aragua is \"closely aligned\" with the repressive government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "\"(Tren de Aragua) has engaged in and continues to engage in mass illegal migration to the United States to further its objectives of harming United States citizens, undermining public safety, and supporting the Maduro regime's goal of destabilizing democratic nations in the Americas, including the United States,\" Mr. Trump said in his order.",

    "summary": "President Trump has repeatedly said the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and Israel approached the governments of Sudan and Somalia, and have also been interested in Syria, as potential places to resettle Palestinians from Gaza, according to three sources familiar with the effort.",
      "The idea of Palestinian resettlement in another country is one of several options the Trump team is chewing over as part of the U.S. president's larger goal of ending Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and rebuilding the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" President Trump said Wednesday, when the Irish Prime Minister was asked during the two leaders' Oval Office meeting by a Voice of America reporter about the president's controversial remarks in February when he suggested taking ownership of Gaza to rebuild it.",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a Feb. 4 press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Gaza could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "\"\u200aWe should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this, and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A combination of Israeli and U.S. officials communicated to Sudan and Somalia, two diplomatic sources confirmed to CBS News. Senior far-right Israeli government officials have already been calling for Palestinians to migrate from the enclave. Mr. Trump's remarks have only emboldened Israel to reach out to other countries to explore opportunities for Palestinian resettlement, one source said.",
      "Three sources familiar with Mr. Trump's idea of resettling Gazans to another country told CBS News that his administration and Israel have also been interested in Syria. One source familiar with the Trump administration's Middle East policy said that the administration has attempted outreach to Syria's new interim government via a third-party interlocutor. Another source from the region told CBS News that Syria's government had been approached, but it was unclear whether there had been any response from Syria to the outreach.",
      "A senior Syrian official told CBS News that they are unaware of any outreach to their government by Israel or the U.S. about resettlement of Gazans.",
      "Dahir Hassan, Somalia's ambassador to the U.S., told CBS News that \"neither the U.S. administration nor Israeli authorities have approached the Somali government regarding any proposed relocation of Palestinians to Somalia.\" Hassan also cited concern that \"the dissemination of such unverified information risks fueling recruitment propaganda for extremist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, potentially exacerbating security challenges in the region.\"",
      "The Sudanese government has not responded to a CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Syria's fledgling interim government is just three months old, after toppling Bashar al-Assad and his brutal regime which held an iron fist over the Syrian people for decades. The Arab northeast African nation of Sudan is currently embroiled in civil war and a refugee crisis while suffering pockets of famine. Tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have sought asylum in Israel over the last two decades, only to be detained in the country's desert-based detention centers or left to live without any formal status. The East African country of Somalia is a fragile, formerly failed state where the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab continues to wage a deadly insurgency.",
      "Since his Feb. 4 news conference, Mr. Trump has suggested Palestinians would have a choice on whether to leave but also indicated that their departure from Gaza could be permanent. In a Fox News interview several days later he said, \"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities, could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they (the Palestinians) are.\" In the same interview, he said that Palestinians wouldn't have the right to return to Gaza under his plan because the enclave \"is not habitable\" and won't be for years to come.",
      "The United Nations reported in January that over 90% of housing units in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million Gazan civilians have been displaced. Gaza's health ministry says more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in which Hamas killed more than 1,000 Israelis and took roughly 100 more hostage.",
      "Multiple Arab governments, the United Nations and some Democratic lawmakers, quickly denounced Mr. Trump's idea of emptying out Gaza with some defining the idea as ethnic cleansing. Instead, Arab leaders endorsed an alternative Egyptian post-war construction plan for Gaza last week, but the Trump administration and Israel were both quick to reject it, again citing that the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had been sending U.S. officials on a regular basis to meet with the new Syrian government in Damascus in the lead-up to Mr. Trump's inauguration when the visits stopped.\u00a0 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, was quick to condemn Mr. Trump's remarks in February, saying that the U.S. president's plan \"is a serious crime that will ultimately fail\". It is unclear what the Trump administration's overall policy toward the new Syrian government will be.",
      "\"The Trump administration should engage directly with the new government in Damascus, particularly after the agreement between Damascus and the SDF (the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces). And to ensure that Iran never again gains a foothold in Syria, for the true, enduring defeat of ISIS, and to conduct a full withdrawal of U.S. forces in the right way unlike what unfolded in Afghanistan,\" Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Washington-based advocacy and humanitarian organization Syrian Emergency Task Force, told CBS News.",
      "Israel has conducted widespread airstrikes in Syria since December, on what it described as Assad regime weapons sites, and seized territory in the buffer zone between both countries. This past week, Israel struck inside a Damascus suburb, saying it was taking out the headquarters of the Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group that has a substantial foothold in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
      "A State Department spokesperson deferred to the Israeli government, and told CBS News that Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff \"continues to work tirelessly towards either an extension of Phase One (of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement) or an advance to Phase Two with these principles in mind\".",
      "The State Department also referred to remarks by Witkoff from a February Fox News interview in which he said, \"We need to explore new policy prescriptions that ultimately end up in a better life for Gazans and Palestinians.\"",
      "Witkoff also suggested in the same Fox interview that Gaza's entire Palestinian population could go to other Middle East-based Arab nations and other countries beyond the region: \"I think that the president's solution is: how do we address where two million people can go? And I think the obvious answers are: in some respects, Egypt, in some respects, Jordan; but in some respects other countries who have called us up and voluntarily said this is a humanitarian effort, we want to help you\".",
      "Asked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday about whether the Trump administration is talking to other countries about relocation of two million Palestinians in Gaza, Witkoff said again \"I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that lead to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things.\"",
      "Millions of displaced Palestinians already live in surrounding Arab countries as refugees, including in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. Far-right Israeli ministers have increasingly called for moving Palestinians in Gaza and also in the West Bank off their land as part of the extreme view it would fulfill a Biblical claim by Jews to the land, and increase Israel's security.",
      "The Israeli government, the White House and its National Security Council all declined to respond to multiple CBS News requests for comment.",
      "Trump's son-in-law and former advisor Jared Kushner first suggested that Gaza's \"waterfront property could be very valuable, if people would focus on building up livelihoods\" during an on-camera discussion at Harvard University in February 2024.",
      "The Associated Press was the first to report Friday that the U.S. and Israel had contacted Sudan, Somalia, and also Somaliland, about resettling Palestinians from Gaza.",

      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "As we come on the air, U.S. forces are in the midst of President Trump's most significant military campaign thus far in his second term.",
      "Let's get straight to it this morning with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who joins us from Miami, Florida.",
      "Mr. Secretary, for our audience, just to explain, this Red Sea area is a really important transit point for global shipping. The Houthis out of Yemen have been disrupting transit there for some time. President Trump cited these concerns when he announced the strikes. I'm wondering, how long will this campaign last and will it involve ground forces?",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Well, first of all, the problem here is that this is a very important shipping lane. And in the last year- and-a-half, last 18 months, the Houthis have struck or attacked 174 Naval vessels of the United States, attacking the U.S. Navy directly 174 times. And 145 times, they have attacked commercial shipping.",
      "So we basically have a band of pirates with guided precision anti-ship weaponry and exacting a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world. That's just not sustainable. We are not going to have these people controlling which ships can go through and which ones cannot.",
      "And so your question is, how long will this go on? It will go on until they no longer have the capability to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what does U.S. intelligence tell us at this point? Because the U.S. had been conducting strikes for some time, but has not stopped the Houthis.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what's going to be different right now? Do you have more fidelity in the intelligence that would make this more successful?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, those strikes were retaliation strikes. So they launch one missile, we hit the missile launcher, or we sent something to do it. This is not a message. This is not a one-off.",
      "This is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping. And it's just not going to happen. We're not going to have these guys, these people with weapons able to tell us where our ships can go, where the ships of all the world can go, by the way. It's not just the U.S. We're doing the world a favor.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We're doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping. That's the mission here. And it will continue until that's carried out. That never happened before. The Biden administration didn't do that.",
      "All the Biden administration would do is, they would respond to an attack. These guys would launch one rocket, we'd hit the rocket launcher. That's it. This is an effort to take away their ability to control global shipping in that part of the world. That's just not going to happen anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And it could\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So, this will continue until that's finished.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It could involve ground raids?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, those are military decisions to be made, but I have heard no talk of ground raids. I don't think there's a necessity for it right now.",
      "I can tell you that, as of last night, some of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us. And I can tell you that some of the facilities that they used are no longer existing. And that will continue.",
      "Look, it's \u2013 bottom line, easy way to understand it, OK, these guys are able to control what ships can go through there. They have attacked the U.S. Navy 174 times. They have attacked the United States Navy. We're not going to have people sitting around with the missiles attacking the U.S. Navy. It's not going to happen, not under President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president also referenced Iran in his statement. Iran provides some support for the Houthis, as you know.",
      "Put this in context for me, because U.S. intelligence has been suggesting for some time that Israel has the desire and intent to conduct an attack on Iran's developing nuclear program in the coming months. President Trump has extended an offer for negotiations.",
      "Have you heard anything back from Iran? Is this strike in Yemen a signal to Iran?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: This strike in Yemen is about their ability, the ability of the Houthis to strike global shipping and attack the U.S. Navy, and their willingness to do it, 174 times against the U.S. Navy, 145 sometimes against global shipping. That's what the strike is about.",
      "What we can't ignore and the reason why the president mentioned Iran is because the Iranians have supported the Houthis. They have provided them intelligence. They have provided them guidance. They have provided them weaponry. I mean, there's no way the Houthis, OK, the Houthis, would have the ability to do this kind of thing unless they had support from Iran.",
      "And so this was a message to Iran. Don't keep supporting them, because then you will also be responsible for what they are doing in attacking Navy ships, in attacking global shipping.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They also get support from Russia, potentially, which you leveraged sanctions in regard to.",
      "But I want to ask you about tariffs, because you were just in Canada this past week. China is Canada's second biggest export market, Mexico's third. In this ongoing trade back and forth the U.S. is having, isn't there a risk that China will ultimately be the winner? If it's too costly to deal with the United States, won't they benefit?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, actually, China and Canada are involved in a mini-trade war right now. In fact, the Chinese have imposed a bunch of tariffs, reciprocal or retaliatory tariffs, on Canada after Canada imposed tariffs on them.",
      "So here's the way everyone needs to understand this, OK? The president rightfully believes that the balance of global trade is completely off kilter. For 30 or 40 years, we have allowed countries to treat us unfairly in global trade, much of it during the Cold War because we wanted them to be rich and prosperous because they were our allies in the Cold War.",
      "But now that has to change. You look at the European Union. The European Union's economy is about the same size as ours. It's not a low-wage economy. It's very comparable to ours in terms of its composition and so forth. Why do they have a trade surplus with us?",
      "So what the president is saying is two things. Number one, there are critical industries like aluminum, like steel, like semiconductors, like automobile manufacturing, that he rightfully believes, President Trump rightfully believes, the U.S. needs to have a domestic capability. And the way you protect those industries and build that capability is by ensuring that there's economic incentives to produce in the United States.",
      "The second is global. And that is, we are going to put tariffs on countries reciprocal to what they impose on us. And so this is a global \u2013 it's not against Canada. It's not against Mexico. It's not against the E.U. It's everybody.",
      "And then, from that new baseline of fairness and reciprocity, we will engage potentially in bilateral negotiations with countries around the world on new trade arrangements that make sense for both sides. Fairness. But, right now, it's not fair. We're going to reset the baseline and then we can enter into these bilateral agreements potentially with countries so that our trade is fair.",
      "What's not going to continue is \u2013 of course, these countries are upset.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is all just about leverage to get bilateral not free trade \u2013 not North American free trade deals?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, no, it's not leverage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Renegotiation?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's fairness. It's resetting baseline fairness. And then from there we can work on deals and so forth because they will have products we don't make. We have products they don't make. That's where trade works the best.",
      "It has to be free, but it has to be fair in that country. And, right now, it's only free on one side and it's not fair for the other side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, sir\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It's an unsustainable position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 the ad hoc nature of these policy announcements and pullbacks are causing concern in the marketplace, as we saw this past week.",
      "So I heard you describe what seemed like a strategy to get to negotiations on a bilateral front. You also seemed to negotiate \u2013 you say this was national security-minded.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But then we also see comments by the president of like 200 percent tariffs on champagne. That's not a critical industry for the United States. That seems more emotional.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, that means \u2013 that's called retaliation. That's what happens in these trade exchanges. They're going to increase tariffs on \u2013 they already have high tariffs. They're going to add more to their tariffs? Fine.",
      "Then we will have to find something to \u2013 I mean, you tell me. I mean, Canada's going after whiskey and orange juice. And, I mean\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In retaliation.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Yes, exactly. So that sounds pretty petty to me as well. So what's the difference?",
      "The point is, I get it. I understand why these countries don't like it, because the status quo of trade is good for them. It benefits them. They like the status quo. We don't like the status quo. We are going to set a new status quo. And then we can negotiate something, if they want to, that is fair for both sides.",
      "But what we have now cannot continue. We have deindustrialized this country, deindustrialized the United States of America. There are things we can no longer make and we have to be able to make in order to be safe as a country and in order to have jobs. That's why we had a Rust Belt. That's why we have suffered all these important jobs that once sustained entire communities wiped out by trade that basically sent these factories, these jobs, this industrial capability to other places.",
      "That cannot and will not continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't know \u2013 President Trump. This is no mystery. He's been talking about this since the 1980s, actually, even before he was a political figure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: This is going to happen, and it's going to happen now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Russia.",
      "You said Envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting with Vladimir Putin that happened last week would answer the fundamental question of whether we're moving towards a cease-fire or whether Putin is using a delay tactic. You spoke with Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister, yesterday. Is this a delay tactic?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think that was a promising meeting. As I have said repeatedly, we're not going to negotiate this in the public. Hopefully, we will have something to announce at some point fairly soon. I can't guarantee that, but I certainly think the meeting was promising, The exchange was promising.",
      "I don't take away from Steve's meeting, from Ambassador Witkoff's meeting, negativity. There are some challenges. This is a complex three-year war that's been ongoing along a very long military front with a lot of complexity to it. So, no one's claiming that it's easy.",
      "But I want everyone to understand here's the plan. Plan A is, get the shooting to stop, so that we can move to plan B, phase two, which is have everybody at a table, maybe not \u2013 maybe with some shuttle diplomacy, to figure out a way to permanently end this war in a way that's enduring and that respects everybody's needs and so forth.",
      "No one is saying that that second part is easy, but we can't get even to that second part until we get past the first part. It's hard to negotiate an enduring end to a war as long as they're shooting at each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And so the president wants a cease-fire, and that's what we're working on.",
      "Assuming we can get that done \u2013 and that won't be easy in and of itself \u2013 we move to the second phase, which is negotiating something more enduring and permanent. That will be hard. It will involve a lot of hard work, concessions from both sides, but it has to happen. This war cannot continue.",
      "The president has been clear about that, and he's doing everything he can to bring it to an end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. We will talk about that later in the program as well with Envoy Witkoff.",
      "I want to ask you about a decision you made to revoke a student visa for someone at Columbia University this past week. \"The Wall Street Journal\" Editorial Board writes: \"The administration needs to be careful it's targeting real promoters of terrorism, not breaking the great promise of a green card by deporting anyone with controversial political views.\"",
      "Can you substantiate any form of material support for terrorism specifically to Hamas from this Columbia student? Or was it simply that he was espousing a controversial political point of view?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, not just the student. We're going to do more. In fact, we \u2013 every day now, we're approving visa revocations, and if that visa led to a green card, the green card process as well.",
      "And here's why. It's very simple. When you apply to enter the United States and you get a visa, you are a guest and you're coming as a student, you're coming as a tourist or what have you. And, in it, you have to make certain assertions. And if you tell us when you apply for a visa, I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events, that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America.",
      "It's that simple. So you lied. You came \u2013 if you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa. Now you're here. Now you do it. You lied to us. You're out. It's that simple. It's that straightforward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is there any \u2013 but is there any evidence of a link to terrorism, or is it just his point of view?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Sure. Yes, they take over \u2013 I mean, do you not \u2013 I mean, you should watch the news. These guys take over entire buildings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We covered it intensely.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: They vandalized colleges. They shut down colleges. Well, then you should know that this is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm asking about the specific justification for the revocation of his visa. Was there any evidence of material support for terrorism?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, this specific individual was the spokesperson, was the negotiator on \u2013 negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus, that vandalized buildings? Negotiating over what? That's a crime, in and of itself, that they're involved and being a negotiator, the spokesperson, this, that, the other.",
      "We don't want \u2013 we don't need these people in our country. We never should have allowed him in, in the first place. If he had told us, I'm going over there and I'm going over there to become the spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down, people can't even go to school, library \u2013 the buildings being vandalized, we never would have let him in.",
      "We never would have let him in to begin with.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And now that he's doing it and he's here, he's going to leave. And so are others. And we're going to keep doing it.",
      "We are\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And, by the way, I find it ironic that a lot of these people out there defending the First Amendment speech, alleged free speech rights of these Hamas sympathizers\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: .. they had no problem, OK, pressuring social media to censor American political speech.",
      "So I think it's ironic and hypocritical. But the bottom line is this. If you are in this country to promote Hamas, to promote terrorist organizations, to participate in vandalism, to participate in acts of rebellion\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: .. and riots on campus, we never would have let you in if we had known that. And now that we know it, you're going to leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it only pro-Palestinian people who are going to have their visas revoked or are other points of view as well?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, I think anybody who's here in favor \u2013 look, we want to get rid of Tren de Aragua gang members.",
      "They're terrorists too. I \u2013 we \u2013 the president designated them\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 asked me to designate, and I did, as a terrorist organization. We want to get rid of them as well.",
      "You \u2013 we don't want terrorists in America. I don't know how hard that is to understand. We want people \u2013 we don't want people in our country that are going to be\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety. It's that simple\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 especially people that are here as guests. That is what a visa is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I don't know what we have gotten it in our head that a visa is some sort of birthright. It is not. It is a visitor into our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And if you violate the terms of your visitation, you are going to leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, Secretary Rubio, I'd like to have you back, talk to you about a lot more on your plate another time, but we have to leave it there.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, who joins us this morning from Miami Beach.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation, Ambassador.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF (U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East): Thank you. Thank you, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you just heard Secretary of State Rubio talk about these efforts to broker a cease-fire. You were the man face-to-face with Vladimir Putin.",
      "I wonder what your answer to the question is in regard to whether this is a delay tactic or whether Vladimir Putin is sincere in seeking a cease-fire.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I was there for quite some time, Margaret.",
      "And I agree with the secretary's assessment. We made a lot of progress in that meeting. It was a meeting that was \u2013 it could have been as long as four hours, but it was certainly at least three. We talked about a lot of specifics. And I point to the large gap that existed between Ukraine and Russia prior to the inauguration and where we are today.",
      "We have narrowed the issues between both of these parties, making a lot of progress, in my opinion, and I think that meeting underscores that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I heard you say on another program this morning that you do expect Presidents Trump and Putin to speak this week. Is that a decision-making call, or is this just next steps?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I would assume that they have a \u2013 they have a real relationship from the president's first term. They have talked already after the first visit that I had with President Putin.",
      "And I think this is going to be a very positive and constructive call between the two men, between the two presidents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And decisions will be made on whether to move forward with this 30-day cease-fire that the U.S. and Ukraine have agreed to, but Russia, at least publicly, has not?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, President Trump is the ultimate decision-maker, our decision-maker, and President Putin for the country of Russia is their decision-maker.",
      "I think it's a very positive sign that the two of them will be talking at some point. I think that's \u2013 that's showing that there's positive momentum, that there's a \u2013 an inclination on \u2013 on the part of both countries, and, by the way, this includes Ukraine as well, to get to a long-term, durable peace here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, France's president publicly said yesterday that, in his country's view, Russia is not genuine in seeking peace. They're intensifying the fighting.",
      "We saw Vladimir Putin on television this week dressed in military fatigues. He made public comments about wanting to resolve root causes of the war. How different was his message in private?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I \u2013 look, I don't \u2013 I don't know what President Macron said.",
      "I think it's unfortunate when people make those sort of assessments, and they don't have necessarily firsthand knowledge. But I'm not going to comment on what he said, because I don't know what he said.",
      "I know what I heard, the body language I witnessed. I saw a constructive effort over a long period of time to \u2013 to discuss the specifics of what's going on in the field. There's a 2,000-kilometer border between these two countries, and they are facing \u2013 shooting each other and facing each other across that 2,000-mile border.",
      "That's a very, very complicated cease-fire, and yet everybody is committed to have that discussion. Here we are, in the throes of having that discussion, with the Russians talking about sending technical teams, the United States sending technical teams, a meeting in Saudi Arabia with our national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Secretary of State Rubio that had a lot of positivity attached to it, my meeting, which I \u2013 I regard as promising.",
      "I think those are all very, very good trends, and hopefully inform on the possibility of a near-term peace agreement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, beyond the cease-fire, a peace agreement? you're already talking about technicalities in terms of territory that would be given up?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I \u2013 what I \u2013 what I'm saying, the technical \u2013 what I'm saying is that a cease-fire involves how to get people to not be fighting with each other over a 2,000-kilometer border. That's \u2013 that's 1,200 miles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Nor does that include a main area of confrontation, which is Kursk. And so there's different battlefield conditions.",
      "We've got to discuss that. There are regions that we all know the Russians are focused on. There is a nuclear reactor that supplies quite a bit of electricity to \u2013 to the country of Ukraine. That's got to be dealt with. There's access to ports. There's the Black Sea potential agreement.",
      "There's \u2013 there's just \u2013 there's so many elements, Margaret, to the implementation of a cease-fire here. And I compare it sometimes to Gaza. Gaza is a finite, defined space as compared to the \u2013 the battle \u2013 where the battle is being fought in Ukraine-Russia.",
      "So this is a much more complicated situation, and yet no one is throwing their hands up in the air. What they are doing is, they are digging in, and everybody is committed, all stakeholders, including the Europeans, to doing everything we need to do to get to a successful resolution here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned Gaza.",
      "I want to ask you what specifics you are looking at when it comes to relocating the two million Palestinians in Gaza. In the past, you've mentioned Egypt. You've mentioned Jordan. Are you talking to other countries at this point about resettling?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: I mean, I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that leads to a better life for Gazans and, by the way, for the people of Israel.",
      "So we're exploring all of those things. But, right now, what's right in front of us, is coming to some sort of resolution on this conflict. And the recent experience that we had at the Arab summit, where we spent 7.5 hours with leaders of various Arab countries, the recent experience we had with Hamas' response was not encouraging.",
      "Now, to me, we put a very sensible proposal on the table that was intended as a bridge to get to a final discussion and final resolution here that would have incorporated some sort of demilitarization of Hamas, which must happen \u2013 that's a red line for the Israelis \u2013 and maybe could have led to a long-term peace resolution here.",
      "And yet Hamas \u2013 Hamas came up with their own construct\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: \u2026 essentially disavowed what we discussed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: And, to my mind, that was a pretty poor ending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: And I \u2013 I hope they reconsider, because the alternative is not so good for them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Ambassador Witkoff, thank you for your time today.",

      "Welcome back.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Near miss with the government shutdown, sir. And I - I thought we'd be talking about a lot of domestic policy, but President Trump's point of view seems to be overseas in these - in this past week. Certainly a lot of action.",
      "I looked at the last time we spoke. You were advocating for President Trump to bomb Iran. You said, there's a one in trillion chance you'll degrade the Iranian nuclear program through diplomacy. Since then, President Trump has offered negotiations. Are you softening your stance?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I don't mind negotiating, as long as we get the outcome that we all desire. They can't have a nuclear bomb. So, I think there is a one in trillion chance the ayatollah would ever genuinely give up his quest for a nuclear weapon. He wants a nuclear weapon to use it. He wants to destroy Israel, kill all the Jews. He's a religious Nazi. He wants to purify Islam and drive us out of the region.",
      "Yes, I think he - I think he's a fanatical, religious Nazi who would use a bomb. But let's talk to him. And if he really is sincere, give up enrichment. There are 40 countries in this world that have nuclear power but don't enrich. There's no commercial purpose for enriching uranium at 60 percent. He has enough to make six bombs at 60 percent. So, turn that all over to the international community. We'll pay for it. Get out of the enrichment business and we'll help you with your nuclear power program. If you'll do all those things, then I will have been proven wrong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a long - that's a long to-do list. And so far no - no indication that he's taking the offer.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Not really. He's - if you don't want to bomb, give up enrichment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: You don't need enrichment for nuclear power. You do need enrichment to make a bomb. It's not that hard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "We did see additional Russian strikes in Ukraine overnight. You have been an advocate for Ukraine.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do - you heard the secretary of state.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard Ambassador Witkoff.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is Putin playing for time? Is he playing President Trump?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I don't know yet. But I do know you play President Trump at your own peril. What Trump did to get Ukraine at the table was tough, and it worked. So, if Putin is sincere about wanting peace, accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine and quit trying to mix the two, ceasefire and peace deal.",
      "What I would advise the Trump administration to do is to tell Putin, are you going to accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine or not. If you're not, go back to maximum pressure.",
      "I have legislation that will overwhelmingly pass the United States Senate that will crush the Russian economy. And I'm willing to move forward if I have to. But we're talking about a ceasefire and we're talking about peace. We weren't talking about that in the last administration. But, to me, Putin's a predator. The best way to judge Putin is not in a three hour meeting but 30 years of action. And I see no indication that he's going to stop being a predator against Ukraine until the pain is too large.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have -",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: So, if he refuses the ceasefire, that tells me all I need to know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any reason to believe that President Trump would sign the legislation you say you can use to put more sanctions on Russia? Because he hasn't put more sanctions on Russia in a significant way at all.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think he's waiting to see what kind of response he gets from the discussions that Witkoff had. Who, I like Steve, and I'm glad he's doing what he's doing.",
      "I think Trump's going to talk to Putin this week. You can't solve a problem until you talk the - to the person who's creating the problem. And the problem is Putin. He's a predator toward Ukraine and the region at large.",
      "I hope President Trump can convince Putin to go to the peace table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: To engage in a ceasefire and to find a win/win solution for both countries to stop the killing. You'll never know until you try. And there's one person on the planet capable of doing that, and that is President Trump. If Putin is playing Trump, he will regret it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think Vladimir Putin benefits from the U.S. decision to try to shutter some of the advocates for the free press and agents of the free press, like Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia and Voice of America? As you know, there was an executive order to try to dismantle them.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes, I don't know what value these - these ideas have in the 21st century. At the end of the day, I'll look and evaluate where the voice of America really is, Radio Free Europe, I know it made a difference in the Cold War. People told us that. So, that's something to consider, is it still worth the price? But I like the idea of putting bad guys on their back foot and giving people hope.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, you had been an advocate for soft power.",
      "I want to ask you about what's happening here at home.",
      "There were more executive orders from the president this week targeting some of the country's most prominent law firms, including Paul Weiss. He wants to restrict business activities of the firm despite a federal judge ruling in a different case that it's unconstitutional. The president suspended security clearances at the firm. He stripped clearances from lawyers over at Covington and Burling as well because they were involved in representing former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you support this?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I think all of these things - I think Jack Smith was politically motivated. I think the Russian hoax - a lot of people should have gone to jail, and they didn't. I think the idea that President Trump was an agent of Russia was manufactured. The Steele dossier was based on lies and falsehoods coming from a source that said he never meant it to be used in the fashion it was used. I think Jack Smith's effort to prosecute President Trump for January 6th was politically motivated. And people who engage in trying to destroy President Trump, I don't mind him going after them in a lawful way. I don't mind restrict - you know, when Biden took - took -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this lawful?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I think so. Yes, I think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this good for the U.S. legal system, Senator, because",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president's trying to use government power to punish private business because he didn't like some of the work they had been doing.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, private business aided government power in a - in a fashion to destroy Donald Trump's life.",
      "You know, on our side, nobody in your world gets it, but our people believe that the Justice Department was used as a weapon to destroy Trump's campaign and his business interests and to ruin his family. That they made up bogus charges and they proceeded in a fashion that was designed to destroy him politically and personally. I believe that. And if these people involved pay a price, they got nobody but themselves to blame. That's what I believe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are lawyers working on cases that - you're making it sound like the work they take on is somehow part of a conspiracy and they should be punished for it.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I think - I think these law firms were pushing legal theories that, to me, were designed for political outcomes more than legal outcomes.",
      "You know, I - we can have a debate about, you know, holding a lawyer accountable for his client's actions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I genuinely don't like that. But these - but these law firms -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what this sounds like.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And Jack Smith using the power of government, incorporating these law firms, in my - in my view, were trying to disrupt and take down the Republican nominee for president. That this was an orchestrated effort and Biden only regretted they didn't do it sooner. So, it was politically motivated. And everybody with their fingerprints on it, I hope they pay a price.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, I know, since you're on the Judiciary Committee, and -",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And my answer is not going to change -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And have that oversight. It's important to get your point of view, but I've got to leave it there for today.",
      "We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Michigan Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.",
      "Good to have you here and a happy early St. Patrick's Day.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): Top of the morning to you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, I want to talk about the impact of these tariffs and potential tariffs because you're from the manufacturing hub of Michigan.",
      "We were looking at the data. Michigan's lost more than 220,000 manufacturing jobs over the past 30 years. The vice president was out in Michigan this week. He says this is \u2013 this entire Trump strategy is about industrial resurgence. Is that landing where you live?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: So, I'm somebody that answers this differently than many. I believe that tariffs are a tool in the toolbox. And if you'll recall, I said Donald Trump would win in 2016, and nobody believed me. And I was right. And it was one issue. It was trade. NAFTA was one of the worst pieces of trade legislation in the history of this country. It sent tons of jobs overseas. And President Trump came in. I worked with him. We renegotiated it. We have the USMCA.",
      "The way that the tariffs are being done now is - it's made a ping-pong ball of the auto industry. I think they're a tool that we can look at. We need to using them against China. But I think they're being selectively applied. The domestic auto companies are complying. There's no way that in a month's time, when they have such an integrated inventory and production plan - production plants where a part will go over the border several times to make the changes that need to happen.",
      "So, I want to work with this administration. I think the 25 percent tariffs are too high. They're placing an unfair burden. Autos are a ping-pong ball in a big war. I want to bring manufacturing home. I want to bring supply chains home. We needed industrial policy. Tariffs are part of it. Let's just do it in a way that lets everybody plan for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The automakers, the big three, called President Trump. That was partly how this April 2nd push-off of some of these tariffs happened, their persuasion.",
      "Do you have any idea how long it would take to build the kind of plants and to bring all the manufacturing home, like President Trump is asking of them?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE DINGELL: So, if everything were go right, which, like in this world does anything ever go right, it's going to take two to three years. Our - our suppliers, also, there are many - and, by the way, we need to immediately renegotiate USMCA. It's time to look at it. And I think we need to be treating Mexico and Canada as different trading partners. Next -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You support this idea. Secretary Rubio was basically saying bilateral, not North America as a globe -",

The president has put all these tariffs in place, teed them up, and on April 2nd is poised to enact 25 percent tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. Do you have any idea when you will see the impact on shipping volume, what the impact on your state's economy will be?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We're already seeing the impacts of these - of these - of these disastrous and frankly not very well thought out policies when it comes to tariffs. You know, tariffs are a tool. They're not an ideology. But this administration is using it like an ideology. And so, while these decisions are being made - made not with us, they're being made to us, we're already seeing how this is going to have a significant impact on the Port of Baltimore. It's also seeing how the tariff policies are having disastrous impact on our farmers over in the eastern shore, on our chicken farmers in the eastern shore. This lack of predictability, this erratic behavior and this - and the indecisive decision making that's being made is already having very real impact on cost. It's having very real impact on our businesses and our small businesses. It's having a very real impact on our economic engines and American competitive, as well as our national security. And so, these are the type of things, this erratic behavior is the things that people were concerned about and we are now seeing in real time in our states.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state was one of 20 that decided to legally challenge the Trump administration on the decision to dismiss 1,300 workers at the Education Department. I'm wondering, as you sit there, how do you choose which issues to fight legally, and is litigation the Democrats' only tool here?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, it's not. I mean then you look at the - at the flurry of executive actions and executive orders that have been laid out by this administration thus far, they really fall into three different categories. It's - it's either ineffective, it is performative, or it is illegal, right? Those are the three buckets that all of these executive actions are falling under.",
      "And the ones that are illegal, we are going to take legal action to make sure that there are legal consequences for making these decisions that, frankly, the president of the United States does not have the authority to make unilaterally.",
      "And so, when we talk about the different tools that we have, just in the past week alone, you know, I signed - I signed executive action, executive orders focusing on supporting law enforcement and our police officers and our firefighters and giving them pay raises because, on the federal side, we've seen continued attacks on our public servants and our law enforcement and the cutting of first responders like FEMA.",

That goes to show the level of partnership that this administration is - is - that they - that they have and they would like from our nation's governors and from our nation's chief executives.",
      "And so - so the thing that we know about this is, this is a direct attack and a direct assault on law enforcement, a direct attack on the FBI, because Maryland is the place - and we've gone - we went through this process not just for these past couple years since I've been the governor, but for the past decade, where Maryland - where Maryland won this - this element, this competition, fair and square, quantitively, where we showed that we could be at a place that it was the only site ready place to build, build ready site. So, the building is ready to go in the state of Maryland, but the president has just decided to politicize it by talking about, but he doesn't want it to go to a liberal state. We cannot continue to politicize national security when it is too important to the people who are serving us.",

But I also think that that falls into line of a collection of other things that the president does not have the authority to do. Congress is the one who actually allocates the capital towards where federal agencies are going to go. And so, I believe the president of the United States thinks that he can do this. But there's one thing that I know, and I say this on a Sunday morning, I know there's a king of king and a lord of lords, and I know he does not live in the White House.",

You joked about the advanced age of your party's leaders, saying their staff has to stand around with defibrillators. I know these are jokes, but - but you're acknowledging something here. Is the issue with your party age or a lack of vision? And is the reset underway to fix those things?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think we need to be very clear about who we're fighting for. And I think we need to be very clear about the vision that we are offering.",
      "You know, I think about what's happening, you know, in this moment, even the conversation around the continued resolution, where - where we all know that the consequences of a federal government shutdown would have been disastrous on the state of Maryland. But one thing we did not do was offer an alternative. One thing we did not do was articulate the terms for the American people.",
      "And so I think, when one - when the American people, when they do not have an option or they're not seeing people fighting on their behalf, then, yes, there is going to be a measurement of frustration. We are doing everything in our power to fight for the people. And I think it becomes incredibly important, because people are paying attention who their fighters are and who their fighters are not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there were voices within your party on Capitol Hill who offered alternatives, they just weren't listened to. Do you think there's just no leader in the party?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I don't - I don't see a difference. I don't - I don't see a difference.",
      "And, frankly, I don't think the American people see a difference. If they are not hearing an alternative, if they're not hearing an alternative plan, if they're not hearing the plan to push back and fight back, if they're not seeing what we are doing in the streets and in the communities and in the neighborhoods to fight for their best interests, I think for the American people they just look at it as theater. And that is the frustrating thing. The performative politics, people are done, and they're exhausted by it. They just want to see results. And that's exactly what we're trying to provide in the state of Maryland.",

      "\"Private business aided government power in a fashion to destroy Donald Trump's life\u2026our people believe that the Justice Department was used as a weapon to destroy Trump's campaign and his business interests and to ruin his family,\" Graham said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"If these people involved pay a price, they got nobody but themselves to blame.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Friday continued his battle against the legal industry, signing an executive order targeting New York law firm Paul, Weiss that suspended security clearances for employees at the firm and restricted their access to federal buildings and officials. CBS News has reached out to Paul, Weiss for comment.",
      "Just a few hours earlier, Mr. Trump delivered a speech at the Department of Justice where he aired his grievances over the federal investigations into him and vowed retribution against his political foes.",
      "\"We're turning the page on four long years of corruption, weaponization and surrender to violent criminals,\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"And we're restoring fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.\"",
      "The Friday order marked the third targeted move the president has made against a prominent firm.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump targeted Covington & Burling, a firm representing former special counsel Jack Smith, who led the investigation that ultimately resulted in Mr. Trump being charged in two jurisdictions before the election.",
      "Then earlier this month, Mr. Trump signed an order to suspend the security clearances of attorneys at Perkins Coie, a law firm linked to Democratic-funded opposition research during the 2016 presidential campaign into any ties between Mr. Trump and Russia. A federal judge on Wednesday, however,\u00a0 temporarily blocked that order, ruling that it unlawfully targeted the Perkins Coie law firm and violated its First Amendment rights.",
      "Graham, on \"Face the Nation,\" said he believes that these law firms were pushing legal theories that \"were designed for political outcomes more than legal outcomes.\"",
      "\"I think Jack Smith was politically motivated. I think the Russian hoax, a lot of people should have gone to jail, and they didn't. I think the idea that President Trump was an agent of Russia was manufactured. The Steele Dossier was based on lies and falsehoods coming from a source that said he never meant it to be used in the fashion it was used. I think Jack Smith's effort to prosecute President Trump for January 6 was politically motivated,\" Graham said. \"And people who engage in trying to destroy President Trump, I don't mind him going after them in a lawful way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, last week, signaled more actions against firms moving forward.",
      "\"We have a lot of law firms that we're going to be going after because they were very dishonest people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"So bad for our country.\"",

So the legal tool in working with our Attorney General closely to be able to file suit when the federal government oversteps his bounds is one tool, but we are going to use every tool at our disposal to make sure that the people of Maryland are protected, and we're making sure we're putting extra resources and money back into their pockets.",

And President Trump came in, I worked with them, we renegotiated it, we have USMCA. The way that the tariffs are being done now is- it's made a pingpong ball of the auto industry. I think they're a tool that we can look at, we need to be using them against China, but I think they're being selectively applied. The domestic auto companies are complying with USMCA. There's no way that in a month's time when they have such an integrated inventory and production- production plans, where a part will go over the border several times to make the changes that need to happen. So I want to work with this administration. I think the 25% tariffs are too high. They're placing an unfair burden. The autos are a pingpong ball in a big war. I want to bring manufacturing home. I want to bring supply chains home. We need an industrial policy, tariffs are part of it. Let's just do it in a- a way that lets everybody plan for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The automakers, the Big Three, called President Trump. That was partly how this April 2 push-off of some of these tariffs happened, their persuasion. Do you have any idea how long it would take to build the kind of plants and to bring all the manufacturing home like President Trump is asking of them?",
      "REP. DINGELL:\u00a0 So if everything were to go right--which, like, in this world, does anything ever go right?--it's going to take two to three years. Our suppliers, also, there are many- and by the way, we need to immediately renegotiate USMCA. It's time to look at it. And I think we need to be treating Mexico and Canada as different trading partners. Mexico--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You support this idea of- Secretary Rubio was basically saying bilateral--",
      "REP. DINGELL: Totally. I- I--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --not North America as a--",
      "REP. DINGELL:\u00a0 Totally. Canada would never let China build a plant in China and then market it as a North American vehicle. And we need to make sure that that never happens. I'm totally on board on that. But right now, as we're talking about the aluminum and the steel tariffs, to- 60% of aluminum in this country that's being used is coming in from Canada. You take a 25% tariff on that, the profit on automobiles is very small. It's- it's not a big- the companies just can't eat that. But we got to figure it out. I am not against trade policy. We just have to do it in a way that doesn't- I don't believe Donald Trump wants to destroy the domestic auto industry. I think we all got to work together to keep the domestic auto industry strong. And even as we're doing Canada and Mexico, do you realize that Korea and Japan are still able- they brought 2.5 million vehicles in, Korea with no tariff, and Japan with 2.5. Not treating everybody equally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 S&P Global says there's potential for North American auto production to drop by 20,000 units a day, starting this week. That's because of the tariffs. So it's having--",
      "REP. DINGELL:\u00a0 All companies need certainty. Automobiles need certainty. They need to not be a pingpong ball.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Are you talking to the Commerce Secretary or the Trade Representative? Is there any conversation?",
      "REP. DINGELL:\u00a0 I have not talked to the Commerce Secretary. I've talked to Bob Lighthizer who I worked very closely with--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The former advisor--",
      "REP. DINGELL: --the former trade advisor. And I worked very closely with President Trump in two- I totally- I said he would win. Democrats did a lousy job on trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Speaking of Democrats and their performance, I want to ask you what happened this past week. We came near a shutdown. Ultimately, Democrats in the Senate did vote with Republicans on this short term funding deal. Senator Murphy of Connecticut was on another network this morning, and he said it would have been a risk to shut down the government, but it was probably worth taking.",
      "REP. DINGELL:\u00a0 You know--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You agree?",
      "REP. DINGELL: Well, in the House, we were almost united, save one, and there were very strong feelings in the House about what people thought that the Senate should do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The Senate Leader Chuck Schumer would say, you were able to do that because there was wiggle room on votes--",
      "REP. DINGELL: But I'm gonna--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --the republicans voted as a block.",
      "REP. DINGELL:\u00a0 I think he sent out mixed signals. I think if--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Schumer did?",
      "REP. DINGELL: Senator Schumer sent out mixed signals. And I've talked to a lot of labor last week. AFGE, whose employees were going to be impacted the most, were very torn about what to do because- concerned about their employees, so I'm meeting with [them] daily when I'm out there- came out against supporting it, because they felt like they were already being harmed. There was already just a license for DOGE to go ahead and do whatever it wants. They're not including Congress, not abiding with it, people are being hurt. But Margaret, people are angry. We got to move on. Reconciliation is coming up. We have got to be united as Democrats in making sure reconciliation- and we protect people from having their health care cut, Medicaid cut, Social Security cut, or Medicare cut in any way, shape or form.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Can Leader Jeffries actually maintain that kind of unity in the house?",
      "REP. DINGELL:\u00a0 He showed you that he could do it last week. And I can tell you that when- I don't think anybody has been home. If you're home, my town halls look like a Republican town hall. I'm not taking it personally. People are scared. They want to see us do something.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You mean people are shouting, people are angry, people are upset.",
      "REP. DINGELL:\u00a0 They want to see Democrats fighting back, and they're really scared about what's going to happen to them, particularly on seniors. And I was in- went to my asthma doctor, and a woman in a wheelchair with her child started crying with me in the hospital. What are you going to do so my child can still come here?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Congresswoman, thank you. We'll have to leave it there for today. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We turn now to the chairman of the Budget Committee, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who joins us this morning from Clemson, South Carolina. Welcome back.",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Near miss with the government shutdown, sir, and I- I thought we'd be talking about a lot of domestic policy, but President Trump's point of view seems to be overseas in these- in this past week, certainly a lot of action. I looked through the last time we spoke, you were advocating for President Trump to bomb Iran. You said there's \"a one in a trillion chance you'll degrade the Iranian nuclear program through diplomacy.\" Since then, President Trump has offered negotiations. Are you softening your stance?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I don't mind negotiating long as we get the outcome that we all desire. They can't have a nuclear bomb. So I think there is a one in a trillion chance the Ayatollah would ever genuinely give up his quest for a nuclear weapon. He wants a nuclear weapon to use it. He wants to destroy Israel, kill all the Jews. He's a religious Nazi. He wants to purify Islam and drive us out of the region. Yeah, I think he- I think he's a fanatical religious Nazi who would use a bomb. But let's talk to him, and if he really is sincere, give up enrichment. There are 40 countries in this world that have nuclear power but don't enrich. There's no commercial purpose for enriching uranium at 60%. He has enough to make six bombs at 60% so turn that all over the international community. We'll pay for it. Get out of the enrichment business, and we'll help you with the nuclear power program. If you'll do all those things, then I will have been proven wrong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a long- that's a long to do list. And so far, no- no indication that he's taking the offer--",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: -- Not really- if you don't want to bomb, give up enrichment. You don't need enrichment for nuclear power. You do need enrichment to make a bomb. It's not that hard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. We did see additional Russian strikes in Ukraine overnight. You have been an advocate for Ukraine. Do- you heard the Secretary of State. You heard Ambassador Witkoff. Is Putin playing for time? Is he playing President Trump?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I don't know yet, but I do know you played President Trump at your own peril. What Trump did to get Ukraine at the table was tough, and it worked. So if Putin is sincere about wanting peace, accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine and quit trying to mix the two: ceasefire and peace deal. What I would advise the Trump administration to do is to tell Putin, are you going to accept the ceasefire on the same terms as Ukraine, or not? If you're not, go back to maximum pressure. I have legislation that will overwhelmingly pass the United States Senate that will crush the Russian economy, and I'm willing to move forward if I have to, but we're talking about ceasefire, and we're talking about peace. We weren't talking about that in the last administration. But to me, Putin's a predator. The best way to judge Putin is not in a three hour meeting, but 30 years of action, and I see no indication that he's going to stop being a predator against Ukraine until the pain is too large\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Do you have--",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: So if he refuses the ceasefire, that tells me all I need to know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any reason to believe that President Trump would sign the legislation you say you can use to put more sanctions on Russia? Because he hasn't put more sanctions on Russia in a significant way at all.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: I think he's waiting to see what kind of response he gives from the discussions that Witkoff have, who- I like Steve and I'm glad he's doing what he's doing. I think Trump's going to talk to Putin this week. You can't solve a problem until you talk the- to the person who's creating the problem. And the problem is Putin. He's a predator toward Ukraine and the region at large. I hope President Trump can convince Putin to go to the peace table, to engage in a ceasefire and to find a win, win solution for both countries to stop the killing. You'll never know until you try. And there's one person on the planet capable of doing that, and that is President Trump. If Putin is playing Trump, he will regret it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think Vladimir Putin benefits from the US decision to try to shutter some of the advocates for the free press and agents of the free press, like Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia and Voice of America? As you know, there was an executive order to try to dismantle them.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. Yeah- I don't know what value these- these ideas have in the 21st century. At the end of the day, I'll look and evaluate where the Voice of America really is. Radio Free Europe, I know it made a difference in the Cold War, people told us that. So, that's something to consider. Is it still worth the price? But I like the idea of putting bad guys on their back foot and giving people hope.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah you had been an advocate for soft power, I want to ask you about what's happening here at home. There were more executive orders from the president this week targeting some of the country's most prominent law firms, including Paul Weiss. He wants to restrict business activities of the firm, despite a federal judge ruling in a different case that it's unconstitutional. The President suspended security clearances at the firm. He stripped clearances from lawyers over at Covington & Burling as well because they were involved in representing former Special Counsel Jack Smith. Do you support this?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, I think all of these things- I think Jack Smith was politically motivated. I think the Russian hoax, a lot of people should have gone to jail, and they didn't. I think the idea that President Trump was an agent of Russia was manufactured. The Steele Dossier was based on lies and falsehoods coming from a source that said he never meant it to be used in the fashion it was used. I think Jack Smith's effort to prosecute President Trump for January 6 was politically motivated, and people who engage in trying to destroy President Trump, I don't mind him going after them in a lawful way. I don't mind restrict--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this lawful?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: You know when Biden took- took- yeah I think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this good for the US legal system, Senator? Because the President is trying to use government power to punish private business because he didn't like some of the work they had been doing.",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Private business aided government power in a fashion to destroy Donald Trump's life. You know- on our side, nobody in your world gets it, but our people believe that the Justice Department was used as a weapon to destroy Trump's campaign and his business interests and to ruin his family- that they made up bogus charges and they proceeded in a fashion that was designed to destroy him, politically and personally. I believe that. If these people involved pay a price, they got nobody but themselves to blame, that's what I believe--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But these are lawyers working on cases that- you're making it sound like the work that they take on is somehow part of a conspiracy, and they should be punished for it.",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah, I think- I think these law firms were pushing legal theories that, to me, were designed for political outcomes more than legal outcomes. You know, we can have a debate about- you know, holding a lawyer accountable for his client's actions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: I generally don't like that, but these- but these laws firms--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what this sounds like--",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: --and Jack Smith using the power of government- incorporating these law firms in my- in my view, were trying to disrupt and take down the Republican nominee for president. That this was an orchestrated effort, and Biden only regretted they didn't do it sooner. So it was politically motivated, and everybody with their fingerprints on it, I hope they pay a price.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I know- since you're on the Judiciary Committee--",
      "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: And my answer's not going to change--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --and have that oversight- important to get your point of view, but I got to leave it there for today. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you just heard Secretary of State Rubio talk about these efforts to broker a ceasefire. You were the man face-to-face with Vladimir Putin. I wonder what your answer to the question is, in regard to whether this is a delay tactic or whether Vladimir Putin is sincere in seeking a ceasefire?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I was there for quite some time, Margaret, and I agree with the Secretary's assessment. We made a lot of progress in that meeting. It was a meeting that was- it could have been as long as four hours, but it was certainly at least three. We talked about a lot of specifics, and I point to the large gap that existed between Ukraine and Russia prior to the inauguration, and where we are today. We have narrowed the issues between both of these parties, making a lot of progress, in my opinion, and I think that meeting underscores that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I heard you say on another program this morning that you do expect presidents Trump and Putin to speak this week. Is that a decision making call, or is this just next steps?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I would- I would assume that, you know, they have- they have a real- they have a real relationship from the president's first term. They've talked already, after the first visit that- that I had with President Putin. And I think this is going to be a very positive and constructive call between the two men, between the two presidents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And decisions will be made on whether to move forward with this 30-day ceasefire that the U.S. and Ukraine have agreed to, but Russia, at least publicly, has not?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, President Trump is the ultimate decision maker, our decision maker. And President Putin, for the country of Russia, is their decision maker. I think it's a very positive sign that the two of them will be talking at some point. I think that's- that's showing that there's positive momentum, that there's a- an inclination on- on the part of both countries, and by the way, this includes Ukraine as well, to get to a long term, durable peace here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, France's President publicly said yesterday that, in his country's view, Russia is not genuine in seeking peace. They're intensifying the fighting. We saw Vladimir Putin on television this week dressed in military fatigues. He made public comments about wanting to resolve root causes of the war. How different was his message in private?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I- look, I don't- I don't know what President Macron said. I think it's unfortunate when people make those sort of assessments, and they don't have, necessarily, firsthand knowledge. But I'm not going to comment on what he said, because I don't know what he said. I know what I heard, the body language I witnessed. I saw a constructive effort over a long period of time to- to discuss the specifics of what's going on in the field. There's a 2,000 kilometer border between these two countries, and they are facing- shooting each other and facing each other across that 2,000 mile border. That's a very, very, complicated ceasefire, and yet everybody is committed to have that discussion. Here we are, in the throes of having that discussion, with the Russians talking about sending technical teams, the United States, sending technical teams, a meeting in Saudi Arabia with our National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz, and Secretary of State Rubio that had a lot of positivity attached to it, my meeting, which I- I regard as promising. I think those are all very, very good trends, and hopefully inform on the possibility of a near term peace agreement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So beyond the ceasefire, a peace agreement, you're already talking about technicalities in terms of territory that would be given up?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Well, I- what I- what I'm saying, the technical- what I'm saying is that a ceasefire involves how to get people to not be fighting with each other over a 2,000 kilometer border. That's- that's 1,200 miles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: Nor does that include a main area of confrontation, which is Kursk. And so there's different battlefield conditions. We've got to discuss that. There are regions that we all know the Russians are focused on. There is a nuclear reactor that supplies quite a bit of electricity to- to the country of Ukraine. That's got to be dealt with. There's access to ports. There's the Black Sea potential agreement, there's- there's just- there's so many elements, Margaret, to the implementation of a ceasefire here, and I compare it sometimes to Gaza. Gaza is a finite, defined, space, as compared to the- the battle- where the battle is being fought, in Ukraine, Russia. So this is a much more complicated situation, and yet no one is throwing their hands up in the air. What they are doing is, they are digging in, and everybody is committed, all stakeholders, including the Europeans, to doing everything we need to do to get to a successful resolution here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned Gaza. I want to ask you what specifics you are looking at when it comes to relocating the 2 million Palestinians in Gaza. In the past, you've mentioned Egypt, you've mentioned Jordan. Are you talking to other countries at this point about resettling?",
      "STEVE WITKOFF: I mean, I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that leads to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things. But right now, what's right in front of us, is coming to some sort of resolution on this conflict. And the recent experience that we had at the Arab Summit, where we spent seven and a half hours with leaders of various Arab countries, the recent experience we had with Hamas' response was not encouraging. Now to me, we put a very sensible proposal on the table that was intended as a bridge to get to a final discussion and final resolution here, that would have incorporated some sort of demilitarization of Hamas, which must happen. That's a red line for the Israelis. And maybe could have led to a long term peace resolution here. And yet Hamas- Hamas came up with their own construct, essentially disavowed what we discussed, and to my mind, that was a pretty poor ending, and I- I hope they reconsider, because the alternative is not so good for them.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's get straight to it this morning with Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who joins us from Miami, Florida. Mr. Secretary for our audience, just to explain, this Red Sea area is a really important transit point for global shipping. The Houthis out of Yemen have been disrupting transit there for some time. President Trump cited these concerns when he announced the strikes. I'm wondering, how long will this campaign last, and will it involve ground forces?",
      "U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, the problem here is that this is a very important shipping lane and in the last year-and-a-half, the last 18 months, the Houthis have struck or attacked 174 naval vessels of the United States. Attacking the U.S. Navy directly 174 times, and 145 times they've attacked commercial shipping. So we basically have a band of pirates, you know, with guided precision anti-ship weaponry and exact- exacting a toll system in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world. That's just not sustainable. We are not going to have these people controlling which ships can go through and which ones cannot and so your question is, how long will this go on? It will go on until they no longer have the capability to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what does U.S. intelligence tell us at this point? Because the U.S. had been construct- conducting strikes for some time, but has not stopped the Houthis\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013So what's going to be different right now? Do you have more fidelity in the intelligence that would make this more successful?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, those strikes were a retaliation strike. So they launched one missile, we hit the missile launcher, or we sent something to do it. This is not a message. This is not a one off. This is an effort to deny them the ability to continue to constrict and control shipping, and it's just not going to happen. We're not going to have these guys, these people with weapons, able to tell us where our ships can go, where the ships of all the world can go, by the way, it's not just the U.S. We're doing the world a favor. We're doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping. That's the mission here, and it will continue until that's carried out. That never happened before, the Biden Administration didn't do that. All the Biden Administration would do is they would respond to an attack. These guys would launch one rocket, we'd hit the rocket launcher. That's it. This is an effort to take away their ability to control global shipping in that part of the world. That's just not going to happen anymore\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: and it could\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2013So, this will continue until that's finished.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It could involve ground raids?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, those are military decisions to be made, but I've heard no talk of ground raids. I don't think there's a necessity for it right now. I can tell you that as of last night, some of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us, and I can tell you that some of the facilities that they use are no longer existing, and that will continue. The- look, it's bottom line, easy way to understand it, okay, these guys are able to control what ships can go through there. They've attacked the U.S. Navy 174 times. They've attacked the United States Navy. We're not going to have people sitting around with the missiles attacking the U.S. Navy. It's not going to happen, not under President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President also referenced Iran in his statement. Iran provides some support for the Houthis as you know. Put this in context for me, because U.S. intelligence has been suggesting for some time that Israel has the desire and intent to conduct an attack on Iran's developing nuclear program in the coming months. President Trump has extended an offer for negotiations. Have you heard anything back from Iran? Is this strike in Yemen a signal to Iran?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: This strike in Yemen is about their ability, the ability of the Houthis, to strike global shipping and attack the U.S. Navy, and their willingness to do it. 174 times against the U.S. Navy, 145 sometimes against global shipping. That's what the strike is about. What we can't ignore, and the reason why the President mentioned Iran is because the Iranians have supported the Houthis. They provided them intelligence, they provided them guidance, they provided them weaponry. I mean, there's no way the Houthis, okay, the Houthis would have the ability to do this kind of thing unless they had support from Iran. And so this was a message to Iran, don't keep supporting them, because then you will also be responsible for what they are doing in attacking Navy ships and attacking global shipping.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They also get support from Russia, potentially, which you leveraged sanctions in regard to, but I want to ask you about tariffs because you were just in Canada this past week. China is Canada's second biggest export market, Mexico's third. In this ongoing trade back-and-forth, the U.S. is having, isn't there a risk that China will ultimately be the winner? If it's too costly to deal with the United States, won't they benefit?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, actually, China and Canada are involved in a mini trade war right now. In fact, the Chinese have imposed a bunch of tariffs, reciprocal or retaliatory tariffs on Canada after Canada imposed tariffs on them. So here's the way everyone needs to understand this, okay? The president rightfully believes that the balance of global trade is completely off gilt- kilter. For 30 or 40 years, we have allowed countries to treat us unfairly in global trade, much of it during the Cold War because we wanted them to be rich and prosperous because they were our allies in the Cold War, but now that has to change. You look at the European Union. The European Union's economy is about the same size as ours. It's not a low wage economy. It's very comparable to ours in terms of its composition and so forth. Why do they have a trade surplus with us? So what the President is saying is two things. Number one, there are critical industries like aluminum, like steel, like semiconductors, like automobile manufacturing, that he rightfully believes, President Trump rightfully believes, the U.S. needs to have a domestic capability and the way you protect those industries and build that capability is by ensuring that there's economic incentives to produce in the United States. The second is global, and that is, we are going to put tariffs on countries reciprocal to what they impose on us. And so this is a global, it's not against Canada, it's not against Mexico, it's not against the EU, it's everybody. And then from that new baseline of fairness and reciprocity, we will engage, potentially in bilateral negotiations with countries around the world on new trade arrangements that make sense for both sides. Fairness, but right now, it's not fair. We're going to reset the baseline, and then we can enter into these bilateral agreements, potentially, with countries so that our trade is fair. What's not going to continue is, of course, these countries are upset\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is all just about leverage to get bilateral, not free trade- not North American Free trade deals\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: No, it's not leverage\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: re- renegotiation\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2013 No, no, it's not leverage, it's fairness. It's resetting baseline fairness. And then from there, we can work on deals and- and so forth, because they'll have products we don't make, we have products they don't make. That's where trade works the best. It has to be free, but it has to be fair, and right now it's only free on one side, and it's not fair for the other side\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well you know, sir, that\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2013It's an unsustainable position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013the ad hoc nature of these policy announcements and pull backs are causing concern in the marketplace, as we saw this past week. So I heard you describe what seemed like a strategy to get to negotiations on a bilateral front. You also seem to negotiate- say this was national security minded. But then we also see comments by the President of like, 200 percent tariffs on champagne. That's not a critical industry for the United States, that seems more emotional.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: No, that means that's- that's called retaliation that's what happens in these trade exchanges. They're going to increase tariffs on- they already have high tariffs. They're going to add more to their tariffs? Fine, then we'll have to find something to- I mean, you tell me? I mean, Canada is going after whiskey and orange juice and you know I mean\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In retaliation.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah, exactly. So that sounds pretty petty to me as well. So what's the difference? The point is, I get it. I understand why these countries don't like it, because the status quo of trade is good for them. It benefits them, they like the status quo. We don't like the status quo. We are going to set a new status quo, and then we can negotiate something, if they want to, that is fair for both sides. But what we have now cannot continue. We have de-industrialized this country. De-industrialized the United States of America. There are things we can no longer make and we have to be able to make in order to be safe as a country and in order to have jobs. That's why we had a rust belt, that's why we've suffered all these important jobs that once sustained entire communities wiped out by trade that basically sent these factories, these jobs, this industrial capability, to other places that cannot and will not continue. I don't- President Trump, this is no mystery, he's been talking about this since the 1980s actually, even before he was a political figure. This is going to happen, and it's going to happen now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Russia. You said envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting with Vladimir Putin that happened last week would answer the fundamental question of whether we're moving towards a ceasefire, or whether Putin is using a delay tactic? You spoke with Sergey Lavrov, the Foreign Minister, yesterday. Is this a delay tactic?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I think that was a pro- promising meeting. As I've said repeatedly, we're not going to negotiate this in the public. Hopefully we'll have something to announce at some point fairly soon. I can't guarantee that, but I certainly think the meeting was promising, the exchange was promising. I don't take away from Steve's meeting, from Ambassador Witkoff's meeting, negativity. There are some challenges. This is a complex, three-year war that's been ongoing along a very long military front, with a lot of complexity to it. So no one's claiming that it's easy, but I want everyone to understand, here's the plan. Plan A is, get the shooting to stop so that we can move to Plan B, phase two, which is have everybody at a table, maybe not- maybe with some shuttle diplomacy, to figure out a way to permanently end this war in a way that's enduring and it respects everybody's needs and so forth. No one is saying that that second part is easy, but we can't get even to that second part until we get past the first part. It's hard to negotiate an enduring end of a war as long as they're shooting at each other, and so the president wants a ceasefire. That's what we're working on, assuming we can get that done. That won't be easy in and of itself. We move to the second phase, which is negotiating something more enduring and permanent. That will be hard. It will involve a lot of hard work, concessions from both sides, but it has to happen. This war cannot continue. The president has been clear about that, and he's doing everything he can to bring it to an end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, we'll talk about that later in the program as well with Envoy Witkoff. I want to ask you about a decision you made to revoke a student visa for someone at Columbia University this past week. The Wall Street Journal editorial board writes, \"the administration needs to be careful, it's targeting real promoters of terrorism not breaking the great promise of a green card by deporting anyone with controversial political views.\" Can you substantiate any form of material support for terrorism\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013specifically to Hamas, from this Columbia student\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013or was it simply that he was espousing a controversial political point of view?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, not just the student, we're going to do more. In fact, we- every day now we're approving visa revocations, and if that visa led to a green card, the green card process as well and here's why, it's very simple. When you apply to enter the United States and you get a visa, you are a guest, and you're coming as a student, you're coming as a tourist, or what have you. And in it, you have to make certain assertations and if you tell us when you apply for a visa, I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events, that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America. It's that simple. So, you lied. You came- if you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa. Now you're here. Now you do it. You lied to us. You're out. It's that simple. It's that straight forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, is there any- but is there any evidence of a\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Yes. Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013link to terrorism, or is it just his point of view?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah, they take over. I mean, do you not- I mean, you should watch the news. These guys take over entire buildings\u2013",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We covered it intensely. I'm asking about the specific\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2013They vandalized colleges. They shut down colleges\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2013well then you should know that this is\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013justification for the revocation of his visa\u2013",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, this specific individual was the spokesperson\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013was there any evidence the materials support for terrorism?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2013was the negotiator- on negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus? That vandalized buildings? Negotiating over what? That's a crime in and of itself, that they're involved in the being the negotiator, the spokesperson, this that the other. We don't want- we don't need these people in our country that we never should have allowed them in in the first place. If he had told us, I'm going over there, and I'm going over there to become the spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down, people can't even go to school, library buildings being vandalized. We never would have let him in. We never would have let him in to begin with. And now that he's doing it and he's here, he's going to leave, and so are others, and we're going to keep doing it. We're here- and by the way, I find it ironic that a lot of these people out there defending the First Amendment speech, alleged free speech rights of these Hamas\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2013sympathizers, they had no problem, okay, pressuring social media to censor American political speech. So it's, I think it's ironic and hypocritical. But the bottom line is this, if you are in this country, to promote Hamas, to promote terrorist organizations, to participate in vandalism, to participate in acts of rebellion and riots on campus. We never would have let you in if we had known that and now that we know it, you're going to leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it only pro-Palestinian people who are going to have their visas remote- revoked, or other points of view as well?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: No, I think anybody who's here in favor- look, we want to get rid of Tren de Aragua gang members. They're terrorists too. We, the president, designated them, asked me to designate and I did, as a terrorist organization. We want to get rid of them as well. You're- we don't want terrorists in America. I don't know how hard that is to understand. We want people- we don't want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety. It's that simple, especially people that are here as guests. That is what a visa is. I don't know what we've gotten it in our head that a visa is some sort of birthright. It is not. It is a visitor into our country, and if you violate the terms of your visitation, you are going to leave.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Secretary Rubio, like to have you back. Talk to you about a lot more on your plate another time, but we have to leave it there.",

      "Bob Mumgaard is CEO and co-founder of Commonwealth Fusion Systems outside of Boston, one of more than two dozen fusion startups getting billions of dollars in funding from the government and investors. \"It's gonna take time, it's gonna take work, but this is the birth of an industry,\" Mumgaard said.",
      "Instead of lasers, Commonwealth uses a cloud of super-heated plasma that burns at around 180 million degrees Fahrenheit, held in place by massive magnets that the company manufactures on site. \"The magnets in this machine will be the strongest magnets in the world,\" Mumgaard said. \"[They] could lift up an aircraft carrier.\"",

    "summary": "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said signs indicated a Mount Spurr eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
    "story": [
      "A volcano near Alaska's largest city is showing new signs of unrest, with experts saying the likelihood of an eruption at Mount Spurr in the next few weeks or months has increased.",
      "The Alaska Volcano Observatory said Wednesday\u00a0it had measured during recent overflights \"significantly elevated volcanic gas emissions,\" and said signs indicated an eruption was likely, though not certain, in the weeks or months ahead.",
      "\"We expect to see further increases in seismic activity, gas emissions and surface heating prior to an eruption, if one were to occur,\" the observatory said in a statement. \"Such stronger unrest may provide days to weeks of additional warning.\"",
      "However, the observatory warned that it was possible that an eruption could happen with little or no warning.",
      "\"While we expect additional changes to monitoring data prior to an eruption, it is also possible that an eruption could occur with little or no additional warning,\" the observatory wrote. \"This would be extremely hazardous for recreators on Mount Spurr or near its drainages as well as those overflying the volcano.\"",
      "What is Mount Spurr?",
      "Mount Spurr is one of 53 volcanoes in Alaska that have been active within the last 250 years. It has two main vents and is 11,070 feet (3,374 meters) tall. It is covered in ice and snow and is located roughly 80 miles (129 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage.",
      "When did Mount Spurr last erupt?",
      "The last known eruption from the summit vent was more than 5,000 years ago. The Crater Peak vent, meanwhile, erupted once in 1953 and three times in 1992, according to the observatory. The Crater Peak vent is about 2 miles (3 kilometers) south of the summit.",
      "There have been periods of increased earthquake or other activity since then, including between 2004 and 2006, but no other eruptions. Last October, the observatory raised its alert status for Mount Spurr from green to yellow when an increase in seismic activity became pronounced and a ground deformation was spotted in satellite data.",
      "The most likely outcome of the current unrest would be an eruption or eruptions similar to those in 1953 and 1992, the observatory said.",
      "\"It is also possible that no eruption occurs and the present activity slowly dies away or that a smaller eruption takes place,\" John Power, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the observatory, wrote in an email.",
      "What impacts could an eruption have?",
      "The eruptions during the last century lasted between three and seven hours, produced ash columns that rose more than 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) above sea level and deposited ashfall in south-central Alaska communities, according to the observatory.",
      "In 1992, ashfall of about a quarter-inch in Anchorage prompted residents to stay inside or to wear masks if going outside to avoid breathing ash. The cloud drifted as far as Greenland.",
      "CBS affiliate WGME-TV reported that the ash could drift all the way to the East Coast, but that would depend on the jet stream, and it probably would not have a major impact.",
      "Volcanic ash is angular and sharp and has been used as an industrial abrasive. The powdered rock can cause a jet engine to shut down.",
      "The 1992 eruptions prompted the temporary closures of airports in Anchorage and other communities.",
      "Closing airports can be more than an inconvenience in a state where most communities aren't connected to Alaska's main road system. Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport also is among the world's busiest cargo hubs.",

    "story": [
      "A new report on the state of birds in the United States has an urgent warning: bird populations across nearly every habitat are declining, with about one-third of U.S. bird species in critical need of conservation action.",
      "A total of 229 out of 718 bird species in the U.S. are now classified as high or moderate conservation concerns, according to the 2025 State of the Birds report, which was produced by a consortium of scientific and conservation organizations led by the North American Bird Conservation Initiative. This includes 112 \"tipping point\" species \u2014 those that have lost more than half their populations in the past five decades. Some, like the Allen's hummingbird, tricolored blackbird and saltmarsh sparrow, are at extreme risk without immediate intervention, says the report, released Thursday.",
      "The population of grassland birds in the U.S. has dropped by 43% since 1970, as row-crop production, drought and habitat loss take their toll, the report says. Aridland birds have declined 41% in the same period due to drought, wildfires and invasive species. Even forest birds, facing habitat degradation from fire suppression and industrial timber practices, are seeing widespread declines. Waterfowl, once considered a conservation success, have declined by 20% since 2014 from the loss of wetlands and grasslands.",
      "The findings continue a downward trend. A 2019 study published in Science, an academic journal, found that North America lost nearly 3 billion birds over the previous 50 years, including 90 \"tipping point\" species of 529 bird species that were examined.",
      "\"The 2025 State of the Birds report shows those losses are continuing, with declines among several bird trend indicators,\" the new report says. \"Notably duck populations\u2014a bright spot in past State of the Birds reports, with strong increases since 1970\u2014have trended downward in recent years.\"",
      "Conservationists have previously warned that bird populations are in steep decline due to habitat loss and climate change, and they're further alarmed after the U.S. Interior Department last month suspended a legal opinion from the Biden administration that held companies accountable for accidentally killing birds through industrial activities like oil and gas drilling, wind energy production and construction \u2013 in a victory for the energy sector.",
      "Birds play a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems. They help control pests, disperse seeds and pollinate plants, contributing to crop yields and supporting biodiversity, says Amanda Rodewald, faculty director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Center for Avian Population Studies",
      "And declining bird populations signal larger environmental problems, experts say.",
      "\"There's a really long history and a lot of evidence that shows that birds can be excellent indicators of environmental conditions,\" Rodewald told CBS News. \"We share the same environments with birds, if they're not healthy for bird populations, they're not likely to be healthy for us either.\"",
      "Beyond their ecological role, birds bring significant economic and mental health benefits. Birdwatching contributes $279 billion to the U.S. economy and supports 1.4 million jobs, according to the report. Encounters with birds have also been linked to reduced stress and improved mental well-being, further underscoring their importance.",
      "Experts stress that conservation efforts can succeed when adequately funded. The bald eagle, once nearly wiped out by the pesticide DDT, has rebounded thanks to concerted efforts. In December, the species even gained bipartisan recognition as the official U.S. bird.",
      "Strategic habitat conservation efforts \u2014 such as conservation ranching, coastal restoration and seabird translocation \u2014 are already making a difference in some regions.",
      "The new report calls for increased investment in conservation programs, stronger habitat protections, and policies that promote sustainable land management. Without swift action, scientists warn, the next State of the Birds report could bring even graver news.",
      "\"Birds unite us across the hemisphere and across the political spectrum,\" said Marshall Johnson, chief conservation officer at the National Audubon Society. \"There should be no hesitation in moving to protect them today and in the future.\""

    "story": [
      "Researchers in Spain have unearthed a fossil from a potential new prehistoric member of the human family tree, and they say it's the earliest known remnants of a face discovered in Western Europe.",
      "The facial bones from an adult were found at the Atapuerca archaeological site in northern Spain in 2022. Since then, a team of scientists has been working to learn more about the hominin, whom they nicknamed Pink. The researchers shared their findings in a study in the journal\u00a0Nature, which was published on Tuesday.",
      "Pink's remains have been dated as between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old, the researchers said.",
      "The research \"introduces a new actor in the history of human evolution in Europe,\" study author Rosa Huguet, of Spain's University of Rovira i Virgili, said at a news conference, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "The discovery suggests that early humans settled in Europe, traveling from the east side of the continent to the west, about 1.4 million years ago, the researchers said. Until now, the oldest-known human species in Western Europe was the\u00a0Homo antecessor. Experts have found Homo antecessor remains that are around 850,000 years old.",
      "The oldest human ancestor found in any area of Europe is the Dmanisi people, or Homo georgicus, a group that lived in what is now the nation of Georgia. Remains of that species have been dated back to 1.8 million years ago. They are the first members of the human family known to have traveled from Africa to Europe.",
      "The face of \"Pink\"",
      "The fossilized upper jawbone and partial cheekbone were excavated from a 52-foot-deep layer of silt and mud at Sima del Elefante, or the \"elephant pit,\" a site less than 1,000 feet from where the fossils of\u00a0Homo antecessor were discovered in 1994. The bones were not enough for researchers to determine Pink's age or gender.",
      "From those fossilized bones, researchers were able to use 3D imaging techniques to create a model of Pink's face. The face is more \"projected forward and more robust\" than a modern human face or a\u00a0Homo antecessor face, Maria Martinon-Torres, director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution, told the AFP.",
      "Pink's face bears some similarities to the human ancestor Homo erectus,\u00a0researchers said. That species spanned nearly 2 million years and was the first human species to evolve more familiar human body proportions and use fire and tools. Remains of the species have been found in Africa, Asia and Europe.",
      "But the similarities weren't strong enough for the scientists to confirm that Pink was a member of that species. Instead, they have proposed that Pink could belong to a new possible species, which they called Homo 'affinis' erectus.",
      "\"This is the most honest proposal we can make with the evidence we have,\" Martinon-Torres said, according to AFP.",
      "The scientists were also able to analyze small stone tools and animal bones found at the excavation site to learn more about how Pink lived. The environment at the time was a humid forest landscape, and the early human population lived alongside horses, ancient cattle, monkeys and hippos, the researchers said. The area also likely had plenty of water, which would have made it an \"ideal\" place for the species to settle, Huguet said in the news conference.",
      "The researchers suggested that the species may be a bridge between the\u00a0Homo georgicus species and the\u00a0Homo antecessor species. Study co-author Jose Maria Bermudez de Castro told the AFP that it's likely the species \"probably disappeared\" during a severe global cooling era that occurred nearly 900,000 years ago.",

      "The HR 8799 system, 130 light years from Earth, is only 30 million years old \u2014 just a baby compared to our solar system's 4.6 billion years. A U.S.-led team of researchers used Webb to directly detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of all four of the system's known planets, according to the study.",
      "\"Webb's new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "They used Webb's coronagraph instruments, which block the light from bright stars to get a better view of the planets revolving around them.",
      "\"It's like putting your thumb up in front of the sun when you're looking up at the sky,\" lead study author William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, told AFP.",
      "Normally, the Webb telescope only detects exoplanets by glimpsing them when they cross in front of their host star.",
      "This \"transiting method\" was how Webb indirectly detected CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant WASP-39 in 2022.",
      "But for this latest discovery, \"we're actually seeing the light that is emitted from the planet itself, as opposed to the fingerprint of that light from the host star,\" Balmer said.",
      "This is not easy \u2014 Balmer compared the process to using a torch to spot fireflies next to a lighthouse.",
      "While these gas giants may not be able to host life, it is possible that they had moons that could, he added.",
      "There are missions currently under way to find out if there could be life in the vast oceans underneath the icy shells of several of Jupiter's moons.",
      "\"Key piece of proof\"",
      "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere.",
      "Because CO2 condenses into little ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation.",
      "Jupiter and Saturn are believed to have first formed from a \"bottom up\" process in which a bunch of tiny, icy particles came together into a solid core which then sucked in gas to grow into giants, Balmer said.",
      "So the new discovery is a \"key piece of proof\" that far-off planets can form in a similar way to those in our celestial backyard, Balmer said.",
      "But how common this is throughout the universe remains unclear.",
      "\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" Balmer said. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they're similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is\u2014or how normal.\"",
      "Astronomers have now discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets, many of them massive \u2014 and none of them known to be habitable.",
      "The \"huge leap forward we need to make\" is to focus on smaller Earth-sized worlds, Balmer said.",
      "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman space telescope will use a coronagraph to do that just after its planned launch in 2027.",
      "Last year, the Webb telescope discovered carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the surface of Charon, Pluto's largest moon.",
      "Balmer hopes to use Webb to observe more four-planet systems, but added that future funding was now in question.",

      "The Crew 10 Dragon capsule caught up with the International Space Station and moved in for a textbook docking early Sunday, bringing four fresh crew members to the lab and clearing the way for the Starliner astronauts to return to Earth after nearly 300 days in space.",
      "Approaching from behind and below, the Crew Dragon, launched Friday evening from the Kennedy Space Center, passed 1,300 feet directly under the station before looping up to a point 720 feet directly ahead of the outpost. From there, it glided straight in for docking at the Harmony module's forward port at 12:04 a.m. EDT.",
      "Motorized latches then engaged to pull the capsule into the docking mechanism for an airtight structural seal. After standard leak checks and umbilical connections, the crew opened the Dragon's forward hatch at 1:35 a.m. and floated into the space station.",
      "Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, an Army colonel and former combat helicopter pilot, told flight controllers she and her fellow fliers had a \"great trip\" from the launch pad to the space station, adding \"I cannot tell you the immense joy of our crew when we looked out the window and we saw the space station for the first time.\"",
      "\"Let me tell you, that is such an amazing journey, you can hardly even put it into words,\" she said. \"The ride up on the Falcon 9, orbiting the Earth for the last couple of days, it's been absolutely incredible ... Thank you very, very much.\"",
      "\"Thank you to SpaceX for the awesome ride up here,\" said co-pilot Nichole Ayers, an Air Force major and F-22 Raptor pilot. \"As a (space) rookie, that was one of the coolest things I've ever done. I can't wait to get to work up here.\"",
      "McClain, Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov -- both veteran commercial airline pilots \u2014 are replacing Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and his pilot, Sunita Williams.",
      "Three other crew members, cosmonauts Aleksey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, were launched to the station last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft. They're scheduled to return to Earth next month.",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner astronaut ferry ship. The flight was originally expected to last about eight days.",
      "But during rendezvous with the space station, the Starliner experienced propulsion system problems and NASA eventually ruled out bringing the crew down on the Boeing spacecraft.",
      "Instead, the astronauts were told to remain aboard the station while the Starliner returned to Earth on its own. NASA then bumped two astronauts from the next station flight \u2014 Crew 9 \u2014 freeing up two seats for use by Wilmore and Williams.",
      "When Hague and Gorbunov reached the station, Wilmore and Williams joined them to become part of Crew 9 for a normal six-month tour of duty.",
      "Now that Crew 10 has arrived, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams will help familiarize their replacements with space station operations before undocking and returning to Earth next week with a splashdown in the Gulf near the coast of Florida. NASA announced on Sunday it was targeting Tuesday for the return journey, with undocking scheduled for 1:05 a.m. ET and splashdown at around 6 p.m.",
      "\"NASA and SpaceX met on Sunday to assess weather and splashdown conditions off Florida's coast for the return of the agency's Crew 9 mission from the International Space Station,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "\"Mission managers are targeting an earlier Crew 9 return opportunity based on favorable conditions (predicted) for the evening of Tuesday, March 18. The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favorable weather conditions expected for later in the week.\"",
      "If all goes to plan, Wilmore and Williams upon landing will have logged 286 days in space since launch last June. While a long flight by any standard, it's still well short of the U.S. record for a single flight \u2014 371 days \u2014 set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.",
      "Ironically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.",
      "Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.",
      "Given Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with around 570 days in space overall, depending on the actual launch date. Only former astronaut Peggy Whitson has more time aloft among U.S. astronauts: 675 days over four flights.",

      "Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov took off from historic pad 39 at the Kennedy Space Center at 7:03 p.m. EDT, putting on a spectacular show as the rocket climbed away from the Kennedy Space Center atop a long jet of flaming exhaust.",
      "Ten minutes after liftoff \u2014 and a dramatic first stage landing back at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station \u2014 the Crew Dragon capsule was released from the rocket's upper stage to fly on its own.",
      "As it moved away, a camera on the Falcon 9's second stage showed what a source described as insulation from the Falcon 9's second stage. While unusual, the Crew Dragon was reported to be in good shape and ready to chase down the space station.",
      "Given an on-time liftoff, the Crew Dragon will carry out an autonomous rendezvous with the space station, catching up with the lab Saturday night and moving in for docking at the space station's forward port at 11:30 p.m.",
      "They'll be welcomed aboard by Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams, along with cosmonauts Alexsey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who were launched last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "Hague and Gorbunov were launched aboard the Crew 9 Dragon in\u00a0September. Two NASA astronauts who originally planned to be on that flight were bumped from the mission to free up two seats for Wilmore and Williams. They became part of Crew 9 and worked with Hague and Gorbunov for the duration of their six-month mission.",
      "The Crew 9 fliers plan to spend two days familiarizing their replacements with the intricacies of space station operation before boarding their own Crew Dragon, the same one that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, for the trip home.",
      "The flight plan calls for undocking Tuesday, setting the stage for re-entry and splashdown off Florida's Gulf Coast next weekend. By that point, Wilmore and Williams will have logged about 290 days \u2014 9.7 months \u2014 in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to around 174 days, depending on the landing date.",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule on June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "The astronauts originally planned to spend about eight days in space, but NASA and Boeing, the Starliner's builder, carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers ruled that option out. Instead, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew 9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner, meanwhile, successfully returned to Earth in September, kicking off hands-on troubleshooting and ongoing work to prepare for the eventual resumption of flights.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of their mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "President Trump blamed the extended mission on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the Starliner crew.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon (Musk), I said, 'Do me a favor, can you get 'em out?' He said 'Yes.' He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon that Mr. Trump was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It it is assigned to the Crew 10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew 9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth along with Hague and Gorbunov.",
      "Musk said earlier he offered to launch a mission to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but the offer, he said, was turned down for political reasons. NASA managers say they never heard of such an offer and that the current plan causes the least disruption to station operations and downstream crew rotation flights.",
      "While NASA could have brought Crew 9 down earlier aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, but that would have left a single astronaut \u2014 Pettit \u2014 aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",

    "story": [
      "Those who glanced up at the sky Thursday night had an opportunity to catch the March 2025 \"Blood Moon,\" a phenomenon that colors the full moon in shades of red, orange and yellow during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "This month's full moon\u00a0was due to pass through the shadow of Earth either late Thursday night or very early Friday morning, depending on the viewer's time zone. It was visible to people in the Americas and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Dubbed the \"Worm Moon\" by the Farmer's Almanac, which has been assigning names to full moons for almost a century, this one is expected to last through Saturday morning, according to NASA. The full moon technically rose in its totality early Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about the event \u2014 and why the moon showed a new hue when it happened.",
      "Why was the moon red, orange and yellow?",
      "The moon appeared to turn red as Earth passed directly between it and the sun in what's known as a total lunar eclipse. Their perfect alignment darkens the moon, from the perspective of folks looking up, because our planet's position blocks most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "Some light still makes its way to the moon's surface, but only certain shades of it. The colors that wind up there are longer wavelengths of light \u2014 red, orange, yellow \u2014 which withstood the journey through \"a thick slice of Earth's atmosphere,\" NASA said.",
      "Shorter wavelengths of the color spectrum, like blue, scatter easily when they hit the atmosphere. That's why a vast sky can look blue in the middle of the day, when sunlight can shine straight down from overhead. Longer wavelengths materialize on Earth when sunlight hits from more of a perpendicular angle, so its route through our atmosphere can be more extensive. Short wavelengths are essentially filtered out by the atmosphere over such a protracted distance, and only the longer reds, oranges and yellows remain.",
      "What is a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "\"Blood Moon\" is a nickname that refers to the moon's reddish appearance during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon takes on several shades of red, orange and yellow when it's nearer the outer edges of Earth's shadow \u2014 when it first intersects with the path of Earth's shadow, for example, and as it's on its way out. But shades of deep red become more pronounced as the moon enters the darkest part of the shadow.",
      "What exactly causes a \"Blood Moon\"?",
      "A \"Blood Moon\" happens during a total lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth and the moon align in that order. Long wavelengths of sunlight are refracted through Earth's atmosphere before reaching the moon, which reflects them in reddish hues that may resemble the color of blood.",
      "When was the \"Blood Moon\" lunar eclipse?",
      "This week's \"Blood Moon\" began late Thursday night. The moon moved through Earth's shadow overnight, with the best opportunity to see the reddish moon around 3 a.m. ET Friday.",

      "With the moon in the shadow of the Earth, it will appear red-orange, according to NASA. Lunar eclipses are sometimes called blood moons because of the phenomenon.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, the moon gets its red coloration because any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth is filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA.

These features combined will help scientists learn more about the lunar body, the ESA said.",
      "\"These instruments have been tried out before, during Hera's departure from Earth, but this is the first time that we have employed them on a small distant moon for which we still lack knowledge \u2013 demonstrating their excellent performance in the process,\" ESA Hera mission scientist Michael Kueppers said in the news release.",
      "The ESA's Mars Express, which has been orbiting the red planet for over 20 years, also contributed observations of the moon. Results from the encounter should help guide operational planning for a mission set to explore Martian moons in 2026, the ESA said. That mission, in conjunction with NASA and French and German space agencies, will collect detailed measurements of Mars' two moons and land on Phobos, the larger lunar body, to collect a sample that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",
      "Hera also used the flyby of Mars to adjust its trajectory through deep space. That maneuver shortened Hera's travel time to Dimorphos, the ESA said. Hera will also collect information about Didymos, the asteroid that Dimorphos orbits around. Hera is expected to reach the Didymos in December 2026, the ESA said.",
      "\"This has been the Hera team's first exciting experience of exploration, but not our last,\" said Hera mission manager Ian Carnelli in the news release. \"In 21 months the spacecraft will reach our target asteroids, and start our crash site investigation of the only object in our Solar System to have had its orbit measurably altered by human action.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 04:55:51 -0400",
    "summary": "NASA will wait at least another two days to launch its next space station crew, delaying the return of Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams a bit longer.",
    "story": [
      "With the countdown within 45 minutes of launch, NASA called off an attempt to send the next crew to the International Space Station Thursday evening to allow more time to troubleshoot a ground system hydraulics issue. If the problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX will make another attempt to launch the crew Friday evening.",
      "The scrub will add at least two more days to the eventual return to Earth of Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams, along with two other outgoing space station crew members.",
      "Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov were strapped in and ready for blastoff from historic pad 39 at the Kennedy Space Center at 7:48 p.m. EDT Wednesday.",
      "But throughout the final few hours of the countdown, SpaceX engineers were troubleshooting an apparent problem with one of two clamp arms that hold the Falcon 9 rocket to its launch support gantry. Hydraulics are used to retract the two clamps prior to launch, and while the system appeared to be working normally, it wasn't clear whether one of the arms would retract fully.",
      "A launch opportunity Thursday was ruled out due to expected high winds and to give engineers more time to assess data and determine what, if any, repairs are needed. If the hydraulics problem can be resolved in time, NASA and SpaceX could be ready to press ahead with a launch attempt at 7:03 p.m. Friday.",
      "Whenever Crew-10 takes off, rendezvous and docking with the space station is expected the following day.",
      "Standing by to welcome them aboard will be Crew-9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams, along with cosmonauts Alexsey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who were launched last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "McClain and her crewmates will spend two days getting briefed by Crew-9 on the intricacies of space station operations before Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams undock on March 19\u00a0for their return to Earth. The normal \"handover\" period is five days or so, but mission managers shortened it this time around to maintain the lab's food reserves.",
      "While the ongoing saga of the \"stranded\" Starliner astronauts has overshadowed the Crew-10 mission, McClain said she and her crewmates began training for their mission in 2023 and they were all eager to finally get into space. McClain and Onishi are space station veterans while Ayers and Peskov are making their first flight.",
      "All four are veteran military or commercial pilots. Before joining NASA, McClain, an active-duty Army colonel, served as a combat helicopter pilot while Ayers, an Air Force major, is a veteran F-22 Raptor pilot. Onishi served as a commercial pilot in Japan, flying Boeing 767 jetliners, and Peskov is an experienced commercial 757 pilot.",
      "\"We're going to have planned and unplanned maintenance to keep the space station running,\" McClain said. \"We have a plethora of science experiments, both inside and outside of the space station. We have spacewalks. We have visiting vehicles (and) the potential of (hosting) private astronaut missions.\"",
      "\"They're ready to come home\"",
      "As for Wilmore and Williams, McClain said, \"honestly, I'm kind of most looking forward to breaking bread with those guys, talking to them, giving them big hugs. We go way back. ... We're ready to go up there. They're ready to come home.\"",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Given an on-time launch for Crew 10 Friday, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams could undock on March 19 and land as early as March 20 or 21. If so, the Starliner astronauts will have logged 288 days or so \u2014  9.5 months \u2014  \u00a0in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to about 173 days.",
      "The U.S. record for longest single spaceflight is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, who spent 371 days in space because of problems with the Soyuz spacecraft that carried him to orbit. Like the Starliner crew, he was forced to extend his mission and come home on a different Soyuz.",
      "In any case, what would normally be a relatively routine crew rotation, sending up four crew members to replace four others wrapping up a five- to six-month station visit, has turned into political theater, fueled by repeated criticism from President Trump and Elon Musk blaming the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's predicament.",
      "Musk said in a post on his social media platform X that he offered to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams earlier, but the offer was turned down. He did not say who turned the proposal down or even whether it was someone at NASA or the White House.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon, I said, do me a favor, can you get 'em out? He said yes. He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon he was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It will be carrying the Crew-10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew-9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth aboard their own Crew Dragon.",
      "That Crew Dragon, which carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September for a normal tour of duty, has been docked at the lab ever since. It was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams so their ride home has been at the station for the past five-and-a-half months.",
      "NASA could have brought Crew-9 down earlier, but that would have left a single astronaut, Pettit, aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "\"We don't feel stranded\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those. ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",
      "And so, NASA's plan to bring the Starliner astronauts home, a plan managers said minimized disruption to the space station crew rotation schedule, has been in place since last August. Even so, the president has repeatedly blamed the Biden administration for the extended mission.",
      "NASA managers have not openly challenged the president's comments and have generally downplayed their responses to questions about Musk's claim to have offered to launch another Crew Dragon to bring Wilmore and Williams home.",
      "Last August, Stich was asked about the possibility of launching a mission specifically to bring the Starliner crew back to Earth. He told reporters during a news conference that the agency \"really never considered that option.\"",
      "\"From the very beginning, we liked the option of modifying Crew-9 or Crew-8,\" he said, referring to the option of adding Williams and Wilmore to Hague's crew or whether to shoehorn them into a Crew Dragon that brought four other station fliers back to Earth last October.",
      "\"We looked at both of those and bringing them back on either one of those vehicles,\" Stich said at the time. \"We're trying to lay out the rest of our manifest to make sure we have vehicles available for all the flights. It just didn't make sense to go ahead and accelerate a flight to return Butch and Suni earlier.\"",
      "What went wrong with Boeing's Starliner?",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule last June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets that did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "NASA carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers disagreed and ruled that option out. Instead, as Stich described, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year\u00a0when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew-9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of a lengthy mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "Last September, Boeing successfully brought the Starliner down by remote control and NASA launched the Crew-9 mission aboard a Crew Dragon carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner astronauts joined the Crew-9 expedition and originally expected to return to Earth in February after arrival of the next Crew Dragon in the crew rotation sequence. But the Crew-10 Dragon, a new vehicle making its first flight, ran into problems that delayed launch, and Crew-9's return, to the end of March.",
      "NASA eventually decided to switch Crew-10 to a different Dragon, enabling a launch on March 12, a few weeks earlier than the previous late March target. Stich said the capsule swap and slightly earlier launch date were not the result of any outside pressure.",
      "The decision \"really was driven by a lot of other factors,\" Stich said. \"We were looking at this before some of those statements were made by the President and Mr. Musk.\"",
      "Said Ken Bowersox, NASA's chief of spaceflight operations at agency Headquarters: \"I can verify that Steve had been talking about how we might need to juggle the flights and switch capsules a good month before there was any discussion outside of NASA.\"",
      "\"But the president's interest sure added energy to the conversation, and it's great to have a president who's interested in what we're doing.\"",

      "Multiple factors are pushing the costs for building or fixing up home, according to the trade group. U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China are driving up materials costs, while Mr. Trump's trade threats have also stoked market volatility, making housing developers and homebuyers reluctant to take on financial risks.",
      "Uncertainty around when U.S. levies could take effect and how long they could remain in place is making real estate developers reluctant to commit to new projects, impeding home construction. Prospective homebuyers, many of whom have been sidelined by rising mortgage rates, now also face higher costs due to tariffs.",
      "Greg Kraut, co-founder and CEO of KPG Funds, a New York-based property design and development firm, said such concerns are weighing heavily on the housing industry.",
      "\"Tariffs are causing indecision in the marketplace and eroding confidence, which is leading to developers not leasing or people not building their houses,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",

Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely be asked if policymakers see signs that the Trump administration's tariffs could boost inflation, which remains well above the central bank's 2% annual target.",
      "Still, Wall Street analysts expect more volatility in the weeks ahead amid ongoing uncertainty caused by global trade spats. The Trump administration has threatened on April 2 to impose matching tariffs on countries that tax the U.S. That's also the date 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, which had been delayed for a month to allow for negotiations, are set to take effect.",
      "\"While financial markets appear to be stabilizing, investors are wrestling with the decision of whether to buy the dips or sell the rallies in an environment of exceptionally high policy uncertainty,\" Jason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a report Monday. \"A game-theoretic assessment of potential tariff outcomes suggests that Trump's optimal strategy is to announce reciprocal tariffs on 2 April, and then begin to negotiate them lower.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump is questioning former President Joe Biden's signature on preemptive pardons issued to the members of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump claimed late Sunday that preemptive pardons former President Joe Biden granted to members of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol are \"void\" and \"vacant\" because they were allegedly signed with an autopen.",
      "However, the Justice Department two decades ago said the president can use an autopen to sign legislation, and the Constitution imposes few limits on the president's pardon power.",
      "In a post to Truth Social shared just after midnight, Mr. Trump claimed without evidence that Biden himself did not sign the pardons he issued to the members of the Jan. 6 select committee, staff members, and officers from the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department and U.S. Capitol Police who testified before the panel.",
      "Biden signed the \"full and unconditional pardon\" for any offenses arising from the committee's activities on Jan. 19, one day before he left the White House. Others who received preemptive pardons were Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley and several Biden family members.",
      "What did Trump say about Biden's pardons?",
      "Mr. Trump claimed that the pardons his predecessor issued to the select committee members are \"hereby declared void, vacant, and of no further force of effect, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen.\" The president wrote that Biden did not sign the pardons and \"did not know anything about them,\" though Mr. Trump did not provide evidence about the circumstances surrounding Biden's clemency decision.",
      "He said the select committee members \"should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level.\"",
      "A representative for Biden did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "The pardons were issued to the House members who served on the panel in response to Mr. Trump's threats on the campaign trail that he would target them if elected to a second term. He had accused the former and current lawmakers of destroying evidence and committing a \"major crime\" during their probe, and told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in December that \"everybody\" who served on the committee \"should go to jail.\"",
      "Last July, Mr. Trump circulated a social media post accusing former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, the committee's vice chair, of being \"guilty of treason\" and promoting \"televised military tribunals.\"",
      "The president's latest message shared to Truth Social suggests that his administration may investigate Cheney and the others who served alongside her on the Jan. 6 committee.",
      "What is an autopen signature?",
      "Patented in the early 1800s and used by Thomas Jefferson, the autopen is a device used to replicate handwritten signatures.",
      "Presidents have signed documents and correspondence using an autopen for decades. According to Smithsonian Magazine, Harry Truman was the first president to use autopen, and it was said to have been used frequently by President John F. Kennedy. But Barack Obama became the first president to use an autopen for legislation when he directed it to be used to sign an extension of the Patriot Act while in France in May 2011.",
      "President George W. Bush's administration weighed in on the legality of signing legislation with an autopen in 2005, when the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded that \"the president need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.\"",
      "\"Rather, the president may sign a bill within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the president's signature to such a bill, for example by autopen,\" then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General Howard Nielson, Jr., wrote in an opinion for the White House counsel.",
      "As to the pardon power, the Constitution gives the president the exclusive authority to grant clemency, with few limits. And in 2024, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit found that pardons or commutations do not have to be issued in writing.",
      "\"We readily determine that nothing in the Constitution restricts the president's exercise of the clemency power to commutations that have been rendered through a documented writing,\" the unanimous 4th Circuit panel wrote.",
      "While the court found that a writing \"will generally be the means of proving to a third party that the act has occurred,\" it noted that \"a clemency warrant or, indeed, any writing, is not required for the president to exercise this authority under the Constitution.\"",
      "The case before the 4th Circuit also involved Mr. Trump and claims raised by James Rosemond, who is serving life sentences for numerous offenses arising from his role in drug trafficking and a murder. Rosemond claimed that Mr. Trump told two supporters, former Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown and his wife, during a telephone call in December 2020 that his sentence had been commuted.",
      "But Rosemond was not among those who received written clemency warrants during Mr. Trump's first term, and his petition was listed after the president left the White House in January 2021 as \"pending.\"",
      "The judges who issued the decision are Steven Agee, appointed by Bush, Stephanie Thacker, named by Obama, and Allison Jones Rushing, nominated by Mr. Trump.",

      "The latest retail sales numbers point to \"increased spending reluctance on the part of the consumers as flagging consumer sentiment, rising job insecurity and another bout of cold winter weather took a toll on households' willingness to spend,\" EY Senior Economist Lydia Boussour said in a report. \"Aside from the strong increase online and at personal care stores, sales were mixed across retailers and the largest decline in sales at restaurants and bars in two years suggests consumers are cutting back on non-essential expenses.\"",
      "American retailers Kohl's, Dick's, Walmart and others have warned that they expect consumers to spend more cautiously this year, while airlines, including Delta, American and United cut their earnings forecasts this month amid similar concerns of an economic slowdown.",

Sales in other categories were more in line with forecasts, reassuring investors that the economy isn't already slipping into a recession.",

    "story": [
      "Watching your 401(k) plan savings recede as stocks slide can be gut-wrenching, sparking anxiety about whether you'll ever be able to retire \u2014 a particularly loaded issue for Gen Xers, given the oldest members of the generation are hitting 60 this year.",
      "But financial experts say it's important not to panic in the face of plunging markets\u00a0or rising\u00a0recession risks\u00a0because that can lead to rash decisions that cost you money. Instead, it's important to focus on some key investment questions before taking action, they say.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Trump's tariff barrage has spooked investors and soured consumers on the economy, with many fearing that his trade policies will trigger inflation and slam economic growth. The S&P 500 last week briefly moved into so-called \"correction\" territory, meaning the index had tumbled 10% from its most recent high, although it regained some ground on Friday.",
      "The downdraft in stocks is causing angst among people saving for retirement, experts say.",
      "\"First of all, you aren't alone \u2014 a lot of people are panicking,\" TIAA wealth management director Doug Ornstein told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Don't overreact, but it might be appropriate to take some action.\"",
      "The market turmoil comes as many employees already feel behind the curve, with 7 in 10 workers saying they believe they could work until they retire and still not have enough money to fund their golden years, according to a new Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies report.",
      "\"Everyone is navigating difficult waters right now and trying to understand what the effects of market volatility will be on their overall retirement savings,\" noted Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. \"One thing they should be doing, but many aren't, is engaging in the basics.\"",
      "Here are some key questions that experts recommend you consider before making changes to your retirement account.",
      "What is your appetite for risk?",
      "It's easy to think you've got a high tolerance for risk when stocks are in a bull market, as they've been for the last few years. But the current market turmoil may be a sign that that you're more cautious than you thought, experts say.",
      "Risk tolerance is sometimes assessed in a quiz (such as this one from Vanguard) that asks hypothetical questions about your approach towards investing, such as whether you might sell a bond if it lost money in a short period of time.",
      "\"How do I think about risk, and how do I feel about risk emotionally and psychologically \u2014 all of that is completely valid to consider,\" TIAA's Ornstein said.",
      "But it's also important to consider your risk capacity, which involves a more complicated calculation including data such as your age and your retirement horizon. That offers a more objective way to assess risk than your emotional reaction to losing money on investment.",
      "\"Both things are really important: How you feel about risk, and what resources do you have\" to manage that risk, he noted.",
      "Is your time horizon really what you think it is?",
      "Workers often think about their investment horizon as the number of years they have left in the workforce, which might seem daunting to a Gen Xer who is getting closer to retirement.",
      "But the truth, which might not be intuitive to some workers, is that this timeframe is likely much longer than you expect, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Let's say someone is 60 and plans to retire at 67 \u2014 they don't have a lot of time for the market to recover\" before they retire, he noted. \"But if you retire at 67 and live to 95, most of your money will probably remain invested for next 20, 25, 30 years.\"",
      "He added, \"We'll see a lot of ups and downs, bull and bear markets, presidential administrations, and economic cycles over the next 20 to 30 years, so what is happening right now shouldn't dictate a massive change.\"",
      "In other words, someone whose retirement is just a few years away might have an actual investment time horizon of 30 years, which means sticking to their financial plan.",
      "More generally, trying to time the market, or trading individual stocks in an effort to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, considerable research\u00a0has found.",
      "Is your investment portfolio sufficiently diversified?",
      "Although it's important not to overreact when markets are rocky, rebalancing your investments can be a good idea is such periods, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Buy and hold works well when the market is just going up and up,\" he said. When markets head south, \"It may be a good time to consider rebalancing into a more diversified mix of investments.\"",
      "For instance, that means not only checking your mix of equities and fixed income, but also your mix of sub-asset classes within those categories. Adding international stocks, for instance, on top of your S&P 500 index fund could help spread the risk, as well as considering different types of fixed income investments aside from Treasuries.",
      "And don't forget to tend to your emergency savings, given that having a cash buffer can help in times of financial stress and keep you from raiding your retirement account, noted Transamerica's Collinson. Her group's research found that 37% of workers have tapped their retirement accounts, suggesting that many people use their 401(k)s as an emergency fund.",
      "Workers can ask their employers to set aside a portion of their paycheck in another bank account that they earmark for emergency savings. Some employers also are starting to enroll workers in accounts specifically designed for emergencies, a change that was enabled by the Secure 2.0 retirement law.",
      "\"The research indicates many workers lack adequate emergency savings,\" she said. \"Now is the time to find out how to build that up.\"",

    "story": [
      "Johannesburg\u00a0\u2014 The Trump administration expelled South Africa's Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool on Friday, giving him 72 hours to leave the country. In a social media post, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Rasool a \"race-baiting politician who hates America\" and President Trump.",
      "In a diplomatic notice, the Department of State said that it would no longer recognize Ambassador Rasool as a \"member of the [South African] mission from today, March 17,\" adding that \"his privileges and immunities will cease\" and that he was \"persona non grata\" in the United States.",
      "The expulsion came after Rasool, during a webinar hosted by the South African Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection, accused Mr. Trump of pursuing policies and practices that the diplomat characterized as \"a white supremacist response to growing demographic diversity in the United States.\"",
      "Rasool was expelled just two months after he arrived in Washington to serve as his country's envoy.",
      "\"Improving our relationship with the United States of America is a priority for us,\" South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa told journalists on Monday, calling the U.S. \"our second largest trading partner after China.\"",
      "\"We have noted the displeasure that has been expressed by the United States, particularly about the remarks he made,\" Ramaphosa said, adding that he expected Rasool to return to Pretoria and \"give me a full report.\"",
      "It's the latest in a string of incidents that have seen a marked deterioration of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and South Africa since Mr. Trump took office for his second term in January.",
      "Speaking on South African television on Saturday, the country's foreign minister said the decision by the U.S. to expel Rasool, who previously campaigned against the country's racist Apartheid regime, was \"unprecedented and regrettable,\" before adding: \"We need to find time to engage with each other behind closed doors, where the U.S. can raise their concerns with us, and we can also raise our concerns with them, because it is not helpful to engage in megaphone and Twitter diplomacy.\"",
      "A pro-Hamas, anti-Israel ambassador to the U.S.?",
      "Rasool's appointment to head the South African diplomatic mission in the U.S., by the ruling African National Congress party, was a contentious one even before he arrived in Washington, dividing opinions within the country's new Government of National Unity (GNU). The ANC had to build the coalition government to maintain power after failing to win a significant enough majority in the last elections to govern on its own.",
      "\"Rasool's appointment was opposed by all of the other political parties in the GNU, and was the first large point of contention between the parties,\" Wiliam Gumede, a professor of public management at Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, explained to CBS News.",
      "\"Eventually, the non-ANC partners caved in,\" Gumede said, which led to Rasool getting the job.",
      "\"He is perceived to be pro-Iran and Hamas, as well as strongly anti-Israel, which is largely why it was felt he was the wrong choice for the ambassador post,\" Gumede told CBS News.",
      "Rasool has long been a controversial figure in South African politics, having spoken favorably of the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization Hamas, and even\u00a0boasting of his ties with the group's leadership. He is a strong backer of the case South Africa filed with the United Nations' top court, accusing Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. Israel has vehemently rejected that accusation, arguing that its war in the Palestinian enclave has been a legitimate self-defense against Hamas following the group's Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack.",
      "Gumede said he believed the way for Ramaphosa to ease the tension with Washington was for the South African president to publicly label Rasool's comments \"unacceptable,\" while also giving a detailed acknowledgement of how important relations and aid from the U.S. are to South Africa.",
      "The analyst said if such measures were not taken by Pretoria to smooth the relationship, the impasse could deepen, with significant implications for South Africa.",
      "\"I fear the next step steps could be targeted economic sanctions against South Africa, which would mean we are in danger of losing 300,000 to 400,000 direct jobs in the country, as well as hundreds of thousands more jobs through indirect channels,\" he said.",
      "\"It's not too late,\" Gumede added. \"President Trump has a lot of South Africans in his inner circle. We need to engage them and put together a team of non-ANC partners from the Government of National Unity to travel to the U.S. and engage the Trump team. The relationship is simply too important not to.\"",

    "summary": "As revelers celebrate St. Patrick's Day in 2025, here's a look at who Ireland's patron saint was and the meaning behind the holiday.",
    "story": [
      "While St. Patrick's Day celebrations often produce images of T-shirts donning \"Kiss me, I'm Irish,\" leprechaun hats and pubs full of people, the holiday holds a deeper meaning.",
      "Here's a look at who Ireland's patron saint was and why he is celebrated each year.",
      "When did we start celebrating St. Patrick's Day?",
      "The first historical record of revelry for St. Patrick dates back to the 7th century in Ireland, Sarah Waidler, a visiting assistant professor of Irish language, literature and culture at New York University, told CBS News. However, she said people had likely already begun to honor him before that.",
      "During medieval times, texts show that people not only believed St. Patrick was a saint, but also that he was a part of God's final judgement of Irish people when they died. Over the years, Patrick became \"strongly identified\" with Ireland and would become one of its three patron saints, along with St. Brigid and St. Columba, Waidler said.",
      "The first St. Patrick's Day parade currently on record was held in St. Augustine, Florida, in 1601, historians say. Not, as some might assume, on the Emerald Isle.",
      "\"The parade is an embracing of the Irish diaspora,\" said Elizabeth Stack, the executive director of the American Irish Historical Society in New York City. Especially, she said, in times when there was pushback against Catholics.",
      "Through the parades, the Irish community is saying, \"Yes, we're proud of our heritage and our roots,\" she said, \"but we are also a very vibrant part of a modern city or a modern America.\"",
      "It's also a gentle reminder, she said, that \"there are a lot of us, and if we choose to vote as a block, we can use a lot of power.\"",
      "According to the U.S. Census, 31.5 million Americans, or 9.5% of the population, claimed Irish ancestry in 2021. In 2023, the population of Ireland was 5.3 million. \"There's more of us that left the country then stayed there,\" said Stack.",
      "Who was St. Patrick?",
      "This may come as a surprise to some, but St. Patrick was not actually Irish. \"The patron saint of Ireland is actually a Welshman,\" Cian T. McMahon, an expert on modern Ireland and the Irish diaspora and history professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, told CBS News.",
      "\"In the days before there were England, Scotland and Wales, it was Rome,\" he said. So, Patrick was born in what is now Wales, but was then Roman Britain.",
      "Much of what historians know about St. Patrick comes from two of his very own writings, which is considered lucky to have from so long ago, Waidler said. The two pieces were likely written in the 5th century, but Patrick did not date them or give much historical context. So, historians aren't certain of when he lived.",
      "However, according to these writings, Patrick said he was captured when he was 16 years old by slavers from Roman Britain, where he was, in McMahon's words, a \"lukewarm Catholic.\"",
      "The slavers took Patrick to Ireland, where he said he worked as a shepherd. This hardship helped him rediscover his faith, and after 6 years, he escaped to Britain, attributing his release to the works of God. After escaping, he spent many years training to become a bishop, according to his writings.",
      "Waidler said it is hard to say if Patrick was truly recognized as a bishop because there are no other historical texts backing this claim up.",
      "After he supposedly became a bishop, Patrick said that in a vision he heard the voice of an Irish fisherman calling him back to the country he was formerly enslaved in. He then went back to the Celtic Pagan nation of Ireland and converted people to Catholicism.",
      "St. Patrick died on March 17, as recognized by the church. Waidler said it is hard to know the exact year.",
      "Patrick's story, many later writers point out, is very similar to Moses' from the Bible.",
      "After being kidnapped into slavery, he could have been vengeful or looked down on the people who put him in bondage, Stack said. But he decided, instead, to forgive the Irish.",
      "In doing so, she said he \"changed Ireland forever, converting a Pagan country to an intensely Catholic one.\" St. Patrick's \"beautiful message\" of tolerance and forgiveness \"becomes more and more relevant,\" said Stack.",
      "In modern times, many know of the legends that St. Patrick rid Ireland of snakes and that he taught the idea of the holy trinity by using a shamrock.",
      "According to Waidler, the stories attributing the expulsion of poisonous creatures or reptiles to St. Patrick began in the 12th century. However, some later writers see the expulsion of snakes as a metaphor for paganism. \"It is a story that keeps getting repeated after the 12th century and also appears in early images of the saint,\" she said.",
      "\"Shamrocks are harder to trace,\" Waidler said. The term shamrock first appears in 1571, but it was first attributed to St. Patrick in a treatise on Ireland's native plants in 1726. \"Shamrocks, by the way,\" she said, \"are simply clovers.\"",
      "St. Patrick's Day also used to be associated with the color blue. However, as other countries started celebrating it in more modern times, green became associated with the day because Irish-Americans attribute green to \"all things Ireland,\" said Waidler.",
      "Where is St. Patrick's Day celebrated?",
      "\"The better question is where is it not celebrated,\" said McMahon.",

    "story": [
      "The Vatican on Sunday released the first photograph of pope in more than a month, showing Pope Francis wearing a purple Lenten liturgical vestments sitting in a wheelchair in front of an altar in the hospital chapel.",
      "The Vatican said he was participating in the celebration of the Mass with other priests. No one else is visible in the photo. It is the first photograph of the pope since he was hospitalized on Feb. 14 with a severe case of bronchitis, which developed into double pneumonia. It is also the first time the Vatican mentions that the pope has participated in celebrating a Mass in the period.",
      "Children's prayers for the pope",
      "Earlier, dozens of children toting yellow and white balloons \u2014 many from war-torn countries \u2014 gathered outside Rome's Gemelli hospital to greet Pope Francis on his fifth Sunday hospitalized. While the pope did not appear from the 10th-floor suite of windows, he thanked them and acknowledged their presence in the traditional Sunday blessing.",
      "\"I know that many children are praying for me; some of them came here today to Gemelli as a sign of closeness,'' the pontiff said in the Angelus text prepared for the traditional prayer but not delivered live again. \"Thank you, dearest children! The pope loves you and is always waiting to meet you,'' Francis said.",
      "The Rev. Enzo Fortunato, president of the pontifical committee for World Children's Day who organized the event, said that the gathering of children with their parents was a form of spiritual medicine for the 88-year-old pontiff. He called it ''the most beautiful caress.''",
      "\"The children represent a symbolic medicine for Pope Francis,'' Fortunato said. ''Letting him know that so many children are here for him cheers the heart.''",
      "A small group of children, whose balloons represented the colors of the Vatican flag, briefly entered the hospital to leave behind their drawings, messages and flowers for Francis. Many of the children came from poorer Italian districts or from countries impacted by war, some having arrived in Italy from Afghanistan and Syria via humanitarian corridors set up by the Sant'Egidio charity in agreement with the Italian government; others were from Ukraine, Gaza, South America and Africa.",
      "One of them was 12-year-old Anastasia, who got up at 5 a.m. to make the trip from Naples with the hopes of delivering the message directly to the pope. \"I wrote, 'Pope Francis, get well and return home soon,'\" she said. \"We love you, all of the children are praying for you.''",
      "\"Pope of the children\"",
      "Andrea Iacomini, the spokesman for UNICEF in Italy, said besides demonstrating affection for the pope, the group also wanted to say \"enough'' to conflicts that are impacting 500 million children in 59 countries.",
      "\"This pope is not just a religious leader, he is a great global leader. A man of peace. This pope is pope of the children.'' Iacomini said.",
      "Francis typically delivers the Angelus from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square to the gathered faithful, who have grown more numerous due to the Jubilee year that Francis inaugurated in December.",
      "In the written text, Francis said he was thinking of others, who like him, are in a fragile state. \"Our bodies are weak, but even like this, nothing can prevent us from loving, praying, giving ourselves, being for each other, in faith, shining signs of hope,'' the pope said.",
      "Along with a stop at St. Peter's to seek indulgences by walking through the basilica's Holy Door, pilgrims are now also adding a stop at Gemelli, a 15-minute train ride from the Vatican.",
      "Pope's condition remains complex",
      "Doctors this week said the pontiff was no longer in critical, life-threatening condition, but they have continued to emphasize that his condition remained complex due to his age, lack of mobility and the loss of part of a lung as a young man.",
      "Still, they are issuing fewer medical bulletins as the pontiff has been on an upward trajectory. An X-ray this week confirmed that the infection was clearing.",
      "Francis has not been seen publicly since he was admitted to the hospital Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis that made it difficult for him to speak. Doctors soon added a diagnosis of double pneumonia and a polymicrobial (bacterial, viral and fungal) infection.",
      "The first three weeks of his hospitalization were marked by a rollercoaster of setbacks, including respiratory crises, mild kidney failure and a severe coughing fit.",
      "Doctors in the most recent medical update on Saturday said they were working to reduce the pope's nighttime reliance on the non-invasive ventilation mask, which will allow his lungs to work more.",
      "Doctors underlined that while the pope's condition is stable, he still requires hospitalization for treatment along with physical and respiratory therapy, which are \"showing further gradual improvements,\" the Vatican said Saturday in the first medical update in three days.",
      "The next update won't be issued until mid-week, the Vatican said."

    "summary": "President Trump has repeatedly said the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and Israel approached the governments of Sudan and Somalia, and have also been interested in Syria, as potential places to resettle Palestinians from Gaza, according to three sources familiar with the effort.",
      "The idea of Palestinian resettlement in another country is one of several options the Trump team is chewing over as part of the U.S. president's larger goal of ending Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and rebuilding the devastated Palestinian enclave.",
      "\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" President Trump said Wednesday, when the Irish Prime Minister was asked during the two leaders' Oval Office meeting by a Voice of America reporter about the president's controversial remarks in February when he suggested taking ownership of Gaza to rebuild it.",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a Feb. 4 press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Gaza could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "\"\u200aWe should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this, and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A combination of Israeli and U.S. officials communicated to Sudan and Somalia, two diplomatic sources confirmed to CBS News. Senior far-right Israeli government officials have already been calling for Palestinians to migrate from the enclave. Mr. Trump's remarks have only emboldened Israel to reach out to other countries to explore opportunities for Palestinian resettlement, one source said.",
      "Three sources familiar with Mr. Trump's idea of resettling Gazans to another country told CBS News that his administration and Israel have also been interested in Syria. One source familiar with the Trump administration's Middle East policy said that the administration has attempted outreach to Syria's new interim government via a third-party interlocutor. Another source from the region told CBS News that Syria's government had been approached, but it was unclear whether there had been any response from Syria to the outreach.",
      "A senior Syrian official told CBS News that they are unaware of any outreach to their government by Israel or the U.S. about resettlement of Gazans.",
      "Dahir Hassan, Somalia's ambassador to the U.S., told CBS News that \"neither the U.S. administration nor Israeli authorities have approached the Somali government regarding any proposed relocation of Palestinians to Somalia.\" Hassan also cited concern that \"the dissemination of such unverified information risks fueling recruitment propaganda for extremist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, potentially exacerbating security challenges in the region.\"",
      "The Sudanese government has not responded to a CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Syria's fledgling interim government is just three months old, after toppling Bashar al-Assad and his brutal regime which held an iron fist over the Syrian people for decades. The Arab northeast African nation of Sudan is currently embroiled in civil war and a refugee crisis while suffering pockets of famine. Tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have sought asylum in Israel over the last two decades, only to be detained in the country's desert-based detention centers or left to live without any formal status. The East African country of Somalia is a fragile, formerly failed state where the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab continues to wage a deadly insurgency.",
      "Since his Feb. 4 news conference, Mr. Trump has suggested Palestinians would have a choice on whether to leave but also indicated that their departure from Gaza could be permanent. In a Fox News interview several days later he said, \"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities, could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they (the Palestinians) are.\" In the same interview, he said that Palestinians wouldn't have the right to return to Gaza under his plan because the enclave \"is not habitable\" and won't be for years to come.",
      "The United Nations reported in January that over 90% of housing units in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million Gazan civilians have been displaced. Gaza's health ministry says more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in which Hamas killed more than 1,000 Israelis and took roughly 100 more hostage.",
      "Multiple Arab governments, the United Nations and some Democratic lawmakers, quickly denounced Mr. Trump's idea of emptying out Gaza with some defining the idea as ethnic cleansing. Instead, Arab leaders endorsed an alternative Egyptian post-war construction plan for Gaza last week, but the Trump administration and Israel were both quick to reject it, again citing that the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had been sending U.S. officials on a regular basis to meet with the new Syrian government in Damascus in the lead-up to Mr. Trump's inauguration when the visits stopped.\u00a0 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, was quick to condemn Mr. Trump's remarks in February, saying that the U.S. president's plan \"is a serious crime that will ultimately fail\". It is unclear what the Trump administration's overall policy toward the new Syrian government will be.",
      "\"The Trump administration should engage directly with the new government in Damascus, particularly after the agreement between Damascus and the SDF (the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces). And to ensure that Iran never again gains a foothold in Syria, for the true, enduring defeat of ISIS, and to conduct a full withdrawal of U.S. forces in the right way unlike what unfolded in Afghanistan,\" Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Washington-based advocacy and humanitarian organization Syrian Emergency Task Force, told CBS News.",
      "Israel has conducted widespread airstrikes in Syria since December, on what it described as Assad regime weapons sites, and seized territory in the buffer zone between both countries. This past week, Israel struck inside a Damascus suburb, saying it was taking out the headquarters of the Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group that has a substantial foothold in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.",
      "A State Department spokesperson deferred to the Israeli government, and told CBS News that Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff \"continues to work tirelessly towards either an extension of Phase One (of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement) or an advance to Phase Two with these principles in mind\".",
      "The State Department also referred to remarks by Witkoff from a February Fox News interview in which he said, \"We need to explore new policy prescriptions that ultimately end up in a better life for Gazans and Palestinians.\"",
      "Witkoff also suggested in the same Fox interview that Gaza's entire Palestinian population could go to other Middle East-based Arab nations and other countries beyond the region: \"I think that the president's solution is: how do we address where two million people can go? And I think the obvious answers are: in some respects, Egypt, in some respects, Jordan; but in some respects other countries who have called us up and voluntarily said this is a humanitarian effort, we want to help you\".",
      "Asked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday about whether the Trump administration is talking to other countries about relocation of two million Palestinians in Gaza, Witkoff said again \"I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that lead to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things.\"",
      "Millions of displaced Palestinians already live in surrounding Arab countries as refugees, including in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. Far-right Israeli ministers have increasingly called for moving Palestinians in Gaza and also in the West Bank off their land as part of the extreme view it would fulfill a Biblical claim by Jews to the land, and increase Israel's security.",
      "The Israeli government, the White House and its National Security Council all declined to respond to multiple CBS News requests for comment.",
      "Trump's son-in-law and former advisor Jared Kushner first suggested that Gaza's \"waterfront property could be very valuable, if people would focus on building up livelihoods\" during an on-camera discussion at Harvard University in February 2024.",
      "The Associated Press was the first to report Friday that the U.S. and Israel had contacted Sudan, Somalia, and also Somaliland, about resettling Palestinians from Gaza.",

      "Large crowds of flag-waving protesters converged after meeting up at several agreed-on protest venues in various parts of the capital, which was placed on high alert. All public transport was cancelled.",
      "Ahead of the demonstration, Vucic repeatedly warned of alleged plans for unrest while threatening arrests and harsh sentences for any incidents.",
      "A deafening sound of whistles, drums and vuvuzelas filled the air on Saturday. Some protesters carried banners that read, \"He's Finished!\" Crowds chanted \"Pump it Up,\" a slogan adopted during past four months of student-led protests.",
      "\"I expect that this will shake his authority and that Vucic will realize that people are no longer for him,\" Milenko Kovacevic, a protester, said.",
      "The rally \u2014 which is expected to be the biggest anti-government protest ever held in the Balkan country \u2014 comes after more than four months of anti-corruption demonstrators that have posed the biggest challenge to Vucic's grip on power after 13 years in charge.",
      "Protesting university students have led the nationwide anti-graft movement, which started after a concrete canopy collapsed at a train station and killed 15 people in Serbia's north on Nov. 1. Many in Serbia blamed the crash on rampant government corruption, negligence and disrespect of construction safety regulations.",
      "On Friday evening, tens of thousands of people staged a joyous welcome for the students who have been marching or cycling for days from across Serbia toward Belgrade.",
      "Interior Minister Ivica Dacic told state RTS broadcaster that 13 people were detained overnight. He said police detained six opposition activists for allegedly plotting to stage a coup and stir unrest.",
      "By Saturday morning, people were assembling in various parts of the city as they marched toward the center. The entire downtown zone was flooded with people hours before the scheduled start of the gathering.",
      "Reflecting the tensions, police said they arrested a man who rammed his car into protesters in a Belgrade suburb, injuring three people. Hundreds of policemen were deployed inside and around government buildings and in front of the presidential palace.",
      "The Belgrade authorities canceled all public transport, including intercity railway and bus links, in an apparent effort to prevent people from attending the rally. The transport company said the cancellation was made \"for security reasons.\"",
      "Several reporters from neighboring Croatia as well as Slovenia have been turned back from Serbia's border under explanation that their presence at the rally \"represents a security risk.\"",
      "Vucic has rejected earlier proposals for a transitional government that would prepare an early election. Fueling fears of clashes, Vucic's supporters have been camping in central Belgrade in front of his headquarters. They include ex-members of a dreaded paramilitary unit involved in the assassination in 2003 of Serbia's first democratic Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, as well as soccer hooligans who are known for causing violence.",
      "Private N1 television on Saturday broadcast footage of dozens of young men with baseball caps going into the pro-Vucic camp.",
      "Vucic has been claiming that Western intelligence services were behind almost daily student-led protests with an aim to oust him from power. He has presented no evidence for the claims.",
      "Students have struck a chord among the citizens who are disillusioned with politicians and have lost faith in the state institutions. Previous student-led rallies in\u00a0other Serbian cities\u00a0have been peaceful while\u00a0drawing huge crowds.",
      "Earlier this month, at least three lawmakers were injured, one of them seriously, after chaotic scenes in Serbia's parliament, during which smoke bombs and flares were thrown, further fueling political tensions.",

      "Working from the Gemelli hospital, Francis has approved a three-year implementation and evaluation process for his reform project that aims to make the church a more welcoming and responsive place. The Vatican office for the synod, or gathering of bishops, released a timetable through 2028 to implement the reforms and said Francis had approved the calendar last week.",
      "The Vatican announced Friday that it would provide medical updates on the pope less frequently, in what it called a positive development. It also has ceased issuing brief morning advisories that the pope had slept well and was starting his day.",
      "Doctors this week said the 88-year-old pontiff was no longer in critical, life-threatening condition, but have continued to emphasize that his condition remained complex due to his age, lack of mobility and the loss of part of a lung as a young man.",

      "Francis was admitted to the hospital on Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis that made it difficult for him to speak. Doctors soon added a diagnosis of double pneumonia and a polymicrobial (bacterial, viral and fungal) infection.",
      "The first three weeks of his hospitalization were marked by a rollercoaster of setbacks, including respiratory crises, mild kidney failure and a severe coughing fit.",
      "But medical updates this week have focused on his continued physical and respiratory therapy, as well as the rotation from high-flow oxygen through nostril tubes during the day and a non-invasive ventilation mask at night to help ensure his rest. An X-ray this week confirmed that the infection was clearing.",
      "With little more to report, doctors on Friday canceled a planned medical update. The next is likely to be issued later Saturday. Doctors have not indicated how much longer Francis will be hospitalized.",
      "The pope this week participated in Lenten spiritual exercises from the hospital, which Vatican officials have said implied a lighter workload.",
      "The only public sign of life from the pope since his hospitalization was a recorded audio message thanking people for their prayers for his recovery in a weak and labored voice. It was played in St. Peter's Square for the faithful gathered for a nightly recitation of the rosary prayer.",
      "For the last four Sundays, the traditional blessing that the pope delivers from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square has been released as a text.",

      "Cancer is the leading disease-related cause of death among children and adolescents \u2014 most commonly leukemia, brain cancer and lymphoma.",

      "\"Cervical cancer in women from 30 to 44 is increasing,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"But also, this is a cancer that has the potential to be eradicated, if not eliminated, because of us knowing the understanding of HPV and its prevalence in the disease.\"",

      "Among cervical cancer patients, the death rate in Black women and Native American women is 50% and 70% higher than in white women.",
      "The five-year relative survival rate for cervical cancer in Black women is 58% compared to 67% of White women, the report found.",
      "Black women are 50% more likely to die from cervical cancer than White women, the report found. (iStock)",

      "Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, such as pancreatic, liver, colorectal and stomach cancers, are all considered highly deadly.",
      "The ACS report noted that colorectal diagnoses in men and women under the age of 65 have continued to increase.",

      "WOMAN, AGE 107, HAS A FEW BIG SECRETS OF LIVING A LONG, HAPPY LIFE",
      "\"Only about 20% of how long you live is dictated by your genes,\" he told Fox News Digital during an on-camera interview.",
      "\"The other 80%, we reason we might find among the longest-living populations.\" (See the video at the top of this article.)",
      "Dan Buettner, a Florida-based author, explorer and longevity researcher who first coined the term \"blue zone,\" embarked on a mission to find the secrets of longer-living areas. (Fox News)",
      "For the recent Netflix documentary \"Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones,\" Buettner visited five destinations \u2014 Okinawa, Japan; Sardinia, Italy; Ikaria, Greece; Nicoya, Costa Rica; and Loma Linda, California \u2014 to discover why these areas have the highest rates of living centenarians.",
      "\"We verified ages and found that in these areas, people were living about 10 years longer at middle age,\" he said.",
      "WWII VETERAN TURNS 100, REVEALS THE SECRETS OF A LONG, HEALTHY LIFE",
      "\"It\u2019s because they're not suffering from the diseases that are plaguing us, like type 2 diabetes. They\u2019re not dying of cardiovascular disease prematurely, or dementia, and they have 40% lower rates of cancer.\"",
      "Buettner and his team of demographers and researchers investigated the lifestyle and environmental characteristics in these five areas to determine what people may be doing differently.",
      "\u2018Healthy choice is easy\u2019",
      "\"The big insight we learned from blue zones is that in places where people are actually living longer, it's not because they try,\" Buettner said.",
      "\"In America, we tend to pursue health. We try to identify the right diet or exercise program or supplement regimen \u2014 but our brains are hardwired for novelty.\"",
      "Studies have shown that people who wake up and have a sense of purpose, whether it\u2019s a duty, a passion or an outlet, have greater health outcomes.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"We're constantly bombarded and bamboozled by new health news and people \u2014 and in blue zones, they never tried to live a long time.\"",
      "The reason for this longevity, according to Buettner, is that they live in environments where the healthy choice is easy.",
      "Nutrition and exercise",
      "One of the characteristics most blue zones share is their walkability, as people walk to work, school, friends\u2019 homes or gardens.",
      "\"They're getting 8,000 to 10,000 steps a day without thinking about it,\" Buettner said.",
      "Also, the cheapest and most convenient foods in blue zones are unprocessed.",
      "\"The big insight we learned from blue zones is that in places where people are actually living longer, it's not because they try.\"",
      "\"People in blue zones also eat healthier, as they consume primarily whole, unprocessed, plant-based foods,\" Buettner noted.",
      "The average American eats about 220 pounds of meat a year, which he believes is \"too much.\"",
      "\"I'm not advocating a no-meat diet, but I will tell you, people in blue zones eat about 20 pounds of meat a year, so about once a week as a celebratory food \u2014 and they are getting all the nutrients they need.\"",
      "One of the characteristics most blue zones share is their walkability, as people walk to work, school, friends\u2019 homes or gardens. (iStock)",
      "People also eat far more fiber in these areas, Buettner found.",
      "\"In blue zones, the cheapest and most accessible foods were full fiber,\" he said. \"They pull them out of their garden \u2026 whole grains or beans are the cornerstone of every longevity diet in the world.\"",
      "FRESH FOOD CONSUMPTION COULD HELP SOLVE DIET-RELATED ILLNESS: EXPERTS",
      "Fiber is often neglected in the American diet, Buettner said, with only about 5% to 10% of Americans getting enough.",
      "\"If you don't get enough fiber, it often goes to work at the mucous membrane and creates a certain permeability or leaky gut, and that causes all kinds of problems,\" he warned.",
      "Passion and purpose",
      "Studies have shown that people who wake up and have a sense of purpose, whether it\u2019s a duty, a passion or an outlet, have greater health outcomes.",
      "\"The blue zone purpose almost always includes an altruistic dimension,\" Buettner shared.",
      "\"There's almost always doing it for the next generation, or for the community or their church. There's always some philanthropic dimension to their purpose.\"",
      "Power of community",
      "\"In blue zones, we see very clearly that people are connecting face to face, probably five to six hours a day,\" Buettner said.",
      "People in these areas often live in extended families.",
      "\"People in blue zones eat healthier, as they consume primarily whole, unprocessed, plant-based foods.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Grandma never gets lonely, because she lives upstairs and helps with the garden,\" Buettner shared as an example. \"She helps cook food and she helps with childcare. And the kids do better because they're getting better attention. And it's this virtuous circle.\"",
      "In blue zones, people typically live in communities where they care about each other, he added.",
      "\"They're not spending nearly as many stress hormones arguing about things \u2014 and there's more time for laughter when you're not angry.\"",
      "Faith factor",
      "Data shows that people who regularly go to church live anywhere from four to 14 years longer than people who don't, Buettner noted.",
      "\"You can't measure faith, but you can measure religiosity,\" he said. \"Scientists simply ask people how often they show up at church, temple or mosque, and then they compare the longevity of the people who show up to those who don't show up at all.\"",
      "WARDING OFF DEMENTIA MEANS MORE READING, PRAYING AND LISTENING TO MUSIC: STUDY",
      "Part of this likely stems from the fact that churchgoers have a built-in community, he said, as loneliness has proven to be \"toxic.\"",
      "\"Religious people are also less likely to get involved in risky behaviors, and they often have a sense of purpose, which is their faith in God,\" Buettner added.",
      "Data shows that people who regularly go to church live anywhere from four to 14 years longer than people who don't, Buettner noted. (iStock)",
      "Those who worship on Sunday may also benefit from having one day a week where they \"stop everything.\"",
      "\"Being human is inherently stressful, and church gives us an hour or maybe a couple of hours where we fully take the focus off of our everyday life and troubles, and we get to sort of elevate to a higher plane and focus on a greater good,\" Buettner said.",

      "The act of prayer itself could also \"stack the deck\" in favor of longevity and health, he added.",
      "\"By the way, people who sing in the choir actually even live longer,\" Beuttner said. \"So if you want a little extra bump, join the church and sing in the choir.\"",
      "Sleep's role in health",
      "In his visits to blue zones, Buettner found that the residents are usually early to bed, early to rise.",
      "\"They have kind of two sleeps, where they'll go to bed shortly after sunset, and then get up at 3 or 4 a.m. and do some chores, and then go back to sleep until sunrise,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "Napping is also very common throughout all blue zones.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"And some good research shows that people who take a 20-minute nap five days a week have significantly lower rates of cardiovascular disease and about 30% lower rates of cardiovascular mortality,\" Buettner said. \"So napping is definitely part of the blue zone approach to longevity.\"",
      "\"Blue zones give us a very clear set of choices and environmental factors that would help us mindlessly get the years we deserve.\"",
      "Overall, he concluded, anyone can benefit from the lessons learned from the blue zones \u2014 primarily the importance of keeping people healthy in the first place.",
      "\"It\u2019s about shaping their environment so that healthier choices are easier or unavoidable and setting them up for success, so they're subconsciously making better decisions on a day-to-day basis for years or decades,\" Buettner said.",

      "Seheult, who recently appeared on Dr. Andrew Huberman\u2019s podcast \"Huberman Lab\" to discuss enhancing the immune system, noted that the light from the sun boosts our ability to regulate sleep, circadian rhythm and mood.",
      "BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM WITH THESE 8 SIMPLE STEPS",
      "\"So many people have seasonal affective disorder, and that's a manifestation of the lack of sunlight during winter,\" he said.",
      "Children with tuberculosis were put in an outdoor solarium for periods of rest in 1946. This sanitarium accommodated 200 patients ranging from infants to 20-year-olds. (Alamy)",
      "Sunlight's healing properties",
      "As far back as the 1920s, medical professionals leveraged light exposure to promote healing.",
      "Hospitals made use of sundecks, where patients could be transported for periods of time to take in the sunlight and fresh air, according to Seheult.",
      "JUST ONE NIGHT OF POOR SLEEP COULD HAVE THESE SURPRISING HEALTH EFFECTS",
      "But with the development of penicillin and other advancements in modern medicine, doctors relied less on holistic methods, he said.",
      "The sun's ultraviolet B (UV-B) light produces vitamin D in the body by causing a chemical reaction in the skin, Seheult noted.",
      "Sunlight can boost the body's ability to regulate sleep, circadian rhythm and mood. (iStock)",
      "Vitamin D is a known anti-inflammatory and antioxidant that supports immune health, muscle and brain function, according to Mayo Clinic.",
      "The sun also produces infrared light, which has been shown to relieve pain and inflammation.",
      "Just 15 to 20 minutes of sunlight exposure can help boost the immune system and potentially even ward off chronic disease, according to Seheult.",
      "Balancing risks and benefits",
      "The warnings from medical professionals of sunlight leading to skin cancer may have caused decreased exposure, the doctor suggested.",
      "\"Certainly, if we go outside in the sun for too long for a period of time without protection, we can get those types of skin damage,\" he said.",
      "\"There are some benefits to getting out into the sun, if it's done in moderation and if it's done smartly.\"",
      "But the doctor said some recent studies have found that the more time spent outside in sunlight, the less likely people are to die of all causes, including cancer.",

      "People who are fair-skinned or sensitive to sunlight can wear clothing, hats and other protective gear while still getting the benefits.",
      "\"Infrared light, because it is a long-wavelength, low-energy light, is able to penetrate not only through your skin and deep down into your body, but it's also able to penetrate very easily through clothes,\" Seheult said.",
      "Vitamin D from sunlight acts as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, helping to support immune health, muscle and brain function. (iStock)",

      "Sunlight is also still present on cloudy and rainy days and in urban areas, Seheult noted.",
      "WHY HIGHER UV INDEX NUMBERS ARE MORE DANGEROUS DURING SUN EXPOSURE",
      "\"The amount of light inside a building [is] usually no more than 100 lux,\" he said. \"When you go outside on a bright, sunny day, that's 100,000 lux. That's 1,000 times brighter.\"",
      "Although that exposure will be reduced on cloudy days or in the winter, it won't be \"nearly as low\" as indoor lighting, Sehuelt added.",
      "\"Kids are spending so much more time inside,\" Seheult said. \"Any sort of movement that we make toward going outside will be very beneficial.\" (iStock)",
      "To reap the benefits of infrared light without the risk, Seheult recommended going outside and covering up for about 30 minutes, even in the morning or evening while the sun is setting.",
      "\"These are times when there is an abundance of infrared light, far more than you would get inside your home,\" he said.",
      "\"All it takes is about 15 to 20 minutes of infrared light exposure \u2026 and we're seeing effects that last for days.\"",
      "For those who work in an office and spend their daylight hours inside, Seheult suggested taking short breaks and stepping outside into the light or a green space.",

      "Not answering unfamiliar calls is one of the best ways to avoid a potential scam. Most phone carriers now label robocalls as \"Spam Risk\" or something similar.

If you don\u2019t recognize the number, it\u2019s safest to ignore the call or text in case it's spam.",

With a data removal service, your personal information is removed from the web so data brokers and scammers never get their hands on your personal phone number, home address or email address.

      "This kind of fraud involves a scammer impersonating you to request a change of address with the United States Postal Service (USPS).",
      "Once they have your mail redirected to an address they control, they can go through it at their leisure, looking for mail they can steal and information they can use to perpetrate further scams, like taking out loans or credit cards in your name or using your identity to defraud others.",

      "A person with criminal intent gets your postal address and full name, something that\u2019s most easily done using a so-called people search site. People search sites, also known as people finder sites, are a kind of data broker that specializes in collecting, organizing and selling access to personal information.",
      "The scammer then mails a change-of-address request to the USPS, providing your name and a new address he has access to. The\u00a0online change-of-address form is generally more secure, requiring confirmation via a bank account. That\u2019s why scammers will almost always mail in the request.",
      "The form requires a signature, but this is unlikely to be verified when processing the request. So, the scammer will either find an image of your signature somewhere, steal a document that includes your signature or simply sign your name any which way.",
      "Now that they\u2019ve redirected your mail straight into their hands, the scammer just has to patiently wait for sensitive mail to arrive. They\u2019re on the lookout for anything they can use to steal from you or defraud you. Bank statements, tax documents, checks and even your household bills can be used to commit further acts of fraud and identity theft.",
      "One of the scariest things a scammer can do once he has enough of your personal information is to commit deed fraud, otherwise known as\u00a0home title theft. You\u2019re far from helpless, though. There are telltale signs that you can watch for to catch change-of-address scams early.",
      "The most obvious sign to watch for is a sudden and persistent drop in the amount of mail entering your mailbox. This only applies to mail addressed to you by name. Mail delivered to your address without an addressee, including mail addressed to \"homeowner\" or \"occupant,\" won\u2019t be affected by a change-of-address scam.",
      "The other major things to keep an eye on are your credit report, credit card statements and bank statements. You can request a free credit report from one of the three credit bureaus once per year.",

      "1. Invest in personal data removal services: Have your personal information removed from data broker databases, including people search sites. They\u2019re the first port of call for many scammers. Without these companies in the mix, scammers aren\u2019t likely to come across your address in the first place.",
      "A reputable personal information removal service can take your data down from hundreds of sites and keep it off by resending removal requests, even as data brokers try to add your information to their databases.",

      "2. Reduce the amount of sensitive mail in your mailbox: Start by switching to paperless options wherever available. This will dramatically reduce the amount of sensitive mail heading to your mailbox, leaving criminals with little value to steal. Check your mail daily, as soon as possible after it\u2019s delivered. Get someone to do this for you if you\u2019re away. Some redirection scams start with mail being stolen from your mailbox. Definitely avoid allowing your mailbox to overflow.",

      "3. Secure your mailbox: Consider upgrading to a\u00a0locked mailbox\u00a0to prevent mail theft. If you live in an area prone to mail theft, this simple step can stop criminals from intercepting sensitive documents before they even reach you.",
      "4. Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

Consider using a personal data removal service: Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure to smishing attacks by removing your sensitive information \u2014 like phone numbers, addresses and email details \u2014 from data broker websites. Scammers often rely on these publicly available databases to target victims with personalized phishing texts. These services aren\u2019t foolproof, but they can make it harder for cybercriminals to find and exploit your information.

      "AI dashcams are transforming road safety and fleet management through advanced computer vision technology. These smart devices, equipped with both inward- and outward-facing cameras, can detect a wide range of unsafe driving behaviors.",
      "The outward-facing cameras are capable of detecting rolling stops, unsafe lane changes and potential collisions, while the inward-facing cameras monitor driver drowsiness, distraction, seatbelt violations and smoking. The accuracy of these systems is impressive, with detection rates ranging from 88% to 99.5% and false positives as low as 0.5% to 12%.",

      "Privacy concerns",
      "Despite the safety benefits, the installation of AI dashcams raises significant privacy issues. Many truck drivers view their vehicles as second homes, especially long-haul drivers who spend extended periods on the road. The constant presence of cameras in their workspace raises concerns about perceived invasion of privacy in personal space, fear of constant surveillance and micromanagement and worries about data security and potential misuse of collected information.",
      "The use of outward-facing cameras also affects the privacy of other road users because they may record private citizens without consent. There is a risk of data breaches exposing personal information or location data and concerns about how footage might be used or shared. These concerns underscore the need for careful consideration of privacy rights when deploying such technology.",
      "To address some of these privacy concerns, Motive has implemented features such as Driver Privacy Mode, which allows drivers to disable the driver-facing camera while off duty. Additionally, Motive's AI dashcam system includes privacy controls and the option to activate Driver Privacy Mode for individual drivers, groups or entire fleets. Motive's AI dash cam also incorporates blurring technology to protect the privacy of individuals captured in the footage, further addressing concerns about recording private citizens without consent.",

In some jurisdictions, like California, the use of such cameras is not considered a violation of state laws. However, in Illinois, a lawsuit has been filed against Samsara, alleging violations of the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) for capturing and storing drivers' facial scans without proper consent.

Cameras should only record during specific events rather than continuously, and robust data security measures must be established to prevent breaches and misuse.",

      "AI dashcams represent a significant advancement in road safety technology, offering tangible benefits in reducing accidents and improving driver behavior. However, the implementation of these systems must be carefully balanced against privacy concerns. As the technology continues to evolve, it is crucial for companies, policymakers and drivers to work together to establish guidelines that protect individual privacy while harnessing the safety potential of AI dashcams.

      "What is CVE-2025-24201?",
      "This vulnerability resides in WebKit, the open-source browser engine that powers Safari, Mail, App Store and other apps on Apple devices. The flaw is an out-of-bounds write issue, which allows attackers to use maliciously crafted web content to bypass the Web Content sandbox, a key security layer that isolates web content from accessing sensitive system resources. Apple has acknowledged that\u00a0this vulnerability may have been exploited in highly advanced attacks targeting specific individuals using older versions of iOS before 17.2. These attacks are believed to involve well-funded threat actors, such as state-sponsored hackers or advanced cybercriminal groups.",
      "Why does this matter?",
      "Zero-day vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-24201 are particularly dangerous because they are exploited before developers can patch them.

      "Kurt the CyberGuy explains how to increase your security and privacy through Google Chrome on your devices when browsing the web.",
      "Chrome extensions are incredibly useful, whether you want to block ads, track the best deals or\u00a0enhance your browsing experience. They can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store, which functions like the Play Store but for extensions. However, extensions are easier to mimic and turn into malicious software compared to apps.",
      "As we just reported, over 3.2 million users were victimized by a security breach tied to\u00a016 malicious browser extensions, highlighting how attackers exploit tools that seem legitimate to spread malware or steal sensitive data.",
      "Now, security researchers have discovered a polymorphic attack that allows malicious Chrome extensions to transform into other browser extensions, including password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information.",
      "Keep reading to learn how this attack works and how to protect yourself from it.",

      "Chrome browser on smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the malicious polymorphic attack works",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0SquareX Labs have found a new attack that lets malicious Chrome extensions disguise themselves as legitimate ones, like password managers, crypto wallets and banking apps, to steal sensitive information. This \"polymorphic\" attack takes advantage of Chrome\u2019s extension system to trick users while staying under the radar.",
      "The attack starts with hackers uploading what looks like a harmless extension to the Chrome Web Store. It might even have real features, like an AI-powered marketing tool, to convince users to install and pin it to their browser.",
      "Once installed, the malicious extension scans the victim\u2019s browser for other extensions. It can do this in two ways. If it has permission to use the \"chrome.management\" API, it grabs a list of installed extensions directly. If not, it injects code into web pages to check for unique files or resources tied to certain extensions.",
      "If it finds a targeted extension, like 1Password, the malicious extension reports back to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker then tells it to impersonate the real extension by disabling it if permissions allow, changing its name and icon and displaying a fake login popup that looks just like the real thing.",
      "Fake extension page (SquareX)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Social engineering makes things worse",
      "To steal user credentials, the malicious extension triggers a fake \"Session Expired\" prompt when the victim tries to log in to a website. This tricks them into thinking they need to reenter their credentials for their password manager or banking app. When they do, the stolen data is sent straight to the attackers.",
      "After collecting the credentials, the extension switches back to its original form. It restores the legitimate extension, making everything look normal so the victim doesn\u2019t suspect anything. This shows just how dangerous malicious Chrome extensions can be and why stronger security measures are needed to protect users.",
      "We reached out to Google, and a spokesperson told CyberGuy,\u00a0\"We appreciate the work of the research community and we've received the report. We are constantly investing in ways to improve the security of the Chrome Web Store, and we take appropriate action when we learn of emerging threats.\"",

      "Here are five ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy.",
      "1.\u00a0Keep your browser and extensions up to date: Outdated software is a goldmine for cybercriminals. Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser; don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the extension and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5.\u00a0Invest in personal data removal services: If your personal data gets stolen by the extension, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Security researchers pointed out that the Chrome Web Store lacks protections against these types of attacks, such as blocking sudden changes to an extension\u2019s icon or HTML, or at least alerting users when such changes occur. The problem isn\u2019t limited to the Chrome Web Store. The Play Store also hosts malicious apps from time to time, affecting millions of users.

Stellantis, the parent company of brands like Dodge, Jeep and Chrysler, has just unveiled its STLA AutoDrive 1.0 system, which the company hopes will soon revolutionize the way we drive.",
      "STLA AutoDrive 1.0 system (Stellantis)",
      "The future of driving is here ... almost",
      "Stellantis has developed its cutting-edge Level 3 automated driving system. This innovative technology allows motorists to safely take their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel. Stellantis' STLA AutoDrive 1.0 system is designed to handle driving tasks autonomously at speeds of up to 37 mph in traffic and on highways under certain conditions.

      "However, there's a catch: Despite being fully developed and ready for deployment, Stellantis isn't launching these features just yet. The company cites a limited market for Level 3 autonomous driving as the reason for holding back, that they'll introduce the technology once the market becomes more receptive.",

      "Level 3 autonomy, often referred to as \"conditional automation,\" presents unique challenges. The system can only be activated under certain driving conditions, requiring specific environmental and traffic criteria to be met. Also, drivers must remain alert and prepared to take control at a moment's notice, which can be a difficult standard to maintain. Regulatory authorities also face challenges in setting and enforcing standards for this level of autonomy, as it requires a delicate balance between safety and technological innovation.",

      "1. Have strong antivirus software: Install and regularly update strong antivirus software on all your devices. Antivirus software can help detect and prevent infostealer malware infections. Be sure to perform regular scans to identify and remove potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware potentially accessing your private information is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Use virtual cards for online payments: Instead of using your actual bank card, generate virtual cards through your bank or a service like Privacy.com. These temporary cards limit exposure in case of a data breach.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Enable transaction alerts and spending limits:\u00a0Set up real-time alerts for transactions and daily spending limits on your cards. This way, you\u2019ll be notified immediately of any unauthorized activity.",
      "4. Never store card details in browsers:\u00a0Infostealers target autofill data in Chrome, Edge and Firefox. Always deny the pop-up that asks to \"save payment info\" and use a secure password manager instead. You may also want to take advantage of additional digital security measures such as\u00a0two-factor authentication. Newer types of authentication, such as Face ID and Touch ID, are slowly replacing passwords as a legitimate means to grant a person access to sensitive financial information.",
      "5. Be smart about passwords: Simply employing all the password rules won\u2019t prevent a breach, but since you don\u2019t know exactly what information thieves are looking for, it can\u2019t hurt. You should use strong passwords and change them frequently. I recommend using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Infostealers are a major threat to everyone online, and they are also quite common. However, since this malware often disguises itself as legitimate apps or uses social engineering tricks, it\u2019s easy to get fooled. Even the most cautious individuals can fall victim to a well-executed campaign. The best way to stay safe is to exercise caution when browsing online, downloading apps or making online transactions.

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "SpyLoan apps are everywhere and\u00a0yet people keep falling for them. They promise easy loans with flexible repayment, but what they actually do is steal your personal data, including contacts, sensitive images and files. The moment you take a loan, they start blackmailing you using your own data against you.",
      "Some of these apps do not even bother giving loans. They just grab your data and start the harassment. One such app has been making the rounds on the Play Store, racking up more than 100,000 downloads and putting thousands of Android users at risk of blackmail and extortion.",

      "A man scrolling on his smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How SpyLend malware spreads and leads to scams and extortion",
      "SpyLend spread by posing as a credible financial management tool, \"Finance Simplified,\" on the Google Play Store, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer. It attracted financially vulnerable individuals by offering fast loans with minimal documentation.",
      "The app surged from 50,000 to 100,000 downloads in a single week despite red flags in user reviews about harassment and blackmail.",
      "Once downloaded, the app requested excessive permissions far beyond what a typical financial app would need, including access to contacts, SMS messages, call logs, photos and location data. This allowed the malware to silently collect personal information from users' devices.",
      "The stolen data fueled a vicious cycle of scams and extortion. SpyLoan apps like SpyLend lure users with attractive loan terms, only to exploit their data for predatory lending practices. If users fail to meet repayment demands, the operators weaponize their information by harassing them, blackmailing them with threats of leaking private photos or contacting their friends and family, and creating a climate of fear and coercion.",
      "In some cases, the extortion escalated to public shaming or even deepfake creation using stolen images, amplifying the psychological and financial toll on victims.",
      "We reached out about this incident, and a Google spokesperson told us, \"The app has been removed from Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by\u00a0Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.\"",
      "However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all emerging malware from Android devices.",

      "SpyLend is a serious threat because it steals a huge amount of personal information. It digs into contact lists and call histories, reads text messages, including banking alerts, and grabs photos and videos from storage.",
      "It also collects device details like the model and OS version, tracks location in real time every three seconds, records past locations and IP addresses, and it even saves the last 20 copied texts from the clipboard. On top of that, it gathers financial data like loan histories and banking SMS messages.",
      "This stolen data is not just used for blackmail, as it is often sold to cybercriminals. By preying on people already struggling financially, SpyLend puts nearly every part of their digital lives at risk.",

      "1) Avoid suspicious loan apps: Stick to apps from well-known banks, credit unions or lenders registered with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or other regulatory bodies.",
      "2) Install strong antivirus software: Use strong antivirus protection on all your devices to detect and prevent malicious apps. This can also protect against phishing emails and ransomware scams. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious apps is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Download apps from reliable sources: It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. You might say I am contradicting myself, but Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "4) Review app permissions carefully: If an app asks for unnecessary permissions, like access to your contacts, call logs or storage, do not install it. A legitimate loan app should only require essential permissions related to financial transactions.",
      "5) Check reviews and red flags: Before installing any financial app, read user reviews carefully. If multiple people report harassment, blackmail or excessive permissions, avoid the app entirely.",
      "6) Report and uninstall suspicious apps: If you encounter a SpyLoan app, immediately\u00a0uninstall it and revoke its permissions. Report it to the Google Play Store, cybersecurity authorities and financial regulators to help prevent further victims.",
      "If you\u2019ve shared sensitive information, consider changing passwords and securing your accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The promise of quick and easy money can be tempting, especially during tough times, making it easy to fall for these scams. However, there are safer and more reliable ways to take loans. As a general rule, it is best to avoid borrowing money through online apps unless they are from well-known financial institutions. Google also needs to take responsibility for allowing SpyLoan apps on the Play Store, even when user reviews clearly indicate they are malicious.",

      "Another subsection of the same law \"expressly makes it an offense to engage in a conspiracy to commit or aid or abet the commission of\" harboring an illegal immigrant.",
      "Additionally, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 makes it an offense to \"scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\" Honest services fraud involves \"the misuse of an individual's position or authority for personal gain or advantage,\" according to Eisner Gorin LLP. \"It can be committed by public officials, corporate officers, and private individuals with fiduciary duties to another person or entity.\"",

      "EXCLUSIVE: After surviving nearly a year and a half deep underground, with barely enough air to breathe and no light, and sharing an 18-square-foot space with three other men, recently released hostage Tal Shoham shared with Fox News Digital his harrowing story of captivity at the hands of Hamas.",
      "Shoham was forcibly taken from Kibbutz Be\u2019eri on\u00a0October 7, 2023. His wife and children, ages four and eight, were also kidnapped that day, but he didn\u2019t know that when he was thrown into the trunk of a car and driven into Gaza by Hamas terrorists. He didn\u2019t even know whether his family was alive; hoping to save them, he surrendered to the terrorists just before they set fire to the house where his family was hiding.",
      "He would spend the eight-and-a-half months in an underground tunnel and another five months captive in five different houses deep inside Gaza, where his captors kept him shackled, starved him and deprived him of basic human comforts.",

      "But he gave himself a mission: He was determined not to lose his humanity. Even in moments when he feared that he was facing death, he tried to stay focused. \"I am not a victim. Even if this ends, I will end it with my head high, looking death in the eyes. They won\u2019t break me, and I will not surrender to self-pity. We are stronger than the other side,\" he said.",
      "It has been three weeks since he came home, and he is ready to speak. Kibbutz Be\u2019eri is just nine kilometers \u2014 about five-and-a-half miles \u2014\u00a0from Gaza, but that short distance is practically an ocean between what he describes as two worlds. \"Half-an-hour\u2019s drive, two separate worlds,\" he said. \"The first \u2014 unbelievably surreal, cruel beyond reason. And just 30 minutes away [on this side of the border], a world of sanity, logic, dignity and compassion.\"",
      "He remembers every detail of his 505 days in captivity. Tal wants to tell his story for the sake of the two fellow captives\u00a0who remain behind, starving, abused and at constant risk of death. \"Just as someone emerges from a womb alive, I emerged from the tunnel I was held in and was born again,\" he says. But the men he calls his \"brothers,\" Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal, are still held underground. \"I can\u2019t sleep at night knowing they are still there,\" he says.",

He said everyone entered the safe room, and as the sounds of gunfire drew closer, they tried to barricade themselves inside. But the terrorists pried open the window, and Tal feared they might toss in a grenade if the family did not surrender. On the same street, the terrorists set fire to every other home, burning the people inside alive.",
      "\"I went out and raised my hands,\" he said. \"A man with murder in his eyes led me onto the road and to a vehicle. I saw about 40 heavily armed terrorists. Some of them were filming me on their phones. I was in shock \u2014 there was an entire battalion of Hamas terrorists inside our kibbutz, bodies of people I knew who were murdered on the ground, and they are laughing, unafraid.\"",

      "The terrorists threw him into the trunk of a car and drove him across the border, into Gaza. There, a crowd gathered. \"Teenagers with sticks ran toward me, trying to beat me from all sides,\" he says. Taking him from the car, his captors pointed a rifle at him, ready, he believed, to execute him, and tried to force him to kneel. \"I said, \u2018I can\u2019t control whether you kill me or not,\u2019 and I raised my hands \u2014 but I refused to kneel. \u2018If you want to kill me, kill me, but you will not execute me like ISIS.\u2019\"",
      "He was then paraded through the streets in what he described as a \"victory march.\" \"They were shouting, \u2018Soldier! Pig! Zionist!\u2019 A mob gathered around, boys with wooden clubs trying to hit me. But I just waved and smiled. I didn\u2019t show fear. \u2018You\u2019ve captured me, but you won\u2019t see terror in my eyes.\u2019\"",
      "He was first taken to the home of a family, where he was held, alone and always shackled, for 34 days. Though he was allowed to periodically shower, the captivity was otherwise severe.",
      "His food was strictly rationed. \"For the first three days, I had pita bread. Then, they stopped giving me that,\" he says. \"Food supplies dwindled. Some days, I would receive three spoons of avocado and three dates, or half an orange from a tree in the yard.\"",
      "But the worst torment was not knowing whether his family was alive. \"I am 40 years old. Never in my life have I experienced suffering like this. The isolation, being alone with relentless thoughts \u2014that was worse than even extreme hunger.\"",
      "To endure, he made a heartbreaking decision. \"I had to accept that my family was dead,\" Tal says. \"I sat on the floor and imagined myself at their funeral. I stood in front of a grave \u2014 one large for my wife, and two small for my children \u2014 and I eulogized each of them. I thanked them for the time we had. I told them to move on. I sobbed but didn\u2019t let my captors see me cry. That was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done \u2014 burying my family in my mind.\"",

      "On the 34th day of his captivity, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal were brought to the home. The Hamas terrorists tortured them daily, hitting them, denying them food while eating in front of them. The hostages were allowed only about 300 calories a day \u2014 Shoham's weight dropped from 174 pounds to 110 pounds when he was released \u2014 and speaking was forbidden. \"We couldn\u2019t move from our beds or talk.

      "Then came some glimmer of hope. On the 50th day of his captivity, Tal received proof of life from his wife \u2014 a letter telling him she and the children had been held hostage but were being released. \"I read it, my hands shaking,\" he said. \"The most important thing had happened \u2014 my family was safe. I didn\u2019t need to be a father and husband protecting them anymore. Now, I could focus on my war, the one I knew how to fight, the one for survival.\"",

      "The Tunnel",
      "By June 2024, Tal, Guy and Evyatar were moved by an ambulance\u00a0that Hamas used\u00a0for discreetly transporting hostages, to an underground tunnel, where there already was another captive, Omer Wenkert. There were four mattresses on the floor and a hole in the ground for a toilet. The space was illuminated by a single, dim lightbulb. \"It took me weeks to stop feeling like the walls were closing in, to adapt to the oxygen deprivation,\" Tal says.",
      "They were given just 300 milliliters of water a day \u2014 a little more than 10 ounces. They could use it to either drink or wash their hands. Rice was all they had to eat. Months passed. They were beaten, monitored by cameras, randomly deprived of food and sleep. The guards were Hamas tunnel diggers \u2014 digging every day, even as war raged above. \"Hamas never stopped digging tunnels,\" Tal Says. \"Not for a single day.\"",
      "The conditions were so bad that both he and Evyatar developed severe infections. But it would be months before a doctor would come to see them. \"My leg turned blue, yellow, and purple with internal bleeding,\" He recalls. \"They gave us all blood thinners, fearing we might develop clots from prolonged immobility. Eventually, they realized the issue was malnutrition and provided us with vitamin supplements for seven days. It tasted like dog food, but it dramatically improved our condition.\"",

      "Guy Gilboa-Dalal is still being held in Gaza by Hamas terrorists. \u00a0 (Courtesy: Bring Them Home Now)",
      "But the abuse continued. A new guard arrived, even more violent than the previous ones. \"He made some of us kneel like dogs and beat us,\" he says. \"He would come in screaming that we were filthy Jews, hit us, and then 10 minutes later, he would smile and bring food.\"",
      "Then, what seemed like a miracle. Tal and Omer were named as part of the\u00a0hostage-release deal\u00a0in February. When he was led outside after many months underground, still blindfolded, he felt moisture on his face. \"Is it rain?\" he asked. \"No,\" his captors responded, \"\u2019It is dew.\u2019 And I realized, my name, Tal, is \u2018dew\u2019 in Hebrew. I felt the morning dew on my skin.\"",
      "There were humiliations to come before he was handed over to the Red Cross and returned to Israel: a procession on a stage in the heart of Rafah where he was forced to repeat Hamas propaganda.\u00a0 But he said he didn\u2019t care \u2014 he was going home. When he arrived in Israel, he was taken to the Re\u2019im base, where his wife, Adi, and their two children, Nave and Yahel, were waiting for him. \"It was a dream come true, yet it still felt like a dream,\" Tal says. \"It took a few days to fully grasp that it was real. It was hard to take in. The emotions flooded me, like I was floating above everything.\"",
      "And there was tragic news to absorb. Eleven members of Tal\u2019s family were kidnapped or murdered on October 7. Adi\u2019s father, Avshalom Haran, and two uncles, Lilach and Evyatar Kipnis, were killed. His mother-in-law, Shoshan Haran, was taken, along with two other relatives \u2014 Sharon Avigdori and her daughter, Noam Avigdori \u2014 who were later released in the first hostage deal. Two other relatives who had come from the United States to celebrate a birthday, 59-year-old Judith Raanan, and her 17-year-old daughter, Natalie, were also kidnapped from Kibbutz Nahal Oz.",

      "It's unclear when the transfer will happen, but it comes as talks are ongoing in Qatar to establish the next phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, the first phase of which ended on March 1. The bodies that will be released are of dual-national hostages, the Associated Press reported.",

      "\"Under the \"bridge\" proposal, Hamas would release living hostages in exchange for prisoners in accordance with previous formulas; the phase-one ceasefire would be extended to enable the resumption of significant humanitarian assistance; and the U.S. would work towards a durable solution to this intractable conflict during the extended ceasefire period,\" it continued. \"Through our Qatari and Egyptian partners, Hamas was told in no uncertain terms that this \"bridge\" would have to be implemented soon \u2013 and that dual U.S.-Israeli citizen Edan Alexander would have to be released immediately.",
      "\"Unfortunately, Hamas has chosen to respond by publicly claiming flexibility while privately making demands that are entirely impractical without a permanent ceasefire,\" the statement concluded. \"Hamas is making a very bad bet that time is on its side.\u00a0It is not.\"",
      "Netanayhu also said Friday that \"While Israel has accepted the Witkoff proposal, Hamas remains firm in its refusal and has not moved an inch\" and \"At the same time, it continues to employ manipulations and psychological warfare.\"",

      "Since then, the act has been used just three times: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "During World War II, with anti-foreigner fears sweeping the country, it was part of the legal rationale for mass internment in the U.S. of people of German, Italian and especially Japanese ancestry. An estimated 120,000 people with Japanese heritage, including those with U.S. citizenship, were incarcerated during the war.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward preemptively sued Trump late Friday in federal court in Washington, D.C., saying five Venezuelan men being held at an immigration detention center in Raymondville, Texas, were at \u201cimminent risk of removal\u201d under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg blocked their deportation, prompting an immediate appeal from the Justice Department.",
      "Almost simultaneously, the Trump administration agreed to pay El Salvador $6 million to imprison about 300 alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang for one year.",
      "The agreement with El Salvador followed discussions between that country\u2019s president, Nayib Bukele, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio about housing migrants in El Salvador\u2019s notorious prisons. Bukele\u2019s government has arrested more than 84,000 people, sometimes without due process, since 2022 in a crackdown on gang violence.",
      "ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said two flights Saturday may have carried people deported under Trump\u2019s proclamation, one to El Salvador and one possibly to Honduras. Boasberg said any such flights would have to be returned midair to the United States.",
      "For years, Trump and his allies have argued that America is facing an \u201cinvasion\u201d of people arriving illegally. Arrests on the U.S. border with Mexico topped 2 million a year for two straight years for the first time under President Joe Biden, with many released into the U.S. to pursue asylum. After hitting an all-time monthly high of 250,000 in December 2023, they plunged to less than 8,400 this February \u2014 the lowest levels since the 1960s.",
      "The act, Trump said in his inaugural address, would be a key tool in his immigration crackdown.",
      "\u201cBy invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil,\u201d he said. \u201cAs commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions.\u201d",
      "Critics say Trump is wrongly using the act to target non-state actors, not foreign governments.",
      "\u201cInvoking it in peacetime to bypass conventional immigration law would be a staggering abuse,\u201d the Brennan Center for Justice wrote, calling it \u201cat odds with centuries of legislative, presidential, and judicial practice.\u201d",
      "\u201cSummary detentions and deportations under the law conflict with contemporary understandings of equal protection and due process,\u201d the Brennan Center said.",
      "It\u2019s a new and untested argument. Trump has warned of the power of Latin American criminal gangs in the U.S., but only a tiny percentage of the people living illegally in the U.S. are criminals.",
      "Trump, in his wartime declaration on Saturday, said Tren de Aragua \u201cis perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion of predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\u201d He said the gang was engaged in \u201cirregular warfare\u201d against the United States at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Tren de Aragua originated in an infamously lawless prison in the central state of Aragua and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation\u2019s economy came undone last decade.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration designated Tren de Aragua and seven other Latin American crime organizations as \u201cforeign terrorist organizations,\u201d upping pressure on cartels operating in the U.S. and on anyone aiding them.",
      "Congress\u2019 research arm said in a report last month officials may use the foreign terrorist designations to argue the gang\u2019s activities in the U.S. amount to a limited invasion. \u201cThis theory appears to be unprecedented and has not been subject to judicial review,\u201d the Congressional Research Service said.",
      "The Venezuelan government has not typically taken its people back from the U.S., except on a few occasions. Over the past few weeks, about 350 people were deported to Venezuela, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba."

    "story": [
      "A majority of American voters say their sympathies lie more with Ukraine than Russia in the war between the two countries. At the same time, nearly half say they think President Donald Trump favors Russia, while most of the remainder believe he favors neither, according to the new national NBC News poll.",
      "Sixty-one percent of registered voters choose Ukraine when asked which of the two countries has their sympathies more, while just 2% say Russia. Another 35% say they are more sympathetic to neither side, while 2% are not sure.",
      "When asked where they believe Trump\u2019s sympathies are, 49% choose Russia, 40% say they think Trump favors neither side, and 8% choose Ukraine. Another 3% say they are not sure.",
      "Trump himself has publicly adopted the idea of not favoring either side, saying in February, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t align myself with both of them, you\u2019d never have a deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cI cannot recall a moment in history when American public opinion and voters\u2019 views of a president, as to which country they are more aligned with, have been more in conflict with each other,\u201d said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the survey along with GOP pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.",
      "Those whose personal sympathies lie more with Ukraine are more likely to be Democrats (88% of them chose Ukraine), independents (59%) and those with higher levels of education and income. But majorities across a handful of key demographic cross-sections \u2014 gender, age and race \u2014 all backed Ukraine, which was invaded by Russia in 2022. Hispanic voters are close to evenly divided between Ukraine and \u201cneither side.\u201d",
      "The key split is on political lines, with Republican and conservative-leaning voters more likely to say their sympathies lie with neither nation. Among Republicans, 57% say they favor neither side.",
      "But there are some notable splits within the GOP. For example, 53% of college-educated Republicans say their sympathies lie more with Ukraine, while 62% of Republicans without a college degree say their sympathies lie with neither country.",
      "On the question of how voters view Trump\u2019s positioning on Ukraine and Russia, majorities of Democrats, independents, suburban women, voters of color and voters across all age ranges (except ages 50-64) all believe Trump is more sympathetic to Russia.",
      "Among Republicans, 70% say Trump is not more sympathetic to either nation. Another 14% say Trump is more sympathetic to Russia, and 13% say he\u2019s more sympathetic to Ukraine.",
      "An early flashpoint in Trump's term",
      "Trump\u2019s handling of the war between Ukraine and Russia has been one of the major storylines of the early months of his second term. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly pledged he would end the war quickly upon taking office, but the situation has proved to be more complicated as efforts to reach a ceasefire continue. And it\u2019s clear America\u2019s posture toward the two sides has changed in the new administration.",
      "While then-President Joe Biden heaped praise on Ukraine for defending itself against Russia\u2019s incursion and repeatedly trumpeted new aid packages to the country, Trump has been more critical toward Ukraine, culminating in a heated confrontation between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in front of reporters in the Oval Office late last month.",
      "During the discussion, Trump declared that Zelenskyy was \u201cgambling with the lives of millions of people\u201d and had been \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to the U.S., while Vance argued the Ukrainian president hadn\u2019t been thankful enough for the help his country received. The episode scuttled plans to sign an agreement on mineral rights in Ukraine, and the Trump administration moved to pause intelligence sharing and aid to Ukraine in the days after the meeting, though both restarted last week after talks in Saudi Arabia.",
      "These developments come amid a broader philosophical shift among Republicans toward Trump\u2019s brand of \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy, while Democrats have pulled in the opposite direction.",
      "In the poll, voters heard two statements and picked which one better represents their thinking: The U.S. \u201cneed to focus here at home because America cannot be the world\u2019s policeman trying to solve all the problems and intervening in countries around the world,\u201d or \u201cAmerica has not been strong enough and has allowed Russia and China to\u00a0extend their influence and power throughout the world?\u201d",
      "In March 2022, Republicans were split: 47% chose focus here at home and 46% said America hasn\u2019t been strong enough on the international stage.",
      "Now, 61% want America to focus here at home while 33% say it hasn\u2019t been strong enough on the world stage. Democrats have moved in the opposite direction, from 49%-40% on focusing at home in 2022 to 57%-37% now that America hasn't been strong enough internationally.",
      "Overall, 51% of American voters prefer to focus here at home and 43% say that America hasn\u2019t been strong enough on the world stage. That\u2019s similar to three years ago, when 50% said focus at home and 41% said America hasn\u2019t been strong enough on the world stage.",
      "Republicans\u2019 evolution on U.S. foreign policy also includes increasingly negative views of NATO over the last few years. Trump has long criticized NATO countries for not spending enough to defend the alliance and said the U.S. has been unfairly shouldering the load.",
      "In 2022, 39% of Republicans had a positive view of the military alliance among the U.S., Canada and 30 European countries, while 22% had a negative view of it. Now, 19% view NATO positively and 46% view it negatively.",
      "Views on Ukraine, Russia and their leaders",
      "Fifty-five percent of registered voters disapprove of Trump\u2019s handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine, while 42% approve of it.",
      "When asked to evaluate the kind of change Trump is bringing to America\u2019s handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine, 41% of registered voters say Trump is bringing the right kind of change, 34% say he is bringing the wrong kind and 22% say he isn\u2019t bringing any change.",
      "And U.S. voters give Ukraine and Zelenskyy far higher positive marks than Russian President Vladimir Putin and his country. Forty-six percent of voters say they view Zelenskyy favorably and 32% view him negatively, close to the 41% who view Ukraine positively and 28% who view the country negatively.",
      "Just 6% view Russia positively and 68% view it negatively, while 3% view Putin positively and 84% view him negatively.",
      "While Democratic views on Zelenskyy and Ukraine have largely stayed similar since NBC News polling measured them in May 2022, Republicans have less positive views of Zelenskyy and Ukraine than they did previously. Negative views of Russia and Putin have also declined among Republicans, though positive views have not moved appreciably.",
      "A plurality of Republicans, 37%, viewed Ukraine negatively in November 2023, while 27% viewed the country positively. But the nation's lost support from the party since then, and now 46% view it negatively and 19% view it positively.",
      "\u201cThe president is creating an alignment with his own political base,\u201d said McInturff, the Republican pollster.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re watching a shift,\u201d McInturff continued. \u201cHe is dragging his own political base in terms of his current rhetoric and position.\u201d",
      "The NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from March 7-11 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."

And experts note that signals aren\u2019t red across the board: Job openings and household spending have held steady.",

      "Simple as it sounds, this committee typically takes months to officially declare a recession, as the factors that guide this decision can lag. While waiting, economists and other market watchers monitor several signals to gauge the health of the economy. Here are some of the numbers they consult, and what those figures now show:",
      "Consumer behavior",
      "Consumer spending represents approximately 70% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at the Harvard Kennedy School and one of the experts who called recessions for NBER, emphasized that consumer spending is one of the earliest and most direct indicators of economic downturn.",

      "So far, data from the Census Bureau shows sales numbers have remained steady.",
      "Consumer beliefs affect retail sales, said Menzie Chinn, a professor in the economics department at the University of Wisconsin. He notes that policy uncertainty can shake the economy.",
      "\u201cIf enough people and enough companies put things off because of uncertainty, you can tip the economy into recession,\u201d Chinn told NBC News. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen overnight, but it multiplies out over time.\u201d",
      "What consumers think of the economy gives another hint of where their behavior may be headed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all rooted in consumer confidence and business confidence,\u201d economist Dennis Hoffman said. \u201cAll of this is a recipe for confidence erosion \u2014 when confidence erodes, consumers seize up, business owners seize up, and they don\u2019t spend \u2014 they wait to see clarity.\u201d",
      "The University of Michigan\u2019s Survey of Consumers\u2019 Index of Consumer Sentiment showed a 10.5% decline in consumer confidence this month.",
      "\u201cConsumer confidence and how people feel about their future and the security of their future has a lot to do with how they act in terms of buying goods and services, investing in their businesses, hiring people to work in their businesses,\u201d Hoffman said.",
      "Other measures economists pay attention to include:",
      "The cost of borrowing",
      "There\u2019s a metric with a strong\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but not perfect \u2014\u00a0record of predicting the recessions of the past 50-plus years.",

      "Musk\u2019s connection to President Donald Trump and the emergence of the Department of Government Efficiency and its vast federal government job cuts were the tipping points for many progressives who owned the EV, which remains the top-selling electric car in the country.",
      "But Musk\u2019s influence within conservative politics has inspired a growing segment of people to ditch their Tesla, as they don\u2019t want to be connected to Musk and had tied his political actions to their ownership of vehicles produced by his company. It is a connection many have said they want to disengage by getting rid of their once-beloved groundbreaking cars.",
      "Tesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Teslas still make up 42% of electric vehicle sales in the U.S., even with recent dips.",

      "Ronnie and Tarita Bagley purchased a Tesla Y a year ago, thinking Musk was an environmental revolutionary. But one month into DOGE\u2019s work under the Trump administration, the Bagleys determined the fate of the EV in their garage.",
      "\u201cWe had to get rid of that car,\u201d Ronnie Bagley said. \u201cOur personal morals and values were at odds with what he represents, which is divisiveness, inequality and chaos.\u201d",

      "But Musk\u2019s movements concern her. More importantly, she\u2019s worried about being tied to him and his politics by driving a Tesla. The company\u2019s dealerships and the cars themselves have been targets of vandalism in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cI no longer wish to be associated with these people. I no longer want to be associated with Elon Musk,\u201d Paulus said. While she said she is \u201cvery happy with the car as a car,\u201d the actions of Tesla\u2019s CEO loom over the vehicle, so much so that Paulus said she needed to distance herself from the man as she drives the car.",
      "\u201cI got one of those magnets-slash-bumper stickers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt says: \u2018I bought the car before I knew how awful Elon Musk was.\u2019 I did that as a placeholder, because I have thought very much about selling the car.\u201d",
      "While Musk\u2019s public image has disappointed many, emergency room physician Jerel Chacko, said he is able to separate the CEO\u2019s actions from the vehicle.",
      "Chacko, of Holmdel, New Jersey, bought his Tesla Y in 2020. \u201cMusk wasn\u2019t the same type of public figure then as he is today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe perception back then was that he focused on the environment, sustainability and space travel.\u201d",
      "Chacko said \u201cit\u2019s a shame\u201d that more people can\u2019t follow suit. \u201cDoes he make outlandish statements? Yes,\u201d he said. But he bought the car because it\u2019s \u201ca good product. In my head, he and Tesla are two completely separate entities.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat was that?\u201d said Andrew Johnson, of Scottsdale, Arizona.

That was it for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even drive it, but I don\u2019t even want it anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a man who totally flipped. His car was, in my eyes, a sort of symbol of progress. Now, with him killing people\u2019s jobs \u2026 I can\u2019t. And I won\u2019t. I just don\u2019t feel right within myself.\u201d",

      "Neither could Tonya Parker of Atlanta. She bought a Tesla a year ago and included all the upgrades. \u201cIt was tricked out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut still, I never loved the car.\u201d",

And I understand. I came to the point where I did not want to be associated with him. I don\u2019t like his politics. I don\u2019t like anything about him. I don\u2019t like the person, Trump, that he co-chairs with. I wanted out.\u201d",
      "Paulus, the teacher, seems to want out, too, but she\u2019s in the process of purchasing a home and concerned about the resale value of her car. If she does move on from Tesla, she plans to get another EV.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sold on electric vehicles,\u201d she said.",
      "Tamaira Johnson, who lives near San Diego, is also sold on EVs, calling the Tesla\u2019s capabilities \u201cgenius.\u201d",
      "\u201cTesla is still running circles around its counterparts, performancewise, and with its infrastructure network of quick-charging capabilities,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "\u201cBut,\u201d Johnson added, \u201cdo I like representing an Elon Musk vehicle? Hell, no.\u201d",
      "She owns two Teslas and interchangeably rents out one for passive income via Turo and drives the other.",
      "The financial and business considerations are where it gets tricky for her. \u201cMany like me have to ride it out for a couple reasons,\u201d she explained, adding that the 2020 to 2023 models\u2019 value, in some cases, has depreciated, making a trade-in problematic. \u201cAnd with Elon\u2019s unfavorable popularity, the brand\u2019s value is subject to taking a larger dive,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo being stuck in a vehicle with upside-down value is what it leaves me with.\u201d",
      "Bagley and Parker said they were \u201cfortunate\u201d to get deals in which they sold their Teslas that allowed them to pay off their loans.",
      "Johnson, though, said she likes her cars and considers them reliable. \u201cIf it was just about Musk, you\u2019d see them abandoned on the side of the road all over the place,\u201d she said. \u201cBut until the competitors catch up with the technology, it\u2019s going to be tough. Tesla is still the one to beat in the EV industry, regardless of his politics.\u201d"

      "The 26-year-old starter will take the mound in his native Japan on Tuesday as part of the Major League Baseball season opener between the Dodgers and the Chicago Cubs. Though Yamamoto had an extensive career in the country prior to making the move to the U.S., the upcoming game marks his first appearance there in the signature royal blue.",
      "Yamamoto, who spoke to NBC News a day before hopping on the plane to Japan, said he\u2019s stoked for the homecoming.",
      "\u201cFamily, friends, they\u2019ve seen me play back in Japan a bunch of times with the full stadium and everything, but this is, of course, different,\u201d Yamamoto said through a translator.",
      "\u201cThis is almost like the first time for them to watch me play as a Dodger \u2026 and I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d",
      "Yamamoto, who faces off against Cubs starter Shota Imanaga, is coming off a successful spring training. His final start before the series resulted in an impressive seven strikeouts over five innings with one earned run. And he said he\u2019s feeling \u201cconfident\u201d for his first regular season game.",
      "The pitcher, a three-time MVP in the Nippon Professional Baseball Pacific League, said he\u2019s also looking forward to the game for sentimental reasons. The previous MLB season opener in Japan took place six years ago, coinciding with his early days in the sport.",
      "\u201cI was probably in the last year of high school, maybe the first year of being a pro, when the Mariners and the Athletics played in Japan,\u201d Yamamoto said of the series, during which iconic Japanese outfielder Ichiro Suzuki announced his retirement. \u201cI clearly remember watching the game. So for me to be able to play on the same kind of stage is very exciting.\u201d"

      "Consumer spending represents approximately 70% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.

      "The University of Michigan\u2019s Survey of Consumers\u2019 Index of Consumer Sentiment showed a 10.5% decline in consumer confidence this month.",

      "Many more people are now facing that headache.\u00a0Job cuts are on the rise, fueled in part by terminations\u00a0of federal workers.",
      "More than\u00a040 million Americans hold student loans, and the total outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the payments if you\u2019re out of work.",
      "A bad time to seek lower payments",
      "Federal student loan borrowers who are laid off from their jobs are usually able to sign up for an income-driven repayment plan and get a lower payment, or even a $0 bill, while they\u2019re unemployed.",
      "IDR plans limit borrowers\u2019 monthly payments to a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years.",
      "However, at the moment, borrowers are unable to access the applications for IDR plans.",
      "The disruption is due to a recent\u00a0U.S. appeals court\u00a0decision that blocked the Biden administration\u2019s new IDR plan, known as\u00a0SAVE, or Saving on a Valuable Education. It also blocked the loan forgiveness component under other IDR plans.",
      "As a result, borrowers may also face temporary challenges if they\u2019re already in an IDR plan and trying to go through the recertification process that allows them to get lower payments if their income has changed \u2014 or ceased. (Borrowers who were enrolled in SAVE remain in forbearance and do not have to make payments for now.)",
      "The lack of IDR plan application and recertification access is \u201chugely disruptive, especially in this particular moment when thousands of people are being laid off or fired,\u201d said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "It remains unclear when the IDR plan applications will become available again.",
      "While you may be stuck in your current repayment plan for the time being, you still have options, consumer advocates say.",
      "Unemployment deferment for student loans",
      "\u201cIf a borrower\u2019s employment is terminated, they may want to apply for\u00a0an unemployment deferment,\u201d said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.",
      "Borrowers may be eligible for this pause on their payments if they\u2019re receiving unemployment benefits or are looking for and unable to find full-time employment, among other requirements, Kantrowitz said.",
      "The reprieve can last for up to three years.",
      "Another option that allows you to suspend your student loan bills is\u00a0the economic hardship deferment. Additional, lesser-known deferments include the\u00a0graduate fellowship deferment, the\u00a0military service and post-active duty deferment, and the\u00a0cancer treatment deferment.",
      "Student loan borrowers may also be eligible for\u00a0a general forbearance.",
      "Whenever a borrower applies for a period of nonpayment, they should find out if interest will accrue on their debt in the meantime. If it does, they\u2019ll have a larger balance when their payments resume. Making payments during the deferment or forbearance to at least cover the loan interest on your debt can avoid that outcome, Kantrowitz said.",
      "Those with private student loans may find they have fewer options. However, experts recommend explaining to your lender that you\u2019ve lost your job and asking what relief might be available.",

      "Musk\u2019s connection to President Donald Trump and the emergence of the Department of Government Efficiency and its vast federal government job cuts were the tipping points for many progressives who owned the EV, which remains the top-selling electric car in the country.",
      "But Musk\u2019s influence within conservative politics has inspired a growing segment of people to ditch their Tesla, as they don\u2019t want to be connected to Musk and had tied his political actions to their ownership of vehicles produced by his company. It is a connection many have said they want to disengage by getting rid of their once-beloved groundbreaking cars.",

      "Teslas still make up 42% of electric vehicle sales in the U.S., even with recent dips.",

      "Ronnie and Tarita Bagley purchased a Tesla Y a year ago, thinking Musk was an environmental revolutionary. But one month into DOGE\u2019s work under the Trump administration, the Bagleys determined the fate of the EV in their garage.",
      "\u201cWe had to get rid of that car,\u201d Ronnie Bagley said. \u201cOur personal morals and values were at odds with what he represents, which is divisiveness, inequality and chaos.\u201d",
      "And so, two weeks ago, they traded in their Tesla for a Cadillac Lyric, an electric SUV.",
      "\u201cIt was refreshing to get that Tesla off our hands,\u201d he said.",
      "Megan Paulus, a preschool teacher in New Jersey, took over her husband\u2019s Tesla Y when he died in December 2021. Paulus said her husband was a \u201chuge Elon and Tesla fan. He even owned stock.\u201d",
      "She said they sold the stock to buy the car. As the owner now, Paulus said, \u201cI\u2019m very much connected to the story of how we got the car, that it was my husband\u2019s car.\u201d",
      "But Musk\u2019s movements concern her. More importantly, she\u2019s worried about being tied to him and his politics by driving a Tesla. The company\u2019s dealerships and the cars themselves have been targets of vandalism in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cI no longer wish to be associated with these people. I no longer want to be associated with Elon Musk,\u201d Paulus said. While she said she is \u201cvery happy with the car as a car,\u201d the actions of Tesla\u2019s CEO loom over the vehicle, so much so that Paulus said she needed to distance herself from the man as she drives the car.",
      "\u201cI got one of those magnets-slash-bumper stickers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt says: \u2018I bought the car before I knew how awful Elon Musk was.\u2019 I did that as a placeholder, because I have thought very much about selling the car.\u201d",
      "While Musk\u2019s public image has disappointed many, emergency room physician Jerel Chacko, said he is able to separate the CEO\u2019s actions from the vehicle.",
      "Chacko, of Holmdel, New Jersey, bought his Tesla Y in 2020. \u201cMusk wasn\u2019t the same type of public figure then as he is today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe perception back then was that he focused on the environment, sustainability and space travel.\u201d",
      "Chacko said \u201cit\u2019s a shame\u201d that more people can\u2019t follow suit. \u201cDoes he make outlandish statements? Yes,\u201d he said. But he bought the car because it\u2019s \u201ca good product. In my head, he and Tesla are two completely separate entities.\u201d",
      "It was disturbing to some Tesla owners that Trump acted as a car salesman last week, having a fleet of Musk\u2019s cars on display on the White House lawn.",
      "\u201cWhat was that?\u201d said Andrew Johnson, of Scottsdale, Arizona. He rents his Tesla out through the Turo car app. \u201cThat display made me sick, from the standpoint of why is the president of the United States pushing cars for the richest man in the world? That was it for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even drive it, but I don\u2019t even want it anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a man who totally flipped. His car was, in my eyes, a sort of symbol of progress. Now, with him killing people\u2019s jobs \u2026 I can\u2019t. And I won\u2019t. I just don\u2019t feel right within myself.\u201d",

      "Neither could Tonya Parker of Atlanta. She bought a Tesla a year ago and included all the upgrades. \u201cIt was tricked out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut still, I never loved the car.\u201d",
      "When Musk began campaigning for Trump and espousing his disdain for diversity, equity and inclusion, Parker\u2019s dislike of her car \u2014 and the man \u2014 intensified.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make a statement,\u201d she said after selling her Tesla a couple of weeks ago. \u201cSome of my friends were disappointed in me that I bought the Tesla in the first place. And I understand. I came to the point where I did not want to be associated with him. I don\u2019t like his politics. I don\u2019t like anything about him. I don\u2019t like the person, Trump, that he co-chairs with. I wanted out.\u201d",
      "Paulus, the teacher, seems to want out, too, but she\u2019s in the process of purchasing a home and concerned about the resale value of her car. If she does move on from Tesla, she plans to get another EV.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sold on electric vehicles,\u201d she said.",
      "Tamaira Johnson, who lives near San Diego, is also sold on EVs, calling the Tesla\u2019s capabilities \u201cgenius.\u201d",
      "\u201cTesla is still running circles around its counterparts, performancewise, and with its infrastructure network of quick-charging capabilities,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "\u201cBut,\u201d Johnson added, \u201cdo I like representing an Elon Musk vehicle? Hell, no.\u201d",
      "She owns two Teslas and interchangeably rents out one for passive income via Turo and drives the other.",
      "The financial and business considerations are where it gets tricky for her. \u201cMany like me have to ride it out for a couple reasons,\u201d she explained, adding that the 2020 to 2023 models\u2019 value, in some cases, has depreciated, making a trade-in problematic. \u201cAnd with Elon\u2019s unfavorable popularity, the brand\u2019s value is subject to taking a larger dive,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo being stuck in a vehicle with upside-down value is what it leaves me with.\u201d",
      "Bagley and Parker said they were \u201cfortunate\u201d to get deals in which they sold their Teslas that allowed them to pay off their loans.",
      "Johnson, though, said she likes her cars and considers them reliable. \u201cIf it was just about Musk, you\u2019d see them abandoned on the side of the road all over the place,\u201d she said. \u201cBut until the competitors catch up with the technology, it\u2019s going to be tough. Tesla is still the one to beat in the EV industry, regardless of his politics.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe\u2019re not quite there yet. These systems are very impressive at certain things. But there are other things they can\u2019t do yet, and we\u2019ve still got quite a lot of research work to go before that,\u201d Hassabis said.",
      "Hassabis isn\u2019t alone in suggesting that it\u2019ll take a while for AGI to appear. Last year, the CEO of Chinese tech giant\u00a0Baidu\u00a0Robin Li said he sees AGI is \u201cmore than 10 years away,\u201d pushing back on excitable predictions from some of his peers about this breakthrough taking place in a much shorter timeframe.",
      "Some time to go yet",
      "Hassabis\u2019 forecast pushes the timeline to reach AGI some way back compared to what his industry peers have been sketching out.",
      "Dario Amodei, CEO of AI startup Anthropic, told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January that he sees a form of AI that\u2019s \u201cbetter than almost all humans at almost all tasks\u201d emerging in the \u201cnext two or three years.\u201d",
      "Other tech leaders see AGI arriving even sooner. Cisco\u2019s Chief Product Officer Jeetu Patel thinks there\u2019s a chance we could see an example of AGI emerge as soon as this year. \u201cThere\u2019s three major phases\u201d to AI, Patel told CNBC in an interview at the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona earlier this month.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the basic AI that we\u2019re all experience right now. Then there is artificial general intelligence, where the cognitive capabilities meet those of humans. Then there\u2019s what they call superintelligence,\u201d Patel said.",
      "\u201cI think you will see meaningful evidence of AGI being in play in 2025. We\u2019re not talking about years away,\u201d he added. \u201cI think superintelligence is, at best, a few years out.\u201d",
      "Artificial super intelligence, or ASI, is expected to arrive after AGI and surpass human intelligence. However, \u201cno one really knows\u201d when such a breakthrough will happen, Hassabis said Monday.",
      "Last year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk predicted that AGI would likely be available by 2026, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said\u00a0such a system could be developed in the \u201creasonably close-ish future.\u201d",
      "What's needed to reach AGI?",
      "Hassabis said that the main challenge with achieving artificial general intelligence is getting today\u2019s AI systems to a point of understanding context from the real world.",
      "While it\u2019s been possible to develop systems that can break down problems and complete tasks autonomously in the realm of games \u2014 such as the\u00a0complex strategy board game Go\u00a0\u2014 bringing such a technology into the real world is proving harder.",
      "\u201cThe question is, how fast can we generalize the planning ideas and agentic kind of behaviors, planning and reasoning, and then generalize that over to working in the real world, on top of things like world models \u2014 models that are able to understand the world around us,\u201d Hassabis said.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I think we\u2019ve made good progress with the world models over the last couple of years,\u201d he added. \u201cSo now the question is, what\u2019s the best way to combine that with these planning algorithms?\u201d",
      "Hassabis and Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google\u2019s cloud computing division, said that so-called \u201cmulti-agent\u201d AI systems are a technological advancement that\u2019s gaining a lot of traction behind the scenes.",
      "Hassabis said lots of work is being done to get to this stage. One example he referred to is DeepMind\u2019s work getting AI agents to figure out how to play the popular strategy game \u201cStarcraft.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of work on that with things like Starcraft game in the past, where you have a society of agents, or a league of agents, and they could be competing, they could be cooperating,\u201d DeepMind\u2019s chief said.",
      "\u201cWhen you think about agent to agent communication, that\u2019s what we\u2019re also doing to allow an agent to express itself ... What are your skills? What kind of tools do you use?\u201d Kurian said.",
      "\u201cThose are all elements that you need to be able to ask an agent a question, and then once you have that interface, then other agents can communicate with it,\u201d he added.",

      "Swedish fintech firm\u00a0Klarna\u00a0will be the exclusive provider of buy now, pay later loans for\u00a0Walmart, taking a coveted partnership away from rival\u00a0Affirm, CNBC has learned.",
      "Klarna, which just\u00a0disclosed\u00a0its intention to go public in the U.S., will provide loans to Walmart customers in stores and online through the retailer\u2019s majority-owned fintech startup\u00a0OnePay, according to people with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified speaking about the partnership.",
      "OnePay, which\u00a0updated\u00a0its brand name from One this month, will handle the user experience via its app, while Klarna will make underwriting decisions for loans ranging from three months to 36 months in length, and with annual interest rates from 10% to 36%, said the people.",
      "The new product will be launched in the coming weeks and will be scaled to all Walmart channels by the holiday season, likely leaving it the retailer\u2019s only buy now, pay later option by year-end.",
      "The move heightens the rivalry between Affirm and Klarna, two of the world\u2019s biggest BNPL players, just as Klarna is set to go public. Although both companies claim to offer a better alternative for borrowers than credit cards, Affirm is more U.S.-centric and has been public since 2021, while Klarna\u2019s network is more global.",
      "Shares of Affirm fell 13% in morning trading Monday.",
      "Deal sweetener",
      "The deal comes at an opportune time for Klarna as it readies one of the year\u2019s most highly anticipated initial public offerings. After a dearth of big tech listings in the U.S. since 2021, the Klarna IPO will be a key test for the industry. The firm\u2019s private market valuation has been a roller coaster: It soared to\u00a0$46 billion\u00a0in 2021, then\u00a0crashed\u00a0by 85% the next year amid the broader decline of high-flying fintech firms.",
      "CEO\u00a0Sebastian Siemiatkowski\u00a0has worked to improve Klarna\u2019s prospects, including touting its use of\u00a0generative artificial intelligence\u00a0to slash expenses and headcount. The company returned to profitability in 2023, and its valuation is now roughly $15 billion, according to analysts, nearly matching the public market value of Affirm.",
      "The OnePay deal is a \u201cgame changer\u201d for Klarna, Siemiatkowski said in a\u00a0release\u00a0confirming the pact.",
      "\u201cMillions of people in the U.S. shop at Walmart every day \u2014 and now they can shop smarter with OnePay installment loans powered by Klarna,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to helping redefine checkout at the world\u2019s largest retailer \u2014 both online and in stores.\u201d",
      "As part of the deal, OnePay can take a position in Klarna. In its\u00a0F-1 filing, Klarna said it entered into a \u201ccommercial agreement with a global partner\u201d in which it is giving warrants to purchase more than 15 million shares for an average price of $34 each. OnePay is the partner, people with knowledge of the deal confirmed.",
      "For Affirm, the move is likely to be seen as a blow at a time when tech stocks are particularly vulnerable. Run by CEO\u00a0Max Levchin, a\u00a0PayPal\u00a0co-founder, the company\u2019s stock has surged and fallen since its 2021 IPO. The lender\u2019s shares have dipped 18% this year before Monday.",
      "Affirm executives frequently mention their partnerships with big merchants as a key driver of purchase volumes and customer acquisition. In November, Affirm\u2019s chief revenue officer,\u00a0Wayne Pommen, referred to Walmart and other tie-ups including those with\u00a0Amazon,\u00a0Shopify\u00a0and\u00a0Target\u00a0as its \u201ccrown jewel partnerships.\u201d",
      "An Affirm spokesman had this statement: \u201cWe win business when merchants want superior performance and maximum value, given our underwriting and capital markets advantages. We will continue our long-term strategy of competing on our products and entering into sustainable partnerships.\u201d",
      "Everything app",
      "The deal is no less consequential to Walmart\u2019s OnePay, which has surged to a\u00a0$2.5 billion\u00a0pre-money valuation just two years after rolling out a suite of products to its customers.",
      "The startup now has more than 3 million active customers and is generating revenue at an annual run rate of more than $200 million.",
      "As part of its push to penetrate areas adjacent to its core business, Walmart executives have touted OnePay\u2019s potential to become a one-stop shop for Americans underserved by traditional banks.",
      "Walmart is the world\u2019s largest retailer and says it has 255 million weekly customers, giving the startup \u2014 which is a separate company backed by Walmart and\u00a0Ribbit Capital\u00a0\u2014 a key advantage in acquiring new customers.",
      "Last year, the Walmart-backed fintech\u00a0began offering\u00a0BNPL loans in the aisles and on checkout pages of Walmart, CNBC reported at the time. That led to speculation that it would ultimately displace Affirm, which had been the exclusive provider for BNPL loans for Walmart since 2019.",
      "OnePay\u2019s move to partner with Klarna rather than going it alone shows the company saw an advantage in going with a seasoned, at-scale provider versus using its own solution.",
      "OnePay\u2019s push into consumer lending is expected to accelerate its conversion of Walmart customers into fintech app users. Cash-strapped consumers are increasingly relying on loans to meet their needs, and the installment loan is seen as a wedge to also offer users the banking, savings and payments features that OnePay has already built.",
      "Americans held a record\u00a0$1.21 trillion\u00a0in credit card debt in the fourth quarter of last\u00a0year, about $441 billion higher than balances in 2021, according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York data.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never been more important to give consumers simple and convenient ways to access fair credit at the point of sale,\u201d said OnePay CEO Omer Ismail. \u201cThat\u2019s especially true for the millions of people who turn to Walmart every week for everything.\u201d",
      "Next up is likely a OnePay-branded credit card offered with the help of a new banking partner after Walmart successfully\u00a0exited\u00a0its partnership with\u00a0Capital One.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to going down this new path where not only can they provide installment credit ... but also revolving credit,\u201d Walmart CFO\u00a0John David Rainey\u00a0told investors in June.",

    "summary": "Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore originally planned to stay just a week on the space station, but problems with their Boeing vehicle forced them to remain there.",
    "story": [
      "NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are finally coming home.",
      "The astronauts, who had planned to visit the International Space Station for just a week but have been there more than nine months, are set to depart Tuesday.",
      "Their journey back to Earth will close out an unusual and closely watched chapter in spaceflight history. Williams and Wilmore became household names after launching on the first crewed test flight of Boeing\u2019s Starliner capsule in June. But they encountered problems with the vehicle\u2019s thrusters while docking to the space station, which eventually led NASA to bring the Starliner back to Earth without anyone on board.",
      "That forced Williams and Wilmore to remain in orbit for far more time than planned. But at long last, they are scheduled to depart the space station on Tuesday at 1:05 a.m. ET aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule. The astronauts should then splash down off the coast of Florida at 5:57 p.m. ET.",
      "Alongside them will be NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, who are wrapping up a roughly six-month mission at the space station.",
      "The particular timing of the group\u2019s return flight on Tuesday was decided \u201cbased on favorable conditions forecasted for the evening of Tuesday, March 18,\u201d NASA said in a statement. (The agency previously targeted Wednesday for the journey.)",
      "The SpaceX vehicle that the four will share arrived at the space station in September, carrying Hague and Gorbunov, along with two empty seats to accommodate their colleagues. Williams and Wilmore then stuck around so that Hague and Gorbunov could complete their mission.",
      "That is now ending as a new set of astronauts takes over. On Sunday, Williams, Wilmore, Hague and Gorbunov welcomed the incoming crew \u2014 NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 to the orbiting outpost.",
      "In that sense, despite the attention their extraordinary circumstances have garnered, Williams and Wilmore were not \u201cstranded\u201d in space. Both have repeatedly challenged that characterization, maintaining that they have enjoyed their extended time living and working in low-Earth orbit.",
      "\u201cEvery day is interesting because we\u2019re up in space and it\u2019s a lot of fun,\u201d Williams said in a news briefing earlier this month, but added that the waiting and uncertainty was likely hard for family members on the ground.",
      "Nonetheless, their unexpectedly long stay in orbit has become a political talking point for SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Both have made unsubstantiated claims that the Biden administration held up the flight back to Earth for political reasons.",
      "\u201cThis began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned Astronauts, because the Biden Administration was incapable of doing so,\u201d Trump wrote Monday in a post on Truth Social. \u201cThey shamefully forgot about the Astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them.\u201d",
      "However, NASA\u2019s plan to use a SpaceX vehicle for the return journey has remained consistent since it was announced in\u00a0August, under the Biden administration.",
      "After Musk made a similar claim to Trump's\u00a0in a joint interview on Fox News last month, a\u00a0public back-and-forth erupted\u00a0on X between\u00a0Musk and\u00a0several current and retired astronauts. European astronaut Andreas Mogensen called Musk\u2019s comments a \u201clie,\u201d and things got ugly after Musk fired back, calling Mogensen an \u201cidiot\u201d and a derogatory term. Retired astronauts Scott Kelly, Mark Kelly and Chris Hadfield also waded into the online dispute.",
      "In the recent news briefing, Williams and Wilmore carefully skirted the politics, with Wilmore saying they had \u201crespect and admiration\u201d for the president and \u201cthe utmost respect for Mr. Musk.\u201d",
      "But in response to a question about recent comments Musk made suggesting that the U.S. should abandon the International Space Station in two years rather than keep it operating through 2030 as planned, Williams voiced her disagreement.",
      "\u201cI would say we\u2019re actually in our prime right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\u201d"

      "\u201cYou sell that call, you get the premium for that, and then you can pay that out as income. As we look at this space, that\u2019s one category that\u2019s been evergreen for investors. A lot of investors are looking for income on a consistent basis,\u201d Lake said.",

    "summary": "A federal judge ordered the release Prince Harry's immigration records, which could reveal if he disclosed prior drug use before coming to America.",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security has until the end of Tuesday to comply with a federal judge's order and release Prince Harry's immigration records, which could reveal if he disclosed prior drug use before coming to America, according to court records.",
      "U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols had previously ruled in favor of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that's been seeking the records for several years under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).",
      "Drug use itself isn't a disqualifying factor for a visa, but lying about it could be a greater challenge. In theory, if the younger brother of future U.K. king Prince William didn't disclose drug use on his visa application, that could be grounds to have him removed.",
      "In his 2023 memoir \"Spare,\"  Harry admitted to using cocaine, among other drugs.",
      "\u201cOf course I had been taking cocaine at that time. At someone\u2019s house, during a hunting weekend, I was offered a line, and since then I had consumed some more,\u201d he wrote in a Spanish language version of his book.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t very fun, and it didn\u2019t make me feel especially happy as seemed to happen to others, but it did make me feel different, and that was my main objective. To feel. To be different.\u201d",
      "The federal government has fought efforts to air Harry's paperwork, saying the \u201crequest does not meet the public interest standard set forth\" in FOIA guidelines, according to defense lawyers.",
      "However, Judge Nichols has ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and on Saturday said he'd reviewed proposed redactions from the government.",
      "\"Those redactions appearing appropriate, the government is ordered to lodge on the docket the redacted versions of those documents no later than March 18, 2025,\" Nichols ruled.",
      "Administration officials could not be immediately reached for comment on Monday. Representatives for Prince Harry declined comment.",
      "Prince Harry, who is also in court papers called \"his Royal Highness Prince Henry Charles Albert David George of Wales, the Duke of Sussex, the Earl of Dumbarton, and Baron Kilkeel K.C.V.O.,\"  stepped away from the royal family in early 2020.",
      "He, his wife Megan Markle and their children, Archie and Lilibet, live near Santa Barbara.",
      "President Donald Trump told the New York Post in February that he won't seek to have Prince Harry removed from the country.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d Trump said before taking aim at Markle, who has been critical of the president. \u201cI\u2019ll leave him alone. He\u2019s got enough problems with his wife. She\u2019s terrible.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A professor at Brown University\u2019s medical school, who was sent back to Lebanon last week despite having a valid visa, allegedly told customs agents that she had attended the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah, the Department of Homeland Security said Monday in a statement.",
      "Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a 34-year-old Lebanese citizen with a valid H-1B visa, returned to the U.S. after visiting her family, according to the court petition filed by her cousin. She was detained Thursday at Boston Logan International Airport, where she was allegedly held for 36 hours \u201cwithout any justification,\u201d during which time she was unable to speak to legal counsel or contact others, the petition states.",
      "Homeland Security alleged Monday that Alawieh told agents during her detainment that she had traveled to Beirut, Lebanon, last month to attend Nasrallah's funeral.",
      "\"A visa is a privilege not a right \u2014 glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be denied,\" the agency said.",
      "NBC News was unable to reach an attorney for Alawieh for comment on Monday.",
      "Tens of thousands of people attended the funeral, which was held at the 48,000-seat Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium in Beirut.",
      "Nasrallah led Hezbollah, a Lebanese militia and political party, for decades before he was killed by an Israeli strike last year. He was also an Islamic scholar who was seen as a defender of Shia Muslims within Lebanon.",
      "Hezbollah formed in the 1980s after Israel occupied southern Lebanon to oppose Israel's presence in the country and is a U.S.-designated terror group. Nasrallah and Hezbollah's close ties to Iran divided Lebanon, and some critics say its support for Hamas in Gaza helped plunge the country into a war with Israel that it could not afford last year.",
      "The petition states that after her airport detainment, Alawieh was sent back to Lebanon \u2014 despite an order from the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts that she should not be removed from the state without 48 hours' notice and a reason to \"give the Court time to consider the matter.\"",
      "Customs and Border Protection denied\u00a0accusations that it\u00a0\"willfully\" disobeyed the court order, according to court records. Federal prosecutors in the case said the CBP officers did not receive notice of the order until Alawieh had already departed.",
      "Prosecutors said that at no time \"would CBP not take a court order seriously or fail to abide by a court\u2019s order.\"",
      "A hearing had been set to take place Monday in Boston, but the case was delayed another week. According to court records, Alawieh also retained new legal counsel, who on Sunday requested time to catch up on the case.",
      "Alawieh's current attorney and her former attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.",
      "According to the initial petition, Alawieh has been in the U.S. since 2018. She obtained her medical degree from the American University of Beirut in 2015 and completed her residency at the university's medical center.",
      "Alawieh arrived on a J-1 visa and completed programs at Ohio State University, the University of Washington and the Yale Waterbury Internal Medicine Program. Through her work as an assistant professor at Brown, she obtained an HI-B visa. She is a kidney and transplant specialist.",
      "Dr. George Bayliss, who worked closely with Alawieh at Brown\u2019s division of nephrology in East Providence, Rhode Island, said he and other colleagues are outraged and saddened. Bayliss, an associate professor who specializes in kidney disease and hypertension with Alawieh, told NBC News that she joined last July.",
      "He described Alawieh as an \u201cimportant part\u201d of their group, and noted that he and other colleagues \"want her back.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m upset. She\u2019s a talented physician. She\u2019s capable. She\u2019s thoughtful. I know her as a thoughtful, caring physician,\" he said. \"We see her and work with her daily. I don\u2019t have any reason to think that she is a different person otherwise.\u201d",
      "Bayliss said a patient called Monday to schedule an appointment with Alawieh. After learning she was not available, he said the patient did not want to see another doctor.",
      "\"She takes good care of her patients,\" he said.",
      "He said his interactions with Alawieh were only in the hospital, but he has found her to be \"unfailingly polite and courteous.\"",
      "\"She\u2019s a very nice person,\u201d he said.",
      "Rep. Gabe Amo, D-R.I., said his office has been working since Friday to \"assess the facts surrounding Dr. Alawieh, including the apparent violation of a federal judge\u2019s order.\"",
      "\"I remain committed to getting answers from @DHSgov to provide Dr. Alawieh, her family, her colleagues, and our community the clarity we all deserve,\" Amo wrote Sunday in a post on X.",
      "The Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations, or CAIR, called on the Trump administration to readmit Alawieh immediately.",
      "\"This blatant disregard for due process raises serious concerns about immigration enforcement targeting Muslim and international scholars,\" the organization said in a post on X.",

      "MEXICO CITY \u2014 The videos roll through TikTok in 30-second flashes.",
      "Migrants trek in camouflage through dry desert terrain. Dune buggies roar up to the United States-Mexico border barrier. Families with young children pass through gaps in the wall. Helicopters, planes, yachts, tunnels and jet skis stand by for potential customers.",
      "Laced with emojis, the videos posted by smugglers offer a simple promise: If you don\u2019t have a visa in the U.S., trust us. We\u2019ll get you over safely.",
      "At a time when legal pathways to the U.S. have been slashed and criminal groups are raking in money from migrant smuggling, social media apps like TikTok have become an essential tool for smugglers and migrants alike. The videos \u2014 taken to cartoonish extremes \u2014 offer a rare look inside a long-elusive industry and the narratives used by trafficking networks to fuel migration north.",
      "\u201cWith God\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to continue working to fulfill the dreams of foreigners. Safe travels without robbing our people,\u201d wrote one enterprising smuggler.",
      "As President Donald Trump begins to ramp up a crackdown at the border and migration levels to the U.S. dip, smugglers say new technologies allow networks to be more agile in the face of challenges, and expand their reach to new customers \u2014 a far cry from the old days when each village had its trusted smuggler.",
      "\u201cIn this line of work, you have to switch tactics,\u201d said a woman named Soary, part of a smuggling network bringing migrants from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso, Texas, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that her last name would not be shared out of concern that authorities would track her down. \u201cTikTok goes all over the world.\u201d",
      "Soary, 24, began working in smuggling when she was 19, living in El Paso, where she was approached by a friend about a job. She would use her truck to pick up migrants who had recently jumped the border. Despite the risks involved with working with trafficking organizations, she said it earned her more as a single mother than her previous job putting in hair extensions.",
      "As she gained more contacts on both sides of the border, she began connecting people from across the Americas with a network of smugglers to sneak them across borders and eventually into the U.S.",
      "Like many smugglers, she would take videos of migrants speaking to the camera after crossing the border to send over WhatsApp as evidence to loved ones that her clients had gotten to their destination safely. Now she posts those clips to TikTok.",
      "TikTok says the platform strictly prohibits human smuggling and reports such content to law enforcement.",
      "The use of social media to facilitate migration took off around 2017 and 2018, when activists built massive WhatsApp groups to coordinate the first major migrant caravans traveling from Central America to the U.S., according to Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University focused on the migrant smuggling industry.",
      "Later, smugglers began to infiltrate those chats and use the choice social media app of the day, expanding to Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Migrants, too, began to document their often perilous voyages north, posting videos trekking through the jungles of the Darien Gap dividing Colombia and Panama, and after being released by extorting cartels.",
      "A 2023 study by the United Nations reported that 64% of the migrants they interviewed had access to a smart phone and the internet during their migration to the U.S.",
      "Around the time of the study\u2019s release, as use of the app began to soar, that Correa-Cabrera said she began to see smuggling ads skyrocket on TikTok.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a marketing strategy,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said. \u201cEveryone was on TikTok, particularly after the pandemic, and then it began to multiply.\u201d",
      "Last year, Soary, the smuggler, said she began to publish videos of migrants and families in the U.S. with their faces covered and photos of the U.S.-Mexico border with messages like: \u201cWe\u2019ll pass you through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, no matter where you are. Fence jumping, treks and by tunnel. Adults, children and the elderly.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of videos examined by the AP feature thick wads of cash, people crossing through the border fence by night, helicopters and airplanes supposedly used by coyotes, smugglers cutting open cacti in the desert for migrants to drink from and even crops of lettuce with text reading \u201cThe American fields are ready!\u201d",
      "The videos are often layered over heavy northern Mexican music with lyrics waxing romantically about being traffickers. Videos are published by accounts with names alluding to \u201csafe crossing,\u201d \u201cUSA destinations,\u201d \u201cfulfilling dreams\u201d or \u201cpolleros,\u201d as smugglers are often called.",
      "Narratives shift based on the political environment and immigration policies in the U.S. During the Biden administration, posts would advertise getting migrants access to asylum applications through the administration\u2019s CBP One app, which Trump ended.",
      "Amid Trump\u2019s crackdown, posts have shifted to dispelling fears that migrants will be captured, promising American authorities have been paid off. Smugglers openly taunt U.S. authorities: one shows himself smoking what appears to be marijuana right in front of the border wall; another even takes a jab at Trump, referring to the president as a \u201chigh-strung gringo.\u201d",
      "Comments are dotted with emojis of flags and baby chickens, a symbol meaning migrant among smugglers, and other users asking for prices and more information.",
      "Cristina, who migrated because she struggled make ends meet in the Mexican state of Zacatecas, was among those scrolling in December after the person she had hired to smuggle her to the U.S. abandoned her and her partner in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.",
      "\u201cIn a moment of desperation, I started searching on TikTok and, well, with the algorithm videos began to pop up,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me a half an hour\u201d to find a smuggler.",
      "After connecting, smugglers and migrants often negotiate on encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, doing a careful dance to gain each other\u2019s trust. Cristina, now living in Phoenix, said she decided to trust Soary because she was a woman and posted videos of families, something the smuggler admitted was a tactic to gain migrants\u2019 trust.",
      "Smugglers, migrants and authorities warn that such videos have been used to scam migrants or lure them into traps at a time when cartels are increasingly using kidnapping and extortion as a means to rake in more money.",
      "One smuggler, who asked to only be identified by his TikTok name \u201cThe Corporation\u201d due to fear of authorities tracking him down said other accounts would steal his migrant smuggling network\u2019s videos of customers saying to camera they arrived safely in the U.S.",
      "\u201cAnd there\u2019s not much we can do legally. I mean, it\u2019s not like we can report them,\u201d he said with a laugh.",
      "In other cases, migrants say that they were forced by traffickers to take the videos even if they haven\u2019t arrived safely to their destinations.",
      "The illicit advertisements have fueled concern among international authorities like the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration, which warned in a report about the use of the technology that \u201cnetworks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and evasive, thus challenging government authorities to address new, non-traditional forms of this crime.\u201d",
      "In February, a Mexican prosecutor also confirmed to the AP that they were investigating a network of accounts advertising crossings through a tunnel running under the border fence between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. But investigators would not provide more details.",
      "In the meantime, hundreds of accounts post videos of trucks crossing border, of stacks of cash and migrants, faces covered with emojis, promising they made it safely across the border.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to cross and we\u2019re not scared,\u201d one wrote."

      "Is 'Adolescence' based on a true story?",
      "Stephen Graham, the show's co-creator who also played Eddie Miller, told Netflix's press site Tudum that a series of recent stabbings by boys inspired the tale.",
      "\u201cThere was an incident where a young boy (allegedly) stabbed a girl,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIt shocked me. I was thinking, \u2018What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happening in society where a boy stabs a girl to death? What\u2019s the inciting incident here?\u2019 And then it happened again, and it happened again, and it happened again. I really just wanted to shine a light on it, and ask, \u2018Why is this happening today? What\u2019s going on? How have we come to this?\u2019\"",
      "Fifteen-year-old Elianne Andam, for example, was stabbed to death in London in September by Hassan Sentamu, then 17. Sentamu was sentenced to a minimum of 23 years in prison per a March court sentencing.",
      "Graham said with the show, of his goals was to answer the question, \"What is happening to our young men these days and what are the pressures they face from their peers, from the internet and from social media?\"",
      "\"And the pressures that come from all of those things are as difficult for kids here as they are the world over,\" he continued to tell Tudum.",
      "Graham told Rolling Stone that when he sees these stories of kids committing violent acts on the news, he knows he's \"not alone in blaming the parents sometimes.\"",
      "Because of this, he wanted to create a narrative where the crime decidedly isn't the parents' fault.",
      "\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018What if it\u2019s not the parents?\u2019 I wanted the dad to be a hardworking man, the kind of man that I was brought up with, like my uncles and my dad, who used to go to work at, like, 6 in the morning and not get home till 8 o\u2019clock at night, Monday to Friday,\" he told the publication.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t want him to be a violent dad who would raise his hand to his children. It\u2019s the same for the mum too; we imagined her as a manager for John Lewis.

      "Instead of his parents, it's the internet, and certain radical groups, that have an impact on Jamie. He was inspired by looking at his own son's interactions with friends and social media use.",
      "\"It was just about looking at the influence that certain people can have upon our children without our knowledge,\" he said.",

If you\u2019re influencing the youth with your own views and opinions, then surely you know that we need to be mindful of what\u2019s being said?\u201d",

    "summary": "What is Adolescence? About the series that is on Netflix and getting rave reviews from critics and what critics are saying.",
    "story": [
      "Every parent\u2019s nightmare comes to life in Stephen Graham\u2019s crime drama \u201cAdolescence,\u201d which focuses on the life of a 13-year-old boy named Jamie Miller (Owen Miller) who is accused of murdering a classmate.",
      "In addition to creating the show, Graham also plays Eddie Miller, Jamie\u2019s father. The rest of the cast includes Ashley Walters (\"Top Boy\"), Erin Doherty (\"The Crown\") and Faye Marsay (\"Game of Thrones\").",
      "Released on March 13, \"Adolescence\" is the No. 1. English-language show on Netflix in the U.S, as of the publication of this article.",
      "Part of what makes this show gripping is how the mystery unfolds. Filmed in one continuous shot, the characters try to understand the truth of what really happened in real time. Broader themes of toxic masculinity and the importance of teaching boys to rely on community, not just themselves, emerge.",
      "\u201cOne of our aims was to ask, \u2018What is happening to our young men these days, and what are the pressures they face from their peers, from the internet, and from social media?\u2019 \u201d Graham told Netflix's press site Tudum. \u201cAnd the pressures that come from all of those things are as difficult for kids here as they are the world over.\u201d",
      "What are critics saying about 'Adolescence'?",
      "\u201cAdolescence\u201d has an approval rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "Rolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall called the series \"an early contender for the best thing ...\u00a0you will see on the small screen this year.\"",
      "J. Kelly Nestruck of the Globe & Mail called the show Netflix\u2019s best since \u201cBaby Reindeer,\u201d which premiered last April.",
      "Critics spoke of the emotional impact it had on them, and potentially will have on viewers.",
      "\"Adolescence is likely to haunt you for quite some time,\" Matt Roush said for TV Insider, giving it a 5 out of 5 ranking.",
      "The Times' Tom Peck called the show \"complete perfection\" and said, \"I don\u2019t think I broke my gaze from the TV for so much as a second. I may not even have blinked.\"",
      "They also touched on how the story will strike viewers as relevant.",
      "\"This is a show that focuses on what the title promises: adolescence, and the unexpected dark turns it can take \u2014 particularly for boys,\" Amber Dowling wrote for The Wrap, calling it \"an addictive but impossibly hard watch.\"",
      "Television critic Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s primarily about family, and self-reflection, and especially fathers and sons, and if the series doesn\u2019t wind down to a traditional conclusion, it achieves a novelistic power in the end.\u201d",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's Daniel Fienberg says the show is more than thriller, but a meditation on the specific difficulties of being, and raising, a young man in the modern era, writing, \u201cThe mystery of what Jamie did or didn\u2019t do is relevant but secondary to bigger questions about masculinity \u2014 be it toxic or fragile \u2014 in a world of bullying, revenge porn and noxious virtual role models like the name-checked Andrew Tate. The nightmare of murder gets a little lost in the more pervasive nightmare of, well, adolescence.\u201d",
      "Other creators are weighing in, too. Director Paul Feig wrote about the impact the show had on him in a tweet.",
      "\"The first episode of the @netflix show Adolescence is one of the best hours of television I\u2019ve ever seen. An emotional and technological masterwork, the show works on all levels. I can\u2019t wait to watch the rest of the episodes. Huge congrats to all involved,\" he wrote on X.",

The next photo showed Hudson supported only by her boyfriend\u2019s feet on the front of her thighs as she stretched her arms out behind her.",

      "Belichick and Hudson took their relationship public in December 2024 when they made their first formal public appearance together at the Museum of Natural History\u2019s 2024 Museum Gala.",
      "Their relationship comes after the head coach at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill split with his former partner, Linda Holliday, in 2023 after 16 years, per People.",
      "Since their joint appearance at the gala together, the couple have continued to step out in public, including at the 14th annual Honors hosted ahead of the Super Bowl in New Orleans, where the age gap in their relationship was the punchline of a joke made by Snoop Dogg. They also were featured in the new Dunkin\u2019 Super Bowl ad starring Ben Affleck and Casey Affleck.",
      "Over the course of their romance, Belichick has made several appearances on Hudson\u2019s Instagram, even before their joint appearance at the gala at the end of 2024.",
      "In September 2024, Hudson shared a photo of Belichick petting a goat at the Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. The following month in October 2024, they were also photographed together at a corn maze in Massachusetts."

      "\"The Electric State,\" which premiered on Netflix on March 14, takes a new spin on the age-old tale of robots taking over.",
      "This time, robots lose the war and are an oppressed class.",
      "To understand the film, which was inspired by a 2018 graphic novel, you need to understand the world's history. Humans invented robots and put them to work doing manual labor and service jobs. Eventually, the robots rebelled and started the Robots Rights' Movement, led by a robot version of Mr. Peanut (voiced by Woody Harrelson). During the Clinton Administration, a deadly war broke out between the humans and the robots.",
      "Technology mogul Ethan Skate (Stanley Tucci) developed Neurocasters, a technology one puts on their head (like VR) which links the human mind to mechanized drone bodies. Neurocasters split your consciousness, a la \"Severance.\" One version of a human can be in a drone body working, while the other version is having fun in the human's original body.",
      "Once humans developed this new technology, they defeated the Robot Equality Coalition, banishing all the robots to Sentre's Exclusion Zone (known as The EX).",
      "Stanley Tucci explained on TODAY March 12 that Neurocasters were \u201coriginally sort of designed to sort of ease people\u2019s pain and suffering, but it\u2019s gotten out of hand.\u201d",
      "\"The Electric State,\" directed by the Russo brothers, takes place in the aftermath of this war in 1994, following Michelle (Millie Bobby Brown) as she races across the country to find her genius brother, Christopher, whom she had previously thought died in a car crash along with their parents.",
      "Accompanying her is a robot named Cosmo (Alan Tudyk). Although he can not fully speak, Cosmo conveys that Christopher is alive and projecting his own consciousness into Cosmo.",
      "Eventually, she teams up with Keats (Chris Pratt) and his own robot friend Herman (Anthony Mackie). Together, the foursome journeys through The EX to find Christopher.",
      "Along the way, they find Dr. Amherst (Ke Huy Quan) who informs them that Christopher is actually the reason that the Neurocasters exist. In fact, Christopher's brain is such a marvel, that in his comatose state after the car accident, his brain was strong enough to power \u2014 and still powers \u2014 all of Sentre's (Ethan Skate's company) technology.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many elements of animation, it\u2019s a massive, epic scope and scale, but really rooted in humanity,\u201d Chris Pratt said on TODAY Oct. 17. \u201cAnd that relationship between these two folks is a big part of that.\u201d",
      "Throughout the film, Michelle befriends many more robots who are voiced by big names like Woody Harrelson, Jenny Slate, Brian Cox and Hank Azaria.",
      "All the while she's on the run from Col. Bradbury (Giancarlo Esposito), a leader in the uprising and now a bounty hunter catching robots (Coleman Domingo also makes a cameo here as a soldier within Bradbury's ranks).",
      "The sci-fi/adventure film ends similar to how the world's history began: a huge battle between humans and robots, but this time the viewer is rooting for the robots. Read on the understand why and what happens.",
      "'The Electric State' ending explained",
      "During a battle in The EX, Col. Bradbury successfully kidnaps Cosmo. He gets ready to fly him back to Sentre when the drone that Ethan is Neurocasting into kills Dr. Amherst. Col. Bradbury still brings Cosmo back to Sentre, but face-to-face, he tells Ethan that he's crossed a line by killing someone and lying to him.",
      "Ethan doesn't care as he has Christopher's essence back, meaning his company won't completely crumble and instead is back at functioning capacity.",
      "This is when Michelle, her friends and a bunch of robots from The EX begin their attack on Sentre's headquarters with the mission of freeing Christopher.",
      "Amherst's computer, which stores all his knowledge, had revealed that removing Christopher's brain from the system would free him and cause a complete system failure for Sentre.",
      "Keats and Herman start the first wave of the attack, launching cars into Sentre's headquarters. Ethan deploys his entire security squad to stop their attack. Michelle, meanwhile, sneaks into Sentre through a backdoor using the code she'd secured.",
      "The second wave of robots then attack Sentre, coming to Keats and Herman's aid and launching a full on war against Ethan's security forces, who are Neurocasting into drones.",
      "Michelle reaches the room holding Christopher. She discovers that she has to put on a Neurocaster and go inside Christopher's mind to speak to him.",
      "While inside, Christopher confirms that if his brain is removed from the system, Sentre dies \u2014 but his physical body cannot survive without Sentre. He tells Michelle that she needs to be the one to save the world from Sentre, meaning that she must kill her own brother.",
      "While Michelle grapples with this realization, unsure of what to do, Ethan fires up his own Neurocaster, which is connected to a giant, lethal drone. He steps into battle in the suit and immediately begins destroying the robots.",
      "Separately on the battle field, Col. Bradbury confronts Mr. Peanut, but instead of fighting him as he had the entire film, he admits he was wrong and tells Mr. Peanut what room and floor Ethan's real body is located on. Col. Bradbury then exits the battle.",
      "Keats and Herman fight Ethan in his drone suit. They defeat him, but Herman dies in the process. As the real Ethan is taking his Neurocaster off, he's confronted by Mr. Peanut inside Sentre to renegotiate the treaty.",
      "Meanwhile, Michelle is still talking to Christopher, unwilling to let him die. Then he tells her that Sentre has put tighter controls over him this time and he doesn't want to live like this forever. Sentre could keep him alive for 100 years. Michelle sayas she doesn't want to lose him again.",
      "\"You can't lose me,\" Christopher tells her. \"But you can lose them. You. You're the one whose gonna change the world.\"",
      "After a final cry, hug, and exchanging of \"I love you's,\" Michelle leaves, pressing three buttons that kill her younger brother. She holds Cosmo's hand and Christopher's chest in both her hands.",
      "The timing is impeccable as Keats is about to be killed by a drone, but all of Sentre's technology ceases to work before the fatal strike.",
      "Despite Christopher dying, there's a happiness to the battle as Herman emerges alive and well after Keats bears his soul to what he believed to be his lifeless friend.",
      "What follows is a montage of Sentre shutting down across the world and news emerging that the company had been experimenting on a little boy to stay afloat. Ethan Skate gets arrested in the aftermath. The media montage ends with a reporter saying, \"You know who I want to talk about? The girl who trucked a ton of bots to Seattle to kick Skate's butt.\"",
      "Cut to Michelle, who films a video for the world saying that the technology Sentre made was bad for everyone, not just robots.",
      "\"I know the war happened and things fell apart and life really sucked,\" she says. \"And maybe for a little while the Neurocasters helped you forget that. We got so used to it that we thought that\u2019s what real life was. But it\u2019s not. Real life, it\u2019s contact. It\u2019s you and me. We\u2019re flesh and bone, yeah, but we\u2019re also electricity. And when we hug and laugh and hold hands and argue, my particles stay with you and yours stay with me. And maybe we stay together forever. But that can\u2019t happen if you close yourself off.\"",
      "Michelle continues on, saying humanity needs to start over. She tells everyone that they need to stick together and help each other to make it work.",
      "\"Look around,\" she says. \"There\u2019s someone near you right now. They\u2019re real and alive. And they need you as much as you need them. And if there isn\u2019t, if you don\u2019t have anyone, then come find us. Because we\u2019re starting over. We\u2019re going to do it right this time.\u201d",
      "What does that last scene mean? Is Christopher alive?",
      "With Michelle saving the world like Christopher had instructed her to do, the movie could end \u2014\u00a0but instead it tacks on one last scene.",
      "Cosmo, the robot Christopher had transferred some of his essence into, is dumped into what looks to be a pile of trash. Nearby, a stray dog laps water from a puddle.",
      "The final shot shows the reflection in the water as Cosmo rises up, hinting that some of Christopher's essence may still be alive within him."

      "Employers \u201cshall not further inquire or investigate the marriage and childbearing status of female job applicants,\u201d read a notice from the state-backed trade union of Hunan province in central China that was posted last week around International Women\u2019s Day on the Chinese social media platform WeChat.",
      "The notice also said employers should not limit recruitment to men, stipulate a preference for male job applicants or require pregnancy tests as a condition of employment.",
      "Similar notices were posted by unions in the southern industrial hub of Shenzhen and the northwestern province of Qinghai.",
      "The notices have been widely shared in recent days on Chinese social media, where users discussed the challenges that women face when applying for jobs.",
      "\u201cFemale employees are expected to lie when employers ask about personal privacy during the job search process and give the employer a satisfactory answer if they really like the job,\u201d said a user on the Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote.",
      "As much as some employers would prefer their female workers to remain single, women are getting the opposite instructions from the Chinese government, which has been pressuring them to get married and have children to help address the declining and fast-aging population.",
      "Women are being encouraged to embrace more \u201ctraditional\u201d roles in society as wives and mothers, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has personally called on women to promote a \u201cchildbearing culture.\u201d",
      "Some have rushed to adopt Beijing\u2019s line.",
      "Last month, a company in China rolled back a policy that threatened never-married and divorced employees with termination if they were still single by the end of September following public uproar.",
      "The company\u2019s notice had criticized single employees for \u201cnot responding to the national call.\u201d",
      "Despite women making strides in the workplace, achieving gender equality has been an uphill battle in China.",
      "It was only in 2012 that the State Council, China\u2019s Cabinet, prohibited employers from reducing female employees\u2019 wages or terminating their contracts because of pregnancy and childbirth.",
      "In an effort to encourage childbearing, Chinese officials have rolled out a series of measures including subsidies, improved child care and longer maternity leave.",
      "Those measures have had limited impact on Chinese women, who cite fear of falling behind in their careers among the reasons they hesitate to have children.",
      "A third of women in the country still take less than the 98 days of maternity leave they are entitled to, according to\u00a0a survey last year\u00a0by the Women\u2019s Studies Institute of China.",
      "Though the trade unions\u2019 notices were praised by some as a step forward for women, others questioned whether companies would take them seriously.",
      "\u201cWill there be any punishment for violating the rules? Most likely not,\u201d read one comment on Xiaohongshu."

      "The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The plight of the Afghan students was first reported by the BBC.",
      "In a letter to aid groups, the Afghan women are appealing for urgent help to allow them to continue their studies abroad and avoid returning to a country where, they say, they will face certain persecution and life-threatening risks.",
      "\u201cThe situation is catastrophic,\u201d the letter says. \u201cBeing sent back to Afghanistan would mean the permanent loss of our education and exposure to severe risks, including oppression, insecurity, and a future without opportunities. This is a life-or-death situation for many of us.\u201d",

      "Secretary of State\u00a0Marco Rubio said Monday\u00a0that 83% of USAID programs had been canceled after a six-week review and that the remaining programs would be merged into the State Department.",

      "The program for female scholars was launched in 2019 with a $50 million endowment from USAID, according to Brian Le, deputy legislative director of With Honor, a nonprofit group that works with veterans in Congress from both parties on bipartisan initiatives. Interest from the endowment has covered the cost of the program, which was administered by USAID, without requiring additional annual funding from the U.S. government, Le said.",
      "Nonprofit groups are in discussions with the government of Oman to try to resolve the situation, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to avoid is their return to Afghanistan, which would functionally amount to a death sentence for these women who have been aided by the United States in pursuing higher education opportunities,\u201d Le said.",
      "While the letter from the Afghan students said 83 women were affected, Le said it now appears more than 120 Afghans had their scholarship funding cut off.",
      "Since the Taliban returned to power in 2021 following the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from Afghanistan, they have reimposed draconian restrictions on women, including banning them from secondary school and higher education,\u00a0prohibiting them from most employment and limiting their freedom of speech and movement, according to human rights groups.",

      "\u201cThe Trump administration thinks it\u2019s politically advantageous to villainize USAID, but Americans need to realize that behind the cancelled contracts and mass layoffs are innocent lives now put at risk,\u201d he said in an email.",

      "Carney\u2019s choice of itinerary emphasizes Canada\u2019s strong connection with the two former colonial powers, said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.",
      "\u201cThe fact that Canada never broke away from the U.K. in a violent fashion is a key historical and institutional difference between the United States and Canada, a constitutional monarchy rather than a republic that has adopted and retained a U.K.-style parliamentary system,\u201d B\u00e9land said.",
      "The trip to London will be a kind of homecoming. Carney became the first non-British governor in the Bank of England\u2019s 319-year history when he took the job on July 1, 2013. He served until March 15, 2020.",
      "Carney, who turned 60 on Sunday, has said he\u2019s ready to meet with Trump if he shows respect for Canadian sovereignty. He said he doesn\u2019t plan to visit Washington at the moment but hopes to have a phone call with the president soon. His government is also reviewing the purchase of U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets in light of Trump\u2019s trade war.",
      "Meanwhile, Macron has been increasing efforts to persuade France\u2019s allies to move away from purchases of American military hardware, which also coincides with mounting concerns in Europe that European defenses are overly dependent on U.S. weaponry, technical support and goodwill.",
      "Macron touched on the French-British plan for securing any ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThis common commitment at the side of the Ukrainians has always aimed for a peace that is solid and lasting,\u201d Macron said. \u201cCanada and France are powers of peace, reliable allies, which will take part together in this effort.\u201d He did not give details.",
      "Carney spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by phone late Sunday and invited him to the G7 summit this summer that Canada is hosting.",
      "Trump said he would speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday as he pushes to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "Carney is expected to call a parliamentary election by the end of the week, to take place in late April or early May. Canada\u2019s governing Liberal Party had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared economic war. Now, the party and its new leader could come out on top."

      "China sees the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as a breakaway province and has not ruled out using force to achieve its unification goal. The ruling Chinese Communist Party, which came to power in 1949, has never controlled Taiwan, which rejects Beijing\u2019s sovereignty claims.",

      "Last month, the Chinese military carried out a \u201cjoint combat readiness patrol\u201d about 40 nautical miles off Taiwan that included\u00a0live-fire drills, which the island criticized as provocative and dangerous.",

      "China also responded angrily last week to a joint statement by top diplomats from the Group of Seven nations, which includes the U.S., that condemned \u201ccoercion\u201d against Taiwan and omitted the typical reference to G7 members\u2019 \u201cone China\u201d policies, under which they recognize Beijing as the only legitimate government of China.",
      "The G7 statements \u201cignore facts and China\u2019s solemn position, grossly interfere in China\u2019s internal affairs, and blatantly smear China,\u201d a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Canada said in a statement Friday.",
      "Last week, Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te called China a \u201cforeign hostile force\u201d and proposed 17 countermeasures against what he called Beijing\u2019s influence campaign, including strict review of applications by Chinese nationals to visit and live in Taiwan, and the reinstatement of military courts.",
