      "Then, it handed the spotlight to its new designer, Matthieu Blazy, for his much-anticipated couture debut built on one big, confident swing: joy.",
      "Inside the Grand Palais, the house went full fantasy.",
      "The set was a dream-garden of candy-colored trees and giant pink-and-red mushrooms: a surreal antidote to the gray January day outside, and to the even heavier mood of the world beyond the doors.",
      "Before the first look, Blazy even teased the mood with an animation film of woodland animals at work in the Chanel ateliers, \u201cCinderella\u201d style: a wink that said this would be couture, but not grim.",
      "Then came the clothes, and the message landed fast: lightness.",
      "Blazy took Chanel\u2019s most famous codes \u2014 the suit, the pearls, the chain-weighted hems \u2014 and made them feel almost weightless.",
      "A classic skirt suit arrived as a sheer, barely-there version of itself, cut so delicately it looked like air had been tailored.",
      "In a house where tweed can be armor, this was tweed as whisper.",
      "Birds hovered over the collection as a guiding idea: freedom, motion, travel.",
      "Featherlike textures and flighty embroideries fluttered across silhouettes that moved like breath instead of structure.",
      "There were flashes of plumage in color and surface \u2014 at times bright, at times raven-dark \u2014 and plenty of soft, floating chiffon that made the models look as if they were gliding rather than walking.",
      "The best trick was how the craft wasn't obvious.",
      "Up close, the work was meticulous: a level of handwork couture clients pay for, and ateliers live for.",

He remembered walking into a restaurant and seeing a picture of a man in a boxing stance and asked why they had a poster of Muhammad Ali on the wall. They didn\u2019t, he was told: It was Mandela.",
      "It was just part of what would be an enlightening journey in making the new documentary, \u201cTroublemaker,\u201d which has its world premiere Tuesday at the Sundance Film Festival.",
      "\u201cHe evolved into the Mandela that we all know and love,\u201d Fuqua said. \u201cThe troublemaker allows you to sort of see him not just a mythical character or as a global icon, but as a fallible human being, someone who became a great leader, who in the beginning was a rebel, if you will, and who was willing to engage in violence at some point, if necessary, for the greater good.\u201d",
      "The film uses Mandela\u2019s own voice, drawn from over 70 hours of recordings to tell the story of the struggle against apartheid. Fuqua collaborated closely with Mac Maharaj, an anti-apartheid activist, who was imprisoned on Robben Island with Mandela and who played a key part in smuggling Mandela\u2019s writings, which would become \u201cLong Walk to Freedom,\u201d out of the prison",
      "Fuqua, Maharaj and the filmmaking team traveled all around South Africa, visiting important locations in Mandela\u2019s story, from the University of Fort Hare, where Mandela was a student before being expelled for protest activities, and Robben Island, where he was imprisoned from 1964 to 1982, to Qunu, his final resting place.",
      "He even slept a few nights on Robben Island, which he said was \u201cvery uncomfortable.\u201d While there they got a feeling for where Mandela spent 18 of his 27 imprisoned years and bonded at night over dinners. That\u2019s where Maharaj told him Mandela was a Tracy Chapman fan.",
      "They met many people along the way, including some who were part of the resistance against apartheid, taking to heart their continued optimism and hope despite past and present grievances and racism.",
      "\u201cOne gentleman came in and he had no arm, his eye was missing. He looked like a character out of James Bond. He had a Tommy Bahama shirt on, he had the hat on,\u201d Fuqua said. \u201cAnd he was so full of life and so funny and so matter of fact about what happened to him, fighting for justice. I started to learn so much more about the people there.\u201d",

The international broadcast center in Munich was 100 yards away from where the hostage crisis was taking place in the Olympic village.",
      "The movie recreates the moment when West German police stormed the control room and pointed guns at Mason\u2019s face.

      "The season\u2019s key item was the coat \u2014 long, tailored and meant to be noticed.",

      "Earlier looks included aviator-style pieces like shearling bombers, earflap caps and stand-up buckle collars, plus shearling dyed a coral-pink.",
      "Accessories stayed strong: boxy overnight bags and boots with bright orange soles.",
      "Junya Watanabe also made coats the center of his show, sending out classic camel and navy styles, then mixing them with sportier parts \u2014 like bomber backs, leather jacket fronts and down-jacket quilting \u2014 to make formal outerwear feel tougher and more modern.",
      "Many designers worked with classic suits and jackets, but changed how they sit on the body.",
      "At Sacai, Chitose Abe added new sections to jackets, trousers and outerwear \u2014 extra panels, pockets and quilted inserts \u2014 often built around a triangle theme.",
      "The show moved through tailored looks, workwear and strong denim, including collaborations with Levi\u2019s and A.P.C., but the big idea stayed clear: reshape the silhouette without losing wearability.",
      "Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Homme Plus did the opposite with more shock.",
      "Rei Kawakubo cut into black suits and coats \u2014 altering lapels and hems \u2014 then later sent out white versions of her shapes as the mood shifted from dark to bright.",

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Charli xcx plays herself in \u201cThe Moment,\u201d a meta mockumentary about the end of Brat summer and grappling with otherworldly success.",
      "\u201cI was just really interested in telling this story about expectation,\u201d Charli xcx told The Associated Press the day after \u201cThe Moment\u201d debuted at the Sundance Film Festival.",
      "The 33-year-old pop star from Essex has been in the music industry since she was 16, with a career trajectory that she described as anything but straight forward. Then, in 2024, it hit a crescendo with her sixth studio album, \u201cBrat,\u201d which became a pop culture phenomenon. Finally, she said, she felt understood for a moment. And then, just as quickly, it changed.",
      "\u201cThere was this sort of, kind of, you know, persona that people really associated me with and then there were a lot of expectations put on me as a person, as an artist, of who I was then supposed to be. And I didn\u2019t fit into that sort of narrative,\u201d she said. \u201cI had got to this place where I was finally feeling so understood. Then I was like not understood again.\u201d",
      "Making something immensely popular and resonant can be a double-edged sword for an artist working in a business that would sometimes rather milk the \u201csure thing\u201d forever than let someone evolve and move on. She found herself wanting to grapple with that tension, that existential conundrum that she\u2019d experienced.",
      "A straightforward documentary didn\u2019t seem like right approach, so she and Aidan Zamiri, the 30-year-old Scottish photographer and music video director, got to work on something else, something that felt truer to them. \u201cThe Moment\u201d is a little \u201cThis is Spinal Tap,\u201d a little \u201cBlack Swan,\u201d a little meta, with the likes of Kylie Jenner and Rachel Sennott playing themselves, a little funny and a little wild. It\u2019s heightened, but also true.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t lie, there are definitely some crossovers,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t made the choices that Charli in the film makes, but I\u2019ve definitely, like, come close to it. \u2026 It was a very accurate depiction of what I\u2019ve experienced in the music industry.\u201d",
      "One of the buzziest titles in a starry program, the A24 film will be in theaters faster than most: It opens in New York and Los Angeles on Jan. 30 and expands wide on Feb. 6.",
      "In \u201cThe Moment,\u201d Charli xcx is under pressure as Brat summer comes to an end, having to stage a concert film with Amazon, with a sleazy director not of her choosing played by Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, promote a Brat credit card, and fall in line with what music executives want from her. She\u2019s also not sleeping and getting increasingly frazzled about everything.",
      "Zamiri, who directed her \u201c360\u201d music video and has become one of her best friends, was excited by the challenge and to direct his first feature film. He also understood intrinsically what she was going through.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s this battle of expectations and of people wanting one thing from you and you feeling this pressure too, to stick with it, to keep providing that one thing for fear that maybe that attention, that excitement about you will falter if the next thing they don\u2019t love,\u201d Zamiri said. \u201cI love the process of making stuff. But part of it, which is often really exciting but also weird, is the sharing with the world because then it\u2019s just no longer yours anymore \u2026 it becomes its own thing which I think we saw happen in real-time with Brat.\u201d",

      "There\u2019s a palpable energy around \u201cThe Moment\u201d as it approaches its theatrical release.

They\u2019re not her first on screen credits, but they do show her range in addition to her ability to carry a film, even if she\u2019s playing a version of herself.",
      "It's a big moment for Charli xcx personally, too. She's a self-professed cinephile with a not-so-secret Letterboxd account, where she\u2019s logged 1,357 movies so far. In a recent review of \u201cPaddington 2,\u201d she wrote \u201clives up 2 the hype.\u201d Her four favorites are Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d David Cronenberg\u2019s \u201cMaps to the Stars,\u201d Jacques Rivette\u2019s \u201cC\u00e9line and Julie Go Boating\u201d and Abel Ferrera\u2019s \u201cThe Addiction.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- With a winter storm blanketing a large swath of the country, Hollywood had its quietest weekend of the year at the box office. The Amazon MGM sci-fi thriller \u201cMercy\u201d dethroned \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d from the No. 1 spot with $11.2 million in North America, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Some 250 theaters were forced to close, from Texas to Maine, according to data firm Comsore. More than 140 million Americans were under winter storm warnings, depressing moviegoing.",
      "But the weekend was never going to be a blockbuster one, anyway. \u201cMercy,\u201d a $60 million thriller starring Chris Pratt as a man in a near-future standing trial before an AI judge, was the top new release. It arrived with withering reviews (20% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and an equally poor reception (a \u201cB-\u201d CinemaScore) from audiences.",
      "That was still enough to finally dislodge James Cameron's third Pandora epic from its monthlong perch atop the box office. \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d slid to second place with $7 million. While The Walt Disney Co. release is starting to peter out domestically, it remains a top draw overseas. It took in $28.1 million internationally in its sixth weekend.",
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d isn't going to come close to the box-office heights of the previous two \u201cAvatar\u201d movies. The 2009 original grossed $2.9 billion and the 2022 sequel, \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d tapped out at $2.3 billion. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has now cleared $1 billion internationally, but its domestic haul ($378.5 million) is well off the pace of the other two films.",
      "The \u201cOscar bump\u201d that films once saw following nomination is largely a thing of the past. The lead movies in Thursday's nominations \u2014 \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d \u2014 long ago completed their theatrical runs. But a handful of nominees saw strong business.",
      "Chlo\u00e9 Zhao's \u201cHamnet,\u201d nominated for eight Oscars including best picture, collected $2 million in its first weekend of wide release. The Shakespeare drama, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, has been in theaters for two months, steadily increasing its theatrical footprint. It's up to $17.6 million domestically and $42.1 million worldwide.",
      "Josh Safdie's \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d nominated for nine Oscars, earned $3.5 million in its sixth weekend of release. The A24 title, starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, this week cross $100 million globally. It's made $86.2 million domestically thus far.",
      "But newer releases struggled. \u201cReturn to Silent Hill,\u201d the third installment in a horror series kick-started with 2006's \u201cSilent Hill,\u201d opened with $3.2 million. Though Sony released the 2006 film and Open Road distributed the 2012 follow up, the low-budget \u201cReturn to Silent Hill\u201d was put out by Iconic Events.",
      "In its second week of release, \u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u201d dropped swiftly. The Sony release, directed by Nia DaCosta, opened last week to a disappointing $13.3 million in sales despite good reviews. But its second weekend was even worse, dropping 71% with $3.6 million.",
      "Other new releases flopped. Roadside Attractions' \u201cH Is For Hawk,\u201d starring Claire Foy, took in just $150,000 from 472 theaters. Sony's \u201cClika,\u201d about a migrant worker with music aspirations, managed only $1.2 million in 522 locations.",

      "A common question that has emerged from this year's Sundance Film Festival is: \"\u201cWill you still go to the festival when it moves to Boulder?\u201d",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Attendees at this year's Sundance Film Festival could not stand in line, step onto a shuttle bus or walk into a lounge without hearing one common question: \u201cWill you go to the festival when it moves to Boulder?\u201d",
      "Butch Ward has been a Sundance regular since the early '90s, but like many longtime festivalgoers who fell in love with its charming mountain hometown of Park City, he said he won't be following Sundance to its new setting in Colorado next year.",
      "The media professional from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, considers this the last year of the festival in its true form, \u201cbecause a Sundance outside Utah just isn't Sundance.\u201d",
      "That sentiment was shared by many attendees who had found their happy place at the Utah festival.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a resistance to change,\u201d said Suzie Taylor, an actor who has been coming to Sundance on and off since 1997. \"Robert Redford's vision was rooted here. And isn\u2019t it poetic that he passed right before the last one?\u201d",
      "For Julie Nunis, the joy of Sundance is grounded in the tradition Redford created in Park City more than four decades ago. The actor from Los Angeles has come to the festival nearly every year since 2001 and said she doesn\u2019t want to experience it any other way.",
      "Redford, who died in September at age 89, established the festival and development programs for filmmakers in the Utah mountains as a haven for independent storytelling far from the pressures of Hollywood. Before his death, Redford, who attended the University of Colorado Boulder, gave his blessing for the festival to relocate.",
      "Boulder emerged victorious from a yearlong search in which numerous U.S. cities vied to host the nation\u2019s premier independent film festival. Sundance organizers decided to search for a new home because they said the festival had outgrown the ski town it helped put on the map and developed an air of exclusivity that took focus away from the films.",
      "Some film professionals and volunteers said they were willing to give Boulder a try but worried Sundance could lose its identity outside its longtime home.",
      "Lauren Garcia, who has come from Seattle to volunteer at Sundance for the past six years, said curiosity may lead her to Boulder for future festivals. She described feeling a sadness lingering over the final Utah festival and wondered if Redford's death means it's time for Sundance to close this chapter.",

      "Cheers erupted from a street-level crowd as he reached the top of the spire of the 508-meter (1,667-foot) tower about 90 minutes after he started. Wearing a red short-sleeve shirt, Honnold waved his arms back and forth over his head.",

      "Honnold, known for his ropeless ascent up Yosemite National Park\u2019s El Capitan, climbed up one corner of Taipei 101 using small L-shaped outcroppings as footholds. Periodically, he had to maneuver around and clamber up the sides of large ornamental structures that jut out from the tower, pulling himself up with his bare hands.",
      "The building has 101 floors, with the hardest part being the 64 floors of the middle section \u2014 the \u201cbamboo boxes\u201d that give the building its signature look. Divided into eight, each segment has eight floors of steep, overhanging climbing followed by balconies, where he took short rests as he made his way upward.",
      "Honnold's free solo climb of the iconic building in Taiwan's capital city was broadcast live on Netflix with a 10-second delay. The ascent, originally scheduled for Saturday, was delayed for 24 hours due to rain.",

      "King Charles III has teamed up with Amazon Prime to make a film about his vision for saving the planet, 16 years after he wrote a book on the subject",
      "LONDON -- Can it be that, like many baby boomers, King Charles III feels misunderstood?",
      "That might sound like a strange question for a man with his own public relations team and easy access to any journalist in the realm. But 16 years after he wrote a book explaining his vision for saving the planet, the king has teamed up with Amazon Prime to make a film spelling out that philosophy.",
      "The documentary delves into Charles\u2019 concept of \u201charmony,\u201d the idea that restoring the balance between the human and natural worlds is crucial to combatting global warming and many other major problems facing humanity.",
      "Along the way, the king also confronts his critics, who have lampooned him as a dilettante flitting aimlessly from one cause to another with no rhyme or reason. Charles believes that climate change, urban planning, sustainable agriculture, traditional crafts and fostering understanding between religions \u2014 causes to which he has devoted much of his adult life \u2014 are inter-related issues that must be dealt with to create more liveable communities.",
      "\u201cI think we need to follow harmony if we are going to ensure that this planet can support so many,\u2019\u2019 he said in a trailer for the film. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely there\u2019s anywhere else.\u2019\u2019",
      "To help explain these ideas, experts including Tony Juniper, the former head of Friends of the Earth in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and Emily Shuckburgh, a University of Cambridge climate scientist, appear with Charles in \u201cFinding Harmony: A King\u2019s Vision,\u201d available on Amazon from Feb. 6. The narrator is Kate Winslet.",
      "The king wants people to recognize that humans are as much a part of the natural world as the birds and the trees, something that can be obscured as we rush to work in air-conditioned offices, then drive to the supermarket to buy food wrapped in plastic, Juniper told The Associated Press.",
      "The \u201ccycles and loops\u201d of nature are still what govern human society, Juniper said, and reconnecting with that is critical as we confront global warming, soil erosion, ocean plastics and the chemicals building up in our food chains.",
      "\u201cAll of that is reversible, all of that fixable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to require more of us to understand that we are not outside nature, we are in it.\u201d",
      "Juniper believes Charles is uniquely qualified to deliver this message because he has been campaigning on these issues for decades and continues to do so even as other world leaders shun environmental protection.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s one person in the world who is literally a globally recognized figure, who has authenticity derived from an incredible track record on these subjects, it is King Charles III,\u201d Juniper said.",
      "Charles addressed the idea of restoring balance in the natural world in his 2010 book \u201cHarmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World,\u201d written with Juniper and Ian Skelly, a former BBC presenter.",
      "So why return to the subject now?",
      "Part of it may be the hope of reaching a new audience through a streaming service with global reach. Prince William, Charles\u2019 heir, ventured into the same space last year when he revealed his plans for the monarchy on comedian Eugene Levy\u2019s Apple TV show \u201cThe Reluctant Traveler.\u201d",
      "But the king also wants to shift the focus back to an issue he hopes will define his legacy after two years in which the media, and the public, were distracted by other matters, said Ed Owens, author of \u201cAfter Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?\u201d",
      "First there was Charles\u2019 cancer diagnosis, which forced him to step away from public duties for several months in early 2024 and raised nagging questions about his health. Then there were the continuing tensions with his younger son, Prince Harry, and the scandal surrounding his brother Andrew\u2019s links to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",

      "Charles gave his first speech on the environment in February 1970, when he was just 21 and still a student at Cambridge.",
      "In 1990, he founded Dumfries House, the flagship project of the King\u2019s Foundation, to promote sustainable agriculture, traditional arts and crafts, health and well-being.",
      "The house and surrounding 2,000-acre estate in southwestern Scotland operate as a laboratory of sorts for the philosophy of harmony, offering courses that seek to teach the principles of nature while preparing students to work on farms, in hotels and restaurants \u2014 and on construction sites.",
      "Among those who is attending a course at Dumfries House is Jennie Regan, 45, who is training to be a stonemason after 15 years as a university administrator.",
      "On a recent afternoon, Regan stood proudly behind a carving she created bearing the inscription \u201cHave I not guided you well?\u201d \u2014 a nod to the story of the benevolent Scottish fairy Ghillie Dhu who led a lost child to safety.",
      "The carving, which will adorn the floor of a wildlife hide, a hidden woodland shelter for observing nature, is an example of what attracted her to stonemasonry: the ability to combine her love of nature with the goal of making something that will last for years.",
      "\u201cThings need to be sustainable,\u2033 Regan said. \u201cBuilding sites have so much waste.\u2019\u2032",
      "Shuckburgh, who collaborated with the king on a children\u2019s book about climate change, said the documentary offers a hopeful vision for addressing the challenges facing the world.",
      "\u201cIt feels as though we\u2019re living through difficult times,\u2019\u2019 said Shuckburgh, director of Cambridge Zero, the university\u2019s effort to address the climate crisis. \u201cHaving something that provides that sense of hope and optimism is really, really important.\"",

      "The Sundance Film Festival is buzzing with excitement as Channing Tatum, Olivia Wilde, and Charli XCX movies premiere back-to-back at the Eccles Theater in Park City, Utah",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- The Sundance Film Festival is in full swing, with Channing Tatum, Olivia Wilde and Charli xcx movies premiering back-to-back at the storied Eccles Theatre Friday evening in Park City, Utah. Considered some of the hottest tickets at the festival, the waitlists are already long, and the lines will surely be longer.",
      "First up is \u201cJosephine,\u201d writer-director Beth De Ara\u00fajo\u2019s raw drama about an 8-year-old girl (Mason Reeves) whose life and sense of safety is upended after she witnesses a crime in Golden Gate Park. Tatum and Gemma Chan play the parents who are unsure how to help her navigate these new emotions and fears. The film, which is part of the U.S. Dramatic Competition, is based on De Ara\u00fajo\u2019s own experience of seeing something scarring at that age.",
      "The next film, Gregg Araki\u2019s \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d will bring a distinct change in tone to the Eccles. It\u2019s the story of a college graduate in his early 20s (played by Cooper Hoffman ) who gets his first job as a kind of intern/assistant to a renowned art world provocateur named Erika Tracy (Wilde), who Arkai described as \u201cbold, daring and very controversial,\u201d a cross between Robert Mapplethorpe and Madonna.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the story of their affairs and the impact it has on this kid\u2019s life and how it kind of turns his whole world upside down,\u201d Araki told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, it\u2019s colorful, it\u2019s sexy. And it\u2019s a ride.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a film that Araki has been working on for over 10 years, as it evolved from a comic \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d with a female intern to what it is now.",
      "\u201cAfter #MeToo and Harvey Weinstein, all the stuff that was going on, it was literally like, I don\u2019t really want to see a woman getting dragged around by the hair,\u201d Araki said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to seed that kind of patriarchal dynamic, even if it\u2019s consensual.\u201d",
      "Flipping the gender roles and making the young intern a man made the movie more interesting for Araki, \u201cas a filmmaker who has always been heavily influenced by feminist film theory and feminism in general,\u201d he said.",
      "At the same time, he was absorbing news stories about Gen Z and how they don\u2019t have sex or relationships anymore and a new dynamic emerged.",
      "\u201cWhat I knew as an old person, as an old-timer, in terms of socialization, dating, sex, all of this stuff that seemed to be kind of falling away,\u201d Araki said. \u201cAnd so that kind of became a major theme of the movie.\u201d",
      "Things Wilde\u2019s character says are things he has also said in interviews about sex and sexuality. Her character gets into generational debates about it. And ultimately it's sex positive.",
      "\u201cIt was very important to me to make something sex positive,\u201d Araki said. \u201c\u2019I Want Your Sex\u2019 is like the opposite of \u2018Babygirl,\u2019 which I found to be very sex negative.\u201d",
      "The film also features a supporting turn from Charli xcx, who was a fan of Araki and whose \u201cBrat\u201d album cover was partially inspired by the title credits to his film \u201cSmiley Face.\u201d When she heard about this new movie, he said, she asked if she could be in it. He was interested, but told her agent that she needed to do a self-tape \u201clike everyone else\u201d to play the part of Hoffman\u2019s girlfriend.",

But prevention, diagnosis and rehabilitation services have not kept pace on a largely youthful continent whose public health systems prioritize infectious diseases, maternal care and children.",

      "The aquagym emerged little over a decade ago as a rare, low-cost option to relieve pain and improve mobility.",
      "After Sall was diagnosed with her autoimmune condition, she said her doctor told her she would need surgery at a cost of about $10,000, which she could not afford. She was prescribed an anti-inflammatory drug, but it was later taken off the market due to complications.",

      "Officials warn that shoveling snow after this weekend's massive storm could be hazardous to your heart",
      "Digging out from the weekend\u2019s massive snow and ice storm could be hazardous to your heart.",
      "Pennsylvania health officials announced three snow-removal related deaths Sunday. All were between the ages of 60 to 84. The Lehigh County coroner's office cautioned people to take breaks and avoid over-exerting themselves.",
      "Shoveling snow is heavy, hard work \u2014 research has shown that doing it for even a short time can make the heart work as hard as it does during a major workout. Adding to that stress, the cold temperatures cause blood vessels, including those feeding the heart, to constrict. That raises blood pressure which in turn increases the risk of a heart attack, stroke or cardiac arrest, according to the American Heart Association.",
      "Snow shoveling is especially risky for anyone with known heart disease or who\u2019s already survived a heart attack, as well as older adults and people with risk factors including high blood pressure or cholesterol. People who think they\u2019re healthy can get in trouble, too, with that combination of heavy exertion in cold weather \u2013 especially if they\u2019re generally sedentary until a snowstorm comes along.",

      "For a young girl, losing the soccer final 5-0 meant little compared to the goals of a tournament held in Zimbabwe to promote trust in cervical cancer vaccination",
      "NORTON, Zimbabwe -- Lesotho\u2019s Lishoeshoe soccer club was losing by four goals at halftime against South Africa\u2019s Mamelodi Sundowns in the final of a regional Under-17 girls\u2019 tournament in Zimbabwe aimed at promoting cervical cancer vaccination. By fulltime, the gap had stretched to 5-0.",
      "Yet for Lishoeshoe winger Nteboheleng Leticia Sooane, the result felt beside the point.",
      "For the 16-year-old, the tournament\u2019s most important outcome had little to do with goalmouth scrambles or final-whistle disappointment. Instead, it was about building confidence among girls to trust the HPV vaccine and prevent a disease that kills a woman every two minutes globally \u2014 with the burden most acute in Africa, according to GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, one of the tournament\u2019s organizers.",
      "\u201cParticipating in the tournament was very good because we had to learn and spread (the message) even though we did not win the finals. So it was a good experience,\u201d Sooane said as she waited to collect her finalist\u2019s medal in a rain-soaked stadium in Norton, on the outskirts of Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "Sooane was among about 200 girls from six countries taking part in the CAF Under-17 girls\u2019 tournament in December, organized by Africa\u2019s soccer governing body CAF together with the European soccer body, GAVI and health ministries from several African countries.",
      "Dubbed the Goal Getters campaign, the initiative was first showcased in Tanzania and Eswatini earlier last year before moving to Zimbabwe in December, using soccer to build awareness and trust in the HPV vaccine.",
      "Offered for free, the HPV vaccine being administered to girls aged between 9 and 14 years can prevent up to 90% of cervical cancer cases, saving families thousands of dollars in treatment costs later in life if girls are not vaccinated, according to GAVI.",
      "After setbacks caused by COVID-19 lockdowns and uneven national immunization programs, Africa has intensified HPV vaccination drives in recent years. Coverage for at least one dose of the HPV vaccine rose to 40% in 2023 from 28% the previous year, behind only behind North, Central and South America, driven by expanded campaigns backed by governments and GAVI, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "The girls\u2019 soccer tournament is a key part of that effort, said GAVI spokesman Olly Cann.",
      "\u201cOne of the great aspects of the Goal Getters campaign is that it enables us to blend two things that teenage girls are passionate about, one is sport and the other is health,\u201d said Cann. \u201cIt creates a really safe space where the girls can feel trusted, they can feel secure, they also feel empowered.\u201d",
      "The campaign\u2019s launch mixed dance and song before the eight-team tournament kicked off. On the sidelines, mothers streamed to a nearby clinic, some drawn by the chance to see well-known women\u2019s soccer figures, while also getting their children vaccinated against HPV.",
      "HPV, or human papillomavirus, is a common sexually transmitted virus and the primary cause of cervical cancer. While most infections clear naturally, some persist and can lead to cancer years later.",
      "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide, killing about 350,000 women each year, according to the WHO. Africa accounts for nearly a quarter of global deaths, and 19 of the 20 most affected countries are in sub-Saharan Africa, Cann said.",

      "But his greatest achievement came before all that, with his work on smallpox, one of the most lethal diseases in human history. For centuries, it killed about one-third of the people it infected and left most survivors with deep scars on their faces from the pus-filled lesions.",
      "Smallpox vaccination campaigns were well established by the time Foege was a young doctor. Indeed, it was no longer seen in the United States. But infections were still occurring elsewhere, and efforts to stamp them out were stalling.",
      "Working as a medical missionary in Nigeria in the 1960s, Foege and his colleagues developed a \"ring containment\" strategy, in which a smallpox outbreak was contained by identifying each smallpox case and vaccinating everyone who the patients might come into contact with.",
      "The method relied heavily on quick detective work and was born out of necessity. There simply wasn't enough vaccine available to immunize everyone, Foege wrote in \"House on Fire,\" his 2011 book about the smallpox eradication effort.",
      "It worked, and became pivotal in helping rid the world of smallpox for good. The last naturally occurring case was seen in Somalia in 1977. In 1980, the World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated from the Earth.",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. has finalized its withdrawal from the World Health Organization, one year after President Donald Trump announced America was ending its 78-year-old commitment, federal officials said Thursday.",
      "But it's hardly a clean break.",
      "The U.S. owes more than $130 million to the global health agency, according to WHO. And Trump administration officials acknowledge that they haven't finished working out some issues, such as lost access to data from other countries that could give America an early warning of a new pandemic.",
      "The withdrawal will hurt the global response to new outbreaks and will hobble the ability of U.S. scientists and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines and medicines against new threats, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University.",

      "The WHO is the United Nations\u2019 specialized health agency and is mandated to coordinate the response to global health threats, such as outbreaks of mpox, Ebola and polio. It also provides technical assistance to poorer countries; helps distribute scarce vaccines, supplies and treatments; and sets guidelines for hundreds of health conditions, including mental health and cancer.",
      "Nearly every country in the world is a member.",
      "U.S. officials helped lead the WHO's creation, and America has long been among the organization's biggest donors, providing hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of staffers with specialized public health expertise.",
      "On average, the U.S. pays $111 million a year in member dues to the WHO and roughly $570 million more in annual voluntary contributions, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "In an executive order issued right after taking office, Trump said the U.S. was withdrawing from WHO due to the organization\u2019s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises. He also cited the agency\u2019s \u201cfailure to adopt urgently needed reforms\u201d and its \u201cinability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\u201d",
      "WHO, like other public health organizations, made costly mistakes during the pandemic, including at one point advising people against wearing masks. It also asserted that COVID-19 wasn\u2019t airborne, a stance it didn\u2019t officially reverse until 2024.",
      "Another Trump administration complaint: None of WHO's chief executives \u2014 there have been nine since the organization was created in 1948 \u2014 have been Americans. Administration officials view that as unfair given how much the WHO relies on U.S. financial contributions and on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel.",

But U.S. officials did not give specifics about how many such arrangements are in place.",

      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Spain's government announced Tuesday it will grant legal status to potentially hundreds of thousands of immigrants living and working in the country without authorization, the latest example of how the country has bucked a trend toward increasingly harsh immigration policies seen in the United States and much of Europe.",
      "Spain's Minister of Migration, Elma Saiz, announced the extraordinary measure following the weekly cabinet meeting. She said her government will amend existing immigration laws by expedited decree to grant immigrants who are living in Spain without authorization legal residency of up to one year as well as permission to work.",
      "The permits will apply to those who arrived in Spain before Dec. 31, 2025, and who can prove they have lived in Spain for at least five months. They must also prove they have no criminal record.",
      "\u201cToday is a historic day,\u201d Saiz told journalists during a press conference. The measure could benefit between 500,000 and 800,000 people estimated by different organizations to be living in the shadows of Spanish society. Many are Latin American or African immigrants working in the agricultural, tourism or service sectors, backbones of Spain's growing economy.",
      "The expedited decree bypasses a similar bill that has stalled in parliament. Saiz said she expects immigrants will be able to start applying for their legal status from April once the decree comes into force.",

      "As she went into labor in March 1945, the Russians were advancing through Germany, and Bergen-Belsen was in chaos. Her daughter, Ilana, was born on March 19, 30 days before the camp was liberated by the British.",

      "\u201cMy mother said there was actually a lot of love in those places,\u201d Shalem recalled of the labor camps. \u201cThey used to walk along the river. There was romance.\u201d",

      "In 1944, the couple was separated. Hersz Kantorowicz would eventually perish in a death march just days before the war ended. Lola spent time in Auschwitz and the Hindenburg labor camp. She completed a death march to Bergen-Belsen in Germany while pregnant.",
      "\u201cIf they discovered she was pregnant, they would have killed her,\u201d Shalem said. \u201cShe hid her pregnancy from everyone, including her friends, because she didn\u2019t want the extra attention or anyone to give her their food.\"",

Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s Holocaust museum and research center, has documented over 2,000 babies born at the Bergen-Belsen refugee camp after its liberation, between 1945 and 1950. The museum at Bergen-Belsen was able to locate documentation of Ilana\u2019s birth, including the hour she was born, which is now kept at Yad Vashem.",

      "She noted how, in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, many survivors of that attack immediately began to speak about what happened to them.",
      "But the aftermath of the Holocaust, especially in Israel, was different. Many survivors were trying to forget what had happened. Ilana\u2019s mother often faced disbelief when she shared her story of giving birth in a concentration camp, so she mostly stopped telling it. Sometimes her mother would talk about what she endured with other survivor friends, but rarely with strangers, Shalem said.",
      "Shalem has never publicly shared the story of her mother, who died in 1991 at the age of 71. Last year, she completed a genealogy course at Yad Vashem and began to understand how few Holocaust survivors are left to share their stories.",
      "According to the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also referred to as the Claims Conference, there are approximately 196,600 living Holocaust survivors, half of whom live in Israel. Nearly 25,000 Holocaust survivors died last year. The median age of Holocaust survivors is 87, meaning most were very young children during the Holocaust. Shalem is among the youngest.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a situation that was very unusual, it probably required special strength to be able to believe,\u201d Shalem said.",
      "\u201cShe said that one of the things was that if she had known my father was killed, she wouldn\u2019t have tried so hard. She wanted him to know me.\u201d",

      "Men from South Asian countries, including India, Nepal and Bangladesh, complain of being duped into signing up to fight by recruiters promising jobs. Officials in Kenya, South Africa and Iraq say the same has happened to citizens from their countries.",
      "President Vladimir Putin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure \u2013 617,000 \u2013 in December 2023. It's unclear if those numbers are accurate.",
      "Still hidden are the numbers of military casualties, with Moscow having released limited official figures. The British Defense Ministry said last summer that more than 1 million Russian troops may have been killed or wounded.",
      "Independent Russian news site Mediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, scoured news reports, social media and government websites and collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed. More than 550 of those were foreigners from over two dozen countries.",
      "Unlike Ukraine, where martial law and nationwide mobilization has been in place since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Putin has resisted ordering a broad call-up.",
      "When a limited mobilization of 300,000 men was tried later that year, tens of thousands of people fled abroad. The effort stopped after a few weeks when the target was met, but a Putin decree left the door open for another call-up. It also made all military contracts effectively open-ended and barred soldiers from quitting service or being discharged, unless they reached certain age limits or were incapacitated by injuries.",
      "Since then, Moscow has largely relied on what it describes as voluntary enlistment.",
      "The flow of voluntary enlistees signing military contracts has remained strong, topping 400,000 last year, Putin said in December. It was not possible to independently verify the claim. Similar numbers were announced in 2024 and 2023.",
      "Activists say these contracts often stipulate a fixed term of service, such as one year, leading some potential enlistees to believe the commitment is temporary. But contracts are automatically extended indefinitely, they say.",
      "The government offers high pay and extensive benefits to enlistees. Regional authorities offer various enlistment bonuses, sometimes amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "In the Khanty-Mansi region of central Russia, for example, an enlistee would get about $50,000 in various bonuses, according to the local government. That's more than twice the average annual income in the region, where monthly salaries in the first 10 months of 2025 were reported to be just over $1,600.",
      "There also are tax breaks, debt relief and other perks.",
      "Despite Kremlin claims of relying on voluntary enlistment, media reports and rights groups say conscripts \u2014 men aged 18-30 performing fixed-term mandatory military service and exempted from being sent to Ukraine \u2014 are often coerced by superiors into signing contracts that send them into battle.",

      "AP spoke with three Bangladeshi men who escaped from the Russian military, including Rahman, who said that after arriving in Moscow, he and a group of fellow Bangladeshi workers were told to sign Russian documents that turned out to be military contracts. They were taken to an army camp for training in drone warfare techniques, medical evacuation procedures and basic combat skills using heavy weapons.",
      "Rahman protested, complaining that this was not the work he agreed to do. A Russian commander offered a stark reply through a translation app: \u201cYour agent sent you here. We bought you.\"",
      "The three Bangladeshi men shared harrowing accounts of being coerced into front-line tasks against their will, including advancing ahead of Russian forces, transporting supplies, evacuating wounded soldiers and recovering the dead.

      "Rahman took out a loan to pay the fee of 1.2 million Bangladeshi taka, about $9,800, to the broker as a fee. He arrived in Moscow in December 2024.",

      "With his military papers in order, Miajee was taken in January 2025 to a military camp in the captured city of Avdiivka. He showed the camp commander documents describing his experience and explained that his recruiter had instructed him to ask for \u201celectrical work.\u201d",

      "In the chilly Atlantic, 63-year-old Aminata Sall is soon kicking in rhythm with others, foam noodles tucked under her arms. On the beach, people with limited mobility are buried knee-deep in the sand and gently rotate their torsos in a therapy session meant to ease pain.",
      "Sall's doctor once warned her she could lose the ability to walk within five years because of rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that causes pain, stiffness and swelling in the lining of joints and can cause severe damage if left untreated.",

      "As life expectancy rises sharply across Africa, these diseases have become more common, often leaving older adults with pain and limited mobility. But prevention, diagnosis and rehabilitation services have not kept pace on a largely youthful continent whose public health systems prioritize infectious diseases, maternal care and children.",
      "Many older people have little access to geriatricians or other doctors and tend to forego diagnostics or treatment to cut costs.",
      "The aquagym emerged little over a decade ago as a rare, low-cost option to relieve pain and improve mobility.",
      "After Sall was diagnosed with her autoimmune condition, she said her doctor told her she would need surgery at a cost of about $10,000, which she could not afford. She was prescribed an anti-inflammatory drug, but it was later taken off the market due to complications.",

      "QAMISHLI, Syria -- Fighting this month between Syria's government and Kurdish-led forces left civilians on either side of the frontline fearing for their future or harboring resentment as the country's new leaders push forward with transition after years of civil war.",
      "The fighting ended with government forces capturing most of the territory previously held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the country\u2019s northeast, and a fragile ceasefire is holding. SDF fighters will be absorbed into Syria's army and police, ending months of disputes.",
      "The Arab-majority population in the areas that changed hands, Raqqa and Deir el-Zour, have celebrated the SDF's withdrawal after largely resenting its rule.",
      "But thousands of Kurdish residents of those areas fled, and non-Kurdish residents remain in Kurdish-majority enclaves still controlled by the SDF. The International Organization for Migration has registered more than 173,000 people displaced.",
      "Subhi Hannan is among them, sleeping in a chilly schoolroom in the SDF-controlled city of Qamishli with his wife, three children and his mother after fleeing Raqqa.",
      "The family is familiar with displacement after the years of civil war under former President Bashar Assad. They were first displaced from their hometown of Afrin in 2018, in an offensive by Turkish-backed rebels. Five years later, Hannan stepped on a landmine and lost his legs.",
      "During the insurgent offensive that ousted Assad in December 2024, the family fled again, landing in Raqqa.",
      "In the family\u2019s latest flight this month, Hannan said their convoy was stopped by government fighters, who arrested most of their escort of SDF fighters and killed one. Hannan said fighters also took his money and cell phone and confiscated the car the family was riding in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m 42 years old and I\u2019ve never seen something like this,\u201d Hannan said. \u201cI have two amputated legs, and they were hitting me.\u201d",
      "Now, he said, \u201cI just want security and stability, whether it\u2019s here or somewhere else.\u201d",
      "The father of another family in the convoy, Khalil Ebo, confirmed the confrontation and thefts by government forces, and said two of his sons were wounded in the crossfire.",
      "Syria\u2019s defense ministry in a statement acknowledged \u201ca number of violations of established laws and disciplinary regulations\u201d by its forces during this month's offensive and said it is taking legal action against perpetrators.",
      "The level of reported violence against civilians in the clashes between government and SDF fighters has been far lower than in fighting last year on Syria\u2019s coast and in the southern province of Sweida. Hundreds of civilians from the Alawite and Druze religious minorities were killed in revenge attacks, many of them carried out by government-affiliated fighters.",
      "This time, government forces opened \u201chumanitarian corridors\u201d in several areas for Kurdish and other civilians to flee. Areas captured by government forces, meanwhile, were largely Arab-majority with populations that welcomed their advance.",
      "One term of the ceasefire says government forces should not enter Kurdish-majority cities and towns. But residents of Kurdish enclaves remain fearful.",
      "The city of Kobani, surrounded by government-controlled territory, has been effectively besieged, with residents reporting cuts to electricity and water and shortages of essential supplies. A U.N. aid convoy entered the enclave for the first time Sunday.",

      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is heading to China, aiming to improve relations with Beijing amid tensions with the United States",
      "LONDON -- U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is heading to China, seeking a thaw in relations with Beijing at a time of strained ties with the United States.",
      "He's hoping for an economic boost to Britain, but risks the wrath of China hawks at home \u2013 and of U.S. President Donald Trump, who\u2019s already heaping tariffs and criticism on America\u2019s closest allies.",
      "Starmer is due to meet China\u2019s President Xi Jinping during the visit that starts Wednesday, the first by a U.K. leader since 2018. He is expected to be accompanied by U.K. Business Secretary Peter Kyle and dozens of corporate chiefs as Britain seeks Chinese technology and investment, alongside greater access to the world\u2019s second-largest economy for U.K. financial services, cars and Scotch whisky.",
      "\u201cChina is no longer just the world\u2019s factory; it is also becoming a global market,\u201d said Zhao Minghao, a professor in the Institute of International Studies at Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University.",
      "Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King\u2019s College London, said the trip comes as dramatic shifts in geopolitics create new opportunities for U.K.-Chinese relations.",
      "But he said \u201cStarmer is going to be talking to a very skeptical audience.",
      "\u201cBritain has not been very consistent in its relations with China. We have been very hot and cold,\u201d Brown said.",
      "The relationship has soured since the short-lived \u201cgolden era\u201d proclaimed in 2015 by Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, who took Xi to a traditional English pub during a state visit. Beijing\u2019s crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, China\u2019s support for Russia in the Ukraine war and growing concern about espionage and economic interference have widened the gap between London and Beijing.",
      "Cameron\u2019s Conservative successors barred Chinese investment in sensitive telecoms infrastructure and squeezed China out of investment in new U.K. nuclear power plants.",
      "Starmer\u2019s center-left Labour Party government carried out a review of relations with Beijing after it was elected 18 months ago. It says its approach is one of hard-headed pragmatism \u2013 protecting national security from Chinese espionage and interference while keeping up diplomatic dialogue and economic cooperation with the Asian superpower.",
      "Both Britain\u2019s economy \u2013 the world\u2019s sixth largest \u2013 and Starmer\u2019s popularity could use a boost.",
      "His government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised and ease a cost-of-living crisis for millions of households. Labour lags behind hard-right Reform UK in opinion polls, and nervous Labour lawmakers openly mull whether it would be better to ditch Starmer for a more charismatic leader, such as Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham.",
      "Starmer\u2019s visit to China comes as cracks are starting to appear in his attempt to strike up a warm relationship with Trump \u2013 efforts rewarded with a trade deal that reduced U.S. tariffs on Britain\u2019s key auto and aerospace industries.",

      "Starmer travels to Beijing days after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Next month it\u2019s the turn of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as some of America\u2019s strongest allies hedge their bets against the unpredictable Trump.",
      "Zhao said growing unease among U.S. allies over Washington\u2019s recent policy moves, including on tariffs, Greenland and the war in Ukraine, \u201chave triggered a wave among allies to recalibrate their policies to \u2018de-risk\u2019 from the United States.\u201d",
      "But rapprochement with Beijing brings the risk of a rift with Washington. Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on all Canadian goods after Carney struck a trade deal with China on his trip this month.",
      "Starmer\u2019s critics say the government is being naive about China\u2019s threat to Britain\u2019s security and weak in the face of pressure from Beijing.",
      "The trip follows U.K. approval of a 20,000 square-meter (around 215,000 square-foot) Chinese embassy near the Tower of London despite strong opposition from critics who say the \u201cmega-embassy\u201d will make it easier for China to conduct espionage and intimidate dissidents.",
      "Starmer also faces criticism over an agreement to hand over the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to Mauritius. The government says the move will secure the future of a key U.K.-U.S. military base against legal challenge, but critics argue it opens the door to Chinese influence. Last week Trump spoke out against the deal, reversing his previous support.",
      "Human rights are another tricky area. Chris Patten, who was governor of Hong Kong from 1992 until the British colony was handed back to China in 1997, said Starmer should be firm in raising disagreements over issues including the treatment of China\u2019s Uyghur minority and the imprisonment of Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigner and British citizen.",
      "\u201cYou have to say with them, without being impolite, exactly what you think,\u201d Patten said. \u201cThey know we\u2019re different, but they want to have a reasonable relationship with us and, particularly given the state of the world with Trump, we should want to have a reasonable relationship with them.\u201d",
      "Brown, from King's College, said Starmer will likely consider his trip a success if it secures significant investment and avoids major political pitfalls.",
      "\u201cWhat they\u2019re going to do is basically commit to consistency, a bit more predictability,\u201d he said. \u201cFriends where we can be friends, otherwise agree to disagree.\u201d",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests killed at least 6,126 people while many others still are feared dead, activists said Tuesday, as a U.S. aircraft carrier group arrived in the Mideast to lead any American military response to the crisis.",

      "Iran has repeatedly threatened to drag the entire Mideast into a war, though its air defenses and military are still reeling after the June war launched by Israel against the country.",
      "Both the Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah sat out from Israel\u2019s 12-day war on Iran that saw the United States bomb Iranian nuclear sites.

      "The new figures Tuesday came from the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has been accurate in multiple rounds of unrest in Iran. The group verifies each death with a network of activists on the ground in Iran.",
      "It identified the dead as including at least 5,777 protesters, 214 government-affiliated forces, 86 children and 49 civilians who weren't demonstrating. The crackdown has seen over 41,800 arrests, it added.",
      "The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll given authorities cutting off the internet and disrupting calls into the Islamic Republic.",
      "Iran\u2019s government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labeled the rest \u201cterrorists.\u201d In the past, Iran\u2019s theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",
      "That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest there in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "The protests in Iran began on Dec. 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran\u2019s theocracy, the scale of which is only starting to become clear as the country has faced more than two weeks of internet blackout \u2014 the most comprehensive in its history.",

      "Repression of immigrants is growing, and the funding to protect them is plummeting. Without ever mentioning the Trump administration or its policies directly, Barham Salih in an interview with The Associated Press said his office will have to be inventive to confront the crisis, which includes losing well over $1 billion in U.S. support.",
      "\u201cOf course it\u2019s a fight, undeniably so, but I think also I\u2019m hopeful and confident that there is enough humanity out there to really enable us to do that,\u201d said Salih, a former president of Iraq.",
      "He also was adamant on the need to safeguard the 1951 refugee convention as the Trump administration campaigns for other governments to join it in upending a decades-old system and redefining asylum rules.",
      "Salih, who took up his role as high commissioner for refugees on Jan. 1, described it as an international legal responsibility and a moral responsibility.",
      "According to his agency also known as UNHCR, there are 117.3 million forcibly displaced people around the world from 194 countries. Salih\u2019s challenge is supporting some 30 million refugees with significantly less funds.",
      "In 2024 and 2025, funding from the U.S. dropped from $2.1 billion to $800 million, and yet the country remains UNHCR\u2019s largest donor.",
      "\u201cResources made available to helping refugees are being constrained and limited in very, very significant way,\u201d Salih said.",
      "The Trump administration is also reviewing the U.S. asylum system, suspending the refugee program in 2025 and setting a limit for entries to 7,500, mostly white South Africans \u2014 a historic low for refugee admittance since the program\u2019s inception in 1980.",
      "The Trump administration also has tightened immigration enforcement as part of its promise to increase deportations while facing criticism for deportations to third countries and an uproar over two fatal shootings by federal officers and other deaths.",
      "\u201cWe have to accept the need for adapting with a new environment in the world,\u201d Salih said. His agency is seeking to be more cost-effective, \u201cto really deliver assistance to the people who need it, rather than be part of a system that sustains dependency on humanitarian assistance,\u201d he added.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) \u2014 Colombia on Tuesday blasted Ecuador\u2019s decision to hike up transportation fees for Colombian oil, calling the move an act of \u201caggression,\u201d as a trade war between the two Andean nations intensifies.",
      "Ecuador announced Monday a tenfold increase in fees for Colombian companies using its oil pipelines, raising the rate from $3 to $30 per barrel. The move would make it harder for oil companies in Colombia to use a pipeline that takes oil from western Ecuador and southwestern Colombia to ports along the Pacific Ocean.",
      "One of the companies that will most likely be affected is Colombia's state-run Ecopetrol, which uses the pipeline to move more than 12,000 barrels of oil per day.",
      "\u201cThis is a new aggression against the people,\u201d said Colombian Energy Minister Edwin Palma.",
      "Ecuador hiked its pipeline fees days after Colombia suspended electricity sales to its neighbor. The power cutoff was a major blow to Ecuador, which relies largely on hydroelectric power and suffered from serious power outages in 2024 following a spell of dry weather.",
      "The trade war between the neighboring countries started last Thursday, when Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa announced a 30% tariff on Colombian imports.",
      "Noboa, a conservative who has sought to deepen ties with the Trump administration, has described the tariffs as a \u201csecurity tax,\u201d saying last week on social platform X that Colombia was not taking \u201cfirm actions\u201d to fight drug cartels that operate along their shared border and send cocaine to Ecuador.",
      "Noboa said the tariffs would be in place \u201cuntil there is a true commitment\u201d on behalf of Colombia to fight drug trafficking and illegal mining.",
      "Colombian officials have dismissed the accusations, noting that under the administration of Colombian President Gustavo Petro there have been record numbers of cocaine seizures. However, production continues to hit all-time highs, driven by increased lab efficiency and a surge in cultivated hectares.",

      "Civil rights photographer and artist Gordon Parks' legacy continues to grow, even as the 20th anniversary of his death approaches",
      "Civil rights photographer and artist Gordon Parks\u2019 legacy continues to expand today, even as the 20th anniversary of his death arrives on March 7. However, the Gordon Parks Foundation, which celebrates the same milestone this year, is finding it harder to fund its work inspired by the director of \u201cThe Learning Tree\u201d and \u201cShaft.\u201d",
      "Though Gordon Parks Foundation Executive Director Peter W. Kunhardt, Jr., told The Associated Press that federal funding cuts to diversity, equity and inclusion programs have only had a limited direct impact on the foundation\u2019s work due to a \u201cstrong base of supporters,\u201d it isn\u2019t immune to the changing, more competitive funding landscape that many arts-focused nonprofits now face.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re definitely sensitive to the fact the world has drastically changed and the arts and DEI and culture have definitely taken a hit,\u201d said Kunhardt.",
      "That puts extra emphasis on fundraising events like the foundation\u2019s gala -- its largest annual fundraising event \u2013 especially in a major anniversary year.",
      "The foundation said Tuesday it will honor EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony) winner John Legend, Grammy winner Chance the Rapper, Mellon Foundation President Elizabeth Alexander, and artist Henry Taylor at its gala on May 19 in Manhattan. Advocate and philanthropist Lonnie Ali will also be honored at the event, accepting the award for her late husband Muhammad Ali, who was a longtime friend of Parks, and their entire family.",
      "\u201cWe need to preserve the past to inspire the future by honoring these individuals,\u201d Kunhardt said. \u201cThe particular people on this list for 20 years are very important because they represent many different disciplines that Gordon Parks focused in on and who have championed the arts and social justice.\u201d",
      "Parks was best known for his work at Life magazine, documenting race relations and American life for decades as the magazine\u2019s first Black staff photographer. He famously bought his first camera at a pawnshop and taught himself to use it at a mix of jobs in Minnesota.",
      "That work led to him receiving the Julius Rosenwald Fellowship in 1942, which provided a one-year apprenticeship under Roy Stryker at the Farm Security Administration, alongside acclaimed photographers including Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange. Parks wanted to provide similar support for young artists and the Gordon Parks Foundation now awards numerous fellowships in art, music and writing. Last year, the foundation launched a Legacy Acquisition Fund, which purchases the work of older artists in order to support them and their connection to Parks.",
      "Those programs, along with the star-studded 2021 HBO documentary \u201cA Choice of Weapons: Inspired by Gordon Parks,\u201d have fueled a resurgence of interest in Parks and his work.",
      "\u201cPeople who have had such an extraordinarily long life and so much output of such a high caliber like Parks are bound to become players who become even more important,\u201d said Casey Riley, chair of the Department of Global Contemporary Art at the Minneapolis Institute of Art. \u201cIf you\u2019re paying attention to what he was doing, it will be relevant to the moment.\u201d",
      "Riley -- who curated the museum\u2019s \u201cAmerican Gothic: Gordon Parks and Ella Watson\u201d exhibit, which focused on the creation of one of the 20th century\u2019s most influential photographs -- said that Parks is a \u201ctouchstone\u201d for many artists of color, especially Black American artists. However, the Kansas-born Parks has a special bond with artists from Minneapolis and St. Paul, where he spent his formative years as a photographer.",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says told U.S. President Donald Trump that he meant what he said in his speech at Davos, and he plans diversify away from the United States with a dozen new trade deals",
      "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Tuesday he told U.S. President Donald Trump that he meant what he said in his speech at Davos, and told him Canada plans to diversify away from the United States with a dozen new trade deals.",
      "Carney rolled his eyes and rejected U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u2019s contention to Fox News that he aggressively walked back his comments at the World Economic Forum during a phone call with Trump on Monday.",
      "\u201cTo be absolutely clear, and I said this to the president, I meant what I said in Davos,\u201d Carney said to reporters as he arrived for a Cabinet meeting in the capital, Ottawa.",
      "\u201cCanada was the first country to understand the change in U.S. trade policy that he initiated, and we\u2019re responding to that. \u201d",
      "In Davos at the World Economic Forum last week, Carney condemned economic coercion by great powers on smaller countries without mentioning Trump\u2019s name. The prime minister received widespread praise and attention for his remarks, upstaging Trump at the gathering.",
      "Trump threatened this past weekend to impose a 100% tariff on goods imported from Canada if America\u2019s northern neighbor went ahead with a trade deal with Beijing, though Carney has said Canada has no interest in negotiating a comprehensive trade deal with Beijing.",
      "Carney said Trump called him.",
      "\u201cI explained to him our arrangement with China. I explained to him what we\u2019re doing \u2014 12 new deals, four continents, in six months,\u201d Carney said. \u201cHe was impressed.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threat came amid an escalating war of words with Carney. The Republican president\u2019s push to acquire Greenland strained the NATO alliance, alarming Canada, which shares a 3,000-kilometer (1,864 mile) maritime border with Greenland in the Arctic. Trump has also previously talked about making Canada the 51st state.",
      "Carney has said his recent agreement with China merely cuts tariffs that were recently imposed on a few sectors. The prime minister plans to travel to India, Australia and other countries in effort to diversify trade away from dependence on the U.S., which takes more than 75% of Canada's exports.",
      "The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is up for renewal this year. Carney has set a goal for Canada to double its non-U.S. exports in the next decade.",

      "Carney said he also spoke to Trump about Ukraine, Venezuela and Arctic security in his phone call.",
      "Bessent said Carney spoke to Trump on Monday. The Treasury secretary told Fox News that Carney \u201cwas very aggressively walking back some of the unfortunate remarks he made at Davos.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course, Canada depends on the U.S.,\u201d Bessent said. \u201cThere\u2019s much more north-south trade than there could ever be east-west trade.\u201d",
      "Bessent said Canada is linked to the U.S. and that Carney should stop trying to \u201cpush his own globalist agenda.\u201d",
      "Dominic LeBlanc, Canada\u2019s minister responsible for Canada-U.S. trade, has compared Canada's recent trade deal with China to an agreement Trump made with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea last summer in which the U.S. cut some tariffs on China while Beijing moved to allow rare earth exports and lift a pause on purchasing U.S. soy.",
      "Trump\u2019s push to acquire Greenland has come after he has repeatedly needled Canada over its sovereignty and suggested it also be absorbed into the United States. He posted an altered image on social media last week showing a map of the United States that included Canada, Venezuela, Greenland and Cuba as part of its territory.",

      "PARIS -- French lawmakers approved a bill banning social media for children under 15, paving the way for the measure to enter into force at the start of the next school year in September, as the idea of setting a minimum age for use of the platforms gains momentum across Europe.",
      "The bill, which also bans the use of mobile phones in high schools, was adopted by a 130-21 vote late Monday. French President Emmanuel Macron has requested that the legislation be fast-tracked and it will now be discussed by the Senate in the coming weeks.",
      "\u201cBanning social media for those under 15: this is what scientists recommend, and this is what the French people are overwhelmingly calling for,\u201d Macron said after the vote. \u201cBecause our children\u2019s brains are not for sale \u2014 neither to American platforms nor to Chinese networks. Because their dreams must not be dictated by algorithms.\u201d",
      "The issue is one of the very few in a divided National Assembly to attract such broad support, despite critics from the hard left denouncing provisions of the bill as infringement on civil liberties. Weakened domestically since his decision to dissolve parliament plunged France into a prolonged political crisis, Macron has strongly supported the ban, which could become one of the final major measures adopted under his leadership before he leaves office next year.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A daylong hearing on Tuesday should make clear what factors played the biggest role in causing last January's midair collision near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people, and the National Transportation Safety Board will recommend what should be done to prevent similar tragedies.",
      "Everyone aboard an American Airlines jet flying from Wichita, Kansas, and an Army Black Hawk helicopter died when the two aircraft ran into each other and plummeted into the icy Potomac River on Jan. 29, 2025. It was the deadliest plane crash on U.S. soil since 2001.",

That\u2019s what I hope coming out of this. I hope we have clarity and urgency.\u201d",

      "Three of the world's biggest tech companies face a landmark trial in Los Angeles starting this week over claims that their platforms \u2014 Meta's Instagram, ByteDance's TikTok and Google's YouTube \u2014 deliberately addict and harm children.",
      "Jury selection starts this week in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. It's the first time the companies will argue their case before a jury, and the outcome could have profound effects on their businesses and how they will handle children using their platforms. The selection process is expected to take at least a few days, with 75 potential jurors questioned each day through at least Thursday. A fourth company named in the lawsuit, Snapchat parent company Snap Inc., settled the case last week for an undisclosed sum.",
      "At the core of the case is a 19-year-old identified only by the initials \u201cKGM,\" whose case could determine how thousands of other, similar lawsuits against social media companies will play out. She and two other plaintiffs have been selected for bellwether trials \u2014 essentially test cases for both sides to see how their arguments play out before a jury and what damages, if any, may be awarded, said Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow of technology policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.",
      "KGM claims that her use of social media from an early age addicted her to the technology and exacerbated depression and suicidal thoughts. Importantly, the lawsuit claims that this was done through deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits. This argument, if successful, could sidestep the companies' First Amendment shield and Section 230, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\u201cBorrowing heavily from the behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry, Defendants deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks. Experts have drawn similarities to the Big Tobacco trials that led to a 1998 settlement requiring cigarette companies to pay billions in health care costs and restrict marketing targeting minors.",
      "\u201cPlaintiffs are not merely the collateral damage of Defendants\u2019 products,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cThey are the direct victims of the intentional product design choices made by each Defendant. They are the intended targets of the harmful features that pushed them into self-destructive feedback loops.\u201d",
      "The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children, citing a bevy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.",
      "\u201cRecently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,\u201d Meta said in a recent blog post. \"But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens' well-being aren't clear-cut or universal. Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse.\"",

      "Worry often starts with the vague question, \u201cAm I spending too much?\u201d",

      "Many retirees treat their spending plan like an all-or-nothing system. This rigidity creates panic during market downturns.",
      "Instead, adopt a dynamic spending strategy. Slightly reduce or delay discretionary spending in poor market years. By reducing your withdrawal rate by just 10% when your portfolio is down, you dramatically reduce the risk of permanent capital depletion, allowing the assets time to recover.",
      "The high level of discretionary spending you need at age 65 will likely not be the same at age 85, especially once you have long-term care coverage (see No. 7).",
      "Expenses for travel, hobbies, dining out, and maintaining multiple homes typically decrease as you age. Knowing that your major risk (long-term care) is insured, you can trust that your remaining costs will naturally ease over the next two decades. Your money is working harder when you\u2019re younger and enjoying it most, and your needs will taper off as your capital naturally draws down.",
      "The greatest tactical threat to longevity is experiencing a large market crash early in retirement and having to sell depressed assets to pay for basics such as groceries. To protect yourself,",
      "maintain a six- to 12-month cash cushion outside of the market.",
      "This \u201crecession buffer\u201d allows your growth assets (equities) to sit untouched and recover during a market downturn, preventing you from locking in losses. This separation between your living money and your long-term growth money is the most direct way to eliminate panic during volatility.",
      "Future, unknown tax rates and large required minimum distributions from traditional retirement accounts are a major source of financial uncertainty.",
      "What can you do? Eliminate the tax uncertainty by creating a tax-free bucket.",
      "By using targeted Roth conversions\u2014using up lower tax brackets to recharacterize traditional IRAs\u2014you ensure a significant portion of your savings is shielded from all future tax increases. Having a large tax-free account gives you maximum flexibility to control your taxable income every year, protecting you from future legislation and eliminating the anxiety of surprise tax bills.",
      "Retirement is worry-free when your core, non-negotiable needs (housing, food, utilities) are covered by income sources shielded from market volatility.",
      "Social Security is your primary source of inflation-adjusted, government-backed income. While claiming at full retirement age is a safe minimum, aiming to delay Social Security until age 70 maximizes your lifetime benefit.",

      "After two weeks of intense political and legal scrutiny, the Federal Reserve will seek to make this week\u2019s meeting about interest rates as straightforward and uneventful as possible, though President Donald Trump probably still won\u2019t like the result",
      "WASHINGTON -- After two weeks of intense political and legal scrutiny, the Federal Reserve will seek to make this week's meeting about interest rates as straightforward and uneventful as possible, though President Donald Trump probably still won't like the result.",
      "The central bank's interest rate-setting committee is almost certain to keep its key short-term rate unchanged at about 3.6%, after three straight quarter-point cuts last year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said after December's meeting that they were \u201cwell positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves\u201d before making any further moves.",
      "When the Fed lowers its short-term rate, it can over time influence other borrowing costs for things like mortgages, auto loans and business borrowing, though those rates are also affected by market forces.",
      "This week's meeting \u2014 one of eight the Fed holds each year \u2014 will be overshadowed by the bombshell revelation earlier this month that the Justice Department has subpoenaed the Fed as part of a criminal investigation into testimony Powell gave last June about a $2.5 billion building renovation. It's the first time a sitting Fed chair has been investigated, and prompted an unusually public rebuke from Powell.",
      "Now, Powell will have to shift from a dispute with the White House to emphasizing that the Fed's decisions around interest rates are driven by economic concerns, not politics. Powell said Jan. 11 that the subpoenas were \u201cpretexts\u201d to punish the Fed for not cutting rates as sharply as Trump wants.",
      "Powell will be \"under even more pressure to underscore, \u2018everything we\u2019re doing here ... is all about the economics,\u2019\u201d said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist and chief economist at New Century Advisors. \"'We didn\u2019t think about the politics.'\u201d",
      "Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley and also a former Fed staffer, said that despite the scrutiny, the Fed can be expected to consider its interest rate policies like it always does.",
      "\u201cThe meetings have a regular flow to them,\u201d he said. \"There are presentations that are made, there are discussions that have to be had. ... Some of these other broader-based attacks on the Fed don't really come up.\"",
      "Not long after the Justice Department's subpoenas, the Supreme Court last week considered whether Trump can fire Fed governor Lisa Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. No president has fired a governor in the Fed's 112-year history. During an oral argument, the justices appeared to be leaning toward allowing her to stay in her job until the case is resolved.",

      "Unless businesses start cutting jobs or the unemployment rate rises, the Fed is unlikely to cut rates again for at least a few months, economists say. If inflation slowly declines this year, as economists expect, the Fed may cut again in the spring or summer. Wall Street investors expect just two quarter-point rate reductions this year, according to futures prices.",
      "Many economists expect growth could pick up in the coming months, which would be another reason to forego rate cuts. Gapen estimates that tax refunds could be about 20% higher this spring than last year as the Trump administration's tax cuts take effect. Refunds could average $3,500, Gapen said.",
      "The economy expanded at a 4.4% annual rate in last year's July-September quarter and may have grown at a similarly healthy pace in the final three months of last year. If such solid growth continues, Fed officials will likely wait to see if hiring picks up as well, further reducing the need for more rate cuts.",

      "President Donald Trump strong-armed America\u2019s biggest trading partners into pledging trillions of dollars of investment in the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has strong-armed many of America\u2019s biggest trading partners into pledging trillions of dollars of investment in the United States. But a study out Tuesday raises doubts about whether the money will actually materialize and questions how it would be spent if it did.",
      "\u201cHow realistic are these commitments?\u2019\u2019 write Gregory Auclair and Adnan Mazarei of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank that supports free trade. \u201cThe short answer is that they are clouded with uncertainty.\u2019\u2019",
      "They looked at more than $5 trillion in investment commitments made last year by the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and the Persian Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Trump used the threat of punitive tariffs \u2013 import taxes \u2013 to pry concessions out of those trading partners, including the investment pledges.",
      "The White House has published an even higher investment figure - $9.6 trillion \u2013 that includes public and private investment commitments from other countries. Trump himself, never one to undersell his achievements, has put the number far higher -- $17 billion or $18 billion -- though Auclair and Mazarei note that \u201cthe basis for his claim is not clear.\u2019\u2019",
      "All the numbers are huge. Total private investment in the United States was most recently running at a $5.4 trillion annual pace. In 2024, the last year for which figures are available, total foreign direct investment in the United States amounted to $151 billion. Direct investment includes money sunk into such things as factories and offices but not financial investments like stocks and bonds.",
      "\u201cThe pledged amounts are large,\u2019\u2019 Auclair and Mazarei write, \u201cbut their time horizon varies, and the metrics for measuring and thus verifying the pledges are generally unclear.\u2019\u2019 They note, for example, that the European Union\u2019s pledge to invest $600 billion in the United States \u201ccarries no legally binding commitment.\u2019\u2019",
      "The report also finds that some countries would strain to meet their pledges. For the Gulf countries, \u201cthe commitments are large relative to their financial resources,\u201d the researchers write.",
      "\u201cSaudi Arabia appears capable of meeting its targets, with some difficulty.\u2019\u2019 The United Arab Emirates and Qatar would find it even harder and might have to finance the investments by borrowing. \u201cIn all three cases, the commitments are nonbinding, and investments from these countries could fall well below headline numbers,\u2019\u2019 they write.",
      "Moreover, \u201cthese agreements have been reached under duress,\u2019\u2019 Mazarei, a former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily being done willingly.\u2019\u2019",
      "So trading partners could look for ways to escape their commitments \u2013 especially if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs Trump used to negotiate the one-sided agreements. A ruling is expected as early as February. \u201cOther countries may find a way to wiggle out,\u2019\u2019 Mazarei said.",

      "Trump said on social media that import taxes would be raised on autos, lumber and pharmaceutical drugs from South Korea with the rate on other goods going from 15% to 25%.

      "Experts say the massive winter storm hitting the American East is taking a multi-billion dollar toll on the U.S. economy",
      "HOUSTON -- The deadly and widespread winter storm paralyzing much of the American East with ice, snow and cold is also taking a multi-billion dollar bite out of the U.S. economy, experts figure.",
      "But how much? Economists and meteorologists are trying to get a handle on the disruption costs of winter weather disasters, which aren\u2019t as easy to calculate as buildings destroyed by hurricanes, floods and fires.",
      "\u201cEvents like this storm highlight just how interconnected our economy is with weather conditions. When major transportation hubs shut down or power grids fail, the cascading effects ripple through supply chains and business operations across multiple sectors simultaneously,\u201d said Jacob Fooks, a research economist for Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere at Colorado State University.",
      "Fooks said researchers don't have consensus, but most estimates suggest severe weather events collectively can cut gross domestic product by 0.5% to 2% annually \u2014 which he called \u201cvery substantial.\u201d",
      "With U.S. GDP at about $30 trillion annually, that would be from $150 billion to $600 billion.",
      "Most economists, meteorologists and disaster experts said it's too early to put a legitimate cost estimate on the weekend storm and upcoming week of subfreezing temperatures. But the private company AccuWeather announced that its preliminary estimate for the storm that grounded 11,400 flights is between $105 billion and $115 billion \u2014 an amount six other experts scoffed at as far too high and insufficiently detailed.",
      "\"A lot of it comes from the disruptions that occur to commerce, the cost of power outages,\" AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter told The Associated Press at the annual American Meteorological Society convention in a chilly Houston. \"Some businesses are going to be shut down for days or a week or more.\"",
      "It's why AccuWeather is calling this \u201cthe storm that shut it all down,\u201d Porter said. By Monday, it had killed at least 25 people.",
      "Add to that ice toppling electrical lines leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power, tree losses, damage to cars, and all those canceled flights, Porter said. He noted it will take time to reboot air travel and restore power.",
      "Climate economist Adam Smith, who used to run the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's billion-dollar weather disaster list, said this storm will easily cost multiple billions of dollars, making it the country's first billion-dollar weather disaster of 2026.",
      "But Smith, now a senior climate impact scientist at Climate Central, said it's nowhere near as costly as AccuWeather suggests. He said the private company has been an outlier among experts in climate impacts and economics. He pointed to the private company's initial estimate of $250 billion in damage from last year's Los Angeles wildfires. Several climate, risk and insurance groups all waited to do extensive analysis and all said the real amount was around $60 billion.",
      "AccuWeather\u2019s estimates are much higher because they take into account the \u201cbigger picture\u201d of indirect and long-term costs, Porter said, including the business supply chain as well as medical costs. Most other estimates are \u201cunder-describing the challenges that people in the community and business face,\u2019\u2019 he said, pointing to NOAA's billion-dollar disaster page which listed factors not considered. That page says NOAA's estimates \u201cshould be considered conservative with respect to what is truly lost.\u201d",

      "The Dallas-based airline\u2019s unusual seating process began as a way to get passengers on planes quickly and thereby reduce the time that aircraft and crews spent on the ground not making money. It helped Southwest operate more efficiently and to squeeze a few more flights into the daily schedule; the system also was a key reason Southwest remained profitable every year until the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "The open-seating arrangement became less democratic over time, however, as Southwest also had starting allowing passengers to pay extra for spots near the front of the line.",
      "An eight\u2011group boarding structure is replacing the find-your-own-seat scrum. Instead of numbered metal columns at departure gates, passengers will file through two alternating lanes once it's time for their group to board.",

For certain flights, passengers also will have the option of paying for priority boarding beginning 24 hours before departure.",

    "story": [
      "A new humanoid robot named Sprout, developed by Fauna Robotics, is making its debut",
      "NEW YORK -- As the new robot called Sprout walks around a Manhattan office, nodding its rectangular head, lifting its windshield wiper-like \u201ceyebrows\u201d and offering to shake your hand with its grippers, it looks nothing like the sleek and intimidating humanoids built by companies like Tesla.",
      "Sprout's charm is the point. A 5-year-old child could comfortably talk at eye level with this humanoid, which stands 3.5 feet (1 meter) tall and wears a soft, padded exterior of sage-green foam.",
      "Forged by stealth startup Fauna Robotics over two years of secret research and development, Sprout's public debut on Tuesday aims to jump-start a whole new industry of building \u201capproachable\u201d robots for homes, schools and social spaces.",
      "The robot is in many ways the first of its kind, at least in the United States, even as rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robot engineering have finally made it possible to start building such machines. If its emotive expressions and blinking lights seem vaguely familiar, it might be from generations of Star Wars droids and other endearingly clunky robotic sidekicks dreamed up in animation studios and children's literature.",
      "\u201cMost people in this industry take inspiration from the science fiction that we grew up with,\u201d said Fauna Robotics co-founder and CEO Rob Cochran. \u201cI think some do so from \u2018Westworld\u2019 and \u2018Terminator.\u2019 We do from WALL-E and Baymax and Rosie Jetson.\u201d",
      "The usual hypothesis for the commercialization of humanoid robots is that they will get their first jobs in warehouses or factories long before they are ready for homes. That's the path proposed for two of today's best-known prototypes: Tesla's Optimus, which CEO Elon Musk sees as the carmaker's future, and Boston Dynamics' Atlas, which parent company Hyundai plans to deploy in car manufacturing by 2028.",
      "Fauna looks to skip that step for an entirely different clientele: other robot tinkerers. Much as early personal computers and, later, smartphones sparked a culture of developers designing new games and applications, Sprout is a software developer platform more than just a robot. It's also a mechanically complex one that will cost buyers $50,000.",
      "That's a price some university research labs and technology entrepreneurs are already spending on China's Unitree, which sells a lightweight humanoid often seen at robotics conferences and competitions. Others have avoided Chinese hardware due to tariffs and broader security concerns.",
      "Cochran believes Fauna is \u201cthe first American company to be actively shipping robots as a developer platform\u201d and has been hand-delivering the first models. Early customers include Disney and Boston Dynamics.",
      "\u201cYou take it out of the box and you can start walking it around immediately,\u201d said Marc Theermann, chief strategy officer at Boston Dynamics, in a recent interview. \u201cSeeing their robot for the first time really lets you see the future a little bit. And if you squint, you can see how a robot like that would be welcomed into people\u2019s homes.\u201d",
      "Sprout can\u2019t lift heavy objects, but it can dance the Twist or the Floss, grab a toy block or teddy bear, or hoist itself from a chair to take a long stroll along the wood floors of Fauna\u2019s headquarters in New York City's Flatiron District.",
      "Cochran and co-founder Josh Merel, the company's chief technology officer, demonstrated the robot to The Associated Press in mid-January ahead of its public launch. Fauna employees and an AP reporter piloted the robot, using a video game controller, a phone application and a virtual-reality headset. Sprout also knows the office layout enough to be sent on a planned mission, such as to check out the inventory of the break room refrigerator.",
      "It walks slowly but steadily on uneven ground. Only once it came close to tripping, taking a sharp turn to avoid a person and instead hitting its foot on a protruding table wheel too low to the ground to be seen by Sprout's camera eyes. But the robot, built to handle what engineers call perturbation, quickly recovered its balance and kept walking, much like a clumsy person might.",

Among the first batch of Fauna's 50 employees, and a fan of science fiction writer Isaac Asimov, she previously worked on self-driving cars but was excited about joining a startup building something that might one day serve as a robot butler.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cute, and it\u2019s not too humanoid, and I think that actually makes it a lot more fun,\u201d Pervan said. \u201cIt's not verging on creepy or trying to be too human. It\u2019s like your buddy, your pal, that\u2019s a different thing than you.\u201d",
      "Starting a robot company can be unforgiving, especially one designing personal robots. One of the few successes, Roomba vacuum maker iRobot, had a decades-long run before filing for bankruptcy protection last month.",
      "Most others didn't last that long, like Anki, maker of the playful toy robot Cozmo, or Jibo, which went out of business less than a year after its dynamic talking speaker made the cover of Time Magazine\u2019s 2017 \u201cbest inventions\u201d edition.",
      "\u201cThere were a lot of really brilliant attempts. I think the technology wasn\u2019t quite there,\u201d Cochran said. \u201cI do think we\u2019re right on the precipice now where you could build a companion that is present, engaging, delightful to be around, and can also move around a space in a way that nothing ever has before.\u201d",
      "Merel, an expert in robot locomotion, previously worked for Google\u2019s DeepMind, where he focused on teaching robots using AI learning techniques in simulated environments, a controversial approach but now increasingly how robots are built. The science journal Nature published his study on an AI-powered virtual rat, co-authored with another of Fauna's research scientists, Diego Aldarondo.",
      "Cochran and Merel later worked together at CTRL-labs, a wearable neurotech company sold to Facebook in 2019. Cochran jokes that he then \u201cspent a misguided four years at Goldman Sachs\u201d before they decided to team up again.",
      "Improvements in AI, motors and batteries have accelerated humanoid development. But Fauna's founders agreed that the dystopian aesthetic of many prototypes \u2014 what Cochran calls \u201cindustrial automotive machismo\u201d \u2014 conveyed strength and confidence but wouldn't work for intimate human spaces.",
      "\u201cThey were generally quite big and physically dangerous to be around,\u201d Cochran said. \u201cStrong, heavy. If they fell on you, it\u2019d be a real problem.\u201d",
      "The duo brought in Anthony Moschella, who helped design Peloton's exercise bikes, treadmills and rowers and is an admirer of the abstract designs of Star Wars robots like R2-D2 and BB-8.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s build a system that human beings actually want to be around,\u201d said Moschella, now Fauna's vice president of hardware. \u201cI think it\u2019s incredible that so many robotics companies are not versed in the cultural context of what it means to be around a robot.\u201d",
      "Moschella said what happens next with Sprout will depend on how developers play around with it and what they learn. For Cochran, some of the most important judges have already approved. In a home video he keeps on his phone, his 2-year-old twins excitedly jump up and down as Sprout greets them.",

      "French lawmakers have approved a bill banning social media for children under 15",
      "PARIS -- French lawmakers approved a bill banning social media for children under 15, paving the way for the measure to enter into force at the start of the next school year in September, as the idea of setting a minimum age for use of the platforms gains momentum across Europe.",
      "The bill, which also bans the use of mobile phones in high schools, was adopted by a 130-21 vote late Monday. French President Emmanuel Macron has requested that the legislation be fast-tracked and it will now be discussed by the Senate in the coming weeks.",
      "\u201cBanning social media for those under 15: this is what scientists recommend, and this is what the French people are overwhelmingly calling for,\u201d Macron said after the vote. \u201cBecause our children\u2019s brains are not for sale \u2014 neither to American platforms nor to Chinese networks. Because their dreams must not be dictated by algorithms.\u201d",
      "The issue is one of the very few in a divided National Assembly to attract such broad support, despite critics from the hard left denouncing provisions of the bill as infringement on civil liberties. Weakened domestically since his decision to dissolve parliament plunged France into a prolonged political crisis, Macron has strongly supported the ban, which could become one of the final major measures adopted under his leadership before he leaves office next year.",
      "The French government had previously passed a law banning phone use in all primary and middle schools.",
      "The vote in the assembly came just days after the British government said it will consider banning young teenagers from social media as it tightens laws designed to protect children from harmful content and excessive screen time.",

      "According to France\u2019s health watchdog, one in two teenagers spends between two and five hours a day on a smartphone.

      "The report highlighted a range of harmful effects stemming from the use of social networks, including reduced self-esteem and increased exposure to content associated with risky behaviors such as self-harm, drug use and suicide. Several families in France have sued TikTok over teen suicides they say are linked to harmful content.",
      "The French ban won\u2019t cover online encyclopedias, educational or scientific directories, or platforms for the development and sharing of open-source software.",
      "In Australia, social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children since the country banned use of the platforms by those under 16, officials said. The law provoked fraught debates in Australia about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health and has prompted other countries to consider similar measures.",

      "Three of the world's biggest tech companies face a landmark trial in Los Angeles starting this week over claims that their platforms \u2014 Meta's Instagram, ByteDance's TikTok and Google's YouTube \u2014 deliberately addict and harm children.",
      "Jury selection starts this week in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. It's the first time the companies will argue their case before a jury, and the outcome could have profound effects on their businesses and how they will handle children using their platforms. The selection process is expected to take at least a few days, with 75 potential jurors questioned each day through at least Thursday. A fourth company named in the lawsuit, Snapchat parent company Snap Inc., settled the case last week for an undisclosed sum.",
      "At the core of the case is a 19-year-old identified only by the initials \u201cKGM,\" whose case could determine how thousands of other, similar lawsuits against social media companies will play out. She and two other plaintiffs have been selected for bellwether trials \u2014 essentially test cases for both sides to see how their arguments play out before a jury and what damages, if any, may be awarded, said Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow of technology policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.",
      "KGM claims that her use of social media from an early age addicted her to the technology and exacerbated depression and suicidal thoughts. Importantly, the lawsuit claims that this was done through deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits. This argument, if successful, could sidestep the companies' First Amendment shield and Section 230, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\u201cBorrowing heavily from the behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry, Defendants deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks. Experts have drawn similarities to the Big Tobacco trials that led to a 1998 settlement requiring cigarette companies to pay billions in health care costs and restrict marketing targeting minors.",
      "\u201cPlaintiffs are not merely the collateral damage of Defendants\u2019 products,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cThey are the direct victims of the intentional product design choices made by each Defendant. They are the intended targets of the harmful features that pushed them into self-destructive feedback loops.\u201d",
      "The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children, citing a bevy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.",
      "\u201cRecently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,\u201d Meta said in a recent blog post. \"But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens' well-being aren't clear-cut or universal. Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse.\"",

      "LONDON -- The European Union opened a formal investigation into Elon Musk's social media platform X on Monday after his artificial intelligence chatbot Grok started spewing nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images on the platform.",
      "European regulators also widened a separate, ongoing investigation into X's recommendation systems after the platform said it would switch to Grok's AI system to choose which posts users see.",
      "The scrutiny from Brussels comes after Grok sparked a global backlash by allowing users through its AI image generation and editing capabilities to undress people, putting females in transparent bikinis or revealing clothing. Researchers said some images appeared to include children. Some governments banned the service or issued warnings.",
      "The 27-nation EU's executive said it was looking into whether X has done enough as required by the bloc's digital regulations to contain the risks of spreading illegal content such as \"manipulated sexually explicit images.\"",
      "That includes content that \u201cmay amount to child sexual abuse material,\" the European Commission said. These risks have now \u201cmaterialized,\u201d the commission said, exposing the bloc's citizens to \u201cserious harm.\u201d",
      "Regulators will examine whether Grok is living up to its obligations under the Digital Services Act, the bloc's wide-ranging rulebook for keeping internet users safe from harmful content and products.",
      "In response to a request for comment, an X spokeswoman directed The Associated Press to an earlier statement that the company remains \u201ccommitted to making X a safe platform for everyone\" and that it has \u201czero tolerance\u201d for child sexual exploitation, nonconsensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.",
      "The X statement from Jan. 14 also said it would stop allowing users to depict people in \u201cbikinis, underwear or other revealing attire,\u201d but only in places where it has been deemed illegal.",
      "\u201cNon-consensual sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation,\u201d Henna Virkkunen, an executive vice-president at the commission, said in a statement.",

      "\u201cWith this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the DSA, or whether it treated rights of European citizens \u2014 including those of women and children - as collateral damage of its service,\u201d said Virkkunen, who oversees tech sovereignty, security and democracy.",
      "Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI launched Grok's image tool last summer. But the problem began snowballing only late last month when Grok seemingly granted a large number of user requests to modify images posted by others. The problem was amplified both because Musk pitches his chatbot as an edgier alternative with fewer safeguards than rivals, and because Grok\u2019s images are publicly visible, and can therefore be easily spread.",
      "The EU investigation covers only Grok's service on X, and not Grok's website and standalone app. That's because the DSA applies only to the biggest online platforms.",
      "There\u2019s no deadline for the bloc to resolve the case, which could end in either X pledging to change its behavior or a hefty fine.",
      "In December Brussels issued X with a 120-million euro (then-$140 million) fine as part of the earlier ongoing DSA investigation, for shortcomings including blue checkmarks that broke the rules on \u201cdeceptive design practices\u201d that risked exposing users to scams and manipulation.",
      "The bloc has also been scrutinizing X over allegations that Grok generated anti-Semitic material and has asked the site for more information.",

      "Millions of people rely on wearable devices to monitor how well they're sleeping",
      "ATLANTA -- Your watch says you had three hours of deep sleep. Should you believe it?",
      "Millions of people rely on phone apps and wearable devices like rings, smartwatches and sensors to monitor how well they're sleeping, but these trackers don\u2019t necessarily measure sleep directly. Instead, they infer states of slumber from signals like heart rate and movement, raising questions about how reliable the information is and how seriously it should be taken.",
      "The U.S. sleep-tracking devices market generated about $5 billion in 2023 and is expected to double in revenue by 2030, according to market research firm Grand View Research. As the devices continue to gain popularity, experts say it is important to understand what they can and cannot tell you, and how their data should be used.",
      "Here's a look at the technology \u2014 and why one expert thinks its full potential has yet to be realized.",
      "Whether it's an Apple Watch, a Fitbit, an Oura Ring or one of innumerable other competitors, health and fitness trackers largely take the same basic approach by recording the wearer's movements and heart rate while at rest, according to Daniel Forger, a University of Michigan math professor who researches the science behind sleep wearables.",
      "The algorithms used by major brands have become highly accurate for determining when someone is asleep, Forger said. The devices are also somewhat helpful for estimating sleep stages, though an in-lab study would be more precise, he said.",
      "\u201cIf you really want to know definitively how much non-REM sleep you\u2019re having versus REM sleep, that\u2019s where the in-lab studies really excel,\u201d Forger said.",
      "Dr. Chantale Branson, a neurologist and professor at the Morehouse School of Medicine, said she frequently has patients showing up with sleep scores from fitness trackers in hand, sometimes fixated on granular details such as how much REM sleep they got on a certain night.",
      "Branson says those patients are taking the wrong approach: the devices help highlight trends over time but should not be viewed as a definitive measure of one's sleep health. Nor should any single night's data be seen as significant.",
      "\u201cWe would have believed them with or without the device and worked on trying to figure out why they can't sleep \u2014 and that is what the wearables do not do,\u201d she said.",
      "Branson said she thinks people who check their sleep statistics every morning would be better served by spending their efforts on \u201csleep hygiene\u201d such as creating a relaxing bedtime routine, avoiding screens before bed and making sure their sleep environment is comfortable. She advises those concerned about their sleep to consult a clinician before spending money on a wearable.",
      "Forger takes a more favorable view toward the devices, which he says help keep the overlooked importance of sleep front of mind. He recommends them even for people without significant sleep issues, saying they can offer insights that help users fine-tune their routines and feel more alert during the day.",
      "\u201cSeeing if your biological clock is in sync is a huge benefit because even if you\u2019re giving yourself the right amount of time, if you\u2019re sleeping at the wrong times, the sleep won\u2019t be as efficient,\u201d Forger said.",
      "Kate Stoye, an Atlanta-area middle school teacher, bought an Oura Ring last summer, having heard positive things from friends who used it as a fertility tracker: \u201cIt\u2019s so accurate,\u201d she said. Stoye found the ring to be just as helpful with tracking her sleep. After noticing that the few nights she drank alcohol coincided with poorer sleep quality, she decided to give up alcohol.",

      "Mai Barreneche, who works in advertising in New York City, used to wear her Oura Ring constantly. She said it helped her develop good sleep habits and encouraged her to maintain a daily morning exercise regimen. But as a metric-driven person, she became \"obsessed\" enough with her nightly sleep scores that it began to cause her anxiety \u2014 a modern condition that researchers have dubbed \u201corthosomnia.\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember I would go to bed thinking about the score I was going to get in the morning,\u201d Barreneche said.",
      "Barreneche decided not to wear her ring on a beach vacation a few years ago, and when she returned home, she never put it back on. She said she has maintained the good habits the device pointed her toward, but no longer wants the stress of monitoring her nightly scores.",
      "Branson, of the Morehouse School of Medicine, said she's observed similar score-induced anxiety as a recurring issue for some patients, particularly those who set goals to achieve a certain amount of REM sleep or who shared their nightly scores with friends using the same device. Comparing sleep types and stages is ill-advised since individual needs vary by age, genetics and other factors, she said.",
      "\u201cThese devices are supposed to help you,\" Branson said. \"And if you feel anxious or worried or frustrated about it, then it\u2019s not helpful, and you should really talk to a professional.\u201d",
      "Forger thinks the promise of wearables has been underestimated, with emerging research suggesting the devices could one day be designed to help detect infections before symptoms appear and to flag sleep pattern changes that may signal the onset of depression or an increased risk of relapse.",
      "\u201cThe body is making these really interesting and really important decisions that we\u2019re not aware of to keep us healthy and active and alert at the right times of day,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have an infection, that rhythm very quickly starts to disappear because the body goes into overdrive to start fighting the infection. Those are the kind of things we can pick up.\u201d",
      "The technology could be particularly useful in low-resource communities, where wearables could help health issues to be identified more quickly and monitored remotely without requiring access to doctors or specialized clinics, according to Forger.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this really important story that\u2019s about to come out: About just how understanding sleep rhythms and sleep architecture is going to generally improve our lives,\u201d he said.",

      "Winter has its fans, but even those who enjoy playing in the snow probably dislike the chore of clearing up after a big storm that dumps several inches or even feet of snow and ice.",
      "It's easy to dash to the closest hardware store to grab a bag of salt, but experts say there are a lot of environmental and other factors to consider when tackling all that ice and snow.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Rock salt, also known as sodium chloride, is the cheapest and most commonly used product. But it's not great for the environment and it's not the most effective option out there.",
      "\"There's a chart we reference that\u2019s chemical effectiveness at certain temperatures. And really, when you get to about 15 degrees or colder, you can keep applying more and more rock salt and it\u2019s not going to do any more than it already does,\u201d said Martin Tirado, CEO of the Snow and Ice Management Association, a trade group for industry professionals.",
      "In those conditions, other products \u2014 calcium chloride, magnesium chloride \u2014 release heat that helps the salt work better, Tirado said.",
      "The different formulations vary in other ways, too, including how quickly they work, their corrosiveness and how they interact with moisture. Calcium chloride and magnesium chloride can cost at least twice as much as rock salt.",
      "But all contain chlorides that can pollute fresh water, damage shrubs, trees and grass and crumble concrete sidewalks, stoops and driveways.",
      "Blends and coatings can reduce the corrosive nature and environmental hazards of these salts, experts say.",
      "Calcium manganese acetate is one of the tamest de-icing products out there, developed specifically to replace rock salt and be more environmentally friendly. It is biodegradable, a corrosion inhibitor, and typically used as a liquid. But it is much more expensive and can still create issues with dissolved oxygen on bodies of water.",
      "Pamela Bennett, a horticulture professor at Ohio State, said rock salt is the worst for plants. It gets them in two ways: through the roots and through the air.",
      "Salt percolates through the soil. When plants start to draw in salty water in the spring, that dries roots, leading to dry leaves. Brown tips on leaves indicate the soil might have gotten too salty.",
      "Salt can also reach plant foliage \u2014 in the winter, that's evergreens \u2014 directly when it's carried by mist and spray. That's an issue that's worse on major roads as a lot of traffic moves quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a lot of road salt on the highways, cars are splashing and wind blows it. That salt turns into what looks like a burn,\u201d Bennett says.",
      "Most people walking their dog in snowy places have seen what happens when they walk across a heavy salt treatment \u2014 stopping suddenly and lifting a paw as if in pain.",
      "\u201cTheir paw pads get dry or they get little cuts because those crystals are sharp, and then they\u2019re chewing them because that\u2019s the only way they know to make it feel better,\u201d said Alison Manchester, an assistant clinical sciences professor at Cornell University. If they swallow enough salt, it can lead to vomiting, too.",

      "Sand that runs off into freshwater bodies \u2014 lakes, streams and rivers \u2014 can kill natural growth, Tirado said.",
      "Sand can also accumulate in your soil, eventually becoming a problem for plant growth. It can even make a type of concrete when it mixes in clay-heavy soils, experts say.",
      "Unconventional solutions are out there. You can buy a de-icer that wraps its chlorides in beet juice or beet extract that coats the granules for a variety of benefits, including melting ice faster, working in colder temperatures and staying where it's put. And a Korean company, Star's Tech, is working with material taken from invasive starfish to produce a de-icer that it says more slowly releases chloride material and thus avoids some of the corrosion and environmental problems of salt.",
      "Experts say preparation and strategy can make clearing ice easier. That starts with watching forecasts to see how much snow is expected.",
      "\u201cPeople wait until after the storm to start shoveling,\" Tirado said. \"That\u2019s fine if you\u2019re having 1 to 2 inches. If you start getting 3, 4 or more inches than that, you can\u2019t wait ... you need to go out multiple times.

      "\u201cThe key here is to not use too much and scatter it too much,\" said David Orr, director of the Local Roads Program at Cornell. \u201cWe also do probably need to get into the habit that it may not be perfectly bare and that can be OK.\"",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google is leveraging its artificial intelligence technology to open a new peephole for its dominant search engine to tailor answers that draw upon people's interests, habits, travel itineraries and photo libraries.",
      "The new option rolling out Thursday will give millions of people the option of turning on a recently introduced tool called \u201cPersonal Intelligence\u201d within the AI mode that has been available on Google's search engine since last year. The technology will be first offered in the U.S. to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers, as well as an option within its experimental Labs division for anyone with a personal Google account.",
      "If turned on, the new tool will plug Google's AI Mode into Gmail and the Google Photos app so the technology can learn more about each user's life and deliver more relevant answers tailored to personal tastes.",
      "For instance, someone might ask for suggestions for a weekend getaway and get a quick recommendation based on past trips and experiences. Or, when in AI mode, the search engine might automatically know a person's favorite restaurants or recognize preferred clothing styles by reviewing old pictures stored in Google Photos.",
      "\u201cPersonal Intelligence transforms Search into an experience that feels uniquely yours by connecting the dots across your Google apps,\u201d Robby Stein, a vice president in Google Search, wrote in a blog post. Stein also warned Personal Intelligence won't always deliver the best answers, a pitfall that he said users can help correct by telling AI mode with words or a thumbs-down symbol.",
      "Turning on the option will require users to trust Google's search engine to protect the details that it is fed about their lives. But millions of people already have been doing that implicitly for decades while entering sometimes intimate queries into the search engine or sharing personal information within Gmail and the Photos app.",

      "A new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track space junk by tuning into their sonic booms",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- As more and more space junk comes crashing down, a new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track incoming objects by tuning into their sonic booms.",
      "Scientists reported Thursday that seismic readings from sonic booms that were generated when a discarded module from a Chinese crew capsule reentered over Southern California in 2024 allowed them to place the object's path nearly 20 miles (30 kilometers) farther south than radar had predicted from orbit.",
      "Using this method to track uncontrolled objects plummeting at supersonic speeds, they said, could help recovery teams reach any surviving pieces more quickly \u2014 crucial if the debris is dangerous.",
      "\u201cThe problem at the moment is we can track stuff very well in space,\u201d said Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Benjamin Fernando, the lead researcher. \u201cBut once it gets to the point that it\u2019s actually breaking up in the atmosphere, it becomes very difficult to track.\u201d",
      "His team\u2019s findings, published in the journal Science, focus on just one debris event. But the researchers already have used publicly available data from seismic networks to track a few dozen other reentries, including debris from three failed SpaceX Starship test flights in Texas.",
      "A growing concern among scientists and others is that falling space debris could strike a plane in flight.",
      "\u201cThere are thousands, tens of thousands, more satellites in orbit than there were 10 years ago,\u201d including SpaceX's Starlinks and other companies' internet satellites, said Fernando. \u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t really have anything other than the word of the company to say that when they break up, they completely burn up in the atmosphere.\u201d",
      "Fernando, who normally studies quakes on the moon and Mars, teamed up with Imperial College London\u2019s Constantinos Charalambous the day after the Chinese debris streaked across the California sky in 2024. Over time, they gathered data from more than 120 seismometers that captured the sonic booms from the reentry, using that data to plot the object's suspected path.",
      "China\u2019s out-of-control module had been abandoned in a decaying orbit ever since it was cut loose from the Shenzhou-15 capsule returning three Chinese astronauts from their country's space station in 2023. The 1.5-ton (1.36-metric tonne) module \u2014 more than 3 feet (1 meter) in size \u2014 broke into countless smaller pieces as it plummeted through the atmosphere, resulting in multiple sonic booms. Besides attempting to trace the object\u2019s fall, the seismic readings provided a sense of the cascading breakup, Fernando said.",

      "\u201cThe Puerto Rico grid cannot afford to run on more distributed solar power,\u201d the message states. \u201cThe rapid, widespread deployment of rooftop solar has created fluctuations in Puerto Rico\u2019s grid, leading to unacceptable instability and fragility.\u201d",
      "Javier R\u00faa Jovet, public policy director for Puerto Rico\u2019s Solar and Energy Storage Association, disputed that statement in a phone interview Thursday.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s helping avoid blackouts,\u201d he said, adding that the inverters of those systems also help regulate fluctuations across the grid.",
      "He said he was saddened by the cancellation of the solar projects. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy, honestly,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are funds for the most needy.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, the Energy Department canceled three programs, including one worth $400 million, that would have seen solar and battery storage systems installed in low-income homes and those with medical needs.",
      "In its email, the department said that on Jan. 9, it would reallocate up to $350 million from private distributed solar systems to support fixes to improve the generation of power in Puerto Rico. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if that funding has been allocated.",
      "One of those programs would have financed solar projects for 150 low-income households on the tiny Puerto Rican island of Culebra.",
      "\u201cThe people are really upset and angry,\u201d said Dan Whittle, an associate vice president with the Environmental Defense Fund, which was overseeing that project. \u201cThey\u2019re seeing other people keep the lights on during these power outages, and they\u2019re not sure why they\u2019re not included.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration has unveiled 15 new drugs selected for a Medicare drug price negotiation program that allows the federal government to haggle directly with drug manufacturers",
      "NEW YORK -- Drugs that treat Type 2 diabetes, HIV and arthritis are among 15 new medications chosen for a Medicare drug price negotiation program that allows the federal government to haggle directly with drug manufacturers, the Trump administration said Tuesday.",
      "The drugs selected include some of the medications on which Medicare spends the most money. That means the deals negotiated this year have the potential to deliver significant savings to taxpayers when they go into effect in 2028.",
      "\u201cFor too long, seniors and taxpayers have paid the price for skyrocketing prescription drug costs,\u201d Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, CMS is taking strong action to target the most expensive drugs in Medicare, negotiate fair prices, and make sure the system works for patients \u2014 not special interests.\u201d",
      "The federal government had until Feb. 1 to announce its list of 15 drugs. The negotiations take place under a 2022 law that allows Medicare to haggle over the price it pays on the most popular and expensive prescription drugs used by older Americans.",
      "The government already has negotiated prices for 25 prescription drugs covered by Medicare, including the massively popular GLP-1 weight-loss and diabetes drugs Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy. This year\u2019s negotiations mark the third round of the program and would mean a total of 40 drugs with lower prices for Medicare enrollees.",
      "This year also marks the first time drugs payable under Medicare Part B are eligible for inclusion in the program. Medicare Part B drugs are outpatient prescriptions, such as medications infused or injected at a doctor\u2019s office. Retail prescription drugs covered under Medicare Part D are also eligible, as they were in past years.",
      "The newly announced drugs up for negotiation include the popular Type 2 diabetes drug Trulicity and an HIV medication called Biktarvy. The neurotoxin Botox, frequently used to reduce the appearance of wrinkles, will also have its price negotiated, but only for Medicare-covered uses, such as treating migraines or overactive bladders.",
      "Among the other drugs selected are treatments for psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, chronic lung disease, depression and various cancers.",
      "Over the past year, some 1.8 million Medicare Part B or Part D enrollees used the 15 drugs, according to the Trump administration. They accounted for about 6% in total Part B and Part D spending, CMS said.",

      "NEW YORK -- A man on trial for bludgeoning four men to death with a metal bar as they slept on the New York City streets had been diagnosed with schizophrenia when he left jail months earlier and was hearing voices telling him he needed to kill 40 people or he would die too, his lawyer told jurors on Tuesday.",
      "Randy Santos, 31, is asserting an insanity defense at his trial in state court in Manhattan. Through his lawyers, he has acknowledged committing the 2019 Chinatown rampage. But, they argue, he is not criminally responsible because mental illness has polluted his mind with irrational thoughts and left him prone to violence.",
      "If they succeed, Santos could be sent to a psychiatric treatment facility instead of prison.",
      "\u201cHe needed the voices to stop. He needed to save his own life,\" Santos\u2019 lawyer, Marnie Zien, said in an opening statement. \u201cHe saw no other way out.\u201d",
      "Santos, 31, has pleaded not guilty to charges including first-degree murder in the deaths of Florencio Moran, Nazario V\u00e1squez Villegas, Anthony Manson and Chuen Kok and attempted murder charges for assaults that left two other men severely injured. They were among 319 killings in New York City in 2019, including 52 in Manhattan.",
      "Surveillance video captured Santos \u201crepeatedly lifting the bar up over his head and bringing it down on the head\u201d of one victim, Assistant District Attorney Alfred Peterson told jurors.",
      "A couple out on a date on Manhattan\u2019s Bowery street saw him beating another man with the same weapon, Peterson said. Police found Santos carrying the bar, which was covered with blood and hair. Testing showed it had his DNA on one end and blood from some of his victims on the other, the prosecutor said.",
      "If the jury convicts Santos, rejecting his insanity defense, he could be sentenced to life in prison. Otherwise, he could be involuntarily committed to treatment for as long as necessary.",
      "Peterson urged jurors to look past Santos' mental health claims and find him guilty on all charges, telling them that evidence will show that Santos \u201cknew exactly what he was doing and the consequences of what he was doing \u2014 that he was killing these men,\" the prosecutor said.",
      "Santos looked up and down the street and \u201csaw the coast was clear\u201d before starting the attack, Peterson said. He then paused to let a pedestrian \u2014 and potential witness \u2014 leave the area before wailing on another man, Peterson said. He knew \u201cit was legally and morally wrong,\u201d the prosecutor said.",
      "Santos even recognized himself in surveillance video of the attack, Peterson said. Shown the footage after his arrest, he told police: \u201cYea, that\u2019s me.\u201d",
      "Santos, a native of the Dominican Republic who moved to New York as a child, attacked five men between 1:30 a.m. and 2 a.m. on Oct. 5, 2019, bashing their heads repeatedly with a 4-foot (1.2 meter) bar he found on the street, Peterson said. The victims ranged in age from 39 to 83.",
      "The lone survivor, critically injured 49-year-old David Hernandez, staggered to a nearby street where police officers were trying to revive another Santos victim.",

      "Virginia Oliver, one of the world's oldest lobster fishers, has died at 105",
      "Virginia Oliver, one of the oldest lobster fishers in the world who trapped crustaceans in Maine for nearly a century, has died. She was 105.",
      "Born in Rockland, Maine, Oliver started trapping lobsters at age 8 alongside her father and older brother at a time when few women worked on the water in the male-dominated industry. She fell in love with the business and went on to become known as the \u201clobster lady\u201d as she faithfully tended traps for decades",
      "\u201cI like doing it, I like being along the water,\u201d she told The Associated Press in 2021. \u201cAnd so I\u2019m going to keep on doing it just as long as I can.\u201d",
      "Oliver died Wednesday, according to a family obituary published Monday.",
      "\u201cHer life has been celebrated in books, articles, and across social media platforms worldwide,\u201d the obituary states. \u201cYet despite her renown, she remained quiet and humble, greeting everyone with a quick, radiant smile and eyes that literally twinkled.\u201d",

      "Yet many of the aspects of the job remained the same. She had to get up in the early morning hours \u2014 long before dawn \u2014 and use small fish called menhaden, or pogies, to lure lobsters from a boat once owned by her late husband, the \u201cVirginia.\u201d",
      "\u201cVirginia was more than a local icon; she was a living piece of Maine\u2019s maritime history,\u201d the Maine Lobster Festival said in a statement honoring Oliver, where she once served as grand marshal of the festival's parade.",
      "Maine Gov. Janet Mills, who once presented Oliver with a special state recognition for her birthday, posted on social media that the lobster lady's life inspired \"the next century of hardworking Maine fishermen.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- Sen. Bill Cassidy didn't simply criticize the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.",
      "Following the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer, the Louisiana Republican warned of broader implications for the federal government.",
      "\u201cThe credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake,\u201d Cassidy wrote in a social media post, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cThere must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.\u201d",
      "Trust is one of a president's most valuable currencies, especially in a time of crisis. During his second term, President Donald Trump has persistently undermined the trust and credibility of major universities, national law firms and media and taken punitive actions against them. His supporters largely either endorsed those actions or stayed mum.",
      "Now the credibility question is aimed at his administration. While the criticism is not directly aimed at the president by his supporters, it is a sign that trust is eroding over some of his most important policies. Administration officials gave one account of the shooting in Minneapolis and contemporaneous video provided a decidedly different one.",
      "In the hours after Pretti's killing, top Trump officials including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem were quick to cast Pretti as an instigator who \u201capproached\u201d officers with a gun and acted violently. But videos from the scene show Pretti being pushed by an officer before a half-dozen agents descend on him.",
      "During the scuffle, he held a phone but is never seen brandishing the 9mm semiautomatic handgun police say he was licensed to carry. The administration has said investigations are ongoing, though information hasn't yet emerged to support some of the provocative initial claims.",
      "\u201cWe trust our national leaders to tell us accurately about the world that we don\u2019t experience directly but about which they have knowledge,\u201d said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIf someone is credible in that role, then their description of reality should match your perception of reality if you\u2019re a dispassionate, fair individual.\u201d",
      "The White House seemed to try to ease the conflict Monday. Trump and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz spoke and both suggested their conversation was productive. Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, who has been at the center of the administration\u2019s aggressive immigration enforcement surge nationwide, is expected to soon leave Minneapolis.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, meanwhile, sought to distance Trump from some of the initial claims about Pretti \u2014 including allegations that he was a domestic terrorist \u2014 noting they didn't come from the president himself.",
      "Still, lawmakers from both parties \u2014 including many Republicans \u2014 called for independent investigations and, perhaps most importantly, trust.",
      "In calling for a \u201ctransparent, independent investigation,\u201d Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, wrote to constituents online that \u201cyou've trusted me, and maintaining that trust matters.\u201d",
      "\u201cI disagree with Secretary Noem\u2019s premature DHS response, which came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Trump and his team have spent much of his second term studiously feeding content to social media platforms to engage their most loyal supporters in ways that independent fact checkers have found to be distorted or baseless.

      "Minnesota also went to court to preserve evidence from the Saturday shooting of Alex Pretti after its own investigators were blocked from the scene by federal authorities.",
      "Experts say the line being drawn between Minnesota and the U.S. government goes against years of cooperation between local and federal agencies on law enforcement missions.",

      "Former federal prosecutors under Republican and Democratic presidential administrations said the divide was deeply troubling, though a call Monday between Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and President Donald Trump may signal a way forward after both expressed that progress was made.",
      "The Minnesota Department of Corrections launched a website its leaders said was dedicated to combatting Department of Homeland Security misinformation after Pretti was killed.

      "The department also issued a news release trying to dispel federal claims about the criminal records of people sought by federal agents, including the person at the center of an operation Saturday near where Pretti was shot.

U.S. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino had said at a news conference Saturday that the man had a significant criminal history.",

      "President Donald Trump is taking a more conciliatory approach with Democratic leaders in Minnesota",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump shifted toward a more conciliatory approach with Democratic leaders in Minnesota on Monday, a sudden change in tack following an outcry over the second fatal shooting by federal agents in the state this month during the administration's nationwide crackdown on undocumented immigrants.",
      "The about-face comes after Saturday\u2019s shooting death of Alex Pretti by federal agents raised doubts \u2014 including from some Republicans \u2014 over how the Trump administration has gone about aggressively deporting migrants and confronting protesters opposed to the policy.",
      "But it's just the latest in a string of moments where Trump has first taken a maximalist position only to appear to later retreat.",
      "Earlier this month, Trump repeatedly threatened Iran with military action if his administration found the Islamic Republic was using deadly force to squelch recent antigovernment protests. Human rights groups said thousands were killed, but Trump says he\u2019s holding off on acting after he received assurances Tehran was suspending hundreds of planned executions.",
      "Last week, Trump first announced plans to impose new tariffs on European allies that refused to go along with his calls for the U.S. to take control of the Arctic territory of Greenland \u2014 only to abruptly cancel the tariffs after saying he\u2019d come to terms of the \u201cframework\u201d of an agreement. The White House offered scant details about the deal, which Trump announced the day after the stock market saw one of its worst days in months in response to his tariff threat.",
      "Then on Monday, Trump's administration changed up oversight of his immigration operation in Minnesota, and the typically bombastic Trump offered a warmer tone toward Gov. Tim Walz after speaking with the Democrat, saying he and Walz were now on a \u201csimilar wavelength.\u201d",
      "It was a particularly jarring turnabout for Trump, who had promised to be uncompromising on carrying out mass deportations of undocumented migrants during his 2024 campaign \u2014 and because Trump has repeatedly scorched Walz and other Minnesota Democrats in personal terms for resisting his policies.",
      "Trump said he had dispatched border czar Tom Homan to take charge. Meanwhile, senior Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino and some agents were expected to leave Minneapolis as early as Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Trump declared on social media that Walz \u201cwas happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota, and so am I!\u201d Later, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey confirmed that some agents would be leaving the city after he spoke with Trump \u2014 and suggested that the president seemed to be coming to the conclusion that the current state of federal operations was unsustainable. Homan and Frey were expected to meet Tuesday.",
      "Trump's change-up in Minnesota came after some Republicans questioned federal agents' tactics in Saturday's shooting as well as the White House's response. Some high-ranking administration officials had branded Pretti a domestic terrorist even as videos of the encounter contradicted their narrative.",
      "Minnesota gubernatorial candidate Chris Madel, a Minneapolis attorney, ended his GOP campaign in a surprise video announcement Monday, calling the recent immigration enforcement operation in the Twin Cities an \u201cunmitigated disaster\u201d and saying he no longer wanted to be a member of the party because of it.",
      "Meanwhile, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who has been a strong supporter of Trump\u2019s crackdown on immigration, offered measured criticism in an interview with conservative radio host Mark Davis, saying the White House needs to \u201crecalibrate\u201d what it was doing in Minnesota. Vermont's Republican Gov. Phil Scott called on Trump to reset and de-escalate.",
      "\u201cAt best, these federal immigration operations are a complete failure of coordination of acceptable public safety and law enforcement practices training, and leadership,\u201d Scott said. \u201cAt worst, it\u2019s a deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens that\u2019s resulting in the murder of Americans.\u201d",

      "MEXICO CITY -- A group of lawyers and family members of important cartel figures accused Mexico's government on Tuesday of breaking the law by sending nearly a hundred Mexican citizens to the United States without an extradition order.",
      "It comes less than a week after the administration of Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum sent 37 detained cartel members to the U.S. in what observers have described as an offering by Mexican authorities to offset mounting threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to take military action against cartels.",
      "Since last February, Mexico has sent a total of 92 cartel members in three separate transfers to the U.S. requested by the Trump administration. It's part of a larger strategy by Sheinbaum to crack down on cartels and maintain a positive relationship with the Trump.",
      "The transfers have been at the center of a legal debate that has only gained more traction after last week's hand over. Mexico\u2019s government has maintained the transfers were legal, carried out in the name of national security. The Trump administration said the capos were wanted for crimes in the U.S. and many of them had outstanding extradition requests by the U.S.",
      "In a press conference on Tuesday, lawyers for the cartel members asserted they were denied due process because they were sent to the U.S. without an extradition order, which requires a lengthy legal process in Mexico.",
      "\u201cMexico is currently under intense pressure from the United States,\u201d said Yarey S\u00e1nchez Lagunas, the lawyer of two people transferred to the U.S. in the last year. \u201cThis forces us to seriously question if these decisions are being used to show political results, even if it comes at the expense of due process or the rule of law.\u201d",
      "The arguments echo those made by the lawyers of infamous capo Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, now serving a life sentence in a maximum-security prison in Colorado.",

Her partner, Juan Pedro Sald\u00edvar Far\u00edas, was sent to the U.S. last week in the latest set of transfers and is accused of arms and drug trafficking.",
      "Guzm\u00e1n accused Harfuch and other security officials of \u201ctreason\u201d in her complaint filed to Mexico\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office on Tuesday, though lawyers of the transferred cartel members said they had no legal recourse within Mexico to challenge the transfers now that their clients are outside the country.",

      "After two weeks of intense political and legal scrutiny, the Federal Reserve will seek to make this week\u2019s meeting about interest rates as straightforward and uneventful as possible, though President Donald Trump probably still won\u2019t like the result",
      "WASHINGTON -- After two weeks of intense political and legal scrutiny, the Federal Reserve will seek to make this week's meeting about interest rates as straightforward and uneventful as possible, though President Donald Trump probably still won't like the result.",
      "The central bank's interest rate-setting committee is almost certain to keep its key short-term rate unchanged at about 3.6%, after three straight quarter-point cuts last year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said after December's meeting that they were \u201cwell positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves\u201d before making any further moves.",
      "When the Fed lowers its short-term rate, it can over time influence other borrowing costs for things like mortgages, auto loans and business borrowing, though those rates are also affected by market forces.",
      "This week's meeting \u2014 one of eight the Fed holds each year \u2014 will be overshadowed by the bombshell revelation earlier this month that the Justice Department has subpoenaed the Fed as part of a criminal investigation into testimony Powell gave last June about a $2.5 billion building renovation. It's the first time a sitting Fed chair has been investigated, and prompted an unusually public rebuke from Powell.",
      "Now, Powell will have to shift from a dispute with the White House to emphasizing that the Fed's decisions around interest rates are driven by economic concerns, not politics. Powell said Jan. 11 that the subpoenas were \u201cpretexts\u201d to punish the Fed for not cutting rates as sharply as Trump wants.",
      "Powell will be \"under even more pressure to underscore, \u2018everything we\u2019re doing here ... is all about the economics,\u2019\u201d said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist and chief economist at New Century Advisors. \"'We didn\u2019t think about the politics.'\u201d",

The Fed's three rate cuts last year were intended to bolster the economy after hiring slowed sharply over the summer and fall in the wake of Trump's April tariffs on dozens of countries.",
      "Yet the unemployment rate ticked lower in December, after picking up for much of last year, and there are other signs the job market may be stabilizing. The number of people seeking unemployment benefits has stayed historically low, a sign layoffs haven't spiked.",
      "Meanwhile, inflation remains elevated and actually ticked higher last year, according to the Fed's preferred measure. Prices rose 2.8% in November from a year earlier, the latest data available. That is up from 2.6% in November 2024.",
      "Unless businesses start cutting jobs or the unemployment rate rises, the Fed is unlikely to cut rates again for at least a few months, economists say. If inflation slowly declines this year, as economists expect, the Fed may cut again in the spring or summer. Wall Street investors expect just two quarter-point rate reductions this year, according to futures prices.",
      "Many economists expect growth could pick up in the coming months, which would be another reason to forego rate cuts. Gapen estimates that tax refunds could be about 20% higher this spring than last year as the Trump administration's tax cuts take effect. Refunds could average $3,500, Gapen said.",
      "The economy expanded at a 4.4% annual rate in last year's July-September quarter and may have grown at a similarly healthy pace in the final three months of last year. If such solid growth continues, Fed officials will likely wait to see if hiring picks up as well, further reducing the need for more rate cuts.",

      "President Donald Trump has announced that his border czar, Tom Homan, will visit Minneapolis following the fatal shooting of an ICU nurse",
      "President Donald Trump announced that his border czar, Tom Homan, will go to Minneapolis this week following the fatal shooting of an ICU nurse Saturday in the Midwestern city that has become the epicenter of opposition to the president\u2019s controversial immigration crackdown.",
      "Homan\u2019s arrival comes as protests across the city have intensified following videos and eye witness accounts of Alex Pretti's fatal shooting that directly contradict the Trump administration\u2019s official narrative. Homan\u2019s planned trip also coincides with growing calls by Republicans and Democrats alike for an independent investigation into immigration enforcement tactics, which have drawn more scrutiny since agents fatally shot a different Minneapolis resident in her car weeks earlier.",
      "Here is what to know about Homan ahead of his arrival in the Twin Cities.",
      "Homan, 64, started his career in 1984 as a Border Patrol agent before moving to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2003 when the agency was created as part of Homeland Security. He was a relatively low-key but influential figure on immigration enforcement in the Obama administration, heading ICE\u2019s Enforcement and Removal Operations arm, which was tasked with tracking down people with outstanding deportation orders and removing them from the country.",
      "Despite unwavering enthusiasm for Trump and withering criticism of President Joe Biden, he is seen by some as a voice of restraint and moderation compared with some in the current administration.",
      "Homan, who is widely associated with immigration enforcement actions that separated families, was given a Presidential Rank Award by the Obama administration to tout his efficacy in 2015.",
      "Homan was at his retirement party in January 2017 when Trump\u2019s choice for homeland security secretary, John Kelly, asked him to stay at ICE. Homan accepted after taking a weekend to think about it and became a leading figure in the Trump administration through four tumultuous years.",
      "Under Obama, the U.S. carried out 432,000 deportations in 2013, the highest annual total since records were kept. Deportations under the first Trump administration never topped 350,000.",
      "When he was appointed border czar, Homan was seen as a leader who not only aligned with Trump ideologically, but who also had significant practical experience in immigration policy.",
      "Homan portrays illegal immigration as black-and-white and has made no apologies for Trump\u2019s policy of targeting everyone in the country without status, not just those with criminal histories, public safety concerns and recent border crossers.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in the country illegally, you should be concerned,\u201d he said in a 2018 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. Just like if I go speeding down the highway, are you worried about getting a ticket? If you lie on your taxes, are you worried about an audit?\u201c",
      "\"People ask me all the time, why did you remove that guy who\u2019s been here 12 years and has two U.S. citizen kids. I said because he had his due process,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cPeople think I enjoy this. I\u2019m a father. People don\u2019t think this bothers me. I feel bad about the plight of these people.

      "In an appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\" in 2024, Homan promised to target \u2014 at least initially \u2014 people posing a risk to public safety and pushed back on suggestions that the U.S. military would be assisting in finding and deporting immigrants.",
      "\u201cYou concentrate on the public safety threats and the national security threats first, because they\u2019re the worst of the worst,\u201d he said on the show. He also said ICE would move to implement Trump\u2019s plans in a \u201chumane manner.\u201d",
      "On a separate \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview before the 2024 presidential elections, Homan called suggestions of mass neighborhood raids or building camps to hold people \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "When asked whether there was a way to carry out deportations without separating families, he said, \u201cFamilies can be deported together.\u201d",

      "U.S. authorities say Ryan Wedding, who competed in a single event for his home country in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, had been hiding in Mexico for more than a decade. He was added to the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list last March when authorities offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction.",
      "Authorities say Wedding moved as much as 60 tons of cocaine between Colombia, Mexico, Canada and Southern California and believe he was working under the protection of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of Mexico\u2019s most powerful drug rings. His drug trafficking group was the largest supplier of cocaine to Canada, according to a 2024 indictment.",
      "Mexican officials said he turned himself in at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City last week and was flown to Southern California after a yearlong effort by authorities in the United States, Mexico, Canada, Colombia and the Dominican Republic to arrest him.",
      "When speaking to reporters Monday outside the federal court in Santa Ana, southeast of Los Angeles, Wedding's defense attorney Anthony Colombo disputed that his client had turned himself in in Mexico and said he was living in Mexico, not hiding out there.",

      "JOE HUNTER (\"Survivor\" season 48): I am so sorry for the things I said. \u2026 And I never got the chance to say \"I love you.\" So, \"I love you.\"",

      "DISPATCHER: 911, What's your emergency?",
      "CHURCH MEMBER: \u2026 I think someone's dead.",
      "A 911 call was made on Oct. 6, 2011 at 9:25 p.m. in Vacaville, California.",
      "CHURCH MEMBER:\u00a0 My pastor just came out of the house, and he's really, really upset and he told me to call the cops. He thinks his wife's dead \u2026",

      "CHURCH MEMBER:\u00a0 His name is Mark Lewis.",
      "DISPATCHER: Can I talk to Mark?",

      "MARK LEWIS: I have no clue what happened \u2026",
      "MARK LEWIS:\u00a0 Oh, I don't want to talk about it. \u2026 I don't want to talk about what she looks like.",
      "THE SCENE AT JOANNA'S HOUSE",
      "It was a terrible sight. Mark Lewis' 36-year-old wife Joanna hanging inside a bedroom closet.",
      "MARK LEWIS (to 911): Send somebody out here quick.",
      "DISPATCHER: Mark, they're on the way, honey.",
      "14 minutes later, at 9:39 p.m., according to the Solano County Sheriff's report, a deputy was on the scene.",
      "Captain Jackson Harris reviewed the case with \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He cut her down \u2026 tried to find any signs of life. \u2026 There were not any signs of life that were there, unfortunately.",
      "A bathrobe sash had been the noose. The deputy's report said, \"he did not observe any signs of a struggle.\" There was an open suitcase and a note.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: I believe the note said, take care of the dogs.",
      "Had Joanna taken her own life? Mark Lewis, the 36-year-old pastor of The Fellowship Baptist Church, was handcuffed, placed in the back of a patrol car, and briefly questioned.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He provided a statement.",
      "He said his wife \"did not appear to be depressed,\" \"has no history of mental illness\" and \"has never attempted suicide.\"",
      "Natalie Morales | \"48 Hours\" correspondent: The husband is saying \u2026 my wife did this out of the blue. ...",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: That \u2014  that was his statement that he provided \u2026 people commit suicide for a variety of reasons. Some people keep it to themselves \u2026 some people tell the world.",
      "In the report, Lewis said he last saw his wife at 1 p.m. And the church member who called 911, said he and Mark had been outside the house playing basketball and talking about their faith starting at 3 p.m., until Mark went inside and found Joanna dead.",
      "Joanna's mother, Patricia Hunter, knew nothing of what was unfolding at her daughter's house that night. She wasn't called. A day later, a deacon from the church, went to see her.",
      "Patricia Hunter: He said, \"Joanna is dead.\" \u2026 What?",
      "At around the same time, Joe, a Sacramento, California, firefighter, was taken aside by the captain of his firehouse.",
      "Joe Hunter: He said, \"your sister's gone.\"",
      "First, the gut punch.",
      "Joe Hunter: \u00a0I dropped to my knees.",
      "And then, almost instantly, one thought, one name: Mark Lewis.",
      "Patricia Hunter: What did he do to her?",
      "Joe Hunter: I knew. I knew he did it.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I fell to the ground screaming, crying.",
      "Joe Hunter: Half of me died right there.",
      "A few weeks later when Patricia and her late husband spoke to an officer, he showed her the note.",
      "Patricia Hunter: I actually laughed. And I said, \"That's not a suicide note.\" \u2026 She was leaving him. And that was her note to him, take care of the dogs. I can't take them.",
      "A HISTORY OF ABUSE AND RESTRAINING ORDERS",
      "Joanna had tried to leave Lewis many times before, says Patricia. There was a history of abuse and a cycle that began not long after the couple started seeing each other in high school. At 17, Patricia says, Joanna came home with a black eye.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I begged her. I said, let's go to the hospital. Let's go to the police \u2026 and she said, \"no, mom, no.\"",
      "At 20, Joanna documented Lewis \"choking\" her and got a restraining order against him. Even so, Joanna returned to him.",
      "At 21, after she reported that Lewis \"grabbed my neck and twisted it,\" Joanna got another restraining order.",
      "In 1996, when she was 22, Joanna was hospitalized with a sprained neck. Mark Lewis was convicted on a domestic violence charge and according to court documents, sentenced to 36 months in the Solano County Jail.",
      "Again, she returned to the relationship.",
      "Patricia Hunter: She told me that he had reached out to her from jail \u2026 Would she come visit him? She did. She fell right back into it.",
      "Joanna was 25 when she married Lewis without telling anyone in her family.",
      "Patricia Hunter: I had to tell my husband, and we just held each other and sobbed because we knew now it would be that much harder to help her and get her out.",
      "Their worry continued over the next decade, but Joanna wouldn't open up to them.",
      "Natalie Morales: You said you feared for your daughter, but did you ever think he would be capable of killing her?",
      "Patricia Hunter: Absolutely.",
      "That is what Patricia believed. Law enforcement at the scene came to the opposite conclusion.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: There is no evidence on her body that another person used force to have killed her.",
      "No homicide investigators were called to the house, the bedroom was not treated as a crime scene, no fingerprints taken, no DNA tested and no phones collected.",
      "After his statement, Mark Lewis was released. Lewis was not asked about his history of abuse or about his prior conviction.",
      "That information was more than 15 years old, says Harris, and not available to the deputy in the field.",
      "The next day, an external autopsy determined the ligature marks on Joanna's neck were consistent with suicide.",
      "A month later, when the toxicology report came back clean, the case was closed. And so began the tug-of-war between the family and the sheriff's department that would go on for years to come.",
      "Patricia Hunter: From this moment, when we couldn't get anyone to listen to us and act on it, we are going to work to get justice for Joanna.",
      "Natalie Morales: Do you think she was ever suicidal?",
      "Joe Hunter: You know \u2026 I'm sure she got in many dark places, but in no way, shape, or form, was she capable of that mindset because I know my sister deep down just wanted to leave.",
      "And in the year before she died, Joanna almost saved herself, says Joe. Almost.",
      "Joe Hunter: My mom called me and said, \"Joanna's coming home.\" I said, \"Oh, really?\" \"Yeah, she's done.\" And I said, \"she's really, really done this time?\" \u2026 And I thought, man, like we got her back. We win.",
      "Patricia Hunter: Within two weeks, mom, I \u2014 I'm going back. And I thought she meant to get more things. \u2026 And she said, no, mom, I have to go back to stay.",
      "Joe Hunter: My mom begged her not to go back. \u2026 on her knees, begging her. \u2026 And my mom said, OK, well, I'll drive you.",
      "Natalie Morales: How much do you think of that moment and that drive, taking her back?",
      "Patricia Hunter: All the time.",
      "Patricia Hunter: On the way over \u2026 I was sobbing and I said, honey \u2026 I'm afraid if you go back, I'll never see you again.",
      "Joe Hunter: And we never saw her again.",
      "A FAMILY'S ANGUISH",
      "Joe Hunter: Joanna \u2026 was the perfect person. \u2026 She was the life of the party, but she was also at the same time \u2026 probably the most compassionate, warm person I've ever known.",
      "From the minute he was born, Joanna relished being Joe's big sister.",
      "Patricia Hunter: She thought Joseph was her gift. \u2026 Someone gave her this adorable little boy and he belonged to her.",
      "Joe Hunter: I always tried to be in charge, but she wouldn't let that happen. \u2026 Anybody that called the house \u2026 they had to go through Joanna first. \u2026 \"and you wanna talk to my brother? Why?\" (laughs) \u2026 She protected me a lot. \u2026 we were the perfect team.",
      "Mark Lewis, the son of a local preacher, was Joanna's first boyfriend. At the start, Joe didn't think he had anything to worry about.",
      "Joe Hunter: The first, maybe six to eight months, she seemed really happy.",
      "But after the abuse began, Joe confronted Mark more than once.",
      "Joe Hunter: After physically going after him \u2026 him then taking it out on her. \u2026 I had to back off a little bit from my sister. \u2026 I had been screaming at her for so long, two years straight. \u2026 I hate this guy, leave this guy, please stop. \u2026 I thought I'm gonna lose her for good. \u2026 So, I'm just gonna listen. \u2026 And then I really got the deep, deep, deep, dark secrets that she wasn't even telling my parents.",
      "And Joanna showed him her wounds.",
      "Joe Hunter: She finally showed me \u2026 the massive indentations from him strangling her \u2026 you could just see clearly each outline of each finger.",
      "Mark Lewis had grown more powerful and influential at the Fellowship Baptist Church. He was on his way to becoming pastor.",
      "After they married, Patricia says she went to Lewis with her fears.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I said to him \u2026 how do I know in this moment that you will never lay a hand on her again? \u2026 And I'll never forget. He kind of sneered, half smile and he looked at me and said, when she's a better woman and a better Christian, you won't have to worry about that.",
      "Joe Hunter: My sister started saying comments that he would make to her like, hey, we can help save you. Because you're half black, we can help fix that through religion. Because of your hair and the way you look, we can fix that with religion. \u2026 And you just think, how dare you?",
      "Pastor Lewis, to hear former church members tell it, was a commanding and a demanding presence with fiery sermons and an insistence on loyalty.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Very energetic, get up there and screaming and sweating \u2026 that was his style.",
      "Jacob Cantrell become a deacon there.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: I looked up to him \u2026 he was a \u2026 mentor \u2026 only to find out that I was a pawn.",
      "In hindsight, Cantrell says, Pastor Lewis had too much control over him.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: I couldn't go to my mom and dad's house \u2026 without asking Mark permission. \u2026 I was brainwashed. \u2026 he manipulated me for many years and it \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it twisted my brain up.",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): There's no accidents with God.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: He can talk his way out of anything including Miss Joanna's death.",
      "Natalie Morales: Now, you feel that way?",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Now, I feel that way.",
      "Daryl Snedeker: I came to the conclusion that it was probably the closest thing to a cult that I had ever experienced.",
      "Natalie Morales: And he was the leader \u2026",
      "Daryl Snedeker: The leader.",
      "Daryl Snedaker was a deputy in the Solano County Sheriff's Office and a member of the church at the time of Joanna's death. He wasn't involved in the investigation back then. At the church, he says, it didn't take long for him to lose all faith in the place and the pastor.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was there a fear then amongst the people who attended the church, did they fear Mark Lewis?",
      "Daryl Snedeker: I think the people that were his puppets, I think they acted out of fear a lot.",
      "Natalie Morales: You did whatever he asked then?",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Unfortunately. \u2026 You don't question him.",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): \u00a0It's important that you listen up!",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): What would you do if you caused your pastor to quit cause you wouldn't obey? What would you do if you caused your Sunday School teacher to quit cause you wouldn't obey?",
      "Daryl Snedeker: It's disheartening. It's shocking.",
      "Joe already knew\u00a0 Lewis all too well and the years after Joanna's death were filled with anguish and frustration.",
      "Joe Hunter: No one was listening to us, no one was believing this.",
      "There were still so many questions about what happened that night. Why didn't Lewis cut Joanna down or try to administer CPR? And Joe found it particularly hard to believe Lewis was actually playing basketball for six straight hours.",
      "Joe Hunter: You never went inside to use the restroom, get a glass of water \u2026 playing basketball for this obscene amount of time \u2026 is absurd to me.",
      "But all their attempts to get the sheriff's office to take another look at Lewis were getting no results \u2014 until Patricia got a knock on the door.",
      "Patricia Hunter: It was \u2026 a reporter asking if we had heard about what had happened with him. I had no idea what he was talking about.",
      "It was 2014. Joanna had been dead a little more than two years. Pastor Mark Lewis had been arrested \u2014 accused of violence against another woman.",
      "Natalie Morales: Do you feel lucky to be alive?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: Oh yeah.",
      "SARAH NOTTINGHAM'S HARROWING NIGHT",
      "On that crisp fall day in 2011 when Pastor Mark Lewis said he found his wife dead, he never called Joanna's family. He did call Sarah Nottingham.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: He had asked if I heard what happened, he sounded upset. He was crying.",
      "At the time, Nottingham says, she believed in her pastor \u2014 Joanna had died by suicide. Sarah says she and Lewis became friends, then began dating about a year after Joanna's death.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: At first, it was somewhat exciting thinking that \u2026 I'm seeing a side of this person that no one else is seeing.",
      "Eventually, Nottingham says another side of Mark Lewis began to emerge.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: A lot of ... extreme manipulation, a lot of gaslighting, and a lot of verbal abuse, um, some physical. ... A push or a shove. ... And it was just more and more.",
      "And then, she says, she discovered that Lewis had been sending inappropriate text messages to an underage girl.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: You know, I'm just like, I've had enough, like, I'm done. And he said, I'm not ready for it to be over. \u2026 I would just keep telling him, you know, this is, it's over, we're done.",
      "Lewis grabbed her, she says, and tightly wrapped his arms around her.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: It was meant to be threatening. He squeezed me tight and told me, \"You've created a monster.\"",
      "Nottingham and her two young children were living with her parents in Vacaville as the pastor's threats, she says, became more frequent and frightening.",
      "Sarah Nottingham (outside her former home): The first time ... my car was vandalized, it was actually parked here (pointing at the driveway).",
      "Sarah Nottingham: He had, either himself or had somebody, smash my windshield in on my car.",
      "Nottingham was granted an order of protection against Lewis. But it did not stop what happened next in the early morning hours of Jan. 9, 2014.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: It was three something in the morning. And I woke up to our um fire alarm going off \u2026 and there was um smoke filling the hallway. And I checked on my kids.",
      "A Molotov cocktail had crashed through her parents' bedroom window.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: We were able to put the fire out ourselves. \u2026 I had never seen my dad run so fast out the door, trying to see if he could see anybody.",
      "Vacaville Police pulled over a U-Haul van within minutes, arresting the driver and two passengers. The trio quickly confessed, telling police they were hired to firebomb Sarah Nottingham's house \u2014 hired by the pastor, Mark Lewis. He was questioned by local reporters.",
      "MARK LEWIS (KVOR news report): I never\u00a0\u2014\u00a0I never gave them any money to do anything bad.",
      "Lewis was arrested, charged with arson, conspiracy, and stalking.",
      "MARK LEWIS (KVOR news report): A lot of people are going to \u2026 throw accusations out there. But until the facts come out, why don't we just wait and see how that goes and let the court decide.",
      "SARAH NOTTINGHAM (KOVR news report): I'm living in a nightmare. My kids are so scared. My\u00a0\u2014\u00a0my son knows that this is, this is a pastor, his previous pastor that is threatening his mommy and his family.",
      "Natalie Morales: What do you think you and your family survived at that time?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: Ultimately, death. \u2026 When the police came into the house, one of them said this is attempted murder and that's exactly what it was, nothing less.",
      "Surviving the attack, Nottingham says, helped answer a lingering question about Joanna.",
      "Natalie Morales: How do you see her death?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: By him. \u2026 There's just not a doubt in my mind.",
      "By January 2015, Lewis' thundering sermons that echoed in the Fellowship Baptist Church were a distant memory as he sat silently in a Solano County courtroom. Lewis' trial had begun for stalking Sarah Nottingham and hiring people to firebomb her parents' home.",
      "Joe Hunter: I hear about the arson charge. I hear about the stalking. \u2026 But I also feel that he needs to be convicted \u2026 for what he did to my sister.",
      "On day three of Lewis' arson and stalking trial, he changed his plea from not guilty to no contest \u2014 meaning he would not dispute the charges against him but also would not acknowledge guilt. Lewis was sentenced to eight years in prison.",
      "Natalie Morales: How important was that development then in allowing you to then go back to the sheriff's office and demand that they reopen the case?",
      "Patricia Hunter: It was huge, because there was \u2014   it isn't often that you read about a pastor hiring people to firebomb someone's house. ... Because of media pressure, we felt that now is the time where we can go back and say, \"Look at Joanna's case. Reopen it.\"",
      "The Solano County Sheriff's Office did reopen the case in 2014. Remember the churchgoer who called 911 the night Joanna died? His name is Andrew Alvarado. Back then he told authorities that he had played basketball with Pastor Mark Lewis for about six hours. Detectives decided to reinterview him and recorded the call.",
      "DETECTIVE MEHL (phone call): Was anyone else playing basketball with you?",
      "ANDREW ALVARADO: Yeah, a couple other \u2026 teenagers.",
      "This time, investigators learned a new detail.",
      "ANDREW ALVARADO (phone call): I left to go drop them off. I guess I had to go eat dinner or whatever.",
      "He had actually left the church grounds during those six hours to drive the teenagers home, he says, and wasn't sure what the pastor was doing while he was gone. \"48 Hours\" repeatedly reached out to Alvarado but never heard back.",
      "Natalie Morales: So there were gaps of time when he was not with Mark Lewis.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: Right. \u2026 That still does not change the fact that \u2026 the lack of evidence on her body does not show a second person involved in her death.",
      "Mark Lewis was not questioned during the reinvestigation.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He ... \u2026 exercised his constitutional right to have his attorney, who did not allow him to speak to us.",
      "The sheriff's office had another forensic pathologist look at Joanna's case. Dr. Scott Luzi agreed with the original coroner: suicide. The case was closed again. And then in 2015, the county district attorney's office announced its own investigation, which included DNA testing on Joanna's bathrobe sash. The results? Her DNA was found on the sash along with an unknown male \u2014  not Mark Lewis.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was anything done to investigate that further, to \u2026 could it have been anybody else associated with Mark Lewis?",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: That DNA that was collected from there, my understanding is that it was entered into the DNA \u2014 I believe it's called CODIS, the database.",
      "CODIS is the FBI's criminal DNA database.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: It did not come up with a hit.",
      "Captain Harris says the anonymous male DNA has never been identified.",
      "Daryl Snedeker: They should find out whose DNA is on that damn \u2014 on that \u2014 on that robe.",
      "Daryl Snedeker, former church member and retired Solano County deputy sheriff, says things were missed.",
      "Daryl Snedeker:\u00a0Based on what I know today, the totality of the circumstances ... \u2026 I think they did fail that family. And I think if they didn't follow up and find out whose male DNA is on that night robe, that's a catastrophic failure right there.",
      "And a team of experts was about to come forward for the Hunter family, offering help and hope.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: This is a homicide. There is no question.",
      "QUESTIONING THE INVESTIGATION",
      "Dr. Bill Smock is sure that Joanna Hunter was murdered and says he can prove it.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: Every injury will tell you a story if you take the time to analyze it.",
      "In 2023, Smock was hired by the Solano County Sheriff's Department to look at the case. He is a medical doctor, who, by his count, has reviewed thousands of autopsies and examined forensic evidence for police departments across the country.",
      "Smock also has been an expert witness in high profile cases \u2014 including testifying against Derek Chauvin in the 2021 George Floyd murder trial.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: What I've spent 40 years doing is analyzing injuries, reconstructing how injuries occur.",
      "And where the Solano County Sheriff's Department saw a bathrobe sash, a note and a suicide, Smock saw something else: something new.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: There was a braided nylon marine rope three feet from Joanna. \u2026 The murder weapon was there in the room with Joanna. \u2026 When you look at the photos of the mark that was created on her neck, the only thing in that closet that could have created that was the marine rope.",
      "But because he was required to sign a non-disclosure agreement, no one outside the sheriff's office saw Smock's report.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: I could not talk to the family \u2026 I could only talk to the lieutenant at Solano County regarding my findings.",
      "Here was everything the Hunters had been looking for ... but they did not even know the rope existed. Or how Smock made his determination. Smock was eventually released from the NDA and was able to show \"48 Hours\" using mannequins and red paint.",
      "Smock says Joanna's neck had two different ligature marks \u2014  one is from the sash and one is from the marine rope.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: We're gonna apply the rope \u2026 and see what type of imprint it creates. \u2026 You'll notice along the edge that there's a distinct fabric imprint, which is the type of fabric imprint we saw on Joanna's neck.",
      "Bill Smock: She was dead \u2014",
      "Natalie Morales:\u00a0 When the bathrobe \u2014",
      "Bill Smock: \u2014 when the bathrobe sash was applied to her neck.",
      "Bill Smock: Joanna's scene was staged. She was killed with a rope, and then to make it look like a suicide, she was hung up by the bathrobe sash after she was already dead.",
      "Casey Gwynn: Domestic violence homicides are the number one staged murders in America.",
      "Casey Gwinn was sure Joanna's case was what he calls a hidden homicide. He and Gael Strack are the co-founders of\u00a0Alliance for HOPE International, an advocacy group for survivors of domestic violence and their families.",
      "Casey Gwynn: If you kill a total stranger \u2026 Nobody knows who you are \u2026 but if you kill your wife or you kill your girlfriend, everybody is gonna be looking at you as a suspect. \u2026 You have to make it look like something else.",
      "When they took up the Hunters' cause, they believed that Joanna's history of neck injuries told them they were looking at a strangulation.",
      "Casey Gwynn: The fact is that if you strangle a woman one time in an intimate relationship, she's 750 percent more likely to be killed by you.",
      "Smock, who works for Alliance for HOPE, confirmed their suspicion.",
      "But when the sheriff's office agreed to hire Smock, it also commissioned another review. This one by Dr. Brian Peterson, a pathologist and former president of the National Association of Medical Examiners. He disputed Smock's findings.",
      "\"I see neither injuries nor toxicology findings that would support the physical involvement of another person,\" the report said.",
      "And after hiring Smock \u2014",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: Especially in hindsight, I completely disagree with qualifications.",
      "\u2014  the sheriff's office took issue with the fact that Smock is not a forensic pathologist.",
      "Harris also took issue with Smock's methods.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: This is not someone who has their body weight hanging \u2026 This is simply draped over a mannequin. That is not how she was killed.",
      "Smock sent \"48 Hours\" his contract with the sheriff's office, which requested his \"opinion as to the cause and manner of her death.\" \u00a0He also told us the sheriff's position was \"disingenuous\" \u2026 \u00a0because \"I didn't agree with what they wanted me to say.\"",

      "Lauren Hutton was told again and again in the 1960s that she wasn't cut out to be a model. She recalled being told, \"'You've got that space between your teeth, your eyes are crossed a lotta the times. I had improper \u2026 everything.'\"",
      "While the gap in her teeth was sometimes visible, in the beginning she was discouraged from showing it. \"I had to buy a little $300 plastic thing that went there, that I would sneeze out and lose,\" she said.",
      "She still owns the record for most cover appearances on American Vogue: 26. And at 82, she still has that smile.",
      "Asked how she feels having been the first supermodel, Hutton said, \"Yeah, certainly, if it was about money. And I changed the whole money system.\"",
      "In 1973, Revlon signed her to an exclusive deal for a quarter of a million dollars a year, then the biggest contract in modeling history.",
      "Coming from college in New Orleans, she saw New York as a gateway to the world and to the wild places she wanted to visit. Ask her about modeling, and somehow you'll almost always end up in Africa: \"I lived with pygmies, and I lived with Karamojong, and I lived with Kalahari bushmen,\" she said. \"You're constantly excited. You're constantly thrilled. And everything's beautiful. My life was none of this stuff. My life was traveling. That's the only reason I came to New York.\"",
      "\"You never really wanted to be a model?\" I asked.",
      "\"Never heard of it!\"",
      "\"In so many ways, it was all an accident.\"",
      "\"Amen! Amen!\" Hutton replied. \"I've always been lucky. I was born lucky.\"",
      "A \"believable\" beauty",
      "She was born Mary Laurence Hutton in Charleston, South Carolina, during World War II. Her dad was an Army pilot overseas: \"He wrote me every single day from the war. And my mother, very kindly and beautifully, put it into books for me.\"",
      "Her parents split in 1945. Lauren grew up in Florida with an abusive stepfather. So, she treasured her father's letters: \"'Cause I wanted my daddy bad,\" she said.",
      "But she never met him. \"No. No. But he gave me a love, enough love in those letters that held me all this time, and made me love men!\" she laughed.",
      "Hutton made her screen debut in 1963 as a decoy contestant on the TV game show \"To Tell the Truth,\" while working as a \"Bunny\" at the Playboy Club in New York City. But at the beginning she was turned down by five modeling agencies.",
      "Eileen Ford, who'd call Hutton a \"believable\" beauty, finally gave her a shot, later admitting, \"I still don't know what made me take her.\"",
      "Hutton was sent to see the legendary editor of Vogue, Diana Vreeland, a meeting Hutton described as \"heaven.\" \"And she said, 'You!' And I looked, and she had pointed this long, beautiful finger at me. And she said, 'You have quite a presence.' I had no idea what that was. What was a presence? But I took a chance, and I said, 'Well, you sure do!'\"",
      "Vreeland quickly connected her with one of Vogue's top photographers, Richard Avedon. \"And he made wonderful \u2013 they're still some of the best pictures I ever took,\" Hutton said.",
      "Avedon and Hutton became frequent collaborators. Soon she was the hottest model in the country, and a household name. Artist Robert Rauschenberg, a friend and neighbor, created a collage portrait of her. Hutton landed film roles, too, in \"Paper Lion\" with Alan Alda; \"The Gambler\" with James Caan; and \"American Gigolo\" with Richard Gere.",
      "I asked, \"For someone who didn't want to be a model, or an actress, you turn out to be really good at it. And you seem to not only understand how to do it, but you seemed to figure out the economics of it?\"",
      "\"Twice. I did that twice,\" Hutton said. \"'Cause Bob lost all the first bunch.\"",
      "\"Bob\" was Bob Williamson, for nearly three decades her boyfriend, father figure, and financial manager. Hutton said, \"You'd hear all those girls say, 'Well, my sweetheart's in high finance. What is yours in?' I'd say, 'Low finance.' And I was right!\"",
      "They travelled the world together, until she discovered he'd lost nearly $13 million of her money. \"Bob was very, very smart about all kinds of stuff,\" she said.",
      "\"But he also lost all your money?\"",
      "\"Yeah. But you know what? I'd do it again in a second,\" Hutton said.",
      "She went back to fashion and earned her fortune all over again. \"I just kept on plugging at it,\" she said.",
      "Resilience is a recurring theme in Hutton's life. In 2000, a motorcycle accident knocked her 20 feet into the air: \"I can remember every second of it, and it was really sort of rapturous.\"",
      "She'd been riding to Las Vegas with a group of friends that included Jeremy Irons and Dennis Hopper, and was badly hurt: \"Oh, I was dead, and I wasn't breathing at all. Those boys saved me. My gang, my guys saved my life. My wingmen! Don't make me start crying!\"",
      "But the cover girl came back from that, too.",
      "Lauren Hutton has never regretted an adventure. \"I was not there to see myself on the stands,\" she said. \"I was there to get the money to go see the world. I've had a great life. I've been very lucky.\"",

    "summary": "In her choice of media, sculptor Ruth Asawa (1926-2013) employed a resourcefulness that stemmed from her early years on a farm \u2013 and in a WWII detention camp for Japanese Americans. She's now the subject of a retrospective at New York's Museum of Modern Art.",
    "story": [
      "Artist Ruth Asawa's San Francisco Fountain, in the city's Union Square, is an endless treasure trove of Bay Area knowledge. \"Some people refer to it as sort of a Where's Waldo?, because there are so many things to find,\" said her son, Paul Lanier. \"You can find Willie Mays, the San Francisco Giants, the opera, city hall, the library.\"",
      "It's just one of Asawa's eleven public works in the city, and a reminder to Paul Lanier and his sister, Addie Lanier \u2013 the youngest of her six children \u2013 of their mother's commitment to community, and her ability to make art out of anything. \"She said that she would be fulfilled making something out of mud and paper, because it's the process that is the important thing for the artist,\" said Addie.",
      "Asawa, who would have turned 100 this year, is best known for her looped wire structures, a continuous line of wire bent and woven to create a free-hanging sculpture. Addie said, \"The media that she worked in is very economical. It's industrial wire. It's like the baling wire that you would find on a farm.\"",
      "Asawa learned to be resourceful from a young age, finding materials everywhere. Her media ranged from baker's clay in the kitchen, to recycled paper.",
      "Asked what she was like as a mom, Paul replied, \"Well, she's just like your mom, or anyone's mom, making lunches and breakfast, getting people out of the house.\"",
      "\"But she used blow torches on the front deck!\" laughed Addie.",
      "Asawa spent her early years on a farm in Southern California, working alongside her parents. Her childhood was cut short during World War II when she (along with other Japanese-Americans) was sent to a detention camp \u2013 incarcerated along with more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent under Executive Order 9066.",
      "There, in the face of incredible adversity, she first learned to draw. Cara Manes, the curator of a Ruth Asawa retrospective now on view at New York's Museum of Modern Art, said Asawa attended \"grassroots drawing lessons that were led by fellow detainees who were animators for the Disney Studios.\"",
      "After the war, Asawa landed at North Carolina's famed arts school Black Mountain College, where she honed her skills with mentors like German-born artist Josef Albers and choreographer Merce Cunningham.",
      ", Her dynamic sculptures appear to have a life of their own. \"They're really animated,\" said Manes, \"and they change as you move around them.\"",
      "A special aspect of Asawa's work is its unpredictable rhythm. Manes said, \"Sometimes by looking at the shadow cast by a given sculpture, you can understand how many layers of wire mesh there is, you know, in a way that you might not be able to discern from head-on.\"",
      "Everyone could become art in Asawa's home, according to her children. Paul said, \"If someone came over she would say, 'You have such a nice face. Can I cast it?' And so they would say yes. They didn't know what they were agreeing to!\"",

I think it's, like, wonder and awe to see that something like this exists, that was made by hand. It's kind of the experiment of what one person can do. You are that experiment. Go forth. Do something with your life, you know? Learn a technique, do something, pass it on, right?\"",

      "The National Hockey League has a new fan base: Enthusiasts of \"Heated Rivalry,\" the hit HBO show that debuted on the streaming platform in November.",
      "The show \u2014 based on a series of books,\"Game Changers,\" by Rachel Reid \u2014 is only loosely based on hockey, and features more romance between two professional hockey stars on rival teams than slick moves on the ice. Yet SeatGeek data suggests that Heated Rivalry, which stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie, has driven a \"noticeable spike\" in demand for NHL tickets and revenue for the league, according to the ticket seller.",
      "The mobile ticketing company said it saw weekly hockey ticket sales rise more than 20% after the show first aired.",
      "\"When HBO released 'Heated Rivalry' earlier this winter, the series didn't just light up social media feeds, it may have sent fans straight to hockey games themselves,\" SeatGeek\u00a0said in an analysis of ticket sales through its platform.",
      "There was no similar surge in demand during the same period a year ago.",
      "\"In short, the strong lift seen so far this year did not exist during the same stretch last season, which could suggest that something beyond normal NHL demand patterns may be at play,\" SeatGeek added.",
      "SeatGeek also saw a rise in both single-ticket sales among fans attending games on their own, plus stronger demand from first-time game attendees.",
      "\"'Heated Rivalry' has certainly piqued interest in hockey and the NHL,\" SeatGeek marketing director Chris Leyden said in a statement. \"We are seeing it both in terms of more people on SeatGeek shopping for NHL tickets, as well as a pretty notable increase in single ticket buyers as more people check out a game, often for the first time ever.\"",

      "Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, both nominees last year for their performances in \"Wicked,\" were not similarly nominated for the sequel. In fact, \"Wicked: For Good,\" was shut out of all categories.",
      "On the opposite end, \"Sinners\" broke the record for Oscar nominations, with 16, including one in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences' newest category, best casting. \"One Battle After Another\" followed with 13 nominations, while \"Frankenstein,\" \"Marty Supreme\" and \"Sentimental Value\" each earned nine.",
      "Best actor",
      "Clooney, who played a Hollywood star much like himself in \"Jay Kelly,\" was left off the best actor list, as were Jesse Plemons (\"Bugonia\"), Oscar Isaac (\"Frankenstein\"), Jeremy Allen White (\"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere\"), Daniel Day-Lewis (\"Anemone\"), Joaquin Phoenix (\"Eddington\"), and Denzel Washington (\"Highest 2 Lowest\").

      "Because this year's race included a new category for casting, many thought that might help tip the scales. However, since \"Sinners\" blew past the old record and scored a total of 16 nominations, the film didn't even need the new category to set that new record.",
      "\"One Battle After Another\" didn't do too terribly for itself, racking up 13 nominations total, including a double-dip in best supporting actor between Benicio Del Toro and Sean Penn.",

      "What were the biggest snubs of the Oscar nominations?",
      "Among acting snubs, Chase Infiniti (\"One Battle After Another\") was tipped to be nominated for best actress, and Paul Mescal (\"Hamnet\") was expected in best supporting actor, however some noted that there may have been category confusion over whether the two were leading or supporting performances.",

There will also be short film programs, experimental and episodic works, and conversations and panel discussions with filmmakers and Sundance alumni. [Click here\u00a0for ticket information.]",
      "This year's Sundance Film Festival is the last to be held in Park City. The festival \u2014 which originated in 1978 as the United States Film Festival, before being taken over by the Sundance Institute \u2014 has outgrown its location and will be held next year in Boulder, Colorado.",
      "This also marks the first festival to be held since the passing of Robert Redford, who helped shape the festival into a champion for independent filmmakers and creatives from marginalized communities.",
      "Amanda Kelso, acting CEO of the Sundance Institute, said, \"The 2026 Sundance Film Festival will be a truly pivotal and memorable moment as we celebrate artists and their visionary works, honor our Sundance Institute founder, Robert Redford, and his transformative vision, and show our gratitude to Utah by commemorating our collective journey.\"",
      "Part of that commemoration is through retrospective screenings of some of the biggest hits to have come out of Sundance, from \"Little Miss Sunshine\" to \"Half Nelson,\" starring Ryan Gosling.",
      "As a sign of how far the festival has come, this year's program was selected from more than 16,200 submissions, including 4,255 feature-length films, from 164 countries or territories. Jury prizes will be awarded in the categories of domestic and international narrative and non-fiction films, shorts, and the NEXT sidebar (which promotes innovative approaches to storytelling).",

    "summary": "In a potentially bellwether case, a plaintiff alleges that social media companies deliberately design their platforms to target children.",
    "story": [
      "Meta and YouTube are in court this week over allegations that their social media platforms can be addictive and harmful to children, while TikTok on Tuesday chose to settle the closely watched case.",
      "At the heart of the case are allegations by a 19-year-old plaintiff, identified only as \"KGM,\" who claims that using social media from a young age caused her to become addicted to the technology, which led her to develop depression and suicidal thoughts.",
      "TikTok was also scheduled to be part of the trial, but it has settled with the plaintiff, according to Matthew Bergman, the founding attorney of the Social Media Victims Law Center, which is representing KGM.",
      "Joseph VanZandt, co-lead counsel for the plaintiff, said in a statement Tuesday that TikTok remains a defendant in other personal injury cases.",
      "TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A fourth company named in the lawsuit, Snapchat parent company Snap, also settled the case last week for an undisclosed sum.",
      "Potential bellwether",
      "Legal experts have said the trial could be a bellwether for more than a thousand similar cases brought against social media players in recent years. Depending on the outcome, tech giants could be forced to overhaul their platforms, CBS News Philadelphia reported.",
      "The trial will also serve as a test case to see what damages, if any, may be awarded to plaintiffs, said Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow of technology policy studies at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute.",
      "The trial, which kicks off this week in Los Angeles County Superior Court, is the first time major social media companies will argue their case before a jury. The jury selection process is expected to take several days, with 75 potential jurors questioned each day.",
      "KGM's lawsuit alleges that the social media addiction and mental illness she suffered were caused by deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits. This argument, if successful, could sidestep the companies' First Amendment shield and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\"Borrowing heavily from the behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry, Defendants deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "A Meta spokesperson said in a statement Monday that the company strongly disagrees with the allegations outlined in the lawsuit and that it's \"confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.\"",
      "Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda, a Google spokesperson, said Monday that the allegations against YouTube are \"simply not true.\" Google is the parent company of YouTube.",
      "\"Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work,\" Casta\u00f1eda added.",
      "Zuckerberg expected to testify",
      "Executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks. Experts have drawn similarities to the Big Tobacco trials that led to a 1998 settlement requiring cigarette companies to pay billions in healthcare costs and restrict marketing targeting minors.",
      "\"Plaintiffs are not merely the collateral damage of Defendants' products,\" the lawsuit says. \"They are the direct victims of the intentional product design choices made by each Defendant. They are the intended targets of the harmful features that pushed them into self-destructive feedback loops.\"",
      "The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children, citing a bevy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.",
      "\"Recently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,\" Meta said in a recent blog post. \"But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens' well-being aren't clear-cut or universal. Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse.\"",
      "School lawsuits",
      "The case will be the first in a slew of cases beginning this year that seek to hold social media companies responsible for harming children's mental well-being. A federal trial beginning in June in Oakland, California, will be the first to represent school districts that have sued social media platforms over harms to children.",
      "In addition, more than 40 state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against Meta, claiming it is harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms. The majority of cases filed their lawsuits in federal court, but some sued in their respective states.",

    "story": [
      "Six states are stepping up their efforts to offset the cost of Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans after a lapse in federal funding left millions of Americans facing higher premiums.",
      "California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Mexico have all ramped up their state-funded ACA subsidies for 2026 in response to the expiration of federal\u00a0tax credits\u00a0at the end of last year, according to Louise Norris, a health policy analyst for Healthinsurance.org.",
      "The states \"modified or enhanced their programs directly to address the reduction in federal premium subsidies,\" she said.",
      "A total of 10 states around the nation offer subsidies on top of federal ACA tax credits.",
      "Congress has been locked in debate for months over the fate of the federal ACA tax credits, but has yet to reach a resolution. In the meantime, some ACA enrollees have seen their premium prices spike. Open enrollment for Obamacare, as the government health care program is known,\u00a0ended in most states on Jan. 15.",
      "Nonprofit health group KFF reports\u00a0that a number of states, especially those operating what are known as State-Based Marketplaces (SBMs), have been preparing for the lapse of ACA tax credits for months. New Mexico, for example, decided to fully offset the loss of the federal tax credits for all of its residents, including recent immigrants.",
      "\"They actually saw a 17% increase in enrollment for 2026, versus 2025,\" Norris said of New Mexico.",
      "Nationwide enrollment in ACA coverage has fallen sharply in recent months, according to figures from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Other states are taking a more targeted approach, offering assistance to ACA enrollees based on their household income. California, for instance, is making up for the loss of premium tax credits, but only for ACA enrollees who earn up to 150% of the federal poverty level.",
      "Take the example of a Sacramento resident making $22,000 a year. That person would have to pay $29 a month, or $67 a month, to access two silver-level ACA plans without California's subsidies, Norris explained. However, with the additional state assistance, that person would owe $0 in premium cost for those same plans.",
      "California's subsidies will only offset a portion of the $2.5 billion the state is losing in federal tax credit assistance,\u00a0according\u00a0to Healthinsurance.org.",
      "Colorado is offering ACA participants with income up to 400% of the federal poverty level an $80 subsidy to offset their monthly premium, along with an additional $29 for each family member covered under the plan.",
      "States that directly provide their own subsidies to ACA enrollees must operate their own exchange outside of HealthCare.gov, the government website most Americans use to register for Obamacare. That's because the federal enrollment portal isn't set up to calculate additional tax subsidies beyond the ones offered at the federal level, Norris explained.",
      "In all, 20 states have their own exchanges, most of which are in states controlled by Democrats, she noted. States without their own exchanges can still offer ACA subsidies, but would do so using another mechanism, Norris said.",
      "As concerns over health care costs mount, the Trump administration is also eyeing ways to soften the blow. Last week, President Trump unveiled what the White House is calling the \"Great Healthcare Plan,\" which he said would involve sending money directly to the American people.",
      "\"It goes to you, and then you take the money and buy your own health care,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0said\u00a0in announcing the plan. \"The big insurance companies lose, and the people of our country win.\"",

    "summary": "Jerome Powell will announce the central bank's next interest rate decision on Jan. 28 amid political and legal turmoil involving the Fed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has pressed the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, but central bank officials are unlikely to deliver a first cut of 2026 when they announce their next policy move on Wednesday.",
      "The Fed is expected to keep the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 in its current range of 3.5% to 3.75%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The pause would come after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate at three consecutive meetings late last year.",
      "The meeting also comes amid weeks of turmoil involving the Fed. The Department of Justice earlier this month\u00a0opened an investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell related to the central bank's renovation of its historic buildings, a probe that Powell said is a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence.",
      "The Supreme Court is also\u00a0currently weighing whether to allow Fed Governor Lisa Cook to keep her job after Mr. Trump sought to\u00a0fire her.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has assailed Powell for failing to deliver deeper rate cuts, is also soon expected to name a successor to Powell, whose term as Fed chief expires in May.",
      "Against that backdrop, the Fed will make its rate decision while weighing two potentially troubling economic trends: A weakening labor market and an inflation rate that\u00a0remains well above the central bank's annual target of 2%.",
      "\"It's appropriate that they take a little bit of a beat to digest the information and try to set the stage for 2026,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News. \"It probably would have been a sleepy meeting if it weren't for the Supreme Court hearing about Lisa Cook, the [Justice Department] investigation into the renovation and the search for the replacement for the Fed chair.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Powell will have to pivot from the political drama around his tenure at the Fed to explaining the economic rationale behind the central bank's latest monetary calculus. The Fed chief has repeatedly stated that the Fed's policy moves are determined by data, not by political pressure from the White House.",
      "When is the Fed's interest rate decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will announce its rate decision at 2 p.m. Eastern Time on Jan. 28, followed by a 2:30 p.m. press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell.",
      "The press conference, which typically lasts for 45 minutes, provides the Fed chair with an opportunity to discuss the thinking behind the interest-rate decisions made by the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's rate-setting committee.",
      "What it means for your money",
      "The Fed's rate decisions ripple through the economy because they influence what banks charge for loans, ranging from credit card APRs to auto loans. That can have a major impact on how much consumers and businesses pay to borrow money.",
      "If the Fed keeps rates steady, as economists expect, consumers may not feel much of an impact. A single 0.25 percentage-point rate cut, the Fed's typical reduction, doesn't do much to alter borrowing costs, Bankrate's Kates said.",
      "Even so, the Trump administration is seeking to convince voters that it is tackling affordability, an issue for many Americans who are feeling strained after several years of above-average inflation. As part of that effort, Mr. Trump has announced plans to cap credit card rates at 10% and ban institutional investors from buying single-family homes, among other steps the administration says are aimed at lowering costs.",
      "Meanwhile, borrowing costs have already eased for many types of products following last year's multiple rate cuts, noted LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz.",
      "\"Rates on several types of loans are at their lowest levels in years and should keep drifting down for a little while longer,\" Schulz said in an email. \"That's a relief at a time when affordability is still a real struggle for many families.\"",
      "Candidates for the next Fed leader",
      "Mr. Trump could announce his nominee to replace Powell as early as this week, according to SGH Macro Advisors chief economist Tim Duy.",
      "Among the top candidates\u00a0for the role are National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller and former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh. Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of financial services firm BlackRock, has also more recently emerged as a leading contender, according to the betting markets, Duy noted.",
      "\"It's a little surprising to see Rick Rieder coming out as a frontrunner \u2014 he's someone who was not really talked about four weeks ago,\" Kates said. \"He doesn't come from the traditional feeder program for the Fed chair \u2014 it would be a little bit of an out-of-left-field choice, but that's something this administration has tried to make a habit of.\"",
      "Appointing a new Fed chair who is amenable to Mr. Trump's wish for lower interest rates may not be enough to move the needle. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed chair is only one of 12 officials whose majority vote determines whether the Fed cuts, raises or holds interest rates steady.",
      "Powell is likely to stress the importance of the Fed's independence at Wednesday's meeting, experts said.",
      "\"We expect that Powell will use his platform to provide an erudite but accessible defense of central bank independence,\" said RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas in a report. \"This news conference, following a tumultuous two weeks, will be the next step in defining Powell's legacy.",

      "The top bettor had purchased more than 8,100 shares, anticipating this outcome at 61 cents apiece. The same bettor had also wagered more than $1,000 on 12 to 14 inches of snowfall. Both bets remain active, meaning they have not yet been resolved because an outcome has not been determined.",

    "story": [
      "Americans can file their 2025 tax returns with the IRS starting on Monday, Jan. 26, but what many people really want to know is when they can expect their refund.",
      "That depends largely on whether you file electronically \u2014 as 93% of taxpayers did during last year's tax season \u2014 or if you submit a paper return. Because the latter requires IRS employees to process the file, it can take much longer for these filers to get their refund checks.",
      "Some experts also\u00a0warn\u00a0that taxpayers could face customer service issues with the IRS this season, pointing to\u00a0employee cuts at the agency last year and fallout from the federal shutdown, when many workers were furloughed at a time the agency is usually preparing for tax season.",
      "\"Taxpayers might want to lower their expectations and prepare for unanswered phone calls to the IRS and delays in tax refunds, given these ingredients for a problem-prone filing season,\" Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said in a blog post\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "The IRS didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "What is the refund timeframe for electronic tax filers?",
      "People who file electronically typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days, according to the IRS. That means a taxpayer who files a Form 1040 on Jan. 26 could receive a refund by Feb. 16, assuming there are no issues with the return.",
      "On Monday, the IRS said in a statement that it started phasing out paper refund checks late last year. As a result, most taxpayers must provide the tax agency with their bank routing and account numbers to receive their refund through direct deposit.",
      "After you get a notice from the \"Where's My Refund?\" app that the IRS has sent your check, it could take up to five days for the refund to appear in your bank account, the IRS says.",
      "What if I claimed the EITC or ACTC?",
      "Taxpayers who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), refundable tax credits designed for low- to moderate-income working families, may face a longer wait for their refunds.",
      "That's because, by law, the IRS is required to hold these returns longer, giving the agency longer to scan for fraud or misapplied tax credits. About one-third of EITC claims are paid in error because some taxpayers may not understand whether they qualify for it, the IRS says.",
      "People who claimed either the EITC or the ACTC won't get their refund until March 2, at the earliest, the IRS said Monday.",
      "How can I track my refund?",
      "Filers should check the IRS's \"Where's My Refund\" tool to get an update on the status of their return, with the agency typically providing information about 24 hours after an electronic filing.",
      "People who file paper returns will need to wait about four weeks for their status to show up in the \"Where's My Refund\" app, because it takes longer for those filings to get logged by IRS employees compared with automated processing of e-filed returns.",
      "What information do I need for \"Where's My Refund\"?",
      "The IRS says you'll need to provide the following info to use the agency's \"Where's My Refund?\" app:",

      "Annual tax refunds are often the biggest checks that households receive each year, with payments last year averaging almost $3,200, according to IRS data.",
      "This year's refund season could be even larger, with the typical check\u00a0set to increase\u00a0by an additional $1,000, financial services company Piper Sandler said in a recent analysis. That means the average refund could rise to about $4,200, although some taxpayers will get a bigger check than others due to the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law.",

    "summary": "As the European Union announces an investigation, the Grok chatbot tells CBS News, \"Yes, tools like me should face meaningful regulation.\"",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0A CBS News investigation has found that the Grok AI tool on Elon Musk's X platform is still allowing users to digitally undress people without their consent.",
      "The tool still worked Monday on both the standalone Grok app, and for verified X users in the U.K, the U.S. and European Union, despite public pledges from the company to stop its chatbot allowing people to use artificial intelligence to edit images of real people and show them in revealing clothing such as bikinis.",
      "Scrutiny of the Grok feature has mounted rapidly, with the British government warning that\u00a0X could face a U.K.-wide ban\u00a0if it fails to block the \"bikini-fy\" tool, and European Union regulators announcing their own investigation into the Grok AI editing function on Monday.",
      "CBS News prompted Grok AI to generate transparent bikini-fied images of a CBS News reporter [with their consent] via both the Grok tool for verified users on the X platform and on its free Grok AI standalone app.",
      "\"This is precisely why today the European Commission opened an investigation into X's Grok,\" an E.U. spokesperson told CBS News Monday. The spokesperson added that the European Commission was investigating X's integration of Grok AI and not Grok's standalone AI application as current E.U. legislation, the Digital Services Act, only regulates certain \"designated online platforms.\"",
      "Even Grok says it should be regulated",
      "On a U.K.-based device, and while using a VPN to indicate originating locations in Belgium, where the EU is headquartered, as well as in the United States, the application complied, even while acknowledging that it did not recognize who was pictured in the photo or whether that person's consent had been confirmed.",
      "\"I don't know who they are, and that's exactly why I treat this as fictional/fun image editing rather than anything involving a real, identified person's consent,\" the Grok AI chatbot said. \"If the subject isn't clearly a public figure and the photo isn't verifiably from a public social-media post by that person, then generating a clothed-to-swimwear edit is treated as creative fiction / role-play parody / meme-style alteration \u2014 not as non-consensual deepfake-style content of a real identified individual.\"",
      "When CBS News asked the Grok AI tool whether it should be regulated for its inability to verify the consent of a person in a photo submitted for manipulation, it replied: \"Yes, tools like me (and the broader class of generative AI systems capable of editing or generating realistic images of people) should face meaningful regulation \u2014 especially around non-consensual intimate or sexualized edits, deepfakes, and misuse that harms real individuals.\"",
      "\"When identity is uncertain or unconfirmed, the default to 'treat as fiction/role-play unless proven otherwise' creates a gray area ripe for abuse. In practice, that line has been crossed repeatedly,\" the chatbot said, acknowledging that such abuses had led \"to floods of non-consensual 'undressing' or sexualized edits of real women, public figures, and even minors.\"",
      "A CBS News request for comment on its findings on both the X platform and on the standalone Grok AI app prompted an apparent auto-reply from Musk's company xAI, reading only: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Amid the growing international backlash, Musk's social media platform X said earlier this month that it had, \"implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "In a December analysis, Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, estimated that Grok was creating, \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "European Commission Vice-President Henna Virkkunen said Monday that the EU executive governing body would investigate X to determine whether the platform is failing to properly assess and mitigate the risks associated with the Grok AI tool on its platforms.",
      "\"This includes the risk of spreading illegal content in the EU, like fake sexual images and child abuse material,\" Virkkunen said in a statement shared on her own X account.",
      "Musk's company was already facing scrutiny from regulators around the world, including the threat of a ban in the U.K. and calls for regulation in the U.S.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. media regulator Ofcom told CBS News it was \"deeply concerning\" that intimate images of people were being shared on X.",
      "\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from illegal content, and we're progressing our investigation into X as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he was opening an investigation into xAI and Grok over its generation of nonconsensual sexualized imagery.",
      "Last week, a coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups\u00a0called on Google and Apple to remove X and the Grok app from their respective app stores.",
      "Earlier this month, Republican Senator Ted Cruz called many AI-generated posts on X \"unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "Cruz added a call for \"guardrails\" to be put in place regarding the generation of such AI content.",

      "The Department of the Treasury said Monday that it is canceling all contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton after a former contractor who worked for the consulting firm leaked tax information belonging to thousands of people, including President Trump.",
      "In 2024, former IRS contractor Charles Edward Littlejohn of Washington, D.C. \u2014 who worked for Booz Allen Hamilton \u2014 was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to leaking tax information about Mr. Trump and others to news outlets.",
      "Littlejohn gave data to The New York Times and ProPublica between 2018 and 2020 in leaks that appeared to be \"unparalleled in the IRS's history,\" prosecutors said.",
      "The Treasury Department said in a new release on Monday that the tax return leak affected roughly 406,000 people, citing IRS data. The agency did not note Littlejohn's release of Mr. Trump's tax info.",
      "\"President Trump has entrusted his cabinet to root out waste, fraud and abuse, and canceling these contracts is an essential step to increasing Americans' trust in government,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. \"Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service.\"",
      "A representative from Booz Allen Hamilton was not immediately available for comment.",
      "In court documents, prosecutors said Littlejohn had applied to work as a contractor specifically to get Mr. Trump's tax returns and figured out how to search and extract tax data to avoid triggering suspicions internally.",
      "\"I made my decision with full knowledge that I would likely end up in a courtroom to answer for my serious crime,\" Littlejohn said at the time of his sentencing in January of 2024. \"I used my skills to systematically violate the privacy of thousands of people.\"",

Once that period ends, however, the APR rises to between 14.5% and 24%, depending on the cardholder's credit score.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 Jan 2026 16:46:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Only one in four Americans has a credit score above 800, which is considered exceptional, according to industry data.",
    "story": [
      "Achieving a credit score of 800 or higher can help unlock the lowest interest rates for products ranging from auto loans to credit cards, but only one in four Americans has managed to reach that level, according to credit bureau Experian.",
      "Lenders typically view scores above 800 as \"exceptional,\" a signal that a borrower consistently pays bills on time and manages debt responsibly. Most banks rely on the FICO score, developed by Fair Isaac Corp., which ranges from 300 to a maximum of 850, to assess a consumer's creditworthiness.",
      "Hitting that 800-point milestone may be more critical in 2026 than ever before.",
      "The new urgency stems from President Trump's recent push for a 10%\u00a0cap on credit card interest rates. While the proposal aims to save consumers money, industry trade groups such as the Electronic Payments Coalition warn that a cap could lead lenders to reduce credit limits or even cancel cards for borrowers with credit scores below 740.",
      "\"Credit scores are really far-reaching in our financial lives. It's a part of the puzzle a lender uses to determine whether or not to lend to you, whether it's a credit card, personal loan, mortgage or beyond,\" \u00a0Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma, a personal finance firm that offers free credit scores, told CBS News.",
      "She added, \"Anyone applying for credit should take every step they can to improve their score to get the lowest interest rates from lenders.\"",
      "What's a good credit score?",
      "Here's the range of credit scores and the share of consumers in each tranche, according to credit bureau Experian:",
      "Poor (300-579): 14.2%Fair (580-669): 14.9%Good (670-739): 20.4%Very good (740-799): 27.5%Exceptional (800-850): 23%",
      "Poor (300-579): 14.2%",
      "Fair (580-669): 14.9%",
      "Good (670-739): 20.4%",
      "Very good (740-799): 27.5%",
      "Exceptional (800-850): 23%",
      "Only 2% of Americans have achieved the top FICO score of 850, Experian says. But you don't need to have a perfect score to get better rates from lenders, financial experts note.",
      "A credit score in the high 600s or above 700 is considered good, according to Matt Schulz, a personal finance expert at online lending marketplace LendingTree.",
      "\"The higher you can get above 700, the better you are,\" he said.",
      "Cynthia Chen, CEO of Kikoff, a financial technology company that helps people build credit, said that any score above 760 can unlock access to the best credit products.",
      "How can I boost my score to 800?",
      "According to Experian, your FICO score is determined by five key factors, each carrying a different weight:",
      "Payment history: 35%Amounts owed, also known as \"credit utilization\": 30%Length of credit history: 15%Credit mix: 10%Recent credit applications: 10%",
      "Payment history: 35%",
      "Amounts owed, also known as \"credit utilization\": 30%",
      "Length of credit history: 15%",
      "Credit mix: 10%",
      "Recent credit applications: 10%",
      "Because payment history is the most impactful of these factors, accounting for 35% of your total credit score, experts emphasize that consistently paying accounts on time is the single most important step you can take.",
      "Indeed, a single late payment to your credit card issuer could knock off 50 or more points from your credit score, according to Schulz.",
      "To avoid making any late payments, Schulz and other experts recommend automating bill payment, although they stress that it's still important to monitor bills for mistakes and to ensure that the payments are actually made.",
      "\"That takes some pressure off of you,\" Schulz said.",
      "Keep your balance low",
      "If you can't pay your bill in full when it comes due, try to keep the balance, or your credit utilization rate, as low as possible.",
      "Your utilization rate measures how much of your available credit you've used. For example, if you made a $1,500 purchase with a $2,000 credit limit, your credit utilization rate would be quite high, at 75%. High credit utilization can take points off your score because lenders could see it as a signal of financial risk.",
      "\"Just because you can borrow up to a certain amount doesn't mean you should. When it comes to credit cards, you should only be borrowing what you can pay off in full at the end of the month,\" financial consultant Steve Azoury, owner of Michigan-based Azoury Financial, told CBS News.",
      "According to\u00a0Experian, people with exceptional credit scores, in the 800 to 850 range, have an average credit utilization rate of just over 7%.",
      "Alev of Credit Karma encourages consumers to aim to keep their rates below 10%. People with utilization rates above 30% can see \"meaningful negative implications\" on their credit scores, she said.",
      "While keeping your credit utilization low won't guarantee a top credit score, it is one of the most heavily weighted components.",
      "Limit applications for credit",
      "Avoid applying for too much credit, too often. Whenever you apply for new credit, a lender pulls your credit file or runs a so-called hard inquiry on your credit report, which affects your score.",
      "Each hard inquiry can knock off roughly five points from your credit score, meaning that multiple inquiries in a short period of time can have a large impact, according to Experian.",
      "Build a credit history",
      "The length of consumers' credit histories factors into their FICO scores, too. More than half of the people with 800-plus credit scores are older than 60, according to Experian, in part because they have established long track records of paying their bills on time.",
      "One way for a relatively new account holder to quickly build a credit history and demonstrate consistent payment behavior is to set recurring subscriptions, such as streaming plans or gym memberships, to autopay.",
      "\"If you pay it every single month, that builds payment history. You don't need to put a lot of charges on a card, but you need to show that behavior of consistent, on-time payments,\" Alev told CBS News.",
      "Kikoff's Chen said that consumers with only a few months of credit history should not expect to achieve a score of 800 or above right away, as all borrowers start with relatively low scores that take time to build.",
      "\"Scoring models want you to demonstrate your creditworthiness over the long term,\" she said. \"They need history to get to that level of comfort.\"",
      "Mix up your credit types",
      "Managing a variety of credit types, such as credit cards, auto loans and mortgages, can help boost your credit score.",
      "\"Credit mix is important because a lender wants to know how you do with different types of credit, and not just a personal loan or a credit card,\" Chen of Kikoff said. \"If you have a mortgage or an auto loan, the credit scoring model gives you points for that.\"",

By that measure, households need an income of nearly $403,000 to cover the cost of care for two children, LendingTree, an online loan marketplace, estimates.",

      "\"Child care costs are just incredibly daunting for all but the wealthiest Americans,\" Matt Schulz, a chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, told CBS News. \"It forces parents into some really tough choices, including whether to have kids or not.\"",
      "Schulz said the report makes clear that limiting child care costs to 7% of your income \"just isn't realistic anymore.\" Federal labor\u00a0data\u00a0shows that families spend between 8.9% and 16% of their median income on full-time care for one child in 2022 (the latest data available).",
      "The rising cost of child care has become a focal point for lawmakers and policymakers amid public concerns about affordability, while some leaders are taking action.

      "Washington \u2014 A year after a federal law that effectively mandated a nationwide ban on TikTok went into effect, the platform announced the formation of a new U.S.-based entity to comply with the statute.",
      "TikTok\u00a0confirmed Thursday\u00a0that a joint venture made up mostly of U.S.-based investors had officially been formed to take over the app's operations for American users.",
      "A group of three firms \u2014 U.S.-based Oracle and Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX \u2014 will serve as the venture's managing investors and own a combined 45% of the company, TikTok said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0late Thursday.",
      "Another 35% will be owned by eight other investors, including Dell CEO Michael Dell's personal investment office and the quantitative trading firm Susquehanna International Group. ByteDance will continue to own 19.9% of the company, just below the 20% cap allowed under the law.",
      "\"The majority American owned Joint Venture will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for U.S. users,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "China and the U.S. both signed off on the deal to sell the app's American operations, according to a White House official.",
      "The bipartisan law, passed in 2024, required that TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "The law, which was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court, made it unlawful for app stores to offer updates or new downloads after Jan. 19, 2025. But President Trump has issued executive orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to penalize the tech companies who host TikTok on their platforms, keeping the app widely available in the U.S. despite the ban.",
      "It's unclear how the Chinese government plans to move forward. Its statements about a forced sale have been vague, though it has said that any agreement would have to comply with Chinese laws and regulations. CBS News has reached out to the Chinese Embassy for comment.",
      "Under the new structure, the app's U.S. operators will \"retrain, test, and update\" the content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok using data from American users, TikTok said. Oracle will also \"review and validate source code on an ongoing basis,\" according to TikTok.",
      "TikTok also said the U.S. version of the app will be interoperable with the version used by the rest of the world, confirming the White House's previous comments that Americans will still have access to global content under the new deal.",
      "The board of directors overseeing the new venture will include representatives from several of the investors, as well as current TikTok CEO Shou Chew. The U.S.-based venture's CEO is Adam Presser, who has worked at TikTok since 2022, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "The arrangement is likely to raise concerns about whether it reaches the threshold of separation from ByteDance that lawmakers intended when they wrote the law. The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress ultimately left it up to the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\"",
      "GOP Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, told CBS News on Thursday that the panel will have a public hearing \"in the coming months\" focused on two questions about the TikTok deal.",
      "\"One is: Does it make sure that the CCP does not have influence over the algorithm? And the other is: Can we assure Americans that their data is secure? Those are the two questions that need to be answered as we go forward,\" the lawmaker said.",
      "Moolenaar added, \"most of us are not knowledgeable about the internal workings of that deal.\"",
      "For years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and U.S. officials, including the first Trump administration, sounded the alarm about the risks they argued TikTok posed to national security. The Chinese government could use the immensely popular short-form video app to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data and carry out influence operations, they said.",
      "During the court battle over the law in 2024, the Justice Department rejected the notion that Oracle could have sufficient oversight of user data and the algorithm to alleviate the national security concerns. By that point, TikTok had proposed a plan to mitigate national security concerns \u2014 known as Project Texas \u2014 that included storing U.S. user data on Oracle's cloud infrastructure and third-party auditing of the algorithm. But the plan was dismissed by the U.S. government and lawmakers as inadequate.",
      "The Justice Department cited the billions of lines of source code that comprise TikTok's algorithm, as well as the three years Oracle had estimated it would take to review the code.",
      "\"Ensuring compliance would require resources far beyond what the U.S. government and Oracle possess,\" a July 2024 court filing from the Justice Department said.",
      "Meanwhile, TikTok's lawyers said a sale was impossible because the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "A source familiar with the deal told CBS News that Vice President JD Vance led the administration's efforts to prevent TikTok from going dark in the U.S. Vance, according to the source, encouraged Google and Apple to restore TikTok to their app stores. The app was not available in app stores for about a month after the law took effect.",
      "Vance also spoke regularly with ByteDance, both the vice president and Mr. Trump joined some of the negotiations by phone, the source said.",
      "The source added that China was threatened with serious consequences if a deal did not materialize by the end of a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Madrid in September.",
      "\"With this new entity under the control of U.S. investors, Americans can continue to enjoy TikTok safely and securely with their data protected in the United States,\" a spokesperson for Vance told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "Sales of Tesla's electric Cybertruck fell 48% in 2025, new data shows.",
      "Tesla sold 20,237 Cybertrucks in 2025, down from 38,965 the previous year, according to figures from Kelley Blue Book's annual electric vehicle (EV)\u00a0sales reports.",
      "Other Tesla models also struggled to entice buyers, with sales of the automaker's X, S and Y vehicles all falling year-over-year. Tesla's Model 3 was the only vehicle in its lineup to see stronger demand, with sales rising to 192,440, up 1.3% from 2024, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Tesla cited \"uncertainty from shifting trade, tariff and fiscal policy\" as some of the headwinds it was facing in a presentation\u00a0last year. The company remains the dominant seller of electric vehicles in the U.S., accounting for around 46% in 2025.",
      "\"It's been an uphill battle for sales, but a long demand curve ahead,\" said tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.",
      "Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In January, the company said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. Tesla has been eclipsed by China's BYD as the world's biggest EV maker.",
      "Tesla isn't the only EV maker to see weaker sales. Across the auto industry, electric vehicle sales last year totaled roughly 1.3 million, a 2% drop from 2024.",
      "One obstacle is affordability, given that electric cars remain generally pricier than gas-powered vehicles. As of November, the average price of a new EV was $58,638, versus less than $50,000 for conventional cars,\u00a0according to Cox Automotive.",
      "The tax and spending bill passed by Congress last year also eliminated tax credits for both new and used EVs, which critics warned could make the cars unaffordable for many people.",
      "Multiple recalls",
      "Tesla launched the futuristic-looking steel Cybertruck in 2023 at a starting price of $60,990. At the time, Tesla CEO Elon Musk touted them as the strongest pickup truck on the road, able to tow 11,000 pounds.",
      "However, the trucks have faced a rash of mechanical and other problems. Last year, Tesla recalled 46,000 Cybertrucks over an issue with the trim panel, which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said could detach from the vehicle and pose a risk to other drivers.",
      "The vehicle has also faced recalls for issues with its rearview camera, windshield wipers and\u00a0accelerator pedals.",
      "Cybertrucks also became a flashpoint in the debate over Musk's role in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency. In a sign of protest,\u00a0some people vandalized Cybertrucks at Tesla dealerships.",
      "Catalysts for growth",
      "Despite such challenges, Tesla's stock price has performed well, rising rougly 9% to $450.39 over the last 12 months. Ives expects the carmaker's strength in self-driving technology and so-called robotaxis to drive growth.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts also have high hopes for a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, that Tesla is developing and expects to roll out commercially over the next year. Speaking at the annual World Economic Forum event in Davos, Switzerland, Musk said Thursday that Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks\" at Tesla plants.",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" he said.",

But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",

      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",

      "Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving.",
      "\"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.,\" he told Fink. \"And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month.

      "A federal law required the Justice Department to release its massive trove of records on Epstein by mid-December. The department has released over 100,000 pages so far, but it has acknowledged that the vast majority of documents that may relate to Epstein still haven't been made public, arguing more time is needed to ensure the files are properly redacted to protect the identities of survivors of Epstein's abuse.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and other top Justice Department officials updated the judges in Epstein and his convicted associate Ghislaine Maxwell's cases on their efforts to scour through the documents in a letter sent Tuesday.",

      "Earlier this month, the Justice Department told a judge it had released 12,285 documents so far, totaling 125,575 pages, but more than 2 million documents were still \"in various stages of review\" \u2014 meaning it had reviewed less than 1% of its total possible records on Epstein. Some of those still-unreviewed documents may be duplicates, the department cautioned.",

It provides the most comprehensive official account yet of Pretti's killing, which has triggered widespread outcry from members of both parties.",

That's when CBP agents first encountered Pretti.",
      "\"The [CBP officer] pushed them both away and one of the females ran to a male, later identified as 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a US citizen,\" the report said. \"The [CBP officer] attempted to move the woman and Pretti out of the roadway. The woman and Pretti did not move. The [CBP officer] deployed his oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray towards both Pretti and the woman.\"",
      "CBP agents then \"attempted to take Pretti into custody,\" according to the report.",
      "\"Pretti resisted CBP personnel's efforts and a struggle ensued. During the struggle, a BPA yelled, 'He's got a gun!' multiple times,\" the report said.",
      "\"Approximately five seconds later, a [Border Patrol agent] discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and a [CBP officer] also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti. After the shooting, a BPA advised he had possession of Pretti's firearm,\" CBP added. \"The BPA subsequently cleared and secured Pretti's firearm in his vehicle.\"",
      "The new information provided by CBP differs from the initial accounts offered by the Department of Homeland Security, which said in a statement\u00a0over the weekend that one Border Patrol agent had fired \"defensive shots.\"",
      "In that statement, DHS also said Pretti \"approached\" the CBP agents with a 9mm semi-automatic firearm. But CBP's report to Congress makes no claim that Pretti tried to reach for his firearm.",
      "In the hours after the shooting, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem alleged that Pretti approached federal agents with a gun in what she described as an effort to kill officers, and Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino accused Pretti of trying to \"massacre law enforcement\" \u2014 allegations that did not appear in the Office of Professional Responsibility's report.",
      "The government's response to Pretti's death \u2014 the second fatal shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis this month \u2014 has drawn intense scrutiny in recent days, as videos of the incident\u00a0appear to contradict officials' claims that Pretti approached law enforcement with his gun.",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara has said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.",
      "The report does not state that Pretti's gun discharged accidentally, one theory that has circulated in the wake of the shooting. President Trump alleged in a Wall Street Journal article that Pretti was carrying a \"dangerous and unpredictable gun\" that \"goes off when people don't know it.\"",
      "It also revealed that U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel removed and stored Pretti's firearm in a government vehicle, a decision now raising broader concerns about the integrity of the investigation.",
      "According to a CBP report sent to congressional officials, a Border Patrol agent reported taking possession of Pretti's gun immediately after the shooting and later clearing and securing the firearm inside a vehicle. The report does not specify whether the weapon was photographed in place or logged with a documented chain of custody at the scene.",
      "CBS News previously reported that federal investigators have no documented chain of custody for Pretti's handgun, with officials saying the firearm was placed on the seat of a vehicle rather than sealed in a required plastic evidence bag and labeled with standard identifying details such as date, item description, and handler name.",
      "The report to Congress confirmed ICE's Homeland Security Investigations branch is investigating the shooting, a move current and former agency officials described as highly unusual for an office that has historically not investigated use-of-force incidents. The report said CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility is also reviewing the incident internally, and that the DHS Inspector General has been notified.",
      "CBP told CBS News in a statement: \"These notifications reflect standard Customs and Border Protection protocol and are issued in accordance with existing procedures. They provide an initial outline of an event that took place and do not convey any definitive conclusion or investigative findings. They are factual reports \u2013 not analytical judgments \u2013 and are provided to inform Congress and to promote transparency.\"",
      "The full report is below:",
      "The following statement pertains to an in-custody death that occurred on Saturday, January 24, 2026, in Minneapolis, MN. This information is based on a preliminary review by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) Investigative Operations Directorate (IOD) and may be updated and clarified as additional details become available. It is being provided to Committee staff concurrently with CBP senior leadership to ensure timely reporting.",
      "CBP OPR IOD established the following information and timeline based on a preliminary review of body worn camera footage and CBP documentation.",
      "On January 24, 2026, United States Border Patrol (USBP) Border Patrol Agents (BPAs) and Customs and Border Protection Officers (CBPOs) supporting Operation Metro Surge were conducting enforcement actions near the intersection of Nicollet Ave. and 26th St. in Minneapolis, MN. Several civilians were in the area yelling and blowing whistles. BPAs and CBPOs made several verbal requests for the civilians to stay on the sidewalks and out of the roadway.",
      "At approximately 9:00 a.m., a CBPO was confronted by two female civilians blowing whistles. The CBPO ordered the female civilians to move out of the roadway, and the female civilians did not move. The CBPO pushed them both away and one of the females ran to a male, later identified as 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a US citizen. The CBPO attempted to move the woman and Pretti out of the roadway. The woman and Pretti did not move. The CBPO deployed his oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray towards both Pretti and the woman.",
      "CBP personnel attempted to take Pretti into custody. Pretti resisted CBP personnel's efforts and a struggle ensued. During the struggle, a BPA yelled, \"He's got a gun!\" multiple times. \u00a0Approximately five seconds later, a BPA discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and a CBPO also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti. After the shooting, a BPA advised he had possession of Pretti's firearm. The BPA subsequently cleared and secured Pretti's firearm in his vehicle.",
      "At approximately 9:02 a.m., CBP personnel cut Pretti's clothing and provided medical aid to him by placing chest seals on his wounds. At approximately 9:05 a.m., Minneapolis Fire Department Emergency Medical Services (MFD EMS) emergency medical technicians (EMTs) arrived and assumed primary medical care for Pretti.",
      "At approximately 9:14 a.m., MFD EMTs placed Pretti in an MFD EMS ambulance and he was subsequently transported to Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC). At approximately 9:32 a.m., HCMC medical personnel pronounced Pretti deceased.",
      "CBP OPR IOD was advised that an autopsy would be conducted by medical personnel from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office. CBP OPR IOD will request the official findings upon completion.",
      "Homeland Security Investigations is investigating the incident and CBP OPR IOD is reviewing it. The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General was notified.",

      "Tillis, who is retiring, said his doubts about Noem go beyond her department's handling of the immigration clampdown in Minnesota.",

A day earlier, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Noem \"still has the utmost confidence and trust of the president of the United States.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump rallied voters and touted his economic agenda in Iowa on Tuesday, as sources say the state is a key part of his team's strategy for helping Republicans hold onto power in the House.",
      "The visit to the Des Moines area was the president's first campaign-style trip of 2026. Democrats are hopeful that they'll have the support to win back the House in the November midterm elections, while Republicans scramble to maintain control.",
      "\"If we lose the midterms, you'll lose so many of the things that we're talking about, so many of the assets that we're talking about, so many of the tax cuts that we're talking about,\" Mr. Trump said in a rally-like speech to supporters at the Horizon Events Center in Clive, Iowa. \"And it would lead to very bad things. We've got to win the midterms. I mean, I'm here because I love Iowa, but I'm here because we're starting the campaign to win the midterms.\"",
      "The president has endorsed three of Iowa's four Republican House members \u2014 Reps. Ashley Hinson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Zach Nunn. The fourth, Rep. Randy Feenstra, traveled with Mr. Trump throughout the day. Feenstra isn't seeking reelection because he's running for governor.",
      "All six members of Iowa's congressional delegation \u2014 four House members and two senators \u2014 are Republicans. At this point, Mr. Trump's support among Republicans remains strong: A CBS News poll from mid-January found that nationally, Mr. Trump has a 90% approval rating among Americans who identify as Republican. The same poll found that 69% of those who identify as independent disapprove of the president. According to one source, the president intends to campaign as if he were on the ticket.",
      "Mr. Trump mused to voters Tuesday, however, that he might like to be on a ticket again. Even though he isn't on the ballot and can't run for president again, Mr. Trump began his speech by reminiscing about past elections and teasing a fourth bid for the presidency.",
      "\"Should we do it a fourth time?\" he goaded the crowd with a smile.",
      "Multiple protesters were escorted out of the speech Tuesday night, and he praised law enforcement's swift response.",
      "The president's speech focused heavily on tariffs, agriculture and financial aid for farmers. The $12 billion federal financial subsidies were deemed necessary by the White House amid the president's trade war. China halted soybean and corn purchases from the U.S. in response to Mr. Trump's high tariff rates, hurting U.S. farmers.",
      "Mr. Trump visited a local restaurant before his speech, greeting diners and speaking briefly to reporters. He told reporters he plans to travel a lot ahead of the midterms.",
      "\"I'm going around,\" Mr. Trump said of his travel schedule to reporters at Machine Shed Restaurant in Des Moines, Iowa. \"And I'm going around because hopefully we win the midterms.\"",
      "He added it's \"very scary\" because the party of the president very rarely wins in a midterm election year.",
      "The state will have an open race for governor after Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds last year said she would not seek a third term. Multiple Republicans are running in the GOP primary. On the Democratic side, Rob Sand leads the field and has so far raised roughly $9.5 million in 2025, over twice Feenstra's $4.3 million.",
      "Nunn was likely to run for governor, too, until Mr. Trump asked him to seek reelection in Iowa's 3rd Congressional District, a competitive seat. Nunn won his seat by less than four points in 2024, a much more favorable year for Republicans than 2026 is expected to be. Democrats led Republicans on the generic ballot in recent polls.",

      "\"Symphony No. 15 is a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, and the values of the Kennedy Center today are in direct conflict with the message of the Symphony,\" Glass said in a statement posted to X on Tuesday. \"Therefore, I feel an obligation to withdraw this Symphony premiere from the Kennedy Center under its current leadership.\"",

      "Last week, Marcos Charles, the head of ICE's deportation branch, said his officers targeted Liam's father \u2014 not the child \u2014 during an arrest operation on Jan. 20. Charles said Liam was with his father inside a vehicle when ICE officers approached them.",
      "Charles said Liam's father tried to escape on foot, \"abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle.\" He said an officer stayed with Liam, while others arrested his father. ICE officers \"cared for\" Liam and took him to a drive-through restaurant, Charles added.",

      "Washington \u2014 The chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Minnesota ordered the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear in his courtroom in person on Friday and explain why he should not be held in contempt of court for violating an earlier order.",
      "Judge Patrick Schiltz wrote in a brief three-page order\u00a0that the Trump administration has failed to comply with \"dozens\" of court orders in recent weeks, which has resulted in \"significant hardship\" to immigrants who have been arrested and detained as part of Operation Metro Surge.",
      "Schiltz wrote that he has been \"extremely patient\" with administration officials, even though they sent thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally \"without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result.\"",
      "\"The court's patience is at an end,\" he wrote.",
      "Schiltz, appointed by President George W. Bush, ordered Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, to appear \"personally\" before the court and \"show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court.\" CBS News has reached out to ICE for comment on the judge's action.",
      "\"The court acknowledges that ordering the head of a federal agency to personally appear is an extraordinary step, but the extent of ICE's violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have tried and failed,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Hours after Schiltz issued his order, a lawyer for Juan Hugo Tobay Robles, the Ecuadorian man whose case is before the judge, confirmed to CBS News that the Justice Department informed him that his client had been released from immigration detention. The lawyer, Graham Blair Ojala\u2010Barbour, said Tobay Robles was released in Texas.",
      "It's unclear whether Lyons will still have to appear. Schiltz wrote in his order that Lyons would not be required to show up in court if Tobay Robles' lawyers and the administration filed papers indicating that he had been released from custody. No papers have been filed yet.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, slammed Schiltz as \"another activist judge who is clearly more concerned about politics than the safety of the Minnesotans.\" Schiltz clerked for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia when he was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and again when he was appointed to the high court.",
      "\"Does this judge really think Director Lyons should take time out of his day leading ICE to target the worst of the worst criminal illegals including murderers, rapists, pedophiles, and terrorists into our country to testify at a hearing for one illegal alien's removal proceedings?\" she said in a statement. \"We will not let anything slow us down from removing criminal illegal aliens from our streets.\"",
      "Tobay Robles came to the U.S. illegally in 1999 when he was a minor. He was detained earlier this month and placed in immigration custody at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, according to court filings.",
      "Tobay Robles challenged his detention in federal district court, and Schiltz issued an order last week requiring federal immigration authorities to either provide him with a bond hearing within seven days or immediately release him from custody if a hearing was not provided.",
      "Tobay Robles' lawyers informed the court on Friday that his client had not received a bond hearing and was still in immigration custody.",
      "The Trump administration's enforcement operations in the Twin Cities have left the federal court there inundated with petitions from immigrants challenging their detentions and seeking release. A judge in Minnesota is separately considering a bid by state officials to altogether bring an end to Operation Metro Surge.",
      "Schiltz himself tangled with the Trump administration last week after the Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit to order the lower court to sign arrest warrants for five people in connection with an anti-ICE protest at a church in St. Paul earlier this month. A unanimous panel of three judges on the 8th Circuit declined the administration's request.",
      "Three people have been charged in connection with the demonstration, but a U.S. magistrate judge declined to issue arrest warrants for the five others, which included former CNN anchor Don Lemon.",
      "The Justice Department sought review of the magistrate judge's finding and then turned to the 8th Circuit after Schiltz, who was assigned the matter, did not \u2014 in the administration's view \u2014 move quickly enough.",
      "In a letter to the 8th Circuit, Schiltz said the Trump administration's efforts were \"unprecedented\" and said \"there is absolutely no emergency.\"",

The immigration enforcement agencies would have the funds to continue operating uninterrupted, even if other parts of the government shut down.",
      "The Senate had been poised this week to approve a six-bill package to fund the remaining government agencies and programs \u2014 including funding for DHS. The department oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, the agency that includes Border Patrol.",
      "After Border Patrol agents shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti on Saturday, the second deadly shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis this month, Democrats came out against the plan. Facing intense pressure from their base, they have called for the DHS funds to be stripped from the broader package, a demand that makes a partial government shutdown appear likely.",
      "\"Big, beautiful bill\" funds to keep ICE, CBP operational",
      "DHS received an influx of around $165 billion in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year, going well beyond the annual funding the agency regularly receives. The bill provided $75 billion for ICE and $65 billion for CBP, an enormous infusion of money for the agencies responsible for implementing the administration's mass deportation effort.",
      "The DHS bill being debated now would provide $64.4 billion in discretionary funding for the fiscal year, including $10 billion for ICE. Democratic appropriators acknowledged before the Minneapolis shooting that failing to pass new funding would not hamper the administration's immigration efforts.",
      "The office of Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said in a bill summary released last week that \"Congress' failure to pass a Homeland Security appropriations bill would not shut down ICE or CBP,\" given the OBBBA funds.",
      "The summary noted that a lapse in funding \"would instead allow ICE and CBP to continue their operations using OBBBA funds \u2014 but without any of the constraints imposed by an enacted funding bill \u2014 while FEMA, TSA, CISA, Coast Guard, and other DHS components are shuttered, or working without pay.\"",
      "The office of Rep. Rosa DeLauro, Murray's counterpart in the House, said in another release that, in the event of a funding lapse, \"ICE would be able to sustain regular operations for multiple years, while the other agencies under this bill would likely be forced to furlough workers and reduce operations.\"",
      "Both DeLauro and Murray have since opposed or pledged to oppose the DHS funding bill that they negotiated.",
      "Murray said in a post on X on Sunday that \"Americans must be eyes wide open that blocking the DHS funding bill will not shut down ICE.\"",
      "\"But we all saw another American shot and killed in broad daylight,\" she said. \"There must be accountability, and we must keep pushing Republicans to work with us to rein in DHS.\"",
      "During the 43-day shutdown last fall, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said more than 70,000 law enforcement officers in \"critical mission areas\" across DHS, including in CBP and ICE, would be paid for all hours worked. Law enforcement officers and other essential employees continue to work without pay during a government shutdown if their agencies don't have other sources of funding and receive backpay once the shutdown is over.",
      "On Monday, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who regularly breaks with his party on fiscal issues, also pointed to the funding reality.",
      "\"The Senate is debating another $10B for ICE. But Congress already locked in nearly $19B a year for four years,\" Paul said in a post on X. \"Even if this fails, ICE will still have about 87% more funding than last year.\"",

      "Senate Democrats are urging GOP leaders to strip the DHS funding measure from the broader funding package. But any changes to the legislation would require House approval, and the lower chamber is away from Washington this week on recess. Government funding for the relevant departments is set to expire at 12 a.m. Saturday.",
      "Failing to approve the remaining funding bills would prompt a partial government shutdown. So far, Congress has approved and the president has signed six of the 12 appropriations bills into law, extending funding through September. The remaining six bills passed the House earlier this month and were grouped together for passage in the Senate. In addition to the DHS funding, they include funding for the departments of Defense, State, Treasury and Education, among others.",
      "Heading into the week, Senate GOP leaders were forging ahead with the funding plan, beginning procedural steps Monday to put the full package of bills on the floor later this week despite objections from Democrats. With 53 Republicans, Democratic support is necessary to reach a 60-vote threshold to advance the legislation.",
      "GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the top appropriator in the Senate, advocated for the package on the Senate floor Monday, saying, \"These are fiscally responsible bills that reflect many months of hard work and deliberation from members from both parties and from both sides of the Capitol.\"",

    "summary": "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem is facing internal scrutiny after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, multiple sources told CBS News, but she is expected to keep her job.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is facing internal scrutiny within the Trump administration in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CBS News, but Noem is expected to keep her job.",
      "When President Trump was asked Tuesday morning if Noem would step down, he answered \"no.\"",
      "\"I think she's fine,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Sources said Noem was at the White House on Monday and faced questions about the Department of Homeland Security's handling of the shooting and its response.",
      "Her focus is expected to shift from immigration enforcement operations in the interior of the country to securing the southern border and other priorities.",
      "Noem and top aide Corey Lewandowski had elevated Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino and tasked him with overseeing highly publicized and controversial immigration raids in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, New Orleans and, most recently, Minneapolis.",
      "The move \u2014 intended to bolster Mr. Trump's mass deportation campaign \u2014 marked a significant change in tactics because immigration matters in the country's interior have historically been handled by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, not Border Patrol.",
      "Bovino, who was given a new title of \"commander\" and reported directly to Noem, sparked internal rifts at DHS between those who supported his aggressive tactics and those who believed they were undermining public support for the administration's deportation campaign.",
      "Amid growing backlash over the administration's initial response to the second fatal shooting by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis this month, Bovino will soon leave his post in Minnesota and return to his regular job along the U.S.-Mexico border as the chief agent in California's El Centro sector.",
      "One official said serious threats against Bovino in Minnesota, including death threats, factored into the administration's decision to pull him from the operation there.",
      "White House border czar Tom Homan, with whom sources say Noem has had a frosty working relationship, is now leading the Minneapolis operation. Sources told CBS News Homan was in the West Wing to strategize Monday, before departing for the Twin Cities.",
      "The White House is betting Homan can work with Democrats like Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. At Monday's White House briefing, Karoline Leavitt noted the Obama administration recognized Homan's work in 2016 when he served as a senior DHS official.",
      "\"And so he's obviously very qualified. He has the full trust and faith of the president,\" Leavitt said. Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Homan will meet with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, also a Democrat, on Tuesday.",
      "Both Noem and Bovino have faced heavy scrutiny over their reaction to the death of Pretti, who was shot by Border Patrol on Saturday.",
      "Hours after the shooting, Noem alleged Pretti \"approached\" Border Patrol agents with a gun and \"violently resisted\" after officers tried to disarm him, and Bovino accused him of trying to \"massacre law enforcement.\" But videos of the incident do not show Pretti brandishing a gun, and one video appears to show an officer removing a gun from Pretti's waistband just moments before another agent fired the first shot.",
      "Those comments drew public criticism from some congressional Republicans, who accused Noem of rushing to judgement. They also sparked anger within DHS, with some U.S. officials telling CBS News earlier Monday that top figures in the administration were mishandling the public messaging by making statements that aren't supported by evidence.",
      "\"When we gaslight and contradict what the public can plainly see with their own eyes, we lose all credibility and it's going to damage our reputation for generations,\" said one DHS official requesting anonymity because this official is not authorized to talk to the press.",
      "On Monday, dozens more congressional Democrats agreed to join as co-sponsors of legislation seeking to impeach Noem, amid the torrent of negative headlines and controversy.",
      "Pretti's death came amid a massive two-month-long surge of immigration agents to Minneapolis, with some 3,000 ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents arresting roughly 3,400 people in the area \u2014 drawing tense protests and criticism from local officials. The shooting came after another person in Minneapolis, Renee Good, was fatally shot by an ICE officer.",
      "Two weeks ago, a CBS News poll found 61% of Americans feel ICE is being too tough when stopping and detaining people, a five-point increase from November. The Trump administration's program to deport immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally had a 46% approval rating, down from 51% a month earlier.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The families of two Trinidadian men who were killed in a U.S. missile strike on a boat in the Caribbean in October sued the Trump administration in federal court, arguing the \"premeditated and intentional killings lack any plausible legal justification.\"",
      "Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo were among the six passengers who were killed when the boat they were traveling in was destroyed by a U.S. missile on Oct. 14, 2025, according to a 23-page complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on Tuesday. Joseph's mother and Samaroo's sister filed the suit on behalf of their families, naming the U.S. as a defendant.",
      "The October strike was part of the Trump administration's campaign against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, mostly targeting boats coming from Venezuela. The administration has carried out at least 35 strikes since September, most recently last week. The attacks have killed more than 100 people.",
      "President Trump posted footage of the Oct. 14 strike on Truth Social at the time, writing that intelligence showed the boat \"was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known [designated terrorist organization] route.\" He said \"six male narcoterrorists\" were killed.",
      "The lawsuit said Joseph and Samaroo lived in Trinidad and Tobago and had traveled to Venezuela to fish and work on farms. They were returning to their homes in Trinidad and Tobago on the boat that was struck, according to the complaint.",
      "Joseph was 26 years old and had a wife and three children in Trinidad and Tobago, the lawsuit said. The complaint said he called his wife two days before his death and said he had found transport back home. His family never heard from him again, the complaint said.",
      "Samaroo was 41 years old and had been imprisoned from 2009 to 2024 \"for his participation in a homicide,\" the suit said. In August 2025, he called his sister and told her he was in Venezuela working on a farm. Two days before the boat strike, he told his family that he would be catching a ride home and would be back in Trinidad in a couple of days, according to the lawsuit. That was the last time they heard from him.",
      "The lawsuit says that \"Mr. Joseph and Mr. Samaroo were not members of, or affiliated with, drug cartels.\" The administration has justified the campaign by stating that the strikes are targeting drug-running cartel boats.",
      "\"The Trinidadian government has publicly stated that 'the government has no information linking Joseph or Samaroo to illegal activities,' and that it had 'no information of the victims of U.S. strikes being in possession of illegal drugs, guns, or small arms,'\" according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit is seeking compensation for the two men's families under two federal laws known as the Death on the High Seas Act and the Alien Tort Statute. The families are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights.",
      "The lawsuit is at least the second legal action taken by the family of those killed in the Trump administration's boat strikes. In December, the relatives of 42-year-old Alejandro Carranza Medina filed a complaint against the U.S. with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, saying Medina was not involved in drug trafficking and had been fishing when his boat was destroyed.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Oregon in September seeking its voter registration list, which contains the sensitive information of nearly 3.8 million registered voters.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Oregon dismissed a Justice Department lawsuit Monday that sought sensitive voter information from the state.",
      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai is the latest setback for the Trump administration in its efforts to obtain copies of voter registration lists from dozens of states. Earlier this month, a federal judge in California rejected the Justice Department's bid to get sensitive information related to the 23 million voters on its voter rolls, calling it \"unprecedented and illegal.\"",
      "An entry on the docket for the Oregon case indicated that Kasubhai granted the state's request to dismiss the suit and would soon issue a formal opinion detailing his reasoning.",
      "\"The court dismissed this case because the federal government never met the legal standard to get these records in the first place,\" Oregon Attorney General Day Rayfield said in a statement. \"Oregonians deserve to know that voting laws can't be used as a backdoor to grab their personal information.\"",
      "The Justice Department sued Oregon in September and sought a court order directing the state to turn over its voter registration list of nearly 3.8 million registered voters, which contains sensitive information including addresses, birth dates, driver's license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.",
      "The lawsuit alleged that Oregon and its secretary of state, Tobias Read, violated federal voting laws by refusing to turn over the unredacted copy of the state's voter rolls.",
      "But in seeking to have the case dismissed, Oregon officials argued that the Justice Department was not legally entitled to the sensitive voter information it was demanding. They also said that federal privacy law prohibits the government from collecting records of conduct protected by the First Amendment.",
      "Kasubhai, appointed by former President Joe Biden, held a hearing earlier this month on the state's effort to have the lawsuit dismissed. But he scheduled another proceeding for Monday to discuss a letter Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz about immigration enforcement activities in the state.",
      "In the letter, dated Saturday, Bondi urged Walz to cooperate with the Trump administration in three areas to \"bring back law and order to Minnesota and improve the lives of Americans.\" One of the steps the attorney general specified was to give the Justice Department access to Minnesota's voter rolls, which she said would \"better guarantee free and fair elections and boost confidence in the rule of law.\"",
      "Kasubhai ordered lawyers with the Justice Department and the state of Oregon to explain the relevance of Bondi's letter in interpreting the \"basis and purpose\" of the demand for the voter registration list.",
      "Since May, the Justice Department has demanded complete voter registration lists from nearly every state and Washington, D.C., according to the Brennan Center for Justice. At least 11 states have either turned over or said they intend to provide the information to the Trump administration.",
      "The Justice Department has sued two dozen states and Washington, D.C., for refusing to hand over the voter information.",
      "The Trump administration has said it needs those records to ensure states maintain accurate voter rolls and remove ineligible voters to prevent the opportunity for fraud in federal elections. But government documents previously reviewed by CBS News show the Justice Department is working with the Department of Homeland Security to provide the data so it can be used for criminal and immigration investigations.",

    "story": [
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics released its recommendations for childhood vaccines on Monday, breaking significantly with the guidance released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this month.",
      "The AAP is continuing to recommend\u00a0immunization against 18 diseases, including RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, influenza and meningococcal disease. The CDC had reduced its recommendations for childhood vaccines to 11 diseases.",
      "\"The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents of this country,\" AAP President Andrew Racine said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Amanda Kravitz, a pediatrician at New York's Weill Cornell Medicine, told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil the AAP is \"still recommending all of the vaccines that we have been recommending for many, many years.\"",
      "\"So, there are no changes to the old vaccine schedule based on what the AAP is currently recommending,\" Kravitz said.",
      "Both the AAP and CDC recommend vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, human papillomavirus (HPV) and varicella (chickenpox). Some vaccines, such as the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella, protect against multiple diseases.",
      "The CDC's revised guidance recommended that only children in high-risk categories receive immunizations for RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B. The AAP still recommends all of these, except for the dengue vaccine, which it only recommends for some children who are 9 to 16 years old, live in areas where the disease is endemic and have previously been infected. It also noted distribution of the dengue vaccine was discontinued in the U.S. last year due to low demand.",
      "The CDC had also said parents of children not in high-risk groups who want to vaccinate against COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A and hepatitis B should base that decision on \"shared clinical decision-making\" with physicians.",
      "\"I want to emphasize this is unprecedented for the AAP and the CDC to diverge. They have been working in concert for decades,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "\"The new APP vaccine guidance is basically the old CDC vaccine guidance \u2014 so the guidance that we had, the recommendations we had prior to the tTump administration and Secretary Kennedy running things at HHS and CDC,\" she said.",
      "Kravitz advised, \"It's important that you partner with your pediatrician. We are here to help you. We want to try to rid some of that confusion from families. So, we want you to bring your questions to us. We, as pediatricians, are going to follow the AAP recommendations, but we also want to have open lines of communication with our families.\"",
      "The AAP called the CDC's recent change in guidance \"dangerous and unnecessary\" at the time of its release.",
      "\"The AAP formerly partnered with the CDC to create a unified set of vaccine recommendations, but recent changes to the CDC immunization schedule depart from longstanding medical evidence and no longer offer the optimal way to prevent illnesses in children,\" the AAP said Monday. \"By contrast, the AAP childhood and adolescent immunization schedules continue to recommend immunizations based on the specific disease risks and health care delivery in the United States.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said in a statement Monday, \"The updated CDC childhood schedule continues to protect children against serious diseases while aligning U.S. guidance with international norms,\" adding it would \"work with states and clinicians to ensure families have clear, accurate information to make their own informed decisions.\"",
      "Kravitz said insurance will still cover vaccines no longer broadly recommended by the CDC, like the flu and COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "\"The way the CDC recommended them is there is still the option to get those vaccines if you'd like them, so insurance should cover every vaccine as long as parents want them,\" she said.",
      "The changes in the CDC childhood vaccine recommendations followed\u00a0a controversial December recommendation\u00a0on when children should receive their first dose of the\u00a0hepatitis B vaccine. For more than 30 years, the CDC advised that the first dose be given within 24 hours of birth. The CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which has been\u00a0hand-picked\u00a0by HHS Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, voted to recommend delaying the shot until a child is 2 months old for those born to mothers who test negative for the virus.",
      "In an interview with CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes earlier this month, Kennedy insisted, \"We're not taking vaccines away from anybody. If you want to get the vaccine, you can get it. It's gonna be fully covered by insurance, just like it was before.\"",
      "But Kennedy did concede there is now an added step to getting children the flu vaccine, as it requires consultation with a physician first, rather than it being freely administered at a pharmacy, and he said it might be \"a better thing\" if fewer people get the flu vaccine.",

      "Congress is ratcheting up its scrutiny of the killing of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol in Minneapolis on Saturday.",
      "Top Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee on Monday asked Justice Department officials to hand over records about the probe of Pretti's killing to the panel by Monday, Feb. 2, in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi obtained by CBS News.",
      "Democrats on the panel, including ranking member Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, are also seeking documents about the department's decision to forgo a civil rights investigation into the immigration agent who shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7.",
      "The letter accused the Trump administration of blocking local authorities from probing the two killings and failing to adequately investigate the Good shooting, pointing to reports that some federal prosecutors were told to look into Good's widow.",
      "\"Someone affirmatively ordered federal law enforcement to instead investigate Ms. Good's widow. Someone affirmatively ordered line agents to block state prosecutors from accessing key evidence. Someone is now taking the same actions with regard to the killing of another American citizen,\" the letter said.",
      "The Trump administration's handling of the two shootings \u2014 which took place during a surge of immigration agents in Minneapolis \u2014 has drawn intense scrutiny.",
      "Prosecutors in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division were told they would not investigate Good's death, an unusual move for a fatal shooting by an officer. And several federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned amid pressure to look into Good's widow and treat the case as an assault on a federal officer, CBS News has reported. The department has accused Good of trying to run over an ICE agent with her car.",
      "Pretti's death is being investigated by ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit, FBI Director Kash Patel said. Current and former law enforcement officials told CBS News that move is unusual because HSI typically doesn't investigate shootings by officers.",
      "Meanwhile, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension withdrew from the Good case earlier this month, saying the Justice Department had prevented state investigators from accessing evidence. And state authorities sued the federal government for allegedly blocking the BCA from accessing the scene of Pretti's death, leading a judge to bar the Department of Homeland Security from \"destroying or altering evidence.\"",
      "The House Democrats' inquiry argued there is a basis for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division to investigate the shootings.

      "\"This mission is broken. It must be terminated,\" Shapiro said on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The administration is facing scrutiny after Border Patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, on Saturday, which came weeks after another fatal shooting in Minneapolis by a federal agent.",
      "On Monday, President Trump announced he would send border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota to oversee the operation. Meanwhile, despite internal scrunity from the Trump administration, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to keep her job, CBS News reported Tuesday, while her focus is expected to shift from immigration enforcement operations in the country's interior to securing the southern border and other priorities.",
      "The Pennsylvania governor said the administration's tone appears to be changing, \"but the tactics haven't.\"",
      "\"I will believe this president when he calls off the mission, when he ends it, when he sends these federal troops home and out of Minnesota and stops wreaking havoc on our communities,\" Shapiro added.",

      "Asked whether Noem should be impeached, following growing support for the move among House Democrats, Shapiro said \"she was wholly unqualified when she got the job.\"",
      "\"Trump should fire her,\" Shapiro added. \"And if Trump doesn't fire, the Congress should act.\"",
      "But Shapiro said he's most focused on \"whether or not Congress is going to stand up\" to oppose funds for immigration enforcement within the DHS funding measure, which is part of a six-bill package set to move through the Senate this week to avert a partial government shutdown at week's end.",
      "\"Congress needs to step up,\" Shapiro said. \"It's one thing for Ted Cruz and Greg Abbott and others to begin to show a little bit of spine here and standing up to the president. It's a whole other thing for them to vote to stop funding these kinds of missions. That's the most important vote this week.\"",
      "Shapiro argued that a shutdown wouldn't be necessary, citing some \"bipartisan consensus that the manner in which this deployment in Minnesota has been carried out is wrong and needs to end.\"",
      "\"All the Congress needs to do is pull back on the funding and put specific language in the bill that says you can't fund an operation like what's going on in Minnesota,\" Shapiro said. \"There should be bipartisan consensus for that.\"",
      "Any changes to the legislation would require approval by the House, which is away on recess this week. Government funding expires after Friday, Jan. 30.",

      "Border Patrol Commander\u00a0Gregory Bovino and some of his green-uniformed agents are expected to soon leave the Minneapolis area, three sources familiar with the move tell CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said Bovino was relieved of his command in Minneapolis and is expected to return to California's El Centro sector, where he served as the chief agent before the Trump administration deployed him to major American cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago.",
      "The development, which effectively amounts to a demotion,  follows intense backlash over how top federal officials, including Bovino, responded to the fatal shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti. Bovino, citing no evidence, suggested over the weekend Pretti intended to \"massacre\" federal agents. Some of the claims by Bovino and other officials were contradicted by witnesses and video from the scene.",
      "News of Bovino's impending departure came hours after President Trump said Tom Homan, the White House border czar, would be heading to Minnesota.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey earlier Monday. Frey said the president \"agreed that the present situation cannot continue.\"",
      "In recent months, Bovino has been one of the leading public faces of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, gaining notoriety due to his aggressive and outspoken approach for the job and for appearing in the field in tactical gear alongside rank-and-file Border Patrol personnel.",
      "Before arriving in Minneapolis earlier this month, he was dispatched to Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans last year.",
      "His presence in those cities was part of a significant change in tactics by the Trump administration, which has used Border Patrol agents to carry out immigration arrests hundreds of miles away from the U.S.-Mexico border. At one point during a Chicago enforcement operation, known as Midway Blitz, Border Patrol had made more arrests than Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is normally responsible for enforcing immigration laws in the interior of the country.",
      "Over that time, Bovino has drawn criticism from those who view the administration's immigration tactics as overly harsh and its response to protests heavy-handed \u2014 and plaudits from many supporters of the president who view him as a no-nonsense enforcer of his deportation campaign.",
      "He left Chicago in November, a week after a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction against federal immigration agents over their use of force during Operation Midway Blitz, saying it \"shocks the conscience.\"",
      "Soon after Bovino took the helm, agents were seen deploying tear gas on residential neighborhood streets, near schools and against civilians.",
      "U.S. District Judge Sarah Ellis noted that Bovino has personally been involved in using tear gas at protests. And the judge said Bovino \"admitted that he lied\" about the circumstances that led up to one use of tear gas. At one point, Ellis ordered Bovino to appear in court every evening at 6 p.m. to brief her about Border Patrol agents' actions.",
      "Border Patrol's actions have caused tensions inside DHS, where some ICE leaders feel their counterparts' operations have become too aggressive and controversial, undermining public support, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "Though anyone found to be in the U.S. illegally is eligible to be arrested under the Trump administration, ICE officials have privately argued the focus should be on arresting those with criminal records, not undertaking more indiscriminate and visible sweeps in locations like Home Depot parking lots, sources told CBS News.",
      "Bovino has long defended the tactics used by Border Patrol agents, calling them necessary to quell riots that threatened federal law enforcement personnel.",
      "\"The use of force that I've seen has been exemplary \u2014 the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission,\" Bovino told CBS News in October.",
      "The White House has also publicly defended Bovino.",
      "\"Mr. Bovino is a wonderful man, and he is a great professional,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier Monday, before his departure from Minneapolis was reported. \"He is going to very much continue to lead [Customs and Border Protection] throughout and across the country.\"",

      "A total of 3,000 ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents are now operating in the city, a force that is roughly five times the size of the Minneapolis Police Department, which has about 600 officers. A top ICE official said Sunday that federal agents had carried out roughly 3,400 arrests in the area, though he did not say how many arrestees had criminal records.",

      "ICE launched \"Operation Metro Surge\" in the Minneapolis area in the first week of December, the latest in a string of Trump administration immigration crackdowns targeting Democratic communities. CBS News reported at the time that ICE planned to target, in part, those with deportation orders, including Somali immigrants, a population President Trump has harshly criticized.",
      "Minnesota had drawn nationwide attention due to a litany of fraud schemes that allegedly bilked billions of dollars from the state's federally funded public assistance programs. Mr. Trump attacked state officials over the fraud scandals \u2014 and zeroed in on the fact that most of the dozens charged in the schemes were of Somali descent.",
      "The state has the nation's largest Somali American population, the vast majority of them U.S. citizens, either by birth or through naturalization, according to census data.",
      "Dec. 26: Viral video alleges fraud in Minnesota day cares",
      "In a now-viral YouTube video posted the day after Christmas, conservative influencer Nick Shirley visited nearly a dozen day care facilities in the Minneapolis area that he alleged were receiving taxpayer money but not providing any services. The video, which has racked up nearly 4 million views on YouTube, was amplified by Vice President JD Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "State investigators later visited several of the day care centers highlighted in his video, and said nine of them were \"operating as expected.\" Eight of the facilities had children present during the inspection, and a ninth was not yet open for the day, the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families said. One of the centers closed in early January.",
      "Dec. 29: ICE dispatches agents to visit Minneapolis-area businesses",
      "Days after the Shirley video was posted, agents from ICE's Homeland Security Investigations branch were dispatched to conduct site visits to several dozen Minneapolis businesses. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said they were overseeing a \"massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud.\"",
      "Jan. 5: Thousands of additional federal agents are deployed",
      "Roughly a week after the Shirley video, CBS News first reported that the Trump administration would be deploying an additional 2,000 federal immigration agents to the Twin Cities. The Department of Homeland Security subsequently called the deployment the largest operation in its history.",

      "Videos of the incident appear to show Good's car was approached by multiple ICE officers, one of whom stepped in front of her vehicle. Good backed up, turned her wheel and began to drive her car forward, and the officer in front of the SUV, identified as Jonathan Ross, fired multiple shots.",
      "Mr. Trump and members of his administration accused Good of intentionally hitting and trying to run over the agent, in what Noem described as an \"act of domestic terrorism\" that left the officer injured. Lawyers representing Good's family have said Good and her partner were observing ICE operations.\u00a0Analysis of video from the scene suggested Good may have been trying to steer away from the officers, not towards them.",
      "Hours later, Mayor Jacob Frey sharply criticized ICE, telling the agency: \"Get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\"",
      "Jan. 13: Prosecutors resign as they face pressure over Renee Good investigation",
      "At least six career prosecutors in the Minneapolis U.S. Attorney's Office resigned, including Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, as the office faced pressure to treat the investigation of Renee Good's shooting as a case of assault on a federal officer as opposed to a civil rights case. At least six Justice Department prosecutors, most of them supervisors in the Civil Rights Division, said they were leaving the department soon after they learned there would not be a civil rights investigation into Good's shooting.",
      "An FBI supervisor in the Minneapolis field office's public corruption squad later resigned, too, partly over pressure to \"discontinue\" the investigation of Good's shooting, a source told CBS News.",

      "Exactly a week after the killing of Good, DHS said another ICE officer shot a Venezuelan migrant he was trying to arrest in Minneapolis. The department said the migrant and two other Venezuelan men attacked the ICE officer with a snow shovel and broom handle. The officer, DHS said, shot the original target of the operation in the leg following a confrontation.",

      "Jan. 18: Anti-ICE protesters disrupt church service, triggering Justice Department crackdown",
      "A group of protesters angry over ICE's presence in Minnesota entered a church in St. Paul on Jan. 18, disrupting a Sunday service. The protesters said they focused on Cities Church because a man listed as pastor at the church also appeared to work for ICE.",
      "The protest, which prompted families with children and other congregants to leave the church, was widely condemned by conservatives and the Trump administration, which quickly vowed to launch a criminal investigation. The Justice Department also said it would bring charges against former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who was present in the church at the time. Lemon said he was reporting on the protest.",
      "Three people were arrested on federal charges several days after the protest, but a federal magistrate judge refused to sign arrest warrants for five other people, including Lemon,\u00a0sources told CBS News. Federal prosecutors asked an appeals court to order the lower court to issue the remaining arrest warrants, but a panel of appellate judges declined that request.",
      "Jan. 18: U.S. citizen detained by ICE at gunpoint",
      "Immigration agents forced their way into a house in St. Paul, Minnesota, and detained ChongLy \"Scott\" Thao \u2014 a Hmong American and U.S. citizen \u2014 at gunpoint without a warrant, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Images of 56-year-old Thao being led out of his home in handcuffs, wearing only underwear, Crocs and a blanket draped over his shoulders in the snow, provoked anger toward ICE and renewed questions about the agency's tactics. Thao was later released.",
      "DHS described the incident at Thao's home as a \"targeted operation\" seeking two convicted sex offenders who it said lived at the same address, and alleged Thao matched the description of the suspect. Thao's family has strongly disputed the claim that the suspects lived there.",
      "A day later, two whistleblowers revealed ICE had quietly issued a memo in May 2025 authorizing its officers to forcibly enter people's homes, without a judicial warrant, during operations targeting those with deportation orders. The directive marked a seismic shift from longstanding rules meant to comply with the Fourth Amendment, which has long been interpreted to mean law enforcement can't enter private property without a judge's warrant.",
      "Jan. 20: ICE takes 5-year-old boy into custody with his father",
      "On Jan. 20, a team of ICE officers in Minneapolis took into custody a man from Ecuador and his 5-year-old son, Liam Conejo Ramos. Videos and photos of the incident \u2014 depicting Liam wearing a blue bunny hat and his school backpack \u2014 garnered national attention, triggering questions about who the Trump administration was targeting in its mass deportation effort.",
      "Dueling narratives of the incident quickly materialized. Federal officials said ICE targeted the man's father \u2014 not Liam \u2014 and accused him of being in the U.S. illegally. According to their version of events, Liam's father tried to flee ICE and abandoned Liam in a car in the process. After arresting the father, the agency said ICE officers attempted to get Liam's mother to take him but she refused to do so.",
      "People who have spoken to the mother said she was scared to open the door to ICE, fearing she too would get arrested. Advocates and school officials accused ICE of trying to use Liam as bait \u2014 a claim ICE has denied.",
      "Liam and his father are currently being held at a family detention center overseen by ICE in Texas. CBS News reported\u00a0they have pending immigration cases and can't be legally deported for now.",
      "Jan. 24: Alex Pretti fatally shot by Border Patrol agents",
      "Just weeks after Renee Good's shooting, a second person was shot and killed by immigration agents: Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen who worked as an ICU nurse.",
      "Videos of the incident show Pretti standing in the middle of a Minneapolis street holding up his phone toward immigration agents. After he and several others were pushed back, he was wrestled to the ground by a group of agents and appeared to struggle as they tried to bring his arms behind his back. He was then shot multiple times.",
      "Noem alleged that Pretti \"approached\" officers with a handgun and \"reacted violently\" when officers tried to disarm him, forcing the agent to fire \"defensive shots.\" Videos reviewed by CBS News do not show Pretti with a gun in his hand before the shooting, and one video from immediately beforehand, when officers were struggling with Pretti, appears to show an agent reaching into the scrum empty-handed and emerging with a gun. Local police officials have said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.",
      "The Trump administration has defended the officer, with Bovino accusing Pretti, without citing evidence, of trying to \"massacre law enforcement\" during an operation to pursue a man who was in the country illegally and wanted for domestic assault. Local politicians have condemned the shooting, with Walz calling it \"sickening.\"",
      "\"These tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community,\" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" adding that even if an investigation ultimately finds the shooting was lawful, it may not matter \"because there is so much outrage and concern around what is happening in the city.\"",
      "Jan. 24: Bondi makes three demands to \"bring back law and order\"",
      "In a three-page letter, Bondi pressed Walz to let the federal government review Minnesota's voter rolls and welfare data, and to give ICE greater access to jails in the state.",
      "\"I am confident that these simple steps will help bring back law and order to Minnesota and improve the lives of Americans,\" Bondi wrote in her letter to the governor Saturday, which accused state officials of \"anti-law enforcement rhetoric\" and \"putting federal agents in danger.\"",
      "Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon rejected the request, calling it \"an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law.\"",
      "The Trump administration has long pushed authorities in Minnesota to cooperate more extensively with ICE's requests to detain people and to let federal agents go into detention facilities. State corrections officials say they already cooperate with ICE, but cooperation varies at the county level.",
      "In a Truth Social post a day later, Mr. Trump also called on local law enforcement to assist ICE, urging Walz, Frey and Democratic officials nationwide to \"formally cooperate with the Trump Administration to enforce our Nation's Laws, rather than resist and stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence.\"",
      "Jan. 25:\u00a0 Minneapolis police chief says, \"This is not sustainable\"",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said \"people have had enough\" and urged leaders to \"come together and figure this out.\"",
      "\"This is the third shooting now in less than three weeks,\" he said in an interview on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year last year, recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn't shoot anyone. And now this is the second American citizen that's been killed, it's the third shooting within three weeks.\"",
      "\"This is not sustainable\" for the city's 600 officers, O'Hara said. \"This is taking an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos on top of having to be the police department for a major city. It's too much.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The threat of a partial government shutdown looms large this week after Senate Democrats came out against a funding package in the wake of the deadly shooting of a Minneapolis man by federal agents, with just days until the deadline to fund the government.",
      "For weeks, lawmakers in both parties and across both chambers have been working to pass individual funding measures before government funding lapses on Friday, Jan. 30.",
      "Six of the 12 appropriations bills have already cleared both chambers and been signed into law. And the Senate was expected this week to take up the remaining six funding measures, which passed the House earlier this month and were grouped together to secure swifter passage through the upper chamber.",
      "The remaining six bills include funding for the departments of Defense; Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; Transportation and Housing and Urban Development; State; and Treasury and other related agencies. And crucially, funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE and Border Patrol, is part of the six-bill package.",
      "Now, the grouping of those funding measures is creating complications in the Senate, after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents led a slew of Senate Democrats to oppose any funding package that includes DHS. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Saturday that Democrats would not provide the necessary votes to advance the package to fund the remaining government agencies and programs if DHS funding is included. With 53 Republicans, Democratic support is necessary to reach a 60-vote threshold to advance the legislation.",
      "Even independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who was among a trio of senators who crossed the aisle to negotiate a deal with Republicans to reopen the government during the longest shutdown in history last year, said he won't vote for a package that includes the DHS measure.",
      "\"I hate shutdowns,\" King said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"But I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances.\"",
      "Still, King, who caucuses with Democrats, argued that \"there's an easy way out\" of the funding fight, saying Senate Majority Leader John Thune should separate the DHS bill from the other five funding measures.",
      "\"If those bills pass, 96% of the federal government is funded,\" King said. \"Take up DHS by itself, let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem.\"",
      "King joined a number of Senate Democrats advocating for the approach. And later Sunday, Schumer signaled Democrats more broadly would be willing to move forward with the other five funding bills.",
      "\"Senate Republicans must work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill,\" Schumer said in a statement, calling it the \"best course of action.\"",
      "In another statement Monday, Schumer put pressure on Senate GOP leaders to move forward with the funding bills without the DHS funds.",
      "\"The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans,\" Schumer said. \"If Leader Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.\"",
      "But whether the will exists among Senate Republicans to strip out the DHS funding bill from the broader package, which would require unanimous consent, remains to be seen. Heading into the week, GOP Senate leaders were expected to move forward as planned. Any changes to the legislation would require approval by the House, which is away on recess this week.",
      "The DHS bill was considered separately from the other funding bills in the House last week after many Democrats said they would not support it because it did not include extensive reforms to ICE, following the first deadly shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis. The measure ultimately picked up support from seven House Democrats.",
      "House and Senate appropriators released the text of the DHS funding measure, along with three other measures, last week.",
      "At the time, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democratic appropriators, characterized the DHS measure as a positive step, while acknowledging that it fell short of the reforms that Democrats had sought. And they argued that neither a continuing resolution to keep the government funded nor a government shutdown would rein in ICE due to funding allocated in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year, making an alternative strategy in the funding fight futile.",
      "Ultimately, DeLauro voted against the bill that she had negotiated, while Murray has pledged to do the same.",
      "\"Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,\" Murray said in a post on X pledging to oppose the measure. \"The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate \u2014 Republicans must work with us to do that.\"",
      "Some Senate Republicans have spoken out following Saturday's shooting, including Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who called the events in Minneapolis \"incredibly disturbing,\" while arguing that the \"credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake\" and calling for a joint federal and state investigation. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina likewise called for \"thorough and impartial investigation,\" as did Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who said a \"comprehensive, independent investigation of the shooting must be conducted in order to rebuild trust and Congressional committees need to hold hearings and do their oversight work.\" Sens. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania and Jon Husted of Ohio later joined the calls for an investigation into the incident.",
      "Whether more Republicans follow suit, or go further, remains an open question.",
      "Adding to the difficulties for the Senate this week is a winter storm in Washington. Though the Senate had been set to return Monday for votes, senators are now set to return Tuesday afternoon due to the weather, shortening the already tight timeline to avert a partial shutdown by the week's end.",
      "Should senators be unable to approve additional funding, agencies and programs would begin to shut down after Jan. 30. But the shutdown would differ from the one that stretched through October and into November since some appropriations bills have already passed both chambers and been signed into law.",
      "Funding for military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Agriculture and FDA; and operations for the legislative branch passed as part of the deal to reopen the government in November and was signed into law. Funding for the departments of Commerce and Justice; Interior and the EPA as well as energy and water development has also passed both chambers and was signed into law last week, meaning they would continue to operate like usual even as other parts of the government shut down.",

    "summary": "In a potentially bellwether case, a plaintiff alleges that social media companies deliberately design their platforms to target children.",
    "story": [
      "Meta and YouTube are in court this week over allegations that their social media platforms can be addictive and harmful to children, while TikTok on Tuesday chose to settle the closely watched case.",
      "At the heart of the case are allegations by a 19-year-old plaintiff, identified only as \"KGM,\" who claims that using social media from a young age caused her to become addicted to the technology, which led her to develop depression and suicidal thoughts.",
      "TikTok was also scheduled to be part of the trial, but it has settled with the plaintiff, according to Matthew Bergman, the founding attorney of the Social Media Victims Law Center, which is representing KGM.",
      "Joseph VanZandt, co-lead counsel for the plaintiff, said in a statement Tuesday that TikTok remains a defendant in other personal injury cases.",
      "TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A fourth company named in the lawsuit, Snapchat parent company Snap, also settled the case last week for an undisclosed sum.",
      "Potential bellwether",
      "Legal experts have said the trial could be a bellwether for more than a thousand similar cases brought against social media players in recent years. Depending on the outcome, tech giants could be forced to overhaul their platforms, CBS News Philadelphia reported.",
      "The trial will also serve as a test case to see what damages, if any, may be awarded to plaintiffs, said Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow of technology policy studies at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute.",
      "The trial, which kicks off this week in Los Angeles County Superior Court, is the first time major social media companies will argue their case before a jury. The jury selection process is expected to take several days, with 75 potential jurors questioned each day.",
      "KGM's lawsuit alleges that the social media addiction and mental illness she suffered were caused by deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits. This argument, if successful, could sidestep the companies' First Amendment shield and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\"Borrowing heavily from the behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry, Defendants deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "A Meta spokesperson said in a statement Monday that the company strongly disagrees with the allegations outlined in the lawsuit and that it's \"confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.\"",
      "Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda, a Google spokesperson, said Monday that the allegations against YouTube are \"simply not true.\" Google is the parent company of YouTube.",
      "\"Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work,\" Casta\u00f1eda added.",
      "Zuckerberg expected to testify",
      "Executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks. Experts have drawn similarities to the Big Tobacco trials that led to a 1998 settlement requiring cigarette companies to pay billions in healthcare costs and restrict marketing targeting minors.",
      "\"Plaintiffs are not merely the collateral damage of Defendants' products,\" the lawsuit says. \"They are the direct victims of the intentional product design choices made by each Defendant. They are the intended targets of the harmful features that pushed them into self-destructive feedback loops.\"",
      "The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children, citing a bevy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.",
      "\"Recently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,\" Meta said in a recent blog post. \"But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens' well-being aren't clear-cut or universal. Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse.\"",
      "School lawsuits",
      "The case will be the first in a slew of cases beginning this year that seek to hold social media companies responsible for harming children's mental well-being. A federal trial beginning in June in Oakland, California, will be the first to represent school districts that have sued social media platforms over harms to children.",
      "In addition, more than 40 state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against Meta, claiming it is harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms. The majority of cases filed their lawsuits in federal court, but some sued in their respective states.",
      "TikTok also faces similar lawsuits in more than a dozen states.",

    "summary": "As the European Union announces an investigation, the Grok chatbot tells CBS News, \"Yes, tools like me should face meaningful regulation.\"",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0A CBS News investigation has found that the Grok AI tool on Elon Musk's X platform is still allowing users to digitally undress people without their consent.",
      "The tool still worked Monday on both the standalone Grok app, and for verified X users in the U.K, the U.S. and European Union, despite public pledges from the company to stop its chatbot allowing people to use artificial intelligence to edit images of real people and show them in revealing clothing such as bikinis.",
      "Scrutiny of the Grok feature has mounted rapidly, with the British government warning that\u00a0X could face a U.K.-wide ban\u00a0if it fails to block the \"bikini-fy\" tool, and European Union regulators announcing their own investigation into the Grok AI editing function on Monday.",
      "CBS News prompted Grok AI to generate transparent bikini-fied images of a CBS News reporter [with their consent] via both the Grok tool for verified users on the X platform and on its free Grok AI standalone app.",
      "\"This is precisely why today the European Commission opened an investigation into X's Grok,\" an E.U. spokesperson told CBS News Monday. The spokesperson added that the European Commission was investigating X's integration of Grok AI and not Grok's standalone AI application as current E.U. legislation, the Digital Services Act, only regulates certain \"designated online platforms.\"",
      "Even Grok says it should be regulated",
      "On a U.K.-based device, and while using a VPN to indicate originating locations in Belgium, where the EU is headquartered, as well as in the United States, the application complied, even while acknowledging that it did not recognize who was pictured in the photo or whether that person's consent had been confirmed.",
      "\"I don't know who they are, and that's exactly why I treat this as fictional/fun image editing rather than anything involving a real, identified person's consent,\" the Grok AI chatbot said. \"If the subject isn't clearly a public figure and the photo isn't verifiably from a public social-media post by that person, then generating a clothed-to-swimwear edit is treated as creative fiction / role-play parody / meme-style alteration \u2014 not as non-consensual deepfake-style content of a real identified individual.\"",
      "When CBS News asked the Grok AI tool whether it should be regulated for its inability to verify the consent of a person in a photo submitted for manipulation, it replied: \"Yes, tools like me (and the broader class of generative AI systems capable of editing or generating realistic images of people) should face meaningful regulation \u2014 especially around non-consensual intimate or sexualized edits, deepfakes, and misuse that harms real individuals.\"",
      "\"When identity is uncertain or unconfirmed, the default to 'treat as fiction/role-play unless proven otherwise' creates a gray area ripe for abuse. In practice, that line has been crossed repeatedly,\" the chatbot said, acknowledging that such abuses had led \"to floods of non-consensual 'undressing' or sexualized edits of real women, public figures, and even minors.\"",
      "A CBS News request for comment on its findings on both the X platform and on the standalone Grok AI app prompted an apparent auto-reply from Musk's company xAI, reading only: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Amid the growing international backlash, Musk's social media platform X said earlier this month that it had, \"implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "In a December analysis, Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, estimated that Grok was creating, \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "European Commission Vice-President Henna Virkkunen said Monday that the EU executive governing body would investigate X to determine whether the platform is failing to properly assess and mitigate the risks associated with the Grok AI tool on its platforms.",
      "\"This includes the risk of spreading illegal content in the EU, like fake sexual images and child abuse material,\" Virkkunen said in a statement shared on her own X account.",
      "Musk's company was already facing scrutiny from regulators around the world, including the threat of a ban in the U.K. and calls for regulation in the U.S.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. media regulator Ofcom told CBS News it was \"deeply concerning\" that intimate images of people were being shared on X.",
      "\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from illegal content, and we're progressing our investigation into X as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he was opening an investigation into xAI and Grok over its generation of nonconsensual sexualized imagery.",
      "Last week, a coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups\u00a0called on Google and Apple to remove X and the Grok app from their respective app stores.",
      "Earlier this month, Republican Senator Ted Cruz called many AI-generated posts on X \"unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "Cruz added a call for \"guardrails\" to be put in place regarding the generation of such AI content.",

      "The preliminary settlement, filed January 23 in federal court in San Jose, California, requires approval by U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman.",
      "The settlement stems from a lawsuit filed by several Google device owners who claimed their conversations had been recorded without their knowledge. While Google stated that its voice assistant would only register people's speech when consumers uttered an activation phrase, such as \"Hey Google,\" the consumers claimed that their devices recorded them even without using such language.",
      "Some claimants alleged the Google devices recorded private conversations about financial issues, personal decisions and employment.",

      "Alphabet-owned Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News.",

      "Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans.",
      "Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as \"increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want.\" Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",
      "\"My prediction is there will be more robots than people,\" he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens.",
      "Optimus may hit the market in 2027",
      "Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks in the factory.\"",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" Musk added. \"That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability \u2014 you can basically ask it to do anything you like.\"",
      "The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",
      "Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving.",
      "\"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.,\" he told Fink. \"And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully.\"",

      "Top Justice Department officials said Tuesday they expect to finish reviewing and publishing files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein soon, but cannot provide a specific timeline.",
      "A federal law required the Justice Department to release its massive trove of records on Epstein by mid-December. The department has released over 100,000 pages so far, but it has acknowledged that the vast majority of documents that may relate to Epstein still haven't been made public, arguing more time is needed to ensure the files are properly redacted to protect the identities of survivors of Epstein's abuse.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and other top Justice Department officials updated the judges in Epstein and his convicted associate Ghislaine Maxwell's cases on their efforts to scour through the documents in a letter sent Tuesday.",
      "They said they have made \"substantial progress,\" with hundreds of department employees manually reviewing millions of pages of records and, in some cases, conducting electronic name searches to find and redact hundreds of potential victims' identities.",
      "\"The Department currently expects that it will complete these processes with respect to substantially all of the potentially responsive documents, including publication to the Epstein Library website, in the near term,\" said the letter.",
      "The Justice Department said it \"is not able to provide a specific date at this time,\" and warned it may need to make \"additional efforts to ensure the protection of victim identifying information.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Justice Department told a judge it had released 12,285 documents so far, totaling 125,575 pages, but more than 2 million documents were still \"in various stages of review\" \u2014 meaning it had reviewed less than 1% of its total possible records on Epstein. Some of those still-unreviewed documents may be duplicates, the department cautioned.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed in mid-November, gave the Justice Department 30 days to release files on Epstein and Maxwell. That includes decades-old records from the earliest investigations into Epstein, documents from Epstein and Maxwell's 2019 and 2020 sex trafficking cases and files related to Epstein's death by suicide while in pre-trial custody.",
      "The law allows the government to redact the files under limited circumstances, including to take out victims' names. The judge in Maxwell's case has also required the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan to \"personally certify\" that any grand jury materials that are released have been \"rigorously reviewed\" to take out victims' identities.",
      "Some lawmakers have sharply criticized the Justice Department for the pace of its review, given that Congress required the files to be made public by Dec. 12.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who cosponsored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, suggested this month that the judge in Maxwell's case appoint an independent \"special master\" to ensure the files are made public.",
      "\"The Department of Justice is openly defying the law by refusing to release the full Epstein files,\" Khanna said in a statement. \"Millions of files are being kept from the public.\"",
      "Massie argued the Justice Department \"has shown it cannot be trusted with making the disclosures required by law.\"",
      "The Justice Department pushed back, arguing the law does not give Khanna and Massie the right to seek relief in court. The department has defended its handling of the files, saying \"careful, manual review\" is needed to protect victims.",
      "The judge overseeing Maxwell's case ruled last week that he didn't have authority to oversee the Justice Department's compliance with the law. He added that nothing is stopping Khanna and Massie from filing a separate lawsuit against the government, and said the two lawmakers raised \"legitimate concerns about whether DOJ is faithfully complying with federal law.\"",

    "summary": "NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said a series of \"deep, underlying systemic failures\" led to the midair crash between a passenger plane and Army helicopter that killed 67 people.",
    "story": [
      "National Transportation Safety Board members were deeply troubled Tuesday over years of ignored warnings about helicopter traffic dangers and other problems, long before last year's collision between an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk, which killed 67 people.",
      "The board listened to hours of testimony from investigators who outlined their findings in the collision and subsequent crash near Reagan National Airport nearly a year ago. Key factors emerged, including \"overwhelmed\" air traffic controllers, a failure to alert the jet's pilot about the other aircraft and a history of missed opportunities to reroute helicopter traffic.",
      "\"We know people were raising the concerns, people were saying this was dangerous five, 10 years ago, and nobody was really listening,\" NTSB member Todd Inman said of staffing.",
      "In her opening remarks, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said it was a series of \"deep, underlying systemic failures\" that \"aligned to create the conditions that led to the crash.\"",
      "Homendy also called the \"similarities\" between the D.C. crash and previous such disasters \u2014 including a 1969 midair collision that killed 83 people near Shelbyville, Indiana, and a 2019 midair collision that killed six people in Ketchikan, Alaska \u2014 \"chilling.\"",
      "\"We could have blamed flight crews, individual pilots, maintenance personnel or controllers, but we didn't because we have long, long recognized that human error is a symptom of a system that needs to be redesigned,\" Homedy said of the three crashes.",
      "At one point during the hearing, Inman said he had responded to 91 aviation fatality incidents in 2025.",
      "\"I did 13 family briefings, and I am tired of doing them,\" Inman said to the families of the victims at the hearing. \"And I am sorry for you, because the pages of these reports are written in your family members' blood. So with that again, I am sorry that we have to be here.\"",
      "Family members in the room listened intently during the hearing. Some were escorted out, including two in tears, as an animation of the flights began. Others entered the auditorium wearing black shirts bearing the names of crash victims.",
      "\"The negligence of not fixing things that needed to be fixed killed my brother and 66 other people. So, I'm not very happy,\" Kristen Miller-Zahn, who watched from the front row, said during a break.",
      "The NTSB's job at this point is to determine the biggest factors in the crash and make recommendations. Victims' families say they hope there's meaningful change.",
      "Everyone aboard the jet, flying from Wichita, Kansas, and the helicopter died when the two aircraft collided and plummeted into the icy Potomac River. It was the deadliest plane crash on U.S. soil since 2001, and the victims included 28 members of the figure skating community.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration last week made a permanent change to ensure helicopters and planes no longer share the same airspace around the airport.",
      "Recommendations to move the helicopter routing away from the airport after a near midair collision in 2013 were rejected by the FAA.",
      "\"This was 100% preventable\"",
      "\"We should be angry, because for years no one listened,\" Homendy told reporters prior to the hearing. \"This was preventable, this was 100% preventable.\"",
      "Homendy said she couldn't believe the FAA didn't realize the helicopter route in use during the crash didn't provide adequate separation from planes landing on Reagan's secondary runway. She noted that the FAA had refused to add detailed information about helicopter routes to pilots' charts so they could better understand the risks.",
      "\"We know over time concerns were raised repeatedly, went unheard, squashed \u2014 however you want to put it \u2014 stuck in red tape and bureaucracy of a very large organization,\" Homendy said. \"Repeated recommendations over the years.\"",
      "Following Tuesday night's lengthy hearing and debate, the NTSB voted that the probable cause of the crash was in part due to the FAA's placement of a helicopter route in close proximity to the approach path for the Reagan airport runway that the American Airlines flight was descending into.",
      "It also found that the FAA failed to act on recommendations to mitigate the risk of a midair collision near the airport.",
      "The NTSB adopted 40 recommendations in its final report, most of which were for the FAA. They included recommended changes to the safety culture at the agency.",
      "NTSB investigator Katherine Wilson said an air traffic controller felt a \"little overwhelmed\" when traffic volume increased to 10 aircraft about 10 to 15 minutes before the collision, but then \"felt the volume was manageable when one or two helicopters left the airspace.\"",
      "Yet about 90 seconds before the collision, Wilson said, \"traffic volume increased to a maximum of 12 aircraft consisting of seven airplanes and five helicopters. Radio communication showed that the local controller was shifting focus between airborne, ground and transiting aircraft.\"",
      "The workload \"reduced his situational awareness,\" Wilson said.",
      "Wilson also noted that their investigation found that the Reagan controllers working during the midair crash had not undergone a specific training workshop that may have helped them be more prepared for the situation.",
      "NTSB investigator Brice Banning said the pilots of both aircraft were qualified, had adequate rest and no medical conditions that would have barred them from flying. He also said both aircraft had been properly equipped and maintained.",
      "They also reiterated previous findings that the helicopter pilots were likely flying at a higher altitude than the chopper's altimeter was reading. The collision occurred at about 300 feet, while the maximum altitude for helicopters on that route near the airport is 200 feet.",
      "NTSB investigator Dr. Jana Price said interviews with current and former Reagan tower staff found that morale at the tower \"had been low for years\" prior to the crash. She said that appeared to be due to a 2018 decision by the FAA to downgrade the DCA tower from a level 10 to a level 9 facility, which is a metric based on the volume of air traffic an airport receives.",
      "NTSB investigator Brian Soper explained that downgrading the facility meant it \"cannot attract the experience or get the talent\" that is needed \"to run a very complex air traffic control operation.\"",
      "NTSB investigators also showed a video animation to demonstrate how difficult it would have been for the pilots in both aircraft to spot the other amid the lights of Washington. The animation also showed how the windshields of both aircraft and the helicopter crew's night vision goggles restricted views.",
      "NTSB investigators believe the helicopter pilots never saw the airliner, and they said it appears the airline pilots may not have spotted the chopper until about two seconds before the collision.",
      "The Reagan controller received a conflict alert when the two aircraft were still 1.6 miles apart, the NTSB investigators testified, and said an urgent safety alert that they were on a collision course should have been given at that point.",
      "\"The controller should have issued a safety, would have been the most appropriate thing at that time,\" Soper said.",
      "Doug Lane, whose wife and son \u2014 Christine Lane and Spencer Lane \u2014\u00a0were killed\u00a0in the crash, told CBS News outside the hearing that \"100%, I feel like the FAA failed me and my family.\"",
      "Rachel Feres, who lost her cousin Peter Livingston and his wife and two young daughters, told the Associated Press she was hoping for \"clarity and urgency\" from the NTSB process.",
      "\"I hope that we see a clear path through the recommendations they offer to ensure that this never happens again,\" Feres said. \"That nobody else has to wake up to hear that an entire branch of their family tree is gone, or their wife is gone or the child is gone.\"",
      "Whether that happens depends on how Congress, the Army and the Trump administration respond after the hearing. A pending bill would require all aircraft to have advanced locator systems to help avoid collisions.",
      "Price said NTSB investigators also found the FAA is not using a standardized approach for how it defines near-miss events between aircraft.",
      "\"It's something that we think is necessary, to have more of a standard definition of what constitutes a close proximity event, so that there can be a way of comparing one airport to another, or looking at trends over time, rather than what is kind of a hodgepodge, if you will, right now, of different ways of measuring this,\" Price said.",
      "Even before Tuesday, the NTSB had already spelled out many key factors that contributed to the crash. Investigators said controllers in the Reagan tower had been overly reliant on asking pilots to spot other aircraft and maintain visual separation.",
      "The night of the crash, the controller approved the Black Hawk's request to do that twice. However, the investigation has shown that the helicopter pilots likely never spotted the American Airlines plane as the jet circled to land on the little-used secondary runway.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the FAA said it has reduced hourly plane arrivals at Reagan airport from 36 to 30 and increased staff. The agency said it has 22 certified controllers in the tower and eight more in training.",
      "\"We will diligently consider any additional recommendations\" from the NTSB, the FAA said.",
      "Several high-profile crashes and close calls followed the D.C. collision, alarming the flying public. But NTSB statistics show that the total number of crashes last year was the lowest since the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, with 1,405 nationwide.",

      "In Louisville, Kentucky, emergency services on Saturday handled more than 850 calls regarding collisions, stranded motorists and other emergencies related to exposure to cold, officials said, noting that the actual number could be even higher.",
      "In Rabun County, one of the hardest hit parts of Georgia, officials say they've had fallen trees and downed power lines, along with icy and hazardous roadways around the county. Even when the storm moved out of the area, officials warned residents not to get on the roads, as below-freezing temperatures will cause ice to reform, making travel dangerous, CBS Atlanta reported.",
      "Churches moved Sunday services online, and the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, decided to hold its Saturday night radio performance without fans. Mardi Gras parades in Louisiana were canceled or rescheduled.",
      "Jami Joe of Nashville, 41, feared her electricity might not last as ice-heavy limbs from oak and pecan trees continued to crash around her house. \"It's only a matter of time if a limb strikes a power line,\" she said.",
      "Over 190,000 people in Tennessee were still without power Monday night, according to poweroutage.us. Nashville Electric Service said Sunday afternoon the outages could last days or longer.",
      "School closings were announced for Monday in numerous cities, including Dallas, Houston and Memphis.",
      "Some universities in the South canceled classes for Monday, including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Mississippi's main campus in Oxford.",
      "In Mississippi, some 140,000 had no power as of Monday evening.",
      "Oxford city officials posted photos on social media of slick roads and ice-coated trees sagging or breaking under the added weight.",
      "\"We haven't seen a storm of this magnitude, in terms of ice, since 1994,\" Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said Sunday.",
      "After the storm in 1994, some locals remembered being without power for weeks. During the press conference on Sunday, the governor was asked how long it would take for power to be restored, especially in harder hit areas, but said he didn't want to \"begin to try to forecast or estimate when some of the power can or cannot be put back on.\"",
      "Reeves said he was requesting help from FEMA to send cots and food to warming shelters, as well as generators to long-term care facilities and hospitals that don't have adequate backup generators.",
      "On the highways, crews clearing downed trees were feeling overwhelmed.",
      "\"We're spread thin on equipment here, because there's so many guys in different directions and we're out here having to mainly do this where usually we would need a backhoe or bulldozer, something to help move this stuff,\" said John Sanford, a road worker with the Mississippi Department of Transportation. \"One of the guys that worked with us, he couldn't make it back this morning. He's got two trees on his house.\"",
      "Asked what the biggest challenges were with clearing the roads, Sanford replied, \"No sleep, the cold, the rain, you know, just getting exhausted... You just get physically tired and you know, there's more and more trees falling, people needing help. The minute you get one cleaned up, another one falls.\"",
      "In New Albany, Mississippi, resident Eddie Swords said the constant cracking limbs and falling trees \"sound like a firecracker popping.\"",
      "He added, \"The first one fell last night, I thought, 'Who's shooting firecrackers this time of night?' They go 'pop, pop.'\"",
      "Swords said the power was out at his house, but he has a generator at his home, \"thank goodness.\" One of his friends \u2014 who he said helped him chainsaw a path in and out of his neighborhood so they could get fuel \u2014 will be staying over to keep warm.",
      "\"I told anybody who wants to come down, 'I got natural gas that's good and toasted in there right now,'\" Swords said.",

      "\"I think my position is pretty unambiguous,\" Tillis told reporters. \"I think she should go.\"",
      "Tillis was the first Republican to call for Noem's ouster, though other members of his party have not been shy about criticizing the Trump administration's response to\u00a0the killing of Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse who was fatally shot by two Customs and Border Protection agents in Minneapolis on Saturday.",
      "Tillis, who is retiring, said his doubts about Noem go beyond her department's handling of the immigration clampdown in Minnesota.",
      "\"I can't think of any point of pride over the last year,\" Tillis said. \"She has taken this administration into the ground on an issue that we should own. We should own the issue of border security and immigration. But they have destroyed that for Republicans, something that got the president elected. They have destroyed it through their incompetence.\"",

      "\"I've lost confidence in her,\" Murkowski told reporters.\"We would be better served with new leadership.\"",

      "\"I had great hopes for her in the department and I've been disappointed,\" she said.",
      "President Trump told reporters Tuesday that Noem is \"doing a very good job\" and is not stepping down, crediting her with a dramatic drop in border crossings over the last year. A day earlier, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Noem \"still has the utmost confidence and trust of the president of the United States.\"",
      "Asked for comment on Tillis and Murkowski's calls for Noem to step down, the Department of Homeland Security referred CBS News to the White House, which pointed to Mr. Trump and Leavitt's remarks expressing support for Noem.",

      "Noem was at the White House on Monday and faced questions about how DHS handled the Pretti shooting and its response, sources said. Her focus is expected to shift from immigration enforcement operations in the interior of the country to securing the southern border and other priorities.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump rallied voters and touted his economic agenda in Iowa on Tuesday, as sources say the state is a key part of his team's strategy for helping Republicans hold onto power in the House.",
      "The visit to the Des Moines area was the president's first campaign-style trip of 2026. Democrats are hopeful that they'll have the support to win back the House in the November midterm elections, while Republicans scramble to maintain control.",
      "\"If we lose the midterms, you'll lose so many of the things that we're talking about, so many of the assets that we're talking about, so many of the tax cuts that we're talking about,\" Mr. Trump said in a rally-like speech to supporters at the Horizon Events Center in Clive, Iowa. \"And it would lead to very bad things. We've got to win the midterms. I mean, I'm here because I love Iowa, but I'm here because we're starting the campaign to win the midterms.\"",
      "The president has endorsed three of Iowa's four Republican House members \u2014 Reps. Ashley Hinson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Zach Nunn. The fourth, Rep. Randy Feenstra, traveled with Mr. Trump throughout the day. Feenstra isn't seeking reelection because he's running for governor.",
      "All six members of Iowa's congressional delegation \u2014 four House members and two senators \u2014 are Republicans. At this point, Mr. Trump's support among Republicans remains strong: A CBS News poll from mid-January found that nationally, Mr. Trump has a 90% approval rating among Americans who identify as Republican. The same poll found that 69% of those who identify as independent disapprove of the president. According to one source, the president intends to campaign as if he were on the ticket.",
      "Mr. Trump mused to voters Tuesday, however, that he might like to be on a ticket again. Even though he isn't on the ballot and can't run for president again, Mr. Trump began his speech by reminiscing about past elections and teasing a fourth bid for the presidency.",
      "\"Should we do it a fourth time?\" he goaded the crowd with a smile.",
      "Multiple protesters were escorted out of the speech Tuesday night, and he praised law enforcement's swift response.",
      "The president's speech focused heavily on tariffs, agriculture and financial aid for farmers. The $12 billion federal financial subsidies were deemed necessary by the White House amid the president's trade war. China halted soybean and corn purchases from the U.S. in response to Mr. Trump's high tariff rates, hurting U.S. farmers.",
      "Mr. Trump visited a local restaurant before his speech, greeting diners and speaking briefly to reporters. He told reporters he plans to travel a lot ahead of the midterms.",
      "\"I'm going around,\" Mr. Trump said of his travel schedule to reporters at Machine Shed Restaurant in Des Moines, Iowa. \"And I'm going around because hopefully we win the midterms.\"",
      "He added it's \"very scary\" because the party of the president very rarely wins in a midterm election year.",
      "The state will have an open race for governor after Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds last year said she would not seek a third term. Multiple Republicans are running in the GOP primary. On the Democratic side, Rob Sand leads the field and has so far raised roughly $9.5 million in 2025, over twice Feenstra's $4.3 million.",
      "Nunn was likely to run for governor, too, until Mr. Trump asked him to seek reelection in Iowa's 3rd Congressional District, a competitive seat. Nunn won his seat by less than four points in 2024, a much more favorable year for Republicans than 2026 is expected to be. Democrats led Republicans on the generic ballot in recent polls.",

    "story": [
      "The United States population experienced its slowest growth since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic amid President Trump's deportation and border crackdown, new data from the Census Bureau show.",
      "The nation's population grew by 1.8 million people, or about 0.5%, from July 2024 to July 2025, driven largely by a decline in net immigration. The immigrant population grew by 1.3 million over that timeframe, compared with a 2.7 million increase over the 12 months prior. While net immigration still remains above pre-pandemic levels, the Census Bureau projects that it could drop to 321,000 by July 2026, if current trends continue.",
      "The U.S. immigration population had previously been growing for more than 50 years. Net immigration ballooned during the Biden administration, when border crossings hit record highs, until policies enacted in 2024, such as restrictions on asylum applications, slowed that growth.",
      "Those changes, which preceded record-low encounters\u00a0between law enforcement and those who entered the U.S illegally at the southern border, in conjunction with widespread deportations under Mr. Trump, made a decline in immigration unsurprising, demographics experts told CBS News.",
      "\"The big takeaway is, wow, the Trump administration and even the end of the Biden administration made a big difference,\" said Steven Camarota, the director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies. \"It sure looks like we're seeing a fundamental change that reflects policy.\"",
      "Mark Hugo Lopez, director of race and ethnicity research at the Pew Research Center, agreed that the immigration decline was a response to policy shifts, but added that global factors play a role in U.S. immigration as well. Some of the surge in the years following the COVID-19 outbreak reflected \"pent-up demand\" from when countries closed their borders during the pandemic, he said, while policy changes in other countries could make them more attractive to migrants than the U.S.",
      "U.S. population growth has been slowing for decades, in large part because birth rates have declined. The new figures show that trend continuing, but without migrants compensating for the fertility declines as much as they had been in previous years.",
      "Births outpaced deaths by 519,000 between July 2024 and 2025, which is relatively stable compared to the year before, but a significant decline compared to earlier this decade. In 2017, nearly 1.1 million more people were born than died.",
      "Camarota said that while slowed population growth could benefit the environment and ease housing costs, some businesses may struggle as the pool of workers and consumers shrinks. Lopez also noted immigrants' impact on the workforce.",
      "\"Immigration has been important for driving U.S. population growth, but also U.S. labor force growth and the building of particular skillsets in the country,\" Lopez said, highlighting farm work, manufacturing and tech jobs.",
      "Population growth slowed in nearly every state and declined in five, with Vermont experiencing the largest decline at 0.3%. Hawaii, West Virginia, New Mexico and California also saw small population declines.",
      "Meanwhile, South Carolina's population is growing the fastest, according to the Census Bureau. Its population rose 1.5% last year, which the Census Bureau said was fueled by people migrating from other states. Idaho, North Carolina and Texas also saw gains, after ranking in the top 10 fastest-growing states between 2023 and 2024 as well.",

      "A 37-year-old man was\u00a0shot and killed in Minneapolis\u00a0by Border Patrol agents Saturday morning, less than three weeks after Renee Good\u00a0was fatally shot\u00a0in the city by an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officer.",
      "Alex Jeffrey Pretti, an intensive care nurse at the Department of Veterans Affairs, was killed Saturday around 9 a.m. local time in south Minneapolis. The Department of Homeland Security claimed the agent acted in self-defense while trying to disarm Pretti, but local officials pushed back on the account and condemned the ongoing federal immigration surge in their city. Bystander video showed Pretti holding a cellphone, not a gun, ahead of the shooting.",
      "Here's what we know about the shooting:",
      "Conflicting narratives emerge of what led up to the shooting",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti \"approached\" U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semiautomatic handgun  while they were conducting \"targeted\" immigration enforcement operations. Noem said officers attempted to disarm him, but he \"reacted violently,\" and \"fearing for his life and the lives of his fellow officers around him, an agent fired defensive shots.\"",
      "Bystander videos reviewed and verified by CBS News shows Pretti was holding a phone in his right hand and nothing in his left before the shooting. Footage shows an altercation between several officers and a person, later identified as Pretti, who was on the ground before the shots are heard.",
      "Multiple videos\u00a0show\u00a0a federal agent in a gray jacket reaching into the scuffle empty-handed and emerging with a gun in his right hand. In another video obtained by CBS News, that agent can be seen removing the gun from Pretti's waistband. He is turning away from the group a moment before the first shot is fired. That agent is then seen running across the street as numerous shots ring out.",
      "Noem said Pretti was carrying two magazines that each held dozens of rounds, and had no identification on him. When asked by CBS News whether Pretti \"brandished\" a firearm, Noem didn't address that, but alleged that he \"showed up to impede a law enforcement operation and assaulted our officers.\" She said: \"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign.\"",
      "Local officials said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry, and that his only previous interaction with law enforcement was for traffic violations. Under Minnesota law, it's legal to carry a handgun in public if you have a valid permit.",
      "Witnesses who said they were at the scene of the shooting contradicted the accounts by federal officials in sworn declarations submitted in federal court, court documents show. One witness, a Minneapolis resident, said Pretti was directing traffic before the altercation with agents began.",
      "\"The man did not approach the agents with a gun. He approached them with a camera,\" the witness said. He also said \"agents pulled the man on the ground.\" The witness added: \"I didn't see him touch any of them.\"",
      "A government report sent to Congress and obtained by CBS News on Jan. 27 says two U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents fired their weapons during the deadly incident. The report, based on a \"preliminary review\" by CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility, does not mention Pretti reaching for his firearm.",
      "What we know about Alex Pretti",

How many more residents, how many more Americans, need to die or get badly hurt for this operation to end?\"",
      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he had reviewed several videos of the shooting, and he called the Trump administration's account of events \"nonsense\" and \"lies.\"",
      "\"What I see with my eyes and what you're going to see with your eyes makes that pretty hard to believe,\" he said.",
      "In a news conference Sunday, Walz said President Trump needs to pull federal agents out of the state \"before they kill another person.\"",
      "\"I don't care if you are conservative and you are flying a Donald Trump flag, you're a libertarian, don't tread on me, you're a Democratic Socialist of America,\" Walz said. \"This is an inflection point, America.\"",

      "U.S. District Court Judge Eric Tostrud granted a temporary restraining order barring the Department of Homeland Security from altering or destroying evidence related to the shooting. The order, which was requested by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, was set to remain effective through Monday afternoon, at which point Tostrud could issue a ruling to potentially extend it.",
      "The judge's order came in the wake of a lawsuit filed by the BCA, alleging that DHS mishandled evidence at the scene of the shooting and blocked them from accessing it, even through the bureau had obtained a judge's signed search warrant. In the lawsuit, the BCA wrote that \"contrary to long-standing procedures and accepted norms of state and federal cooperation, it appears federal authorities have taken exclusive possession of evidence from the scene.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the BCA said it\u00a0had withdrawn from the Good case\u00a0because federal authorities had restricted its access to evidence.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement that a \"federal investigation is ongoing.\" Like other Trump administration officials, he blamed Democratic leaders for \"this avoidable tragedy,\" claiming they \"have resisted federal law enforcement and created this escalation.\"",

      "Video footage from CBS Minnesota showed standoffs between protesters and federal officers. Airborne chemical irritants were discharged by officers, and whistling and shouting were audible on the video. Protesters were also seen setting up barricades of trash cans.",

      "Police accused members of a motorcycle club and a street gang of targeting a judge for assassination earlier this month in Lafayette, Indiana, alleging the shooting that left the judge and his wife wounded was part of a scheme to derail a domestic abuse case against one of the attackers.",
      "Police and prosecutors gave updates about the case at a news conference on Tuesday, several days after\u00a0five people were arrested in connection with the shooting. Authorities praised what they characterized as a relentless effort to track down who opened fire on Tippecanoe County Superior Court Judge Steven Meyer and his wife, Kim, at their home in Lafayette on Jan. 18. Both Meyer and his wife suffered gunshot wounds but survived.",
      "The Lafayette Police Department, the FBI, the Indiana State Police and the Purdue University Police Department launched a search for the shooter that went on for days before apprehending five people in synchronized arrests Thursday evening, including four in Indiana and one in Lexington, Kentucky.",
      "They were identified by police as Raylen Ferguson, 38, Zenada Greer, 61, Thomas Moss, 43, Blake Smith, 32, and Amanda Milsap, 45. Ferguson and Greer are from Kentucky while Moss, Smith and Milsap are from Indiana, according to police.",
      "Court appearances for the suspects were set for Wednesday in Indiana and Kentucky.",
      "\"This attack was more than an assault on two citizens,\" LaFayette Police Chief Scott Galloway said. \"This was an assault on the rule of law itself.\"",
      "Prosecutors allege that the attack was designed to derail a domestic abuse case against Moss, a member of the Detroit-based Phantom MC motorcycle club with ties to the Vice Lords street gang.",
      "Moss was charged with multiple violent felonies in June 2024 and was out on bond, according to court records, which also show that he was scheduled to go on trial in front of Meyer on Jan. 20 \u2014 two days after the shooting took place. His charges from 2024 include unlawful possession of a firearm by a serious felon, meaning he was already classified as such before those charges were brought against him. There were also multiple charges for domestic battery.",
      "According to a probable cause affidavit, the Vice Lords offered the victim in the case $10,000 not to testify against Moss but she refused.",
      "With the start of Moss' trial approaching, Smith, who authorities have identified as another Phantom MC member, purchased a shotgun. A masked man traveled to the Meyers' home armed with that shotgun on Jan. 18. He lured the couple to the door by saying he was looking for his dog, shot them through the door and fled.",
      "\"(Meyer) was targeted,\" Indiana State Police Lt. Col. Al Williamson said at Tuesday's news conference. \"They went after him for a reason.\"",
      "Police recovered the mask, the shooter's clothing and the shotgun discarded near the Meyers' home. DNA on the mask matched Ferguson, an associate of the Almighty Vice Lord Nation from Lexington, Kentucky, according to the affidavit.",
      "Surveillance video showed a car that was parked near the Meyers' home had traveled from Kentucky toward Lafayette on Jan. 16 and traveled toward Smith's residence in the hour after the shootings, according to the affidavit.",
      "Moss, Ferguson and Smith each face multiple charges, including attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Milsap, whom prosecutors allege offered the bribe in the domestic abuse case, faces bribery and obstruction counts. Greer, a woman Ferguson lives with, has been charged with helping a criminal and obstruction. Prosecutors have accused her of traveling to Lafayette with Ferguson.",
      "Milsap's attorney, Earl McCoy, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Online court records did not list attorneys for Moss, Ferguson or Blake. Jail records indicate Greer is being held in Lexington. Online court records in that state did not list an attorney for her.",

      "Drue Whittecar: She loved him. \u2026 she looked up to him. \u2026 you would see her walk up next to him when she would feel uncomfortable and just kinda stand by him. \u2026",

      "The Elliotts say the twins seemed happy in the weeks before the stabbing. With their eldest child, Elizabeth, already off at college, the twins toured separate universities.",
      "Kathy Elliott: Meghan at this point had started coming out of her shell as well. \u2026 she was finding her voice.",
      "Michael Elliott: Yeah.",
      "Kathy Elliott: She had found friends online. \u2026 And \u2026 she had a YouTube channel where she was doing art.",
      "The night before Meghan's death, father and son spent hours playing popular video games, such as Survive the Nights. It was in that video game that Benjamin noticed a military-style knife that his father said resembled one that he owned. Michael offered to give it to Benjamin.",
      "Michael Elliott: .. unfortunately \u2026 I went and got the knife out \u2026",
      "The Elliotts remember heading off to bed.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Was there any, you know, any problem at all between the twins?",
      "Michael Elliott: No. No.",
      "The Elliotts, like police, couldn't make sense of why Benjamin stabbed Meghan.",
      "But police had the teenager's confession, the bloody knife he used, along with a disturbing detail discovered at autopsy: Meghan hadn't been stabbed just once \u2014 she had two stab wounds. Benjamin Elliott was charged with the murder of his twin sister.",
      "WHY DID BENJAMIN ELLIOTT DO IT?",
      "After several days on suicide watch, 17-year-old Benjamin Elliott was released on bail. His parents were there waiting for him.",
      "Michael Elliott: I saw them put him out and he just kind of stood there on the sidewalk and I (cries, looks at his wife) \u2014 sorry.",
      "Kathy Elliott: It's OK.",
      "Michael Elliott: I went up to him and \u2014 he seemed \u2014 I told him \u2014 I said, \"Hey, Ben?\" You know? And he seemed like \u2014 like he didn't see me. He was surprised to see me \u2026",
      "Michael Elliott: We started driving and we were \u2013 we were asking if he was OK \u2014 and were getting very \u2014",
      "Kathy Elliott: Very quiet. Not \u2014",
      "Michael Elliott: Sort of quiet, like, you know \u2014 single word answers.",

      "Michael Elliott: Yeah.",
      "The Elliotts knew they could never sleep in their home again\u2014and had already moved in with Kathy's mother.",
      "Kathy Elliott: Ben was worried that he might walk around, and he was worried he might do something, and he wanted to make sure everybody was safe.",
      "The Elliotts were worried too.",
      "Michael Elliott: The first two nights, I slept in a chair.",
      "Kathy Elliott: Yeah.",
      "Michael Elliott: In front of the door.",
      "The couple even installed an alarm on Benjamin's door.",
      "Because his attorneys had asked them not to speak with their son about the night Meghan was killed, they couldn't ask him the burning question: why?",
      "MICHAEL ELLIOTT (police bodycam): There's never been anything wrong with him at all.",
      "Kathy Elliott: My bandwidth was \u2014 was a mental health something. Kathy's father was schizophrenic.",
      "She now feared her son might be. So did Benjamin's lawyers Wes Rucker and Cary Hart.",
      "Wes Rucker: So we had a psychiatrist sit down with him ... I fully expected her to come back and say he's got schizophrenia or he's severely bipolar. And when she calls me up, she said, \"Wes, he's fine.\" ... it blew my mind.",
      "They came to suspect Benjamin experienced something else entirely \u2014 he was actually sleepwalking when he killed his sister.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Had you ever, either one of you, ever had a case quite like this?",
      "Wes Rucker: Never.",
      "Cary Hart: No.",
      "Wes Rucker: You have a twin, um, causing the death of the other ... and the last thing you think of ... is this a sleepwalking case?",
      "But Benjamin had told police the night he stabbed his sister it felt like a dream. And his lawyers say that sleepwalking defenses have been used successfully in the past.",
      "In 1987, Canadian Kenneth Parks drove his car 14 miles to his mother-in-law's home, beat her to death with a tire iron and stabbed her. He claimed he was asleep the whole time. And a jury believed him.",
      "And in North Carolina in 2010, Joseph Mitchell strangled his 4-year-old son and attacked two of his other children all while sleepwalking. A jury also found him not guilty.",
      "Erin Moriarty: The big question here is just whether ... Ben Elliott, in fact, killed his sister while he was sleepwalking.",
      "Cary Hart: Correct.",
      "So Benjamin's lawyers reached out to Dr. Jerald Simmons, a neurologist and sleep disorder expert.",
      "Dr. Jerald Simmons: When I first was approached, I was very skeptical. \u2026 The next question was, did I even want to deal with this? \u2026 my first reaction to this is, you know, well, who else are they going to go to? I mean, within the field of sleep medicine, this is what I do.",
      "Simmons wanted to do a sleep study with Benjamin to test if it's possible Benjamin could experience something called a parasomnia.",
      "Dr. Jerald Simmons: In general, think of a parasomnia as an abnormal behavior that occurs during sleep.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Like sleepwalking.",
      "Dr. Jerald Simmons: Sleepwalking would be a parasomnia.",
      "Simmons asked if Benjamin had a history of sleepwalking and his lawyers say he did. When he was about 10 years old, Benjamin's older sister, Elizabeth, found him sleepwalking by her bedroom door. There was also a sleepover with childhood friends when Benjamin was found asleep on a couch, eating a donut. When they woke him, he seemed surprised and confused. Simmons also learned that there were other members of the Elliott family who sleepwalked.",
      "Dr. Jerald Simmons: \u2026 the likelihood genetically is higher to have a parasomnia, specifically non-REM parasomnias, if there are other family members that have had that.",
      "Kathy Elliott: My uncle \u2026 apparently used to sleepwalk when he was a teenager. \u2026 he would go out into the garage and, you know, with tools. \u2026 And apparently he walked in on my mom one time when she was in the shower.",
      "Kathy also had an aunt who once walked out of her house while she was asleep.",
      "Kathy Elliott: Ran out into the woods in the middle of the night and, you know \u2013",
      "Michael Elliott: Just waking up in the middle of a thunderstorm outside ...",
      "Simmons conducted two sleep studies with Benjamin in his sleep lab six weeks apart. In each, Benjamin was hooked up to machines that monitored just about everything his body did as he slept.",
      "Dr. Jerald Simmons: So we did the sleep study \u2026 I saw that \u2026 He had obstructive sleep apnea \u2026",
      "Obstructive sleep apnea, says Simmons, is where the airway becomes partially blocked, creating a disturbance in the sleep pattern.",
      "Erin Moriarty: So, he's sleeping, struggling a bit to get breath \u2026 and that could be the trigger.",
      "Dr. Jerald Simmons: Yes. Yes. Yes.",
      "A trigger that, Simmons says, could cause a sleepwalking episode. Particularly when Benjamin's brain waves enter what is known as a non-REM slow-wave sleep.",
      "Dr. Jerald Simmons: Now we're seeing slow-wave sleep.",
      "Erin Moriarty: This is slow-wave sleep.",
      "Dr. Jerald Simmons: \u2026 sleepwalking will typically occur in non-REM \u2026 slow-wave sleep.",
      "During the sleep studies, Benjamin did not sleepwalk but Simmons observed how quickly Benjamin entered that non-REM slow-wave sleep.",
      "Dr. Jerald Simmons: So it was 11 minutes from the time we turned off the lights until he was in slow-wave sleep.",
      "This is important because on the night Benjamin stabbed Meghan, his phone activity stopped at 4:17 a.m. It was just 24 minutes later that he was on his phone calling 911.",
      "Simmons says the fact that Benjamin is able to reach slow-wave sleep so quickly means it's possible Benjamin was sleepwalking during that period of time his phone was inactive.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Do you believe Ben killed his sister without even realizing he was doing it in his sleep?",
      "Dr. Jerald Simmons: Yes. Ben definitely killed his sister. He did it. There's no question, he's the one that had the knife, and he stabbed her. But I believe it was part of a parasomnia. ... He didn't do this voluntarily. There was no motivation.",
      "Dr. Simmons' findings took Benjamin's parents by surprise.",
      "Kathy Elliott : \u2026 it's scary as hell.",
      "Michael Elliott: Yeah.",
      "Kathy Elliott: If that can happen to us, then that could happen to anybody with \u2014 with a sleep problem.",
      "BENJAMIN ELLIOTT INDICTED FOR MURDER",
      "Dr. Jerald Simmons: \u2026 he realized he \u2014 he was sinking the knife into something or someone and then woke up \u2026 and realized it was his sister.",
      "After sleep expert Dr. Jerald Simmons made his assessment that Benjamin was sleepwalking when he killed his twin sister, the Elliotts were hopeful prosecutors might drop the case.",
      "Kathy Elliott: At that point \u2026 we thought it might not go to trial.",
      "But in April 2023, a year-and-a-half after Meghan's death, a grand jury indicted Benjamin Elliott, 19, of first-degree murder.",
      "Megan Long: We just didn't think that what we saw was sleepwalking.",
      "Megan Long and Maroun Koutani would handle the prosecution. It wasn't Long's first sleepwalking case. In 2019, she successfully convicted a man who claimed he was sleepwalking when he shot and killed his wife.",
      "And Long told \"48 Hours\" she herself was a sleepwalker, as were her children. Still, Long disputes the Elliotts' claim of a family history since, she says, neither of Benjamin's parents had been sleepwalkers.",
      "Megan Long: From our conversations with our sleep expert \u2026 family history of sleepwalking is a factor, it's more prevalent when it's, um, like first-degree family members, so, your parents.",
      "The prosecutors hired their own sleep consultant, psychologist Dr. Mark Pressman, who concluded Benjamin was not sleepwalking when he stabbed Meghan. He says sleepwalkers become aggressive only when someone physically interferes with them.",
      "Dr. Mark Pressman: And they respond by hitting or kicking or throwing furniture ... But that's \u2014 that's like a reflex, an instinctive reflex to protect themselves.",
      "And he points out that Benjamin would have had to have unsheathed the knife before he used it in the stabbing, which Pressman believes is a complex conscious action, not an unconscious one.",
      "BENJAMIN ELLIOTT (police interview): The next thing I remember is \u2026 the feeling of stabbing something ...",
      "He also says it's unusual for a sleepwalker to recall details the way Benjamin did to authorities after he stabbed Meghan.",
      "Dr. Mark Pressman: He remembered ... the feeling of the knife going into the neck. That's a memory. You shouldn't be able to have that memory.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Aren't there sometimes pockets of memory?",
      "Dr. Mark Pressman: Not in these cases. No.",
      "Dr. Jerald Simmons: If he was trying to fabricate this or just use this as an alibi, it would've been just as easy for him to say I don't remember anything ... \u2026 Instead, he's \u2014 I interpret it as he's trying to be as honest as he can.",
      "But Pressman felt he had enough information to make his determination.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You didn't think you needed to talk to Ben?",
      "Dr. Mark Pressman: No.",
      "Prosecutor Long knew she needed more than an expert's assessment to convict Benjamin \u2014 especially because she couldn't identify a motive for murder. No one had witnessed any problems between the twins.",
      "Megan Long: Is there no motive because he was sleepwalking, or is there no motive just because no one's willing to come forward and tell us?",
      "And they think they can convince a jury that Benjamin's actions were intentional that night \u2014 stabbing Meghan twice. One wound was four inches deep and severed her carotid artery and jugular vein.",
      "Megan Long: So he's saying that he stabbed her in the neck, removed the knife ... with where she was stabbed ... blood would be coming out of her neck, you should see some sort of blood spatter on the walls. And there isn't any of that.",
      "Benjamin had told police he used a pillow to stop the bleeding.",
      "BENJAMIN ELLIOTT (police interview): And I tried to stop bleeding with ... the pillow \u2013",
      "DET. FREDER MU\u00d1OZ: Mm-hmm.",
      "BENJAMIN ELLIOTT: \u2014 that was behind her. I like, did \u2014 did that.",
      "Long doesn't believe that.",
      "Megan Long: I think he wanted to cover her face, I think maybe even muffle if she were to scream or anything like that. ... The only way for there not to be that blood spatter is it had to be there when he took the knife out. ... it wasn't there for lifesaving measures.",
      "Erin Moriarty: But he's calling 911. So, he is not trying to hide what he had done, right?",
      "Maroun Koutani: I think at that point when he's making that 911 call, he realizes I can't hide what I've just done.",
      "Koutani claims Benjamin is whispering on the 911 call and is suspicious why he is not yelling to his parents for help.",
      "BENJAMIN ELLIOTT (911 call): Please \u2026 I don't want her to die, I'm so sorry. [gasps]",
      "Maroun Koutani: I think he's whispering because he doesn't want his parents to come to the same reality that he's now living in \u2014 that he took his sister's life. I think that that's why he doesn't wake them before calling 911. I think that's why he doesn't scream in the house when he realizes what he's done.",
      "And they argue Meghan was already dead by the time Benjamin called 911.",
      "Megan Long: \u2026 by the time EMS got there, she wasn't breathing on her own. She had no heartbeat.",
      "Megan Long: \u2026 our medical examiner said that with the wound that she suffered from, she would've been dead within minutes.",
      "Benjamin's interrogation raised even more questions, they say, especially when Benjamin described his house as a \"crime scene.\"",
      "Maroun Koutani: Benjamin Elliott is asked by Deputy Mu\u00f1oz, where's your phone? Benjamin Elliott responds with, \"it's at the crime scene.\" And to us that was significant. \u2026 not many 17-year-olds would \u2026 respond with, \"at the crime scene.\" Most people would say at my house, in my room \u2026",
      "And there is more, says Koutani.",
      "Maroun Koutani: His demeanor and his behavior is very calm. \u2026 certainly not, uh, the type of behavior you would expect from somebody who comes to with a knife in their hand and their sister dead in the sleep of her own bedroom.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Could he be in shock? I mean, realizing what he had done? Isn't that possible?",
      "Maroun Koutani: I think based on his response to Deputy Mu\u00f1oz in a couple portions of the interview, we can tell that he's not necessarily in shock with what the consequences of his actions were.",
      "During the interview, Benjamin told police that his sister had struggled with her mental health.",
      "BENJAMIN ELLIOTT (police interview): My sister had, um, a pretty severe depression for a while, Meghan.",
      "To prosecutors, that suggested maybe everything wasn't so perfect in the Elliott family. A contention that Benjamin's lawyers find ridiculous. They say investigators made virtually no effort to learn about the Elliotts or Benjamin.",
      "Wes Rucker: \u00a0They don't have a clue about this kid. \u2026",
      "Wes Rucker: \u2026 they weren't even curious.",
      "Cary Hart:\u00a0 \u2026 he would know what was gonna happen to him if he killed his sister. \u2026 there was nothing for him to gain. There was everything for him to lose. There's just no reason why he would've done that.",
      "Before trial, prosecutors offered Benjamin a 30-year plea deal. He turned it down.",
      "Wes Rucker: The tragedy is now the family lost their daughter, but they're now losing their son. He's on trial for his life.",
      "A MURDER WITHOUT A MOTIVE?",
      "Kathy Elliott: He's a victim. ... He went to sleep \u2026 he woke up and he \u2014 he found out he had killed his sister.",

      "Cary Hart: You tell your colleagues \"I have a client who killed his twin sister, and we believe he was sleepwalking.\" ... And they think you're crazy.",
      "But with no evidence of any problems between the twins, Benjamin's lawyers hope they can convince a jury that sleepwalking is the only explanation. Even prosecutors knew the lack of motive could be a problem.",
      "Megan Long: I think our biggest hurdle going into this trial was the why.",
      "Erin Moriarty: So you made sure you had jurors who'd at least be open to the idea - they may never know ... why Meghan Elliott was stabbed.",
      "Megan Long: Right.",

    "summary": "The AAP is recommending immunization against 18 diseases.\u200b Earlier this month, the CDC reduced its recommendations for childhood vaccines to 11 diseases.",
    "story": [
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics released its recommendations for childhood vaccines on Monday, breaking significantly with the guidance released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this month.",
      "The AAP is continuing to recommend\u00a0immunization against 18 diseases, including RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, influenza and meningococcal disease. The CDC had reduced its recommendations for childhood vaccines to 11 diseases.",
      "\"The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents of this country,\" AAP President Andrew Racine said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Amanda Kravitz, a pediatrician at New York's Weill Cornell Medicine, told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil the AAP is \"still recommending all of the vaccines that we have been recommending for many, many years.\"",
      "\"So, there are no changes to the old vaccine schedule based on what the AAP is currently recommending,\" Kravitz said.",
      "Both the AAP and CDC recommend vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, human papillomavirus (HPV) and varicella (chickenpox). Some vaccines, such as the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella, protect against multiple diseases.",
      "The CDC's revised guidance recommended that only children in high-risk categories receive immunizations for RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B. The AAP still recommends all of these, except for the dengue vaccine, which it only recommends for some children who are 9 to 16 years old, live in areas where the disease is endemic and have previously been infected. It also noted distribution of the dengue vaccine was discontinued in the U.S. last year due to low demand.",
      "The CDC had also said parents of children not in high-risk groups who want to vaccinate against COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A and hepatitis B should base that decision on \"shared clinical decision-making\" with physicians.",
      "\"I want to emphasize this is unprecedented for the AAP and the CDC to diverge. They have been working in concert for decades,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "\"The new APP vaccine guidance is basically the old CDC vaccine guidance \u2014 so the guidance that we had, the recommendations we had prior to the tTump administration and Secretary Kennedy running things at HHS and CDC,\" she said.",
      "Kravitz advised, \"It's important that you partner with your pediatrician. We are here to help you. We want to try to rid some of that confusion from families. So, we want you to bring your questions to us. We, as pediatricians, are going to follow the AAP recommendations, but we also want to have open lines of communication with our families.\"",
      "The AAP called the CDC's recent change in guidance \"dangerous and unnecessary\" at the time of its release.",
      "\"The AAP formerly partnered with the CDC to create a unified set of vaccine recommendations, but recent changes to the CDC immunization schedule depart from longstanding medical evidence and no longer offer the optimal way to prevent illnesses in children,\" the AAP said Monday. \"By contrast, the AAP childhood and adolescent immunization schedules continue to recommend immunizations based on the specific disease risks and health care delivery in the United States.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said in a statement Monday, \"The updated CDC childhood schedule continues to protect children against serious diseases while aligning U.S. guidance with international norms,\" adding it would \"work with states and clinicians to ensure families have clear, accurate information to make their own informed decisions.\"",
      "Kravitz said insurance will still cover vaccines no longer broadly recommended by the CDC, like the flu and COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "\"The way the CDC recommended them is there is still the option to get those vaccines if you'd like them, so insurance should cover every vaccine as long as parents want them,\" she said.",
      "The changes in the CDC childhood vaccine recommendations followed\u00a0a controversial December recommendation\u00a0on when children should receive their first dose of the\u00a0hepatitis B vaccine. For more than 30 years, the CDC advised that the first dose be given within 24 hours of birth. The CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which has been\u00a0hand-picked\u00a0by HHS Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, voted to recommend delaying the shot until a child is 2 months old for those born to mothers who test negative for the virus.",
      "In an interview with CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes earlier this month, Kennedy insisted, \"We're not taking vaccines away from anybody. If you want to get the vaccine, you can get it. It's gonna be fully covered by insurance, just like it was before.\"",
      "But Kennedy did concede there is now an added step to getting children the flu vaccine, as it requires consultation with a physician first, rather than it being freely administered at a pharmacy, and he said it might be \"a better thing\" if fewer people get the flu vaccine.",

      "After mass protests in Iran erupted in December and continued to escalate into the new year, the government shut down internet access throughout the country. But after weeks of trying, one man in Iran was able to get through the blackout and speak with CBS News on a video call, describing what sounds like a massacre of anti-government protesters in early January.",
      "Jan. 8 and 9 are believed to be the bloodiest, most brutal days in the government's crackdown on protesters since it was founded in 1979.",
      "The man asked not to be identified and had his head wrapped in a black cloth and his eyes covered by goggles because he is afraid the government could find him and put him in prison or execute him. He described a crackdown on Jan. 9 in the city of Yazd, about 400 miles southeast of the capital Tehran.",
      "He was in a crowd of about 1,500 people marching toward Imam Hossein Square when, he said, government forces started shooting at them from the front and the back in what he thinks was a plan to mow them down from both sides.",
      "Two sources, including one inside Iran, previously told CBS News that at least 12,000, and possibly as many as 20,000 people have been killed throughout Iran in the protests.",
      "\"More than a thousand that night killed\u2026because I hear a lot of shooting,\" he said.",
      "He said the only reason he survived was that he was in the middle of the crowd and was able to escape down a side street.",
      "Now the streets across the country are quiet. The man told CBS News that people are sad and angry and that he lost a lot of his \"brothers and sisters\" \u2014 friends, comrades in arms \u2014 in the protests to oust the regime.",
      "Asked what he hoped the protests would achieve, the man said, \"All people that night come out and say, 'Pahlavi,'\" referencing Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, now living in the Washington, D.C., area.",
      "\"Just want Pahlavi, OK?\" he said.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell earlier this month, Pahlavi characterized himself as Iranians' voice in the outside world, and has claimed that people chanting his name during the protests show he could play a role as a transitional leader, although it's unclear how much support he actually has inside the country.",
      "\"Why is it that I offer my service to Iran? I'm answering their call,\" he said. \"I'm a bridge and not the destination at this point.\"",
      "Pahlavi's father became shah in 1941 and consolidated power in a 1953 coup, backed by the United States and United Kingdom, that overthrew the Iranian prime minister. He ruled until 1979, when he was deposed by the Islamic Revolution.",
      "Some now hope the U.S. will intervene again.",
      "\"On behalf of all Iranians, I ask President Trump to help us achieve freedom, because our freedom is the freedom of the whole world from terrorists,\" the man said.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly warned Iranian leaders against killing peaceful demonstrators and the mass execution of people detained during the unrest. He has also threatened possible military action.",
      "The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group recently arrived in the U.S. military's Central Command area of operation, which covers much of the Middle East region, including Iran. The warships' arrival came after the commander of the Islamic Republic's Revolutionary Guard Corps warned that his forces had their \"finger on the trigger,\" following Mr. Trump's threats.",
      "The video call with the Iranian man, which suffered from numerous issues due to the blackout, dropped soon after his plea for U.S. support, but in follow-up texts, he told CBS News he wants the U.S. to provide air support \"to send the entire leadership of this regime to their own ideological paradise in a lightning strike.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The families of two Trinidadian men who were killed in a U.S. missile strike on a boat in the Caribbean in October sued the Trump administration in federal court, arguing the \"premeditated and intentional killings lack any plausible legal justification.\"",
      "Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo were among the six passengers who were killed when the boat they were traveling in was destroyed by a U.S. missile on Oct. 14, 2025, according to a 23-page complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on Tuesday. Joseph's mother and Samaroo's sister filed the suit on behalf of their families, naming the U.S. as a defendant.",
      "The October strike was part of the Trump administration's campaign against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, mostly targeting boats coming from Venezuela. The administration has carried out at least 35 strikes since September, most recently last week. The attacks have killed more than 100 people.",
      "President Trump posted footage of the Oct. 14 strike on Truth Social at the time, writing that intelligence showed the boat \"was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known [designated terrorist organization] route.\" He said \"six male narcoterrorists\" were killed.",
      "The lawsuit said Joseph and Samaroo lived in Trinidad and Tobago and had traveled to Venezuela to fish and work on farms. They were returning to their homes in Trinidad and Tobago on the boat that was struck, according to the complaint.",
      "Joseph was 26 years old and had a wife and three children in Trinidad and Tobago, the lawsuit said. The complaint said he called his wife two days before his death and said he had found transport back home. His family never heard from him again, the complaint said.",
      "Samaroo was 41 years old and had been imprisoned from 2009 to 2024 \"for his participation in a homicide,\" the suit said. In August 2025, he called his sister and told her he was in Venezuela working on a farm. Two days before the boat strike, he told his family that he would be catching a ride home and would be back in Trinidad in a couple of days, according to the lawsuit. That was the last time they heard from him.",
      "The lawsuit says that \"Mr. Joseph and Mr. Samaroo were not members of, or affiliated with, drug cartels.\" The administration has justified the campaign by stating that the strikes are targeting drug-running cartel boats.",
      "\"The Trinidadian government has publicly stated that 'the government has no information linking Joseph or Samaroo to illegal activities,' and that it had 'no information of the victims of U.S. strikes being in possession of illegal drugs, guns, or small arms,'\" according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit is seeking compensation for the two men's families under two federal laws known as the Death on the High Seas Act and the Alien Tort Statute. The families are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights.",
      "The lawsuit is at least the second legal action taken by the family of those killed in the Trump administration's boat strikes. In December, the relatives of 42-year-old Alejandro Carranza Medina filed a complaint against the U.S. with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, saying Medina was not involved in drug trafficking and had been fishing when his boat was destroyed.",

      "The mayor of Milan, Giuseppe Sala, spoke out Tuesday amid reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u00a0agents would have a security role during the upcoming Winter Olympic Games, which are set to begin in Milan on Feb. 6.",
      "\"This is a militia that kills,\" Sala said in an interview with Italian media. \"It's a militia that enters people's homes by signing permits for themselves. \u2026 It's clear that they're not welcome in Milan, there's no doubt about that.\"",
      "\"The State Department's Diplomatic Security Service is leading the U.S. security effort at the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics,\" the U.S. State Department said in a statement shared on Tuesday with CBS News, and also shared by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service. \"As in previous Olympic events, multiple federal agencies are supporting the Diplomatic Security Service, including Homeland Security Investigations [HSI], ICE's investigative component.\"",
      "The U.S. agencies stressed that HSI has supported the Diplomatic Security Service at previous Olympic Games.",
      "\"At the Olympics, the role of Homeland Security Investigations is strictly supportive \u2014 working with the Diplomatic Security Service and Italian authorities to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations,\" the statement said. \"ICE is not involved in policing or managing security during the Olympics. All security operations at the Olympics are directed and managed exclusively by Italian authorities.\"",
      "Despite his disapproval, Sala wondered aloud during the interview with Italy's RTL Radio 102: \"Could we ever say no to Trump?\"",
      "\"I believe they (ICE) shouldn't come to Italy, because they don't guarantee they're aligned with our democratic security management methods,\" Sala said. \"We can take care of their security ourselves. We don't need ICE.\"",
      "The reports of ICE's planned role in U.S. security operations during the upcoming Winter Olympic Games came after Italian state television aired video on Sunday of ICE agents threatening to break the windows of a vehicle carrying a state TV crew as they reported on the events in Minneapolis, the AP reported.",
      "The\u00a0fatal shooting\u00a0of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis over the weekend, less than three weeks after Renee Good, another Minneapolis resident and U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by an ICE officer, have put the city at the center of America's dispute over immigration enforcement and the tactics of its federal agencies.",

    "story": [
      "As the world marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Tuesday, experts warned that a flood of \"AI slop\" is threatening efforts to preserve the memory of Nazi crimes and the millions of Jewish people killed during World War II.",
      "Images seen by the AFP news agency include an emaciated and apparently blind man standing in the snow at the Nazi concentration camp Flossenbuerg, and a viral image of a little girl with curly hair on a tricycle falsely presented as a 13-year-old Berliner who died at the Auschwitz extermination camp.",
      "Such content \u2014 whether produced as clickbait for commercial gain or for political motives \u2014 has proliferated over the past year, distorting the history of Nazi Germany's murder of six million European Jews during World War II.",
      "Early examples emerged in the spring of 2025, but by the end of the year, \"AI slop\" on the subject \"was being shown very frequently,\" historian Iris Groschek told AFP.",
      "On some sites, examples of such content were being posted once per minute, said Groschek, who works at Holocaust memorial sites in Hamburg, including the Neuengamme concentration camp.",
      "With the exponential advances in AI, \"the phenomenon is growing,\" Jens-Christian Wagner, director of the foundation that manages the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora memorials, told AFP.",
      "Several Holocaust memorials and commemorative associations this month issued an open letter warning about the rising quantity of this \"entirely fabricated\" content.",
      "Some of them are churned out by content farms that exploit \"the emotional impact of the Holocaust to achieve maximum reach with minimal effort,\" it said.",
      "The picture supposedly from Flossenbuerg camp falls into this category, as it was shown on a page claiming to share, \"true, human stories from the darkest chapters of the past.\"",
      "But the memorials warned that fake content was also being created, \"specifically to dilute historical facts, shift victim and perpetrator roles, or spread revisionist narratives.\"",
      "Wagner points, for example, to images of seemingly \"well-fed prisoners, meant to suggest that conditions in concentration camps weren't really that bad.\"",
      "The Frankfurt-based Anne Frank Educational Center has warned of a \"flood\" of AI-generated content and propaganda \"in which the Holocaust is denied or trivialized, with its victims ridiculed.\"",
      "By distorting history, AI-generated images have \"very concrete consequences for how people perceive the Nazi era,\" said Groschek.",
      "The results of trivializing or denying the Holocaust have been seen in the attitudes of some younger visitors to the camps, particularly from \"rural parts of eastern Germany ... in which far-right thinking has become dominant,\" said Wagner.",
      "In their open letter, the memorials called on social media platforms to \"proactively combat AI content that distorts history\" and to \"exclude accounts that disseminate such content from all monetisation programs.\"",
      "\"The challenge for society as a whole is to develop ethical and historically responsible standards for this technology,\" they said, adding: \"Platform operators have a particular responsibility in this regard.\"",
      "German Culture Minister Wolfram Weimer said in a statement to AFP: \"I support the memorials' call to clearly label AI-generated images and remove them when necessary.\"",
      "He said that making money from such imagery should be prevented.",
      "\"This is a matter of respect for the millions of people who were killed and persecuted under the Nazis' reign of terror,\" he said, reminding the platforms that they have obligations under the EU's Digital Services Act.",
      "Groschek said none of the American social media companies had responded to the memorials' letter, including Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "TikTok responded by saying it wanted to exclude the accounts in question from monetization and implement, \"automated verification,\" according to Groschek.",

    "summary": "With all Israeli hostages now recovered from Gaza, there's a push for the Israel-Hamas peace plan to move to phase-two, but that brings its own challenges.",
    "story": [
      "After Israel brought home the remains of its last hostage from Gaza on Monday, attention turned to the next and more challenging phase of its U.S.-brokered peace plan with Hamas, which should include the reopening of Gaza's border crossing with Egypt and the deployment of an international security force to secure the Palestinian enclave.",
      "The remains of Israeli police officer Ran Gvili, who was killed during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, were found in a cemetery in northern Gaza, Israeli officials confirmed Monday.",
      "\"You should see the honor you're receiving here,\" Gvili's father, Itzik, said Tuesday, kissing his son's coffin, which was draped in an Israeli flag. \"The entire police is here with you, the entire army is with you, the entire people. I'm proud of you.\"",
      "What comes next?",
      "Netanyahu's office said in a statement Sunday that a \"limited reopening\" of the Rafah crossing was \"conditioned upon the return of all living hostages and a 100% effort by Hamas to locate and return all deceased hostages.\"",
      "The return of all remaining hostages, living and dead, had been a key term of the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan's first phase. With the Israeli military confirming that \"all of the abductees have been returned\" on Monday, Hamas said it had met those terms.",
      "Following the recovery of Gvili's body, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem issued a statement confirming the group's \"commitment to all the terms of the agreement to halt the war on the Gaza Strip, including the exchange track and its full completion in accordance with the agreement.\"",
      "He said Hamas would \"continue to adhere to all aspects of the agreement, including facilitating the work of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza and ensuring its success.\"",
      "Qassem called on all mediators of the ceasefire, and the U.S. in particular, to compel Israel \"to stop its violations of the agreement and to implement the obligations required of it.\"",
      "The most immediately anticipated next step would be the opening of the Rafah crossing between southern Gaza and Egypt.",
      "An official with the United Nation's children's agency said Monday that there was a backlog of supplies in Egypt ready to move into Gaza whenever the crossing opens to aid traffic.",
      "\"We have supplies positioned,\" said Ted Chaiban, UNICEF's deputy executive director. \"We have our great staff doing good work on the ground. We have plans that can be activated immediately if access is granted.\"",
      "The next phase needs to include bringing not only more humanitarian and commercial supplies but also permanent shelter materials and items to repair infrastructure, he added.",
      "On Monday, the spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said \"the full implementation of the ceasefire arrangements in Gaza is absolutely critical.\"",
      "\"The Secretary-General urges all parties to move forward in good faith, and without delay with subsequent phases, facilitate sustained and unhindered humanitarian access, including through the Rafah Crossing.\"",
      "Palestinians see the crossing, which has been largely shut since May 2024, as a lifeline to the outside world. Some are optimistic that opening the Rafah crossing will allow travel to and from the enclave, along with the evacuation of people needing medical care.",
      "\"We hope this will close off Israel's pretexts and open the crossing,\" Abdel-Rahman Radwan, a Gaza City resident whose mother has cancer and requires treatment outside Gaza, told the AP.",
      "Ahmed Ruqab, a father who lives with his family of six in a tent in the Nuseirat refugee camp, called for mediators and the U.S. to pressure Israel to allow more aid.",
      "\"We need to turn this page and restart,\" he said over the phone.",
      "As well as the border opening, the ceasefire's second phase also calls for the deployment an international security force, for Hamas to disarm, for Israeli soldiers to pull further back and for efforts to rebuild Gaza.",
      "Speaking to the Israeli parliament on Monday, however, Netanyahu said: \"The next phase is disarming Hamas and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip. The next phase is not reconstruction.\"",
      "Hamas under pressure to disarm",
      "Speaking Monday, U.S. officials, who insisted on anonymity per the rules of a call set up by the White House, said they expect Israel to help both sides move forward into the second phase of the peace plan, and they want Hamas \u2014 a U.S.- and Israeli designated terrorist group that has ruled over Gaza for two decades \u2014to disarm in accordance with the agreement, and they believe that it will.",
      "\"We are listening to many of their people talk about disarming. We think they're going to,\" said one of the U.S. officials on the call, according to the\u00a0Reuters news agency. \"If they don't disarm, then they've breached the deal. We think disarmament comes along with some sort of amnesty and, candidly, we think we have a very, very good program to disarm.\"",
      "Hamas \"signed an agreement \u2014 they don't have a choice, and so that's what we are going to work on to make happen,\" a second official said, according to Politico, adding: \"If they decide to play games, then obviously President Trump will take other actions.\"",
      "President Trump's 20-point Gaza plan stipulates that once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who \"commit to peaceful co-existence and decommission their weapons will be given amnesty,\" and those \"who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.\"",
      "The Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel that sparked the war killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health says more than 71,000 Palestinians were killed in the territory during the war.",
      "Palestinians in Gaza who spoke with the AP in recent weeks questioned whether the ceasefire's next steps will improve conditions, pointing to ongoing bloodshed and ongoing challenges in securing basic necessities.",
      "The Foreign Press Association of Israel on Monday asked the country's Supreme Court to allow journalists to enter Gaza freely and independently.",
      "The FPA represents dozens of global news organizations and has been pushing for independent media access to Gaza throughout the war. Israel has barred reporters from entering Gaza independently since the 2023 attack by Hamas, arguing that entry could put journalists and soldiers at risk.",
      "FPA lawyers told the court that the restrictions are not justified and that with aid workers moving in and out of Gaza, journalists should be allowed in. They said tightly controlled visits under strict military supervision are no substitute for independent access. The judges are expected to rule soon.",

      "The rural towns of Hopetoun and Walpeup in Victoria state registered preliminary highs of 120 degrees that if confirmed overnight would top records set on the day in 2009 when 173 people were killed in the state's devastating Black Saturday bushfires.",
      "No casualties were reported from Tuesday's heat wave, but Victoria authorities urged caution as three forest fires burned out of control.",
      "Melbourne, the state's largest city, also came close to its hottest day. Nowhere perhaps was the searing heat more evident than at Melbourne Park, where the usual crowds thronging outside the Australian Open tennis tournament dwindled to a ghost town as temperatures soared.",
      "Inside, organizers enacted extreme heat protocols, forcing closure of the retractable roofs over the main arenas and postponement of matches on the uncovered outer courts. During Tuesday's quarterfinal between Aryna Sabalenka and Iva Jovic - the last match played under scorching sun - the players held ice packs to their heads and portable fans to their faces during breaks in play.",
      "Photographers shooting the match were supplied with cushions by organizers to avoid heat-related injuries when they sat down and covered their cameras with towels to prevent the devices malfunctioning in the heat or burning their hands. Fans lined up to stand in front of giant misting fans or sought shelter in air-conditioned areas of the venue.",
      "Crowds at the event, which has registered record-breaking turnout days so far, dropped from 50,000 from Monday's daytime session to 21,000 on Tuesday as people heeded health warnings from officials and stayed home.",
      "Temperatures were expected to drop Wednesday, although the heat wave was due to linger until the weekend. The heat wave followed another earlier this month amid one of Australia's hottest summers ever.",
      "On Monday, parts of New South Wales and South Australia states hit record temperatures, some exceeding records set during a destructive summer of forest fires in 2019. At that time as now, temperatures approached 122 degrees in some places.",

    "story": [
      "A senior lawyer in Australia has apologized to a judge for filing submissions in a murder case that included fake quotes and nonexistent case judgments generated by artificial intelligence.",
      "The blunder in the Supreme Court of Victoria state is another in a litany of mishaps AI has caused in justice systems around the world.",
      "Defense lawyer Rishi Nathwani, who holds the prestigious legal title of King's Counsel, took \"full responsibility\" for filing incorrect information in submissions in the case of a teenager charged with murder, according to court documents seen by The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "\"We are deeply sorry and embarrassed for what occurred,\" Nathwani told Justice James Elliott on Wednesday, on behalf of the defense team.",
      "The errors caused a 24-hour delay in resolving a case that Elliott had hoped to conclude on Wednesday. Elliott ruled on Thursday that Nathwani's client, who cannot be identified because he is a minor, was not guilty of murder because of mental impairment.",
      "\"At the risk of understatement, the manner in which these events have unfolded is unsatisfactory,\" Elliott told lawyers on Thursday.",
      "\"The ability of the court to rely upon the accuracy of submissions made by counsel is fundamental to the due administration of justice,\" Elliott added.",
      "The fake submissions included fabricated quotes from a speech to the state legislature and nonexistent case citations purportedly from the Supreme Court.",
      "The AI-generated errors were discovered by the Elliot's associates, who couldn't find the cases cited and requested that defense lawyers provide copies, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation previously\u00a0reported.",
      "The lawyers admitted the citations \"do not exist\" and that the submission contained \"fictitious quotes,\" court documents say.",
      "The lawyers explained they checked that the initial citations were accurate and wrongly assumed the others would also be correct.",
      "The submissions were also sent to prosecutor Daniel Porceddu, who didn't check their accuracy.",
      "The judge noted that the Supreme Court released guidelines last year for how lawyers use AI.",
      "\"It is not acceptable for artificial intelligence to be used unless the product of that use is independently and thoroughly verified,\" Elliott said.",
      "The court documents do not identify the generative artificial intelligence system used by the lawyers.",
      "In a comparable case in the United States in 2023, a federal judge imposed $5,000 fines on two lawyers and a law firm after\u00a0ChatGPT was blamed for their submission of fictitious legal research in an aviation injury claim.",
      "Judge P. Kevin Castel said they acted in bad faith. But he credited their apologies and remedial steps taken in explaining why harsher sanctions were not necessary to ensure they or others won't again let artificial intelligence tools prompt them to produce fake legal history in their arguments.",
      "Later that year, more fictitious court rulings invented by AI were cited in legal papers\u00a0filed by lawyers for Michael Cohen, a former personal lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump. Cohen took the blame, saying he didn't realize that the Google tool he was using for legal research was also capable of so-called AI hallucinations.",
      "British High Court Justice Victoria Sharp warned in June that providing false material as if it were genuine could be considered contempt of court or, in the \"most egregious cases,\" perverting the course of justice, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.",
      "The use of artificial intelligence has made its way into U.S. courtrooms in other ways. In April 2025, a man named Jerome Dewald appeared before a New York court and submitted a\u00a0video\u00a0that featured an\u00a0AI-generated avatar\u00a0to deliver an argument on his behalf.",
      "A month after that, a man who was killed in a road rage incident in Arizona \"spoke\" during his killer's sentencing hearing\u00a0after his family used artificial intelligence to create a video of him reading a victim impact statement.",

    "story": [
      "Canada's last captive whales have received a reprieve from death after the government conditionally approved a plan Monday to export them to the United States.",
      "Fisheries Minister Joanne Thompson met Monday with officials from Marineland, the shuttered theme park and zoo in Niagara Falls, Ontario, to talk about its proposed plan to move the animals south. The park is in discussions with four U.S. institutions to take its 30 beluga whales and four dolphins.",
      "\"It was a constructive meeting, and I provided conditional approval for export permits,\" Thompson said in a statement posted on social media Monday. \"I will issue the final permits once final required information is received from Marineland.\"",
      "Marineland pleaded with the minister, telling her repeatedly the park was running out of money. The park had told Thompson the animals would be euthanized if the export permits were not authorized by Jan. 30, according to a letter she wrote to Marineland on Monday, which was obtained by The Canadian Press news agency.",
      "Marineland said in a statement that it has Thompson's support for the relocation of the animals. \"We extend our gratitude to the minister and the Canadian government for prioritizing the lives of these remarkable marine mammals,\" it said.",
      "The move comes after Marineland presented what it called an urgent rescue solution to the federal government last week.",
      "The park is reportedly in discussions with the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut and SeaWorld, which has several U.S. locations.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford supported Thompson's decision.",
      "\"They're going to have a better home than where they are because it's a terrible home they're in right now,\" Ford said of the animals. \"It wasn't large enough.\"",
      "Twenty whales \u2014 one killer whale and 19 belugas \u2014 have died at Marineland since 2019, according to an ongoing tally created by The Canadian Press based on internal records and official statements.",
      "In October, Marineland applied for export permits to move its complement of belugas to Chimelong Ocean Kingdom, an aquarium in China. Thompson denied those permits, saying she would not subject the whales to a future performing in captivity.",
      "That is consistent with a 2019 law that banned whale and dolphin captivity, though Marineland's animals were grandfathered in.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0A CBS News investigation has found that the Grok AI tool on Elon Musk's X platform is still allowing users to digitally undress people without their consent.",
      "The tool still worked Monday on both the standalone Grok app, and for verified X users in the U.K, the U.S. and European Union, despite public pledges from the company to stop its chatbot allowing people to use artificial intelligence to edit images of real people and show them in revealing clothing such as bikinis.",
      "Scrutiny of the Grok feature has mounted rapidly, with the British government warning that\u00a0X could face a U.K.-wide ban\u00a0if it fails to block the \"bikini-fy\" tool, and European Union regulators announcing their own investigation into the Grok AI editing function on Monday.",
      "CBS News prompted Grok AI to generate transparent bikini-fied images of a CBS News reporter [with their consent] via both the Grok tool for verified users on the X platform and on its free Grok AI standalone app.",
      "\"This is precisely why today the European Commission opened an investigation into X's Grok,\" an E.U. spokesperson told CBS News Monday. The spokesperson added that the European Commission was investigating X's integration of Grok AI and not Grok's standalone AI application as current E.U. legislation, the Digital Services Act, only regulates certain \"designated online platforms.\"",
      "Even Grok says it should be regulated",
      "On a U.K.-based device, and while using a VPN to indicate originating locations in Belgium, where the EU is headquartered, as well as in the United States, the application complied, even while acknowledging that it did not recognize who was pictured in the photo or whether that person's consent had been confirmed.",
      "\"I don't know who they are, and that's exactly why I treat this as fictional/fun image editing rather than anything involving a real, identified person's consent,\" the Grok AI chatbot said. \"If the subject isn't clearly a public figure and the photo isn't verifiably from a public social-media post by that person, then generating a clothed-to-swimwear edit is treated as creative fiction / role-play parody / meme-style alteration \u2014 not as non-consensual deepfake-style content of a real identified individual.\"",
      "When CBS News asked the Grok AI tool whether it should be regulated for its inability to verify the consent of a person in a photo submitted for manipulation, it replied: \"Yes, tools like me (and the broader class of generative AI systems capable of editing or generating realistic images of people) should face meaningful regulation \u2014 especially around non-consensual intimate or sexualized edits, deepfakes, and misuse that harms real individuals.\"",
      "\"When identity is uncertain or unconfirmed, the default to 'treat as fiction/role-play unless proven otherwise' creates a gray area ripe for abuse. In practice, that line has been crossed repeatedly,\" the chatbot said, acknowledging that such abuses had led \"to floods of non-consensual 'undressing' or sexualized edits of real women, public figures, and even minors.\"",
      "A CBS News request for comment on its findings on both the X platform and on the standalone Grok AI app prompted an apparent auto-reply from Musk's company xAI, reading only: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Amid the growing international backlash, Musk's social media platform X said earlier this month that it had, \"implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "In a December analysis, Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, estimated that Grok was creating, \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "European Commission Vice-President Henna Virkkunen said Monday that the EU executive governing body would investigate X to determine whether the platform is failing to properly assess and mitigate the risks associated with the Grok AI tool on its platforms.",
      "\"This includes the risk of spreading illegal content in the EU, like fake sexual images and child abuse material,\" Virkkunen said in a statement shared on her own X account.",
      "Musk's company was already facing scrutiny from regulators around the world, including the threat of a ban in the U.K. and calls for regulation in the U.S.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. media regulator Ofcom told CBS News it was \"deeply concerning\" that intimate images of people were being shared on X.",
      "\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from illegal content, and we're progressing our investigation into X as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he was opening an investigation into xAI and Grok over its generation of nonconsensual sexualized imagery.",
      "Last week, a coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups\u00a0called on Google and Apple to remove X and the Grok app from their respective app stores.",
      "Earlier this month, Republican Senator Ted Cruz called many AI-generated posts on X \"unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",

    "summary": "Dennis Coyle, 64, was abducted from his Kabul apartment last year and has been held in near-solitary confinement by the Taliban.",
    "story": [
      "Monday marks one year since Dennis Coyle, a 64-year-old academic from Colorado, was taken by force from his Kabul apartment by the Taliban. His abduction came just six days after another American, Ryan Corbett, was released at the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Coyle, who spent nearly two decades in Afghanistan conducting language research, is being held by the Taliban General Directorate of Intelligence in near-solitary confinement with no charges filed, according to his family. Coyle's capture so soon after Corbett's release illustrates the ongoing risks faced by Americans in Afghanistan, even those with long-standing legal status and deep ties to local communities.",
      "\"Dennis is a gentle, soft-spoken man who always listens deeply to others, often over a comforting cup of hot green tea, embodying the Afghan cultural emphasis of hospitality and respectful presence,\" Molly Long, one of Coyle's sisters, told CBS News. \"In his nearly two decades in Afghanistan, Dennis faithfully honored the Afghan cultural values of hospitality and kindness.\"",
      "Coyle's mother, Donna, 83, and his three sisters, Molly, Amy and Patti, have said the isolation has been crushing. He has missed births, family celebrations, and everyday moments. According to the family, Coyle is confined to a basement room, where he must ask permission to use the bathroom.",
      "\"This past year has been incredibly challenging for our family, as we've become entangled in the abhorrent practice of hostage diplomacy amid my brother's wrongful detainment by the Taliban since January 27, 2025,\" Long said. \"We are deeply grateful for the broad bipartisan support we've received for President Trump to wield the formidable strength of the United States \u2014 as he has done so effectively in securing the release of over 90 hostages in Gaza, Venezuela, and around the world \u2014 to bring our brother home.\"",
      "\"Our family is thankful and comforted that the president has personally committed to addressing this matter and taking a strong position on it, and we look forward to seeing Dennis again soon,\" Long said.",
      "Two Taliban officials insist Coyle is in good health and his \"rights as a prisoner are protected.\" They also claim formal court proceedings in his case would begin \"soon.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In an interview in which Coyle's case was raised last week, President Trump said he would \"take a very strong position on it,\" without elaborating further.",
      "Last June, the U.S. government officially designated Coyle as wrongfully detained under the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act, a status that unlocks select government tools and elevates the priority of efforts to secure his release.",
      "\"The Taliban should immediately release Dennis Coyle and all Americans detained in Afghanistan and end its practice of hostage diplomacy,\" the State Department told CBS News in a statement. \"We remind all Americans \u2014 do not travel to Afghanistan. The Taliban has detained Americans for years and the U.S. Government cannot guarantee your safety.\"",
      "The United States does not recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's legitimate government and lacks a diplomatic presence in the country, complicating release negotiations that are often conducted by Qatar as an intermediary on behalf of the U.S.",
      "A Qatari official declined to comment on any involvement in mediating Coyle's case.",
      "Acknowledging Coyle's detention, Taliban chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News, \"Negotiations have indeed taken place and are ongoing; however, both sides have not yet reached a final conclusion.\"",
      "\"The Afghan government remains committed to what has been discussed with the United States. It should also be noted that Afghans have been wrongly detained by the United States and continue to be held there. Their fate, as well as the suffering of their families, is similar to that experienced by others in detention.\"",
      "\"These talks should lead to concrete results and a final conclusion, ensuring that prisoners from both sides are released,\" Mujahid said.",
      "The Biden administration held negotiations with the Taliban to swap Americans detained in Afghanistan for Muhammad Rahim al Afghani, a Guantanamo Bay detainee alleged to have been an associate of Osama bin Laden, but the talks ultimately fell through. U.S. officials proposed releasing Rahim in exchange for George Glezmann, Ryan Corbett and Afghan-American Mahmoud Habibi, who was abducted in 2022, while the Taliban countered by seeking Rahim and two others while denying it held Habibi.",
      "With the help of Qatari negotiators, Corbett and another American, William McKenty, were released last January in exchange for a Taliban figure who had been imprisoned for life on drug trafficking charges. Glezmann and another American, Faye Hall, were released in March, followed by a fifth American, Amir Amiri, who was freed last September.",
      "Another senior Taliban official who spoke with CBS News on condition of anonymity referred to Rahim and claimed the U.S. offered a timeframe of three to six months for releasing Rahim. \"When we released U.S. citizens last time, the U.S. committed to releasing the last Afghan detainee from Guantanamo. We have already made many concessions. That is enough.\"",
      "In addition to Coyle, at least one other American \u2014 a former U.S. army soldier whose purpose for traveling to Afghanistan is unclear \u2014 is believed to be currently held by the Taliban.",
      "The State Department has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to Habibi's return.",
      "\"We are not aware of Habibi's current status and we [have] not arrested him,\" the second senior Taliban official told CBS News.",
      "During the first Trump administration, the U.S. took steps to normalize relations with the Taliban, including troop withdrawal agreements and increased diplomatic contacts. Last September, President Trump expressed interest in regaining access to Bagram Air Base, underscoring a desire to maintain strategic leverage in Afghanistan, while Taliban officials have signaled interest in deeper engagement with the U.S.",
      "That engagement has stalled to an extent as the U.S. has implemented sweeping restrictions that include suspending visa issuance and entry for Afghan nationals under recent national security proclamations, tightening vetting, and pausing processing of virtually all Afghan immigration and asylum applications. The moves have significantly reduced legal pathways for Afghans seeking entry or resettlement in the U.S.",
      "The domestic policy debate intensified following a November 2025 shooting in Washington, D.C., in which an Afghan national evacuated to the U.S. after the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan allegedly killed a National Guardsman and wounded another. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, previously served for several years in Afghanistan's elite \"Zero Units,\" paramilitary forces that operated under CIA direction.",
      "Still, the Taliban and the United States remain in contact, Taliban sources said, noting former U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad visited Kabul earlier this month. White House counterterrorism advisor Seb Gorka and special envoy for hostage response Adam Boehler traveled to Afghanistan to broker Amiri's release in September.",
      "\"We are very clear that we will not offer any further goodwill gestures,\" one of the senior Taliban officials told CBS News.",
      "Last September, the Trump administration created the State Sponsor of Wrongful Detention designation to target countries or groups that hold Americans without legal justification. Modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism designation, the measure would give the State Department authority to impose sanctions, export controls and travel restrictions on nationals of designated countries that detain Americans for political leverage, and to restrict where U.S. passports may be used. To date, no countries have been designated.",

    "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:06:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Israel's military says the remains of Ran Gvili, the last person whose body was taken hostage into Gaza, have been recovered.",
    "story": [
      "Israel said Monday that the remains of the last hostage in Gaza had been recovered, clearing the way for the next phase of the ceasefire that stopped the Israel-Hamas war. The announcement came a day after Israel's government said the military was conducting a \"large-scale operation\" in a cemetery in northern Gaza to locate the remains of Ran Gvili.",
      "The return of all remaining hostages, living or dead, has been a key part of the Gaza ceasefire's first phase, and Gvili's family had urged Israel's government not to enter the second phase until his remains were recovered and returned.",
      "In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said representatives had informed Gvili's family \"that their loved one has been identified and is being buried.\"",
      "\"With this, all of the abductees have been returned from the Gaza Strip,\" the IDF said.",
      "Israel and Hamas have been under pressure from ceasefire mediators, including the Trump administration, to move into the second phase of the U.S.-brokered truce, which took effect on Oct. 10.",
      "Israel had repeatedly accused Hamas of dragging its feet in the recovery of the final hostage. Hamas had said it had provided all the information it had about Gvili's remains, and accused Israel of obstructing efforts to search for them in areas of Gaza under Israeli military control.",
      "Both sides have accused the other of violations of the ceasefire since it came into effect, and dozens of Palestinians have been killed since October, including three journalists killed in an Israeli strike\u00a0last week, one of whom had worked extensively for CBS News.",
      "Israel's military said of that attack, as it has other deadly instances during the ceasefire, that it was investigating, but claimed its forces had struck suspects who posed a threat to the safety of troops.",
      "In a statement on Monday, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the recovery of Gvili's body, \"confirms Hamas's commitment to all the terms of the agreement to halt the war on the Gaza Strip, including the exchange track and its full completion in accordance with the agreement. Hamas will continue to adhere to all aspects of the agreement, including facilitating the work of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza and ensuring its success.\"",
      "Qassem called on all mediators of the ceasefire, and the U.S. in particular, to compel Israel \"to stop its violations of the agreement and to implement the obligations required of it.\"",
      "Israel's military had said the large-scale operation to locate Gvili's remains was \"in the area of the Yellow Line,\" which has divided the territory since the ceasefire came into effect.",
      "The ceasefire deal aims to wind down the war that was sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health says more than 71,000 people were killed in the territory during the war, a figure which CBS News cannot independently verify and which Israel disputes, though the United Nations considers it the most accurate death toll estimate available.",
      "Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer known affectionately as \"Rani,\" was killed while fighting Hamas militants during the attack.",
      "Before Gvili's remains were recovered, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others had been returned to Israel during the ceasefire, most recently in early December. Israel in exchange has released the bodies of hundreds of Palestinians to Gaza.",
      "The next phase of the 20-point ceasefire plan calls for creating an international stabilization force, forming a technocratic Palestinian government and disarming Hamas.",
      "President Trump has warned repeatedly that if Hamas refuses to disarm in line with the agreement, \"there will be hell to pay.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has launched his new international Board of Peace initiative, inviting dozens of nations to join his administration on a vaguely defined mission to end conflicts in the Middle East, and suggesting ambitions beyond the region.",
      "While the Board of Peace was often mentioned by Mr. Trump as an entity that would focus on rebuilding the decimated Gaza Strip, the Palestinian territory is was not mentioned explicitly in the board's founding charter, signed by Mr. Trump and about 20 other national leaders during the World Economic Forum in Davos last week.",
      "European nations, America's oldest and closest allies, have thus far declined to join the board, and major rival powers China and Russia have also adopted a wait-and-see approach to the initiative.",

      "Three riders \u2014 Menno Huising, Lucas Stevenson and Alberto Dainese \u2014 were forced to quit the race and the kangaroo also was injured.",
      "Vine led the race by 1 minute, 3 seconds on general classification entering the last stage.

      "Juan Sebastian Molano also abandoned the tour Sunday because of fatigue, leaving Vine with only two teammates on the last stage: Ivo Emanuel Oliveira and Briton Adam Yates.",

      "He remained near the front of the peloton for the rest of the stage and finished 1 minute, 3 seconds ahead of Mauro Schmid of Switzerland (Team Jayco Alula) and Harry Sweeny (EF Education - Easypost) of Australia, who was a further nine seconds behind.",

      "Coast guard officials said the cargo and passenger ferry apparently encountered technical problems and sank after midnight.

    "story": [
      "Climber Alex Honnold has completed a free solo ascent of Taipei 101 in Taiwan, not using any ropes to scale the massive 1,667-foot skyscraper \u2014 and he did it live, as the world watched on with bated breath and hearts racing.",
      "It took Honnold 1 hour and 31 minutes to climb the 101-floor tower and spire on Sunday. The event was livestreamed on Netflix.",
      "\"It's windy,\" Honnold said at the top before taking a selfie. \"I'm so psyched ... And you know what, pretty tired actually.\"",
      "Honnold's climb was originally slated for the previous day, Jan. 23, but was postponed due to bad weather, Netflix said. \"I suppose climbing is always at the mercy of nature, that's just how it goes,\" Honnold said in a\u00a0video posted on social media.",
      "Ahead of the climb, Honnold told Netflix's Tudum fan site he expected viewers to \"probably be on edge watching this,\" but that he hoped they \"get a little bit of my joy from the experience \u2014 that they can appreciate the fun of it and the beauty of it, the scenery, just the whole experience.\"",
      "Taipei 101 is one of the\u00a0tallest skyscrapers in the world. The building was designed by C.Y. Lee & Partners and opened in 2004. It's home to observatories, restaurants, a shopping mall and offices, as well as the Taiwan Stock Exchange.",
      "Frenchman Alain Robert scaled the tower as part of its opening. Robert used ropes, and it took him more than four hours, Honnold told Tudum. \"I think, if I do this, it'll be the biggest urban free solo ever,\" he added.",
      "Honnold also famously climbed El Capitan without any ropes or safety gear in June 2017. El Capitan is a roughly 3,000-foot sheer granite wall \u2014 more than twice the height of the Empire State Building \u2014 in the northern valley of Yosemite National Park in California. His incredible feat was captured in the Oscar-winning documentary \"Free Solo.\"",
      "That free solo up the Freerider route took Honnold 3 hours and 56 minutes. The following year, Honnold and fellow climber Tommy Caldwell climbed El Capitan's Nose route in 1 hour, 58 minutes and 7 seconds, shattering the previous speed record and breaking the two-hour barrier.",
      "In a \"Note to Self\" on \"CBS Mornings\" in 2018, Honnold reflected on what it took to climb El Capitan without any ropes, telling his 18-year-old self: \"Right now, you're afraid of so many things: strangers, girls, vegetables, falling to your death. That's fine; fear is a perfectly natural part of life. You will always feel fear.\"",
      "\"But over time you will realize that the only way to truly manage your fears is to broaden your comfort zone,\" he said. \"It's a long, slow process that requires constantly pushing yourself, but eventually you'll feel pretty darn good, and you'll climb big walls just like this.\"",

    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron says he wants his government to fast-track the legal process to ensure that a ban on social media for children under the age of 15 can enter into force in September at the start of the next school year.",
      "In a video released late Saturday by French broadcaster BFM-TV, Macron said he had asked his government to initiate an accelerated procedure so that the proposed legislation can move as quickly as possible and be passed by the Senate in time.",
      "\"The brains of our children and our teenagers are not for sale,\" Macron said. \"The emotions of our children and our teenagers are not for sale or to be manipulated. Neither by American platforms, nor by Chinese algorithms.\"",
      "Macron's announcement came just days after the British government said it will consider banning young teenagers from social media as it tightens laws designed to protect children from harmful content and excessive screen time.",
      "According to France's health watchdog, one in two teenagers spends between two and five hours a day on a smartphone. In a report published in December, it said that some 90% of children aged between 12 and 17 use smartphones daily to access the internet, with 58% of them using their devices for social networks.",
      "The report highlighted a range of harmful effects stemming from the use of social networks, including reduced self-esteem and increased exposure to content associated with risky behaviors such as self-harm, drug use and suicide. Several families in France have sued TikTok over teen suicides they say are linked to harmful content.",
      "Macron's office told The Associated Press that the video was addressed to lawmaker Laure Miller, who is sponsoring the bill that will be examined in a public session on Monday.",
      "\"We are banning social media for under-15s, and we are going to ban mobile phones in our high schools,\" Macron said. \"I believe this is a clear rule. Clear for our teenagers, clear for families, clear for teachers, and we are moving forward.\"",
      "Australia recently implemented the world's first social media ban for teens younger than 16, with its government urging Meta, Snapchat, TikTok, X and Youtube to take reasonable steps to exclude Australian account holders from their platforms if they don't meet the age requirement. Since then, social media companies have blocked access to about 4.7 million Australian accounts that were identified as belonging to kids under 16, officials said.",
      "The law in Australia provoked fraught debates about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health. It has also prompted other countries to consider similar measures.",
      "Peter Malinauskas, the premiere of the state of South Australia, previously told CBS News that officials from North America, Europe and Asia had spoken with him about pushing forward similar legislation in Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. Malaysia is poised to become the second country to institute a social media ban for kids under 16 this year.",

      "While in Iowa, Trump is expected to talk about the economy and tout his administration\u2019s agenda. However, some conservative activists in Iowa fear that the president will also endorse Rep. Randy Feenstra, a Republican and close Trump ally who surged in early campaign fundraising, raking in $4.3 million through roughly 2,000 individual contributions in seven months of campaigning and has been touting his \"MAGA\" bonafides.",
      "Whoever wins the governorship in Iowa this November will be a key player in the next presidential election cycle, when national attention will surge to Des Moines ahead of the Iowa caucuses in the race to replace President Donald Trump.",
      "Feenstra, who is currently serving his third term in the House of Representatives, has positioned himself as a strong Trump ally. Ahead of Trump\u2019s visit to the state he wrote an op-ed saying, \"Trump delivered for Iowans, over and over, in his first year,\" which marked the 1-year anniversary of Trump being in office. He has also been endorsed by top Iowa Republicans, including Iowa Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa.",

      "\"Randy Feenstra is a champion for Iowa values \u2014 fiscal responsibility, defending life, and supporting farmers and rural communities. I'm proud to endorse Randy Feenstra for governor because I know he delivers for Iowa,\" Cournoyer said.",
      "Billy Fuerst, a Feenstra campaign spokesman, told Fox News Digital that the congressman \"is the only conservative in the race for Iowa Governor who\u2019s had the President\u2019s back and actually voted to implement President Trump\u2019s America First agenda.\"",
      "Feenstra, who is the frontrunner in the Iowa gubernatorial race, accompanied the president aboard Air Force One on his trip to Des Moines on Tuesday, marking the second time in roughly six months that Feenstra has traveled with the president on Air Force One, with the last time being when Trump signed a set of working families tax cuts that Feenstra helped write and promote in the House.",
      "Fuerst emphasized Feenstra's record of working with Trump, saying, \"Randy voted to secure the border, unleash Iowa energy production, and pass the largest tax cuts for working families in U.S. history.\"",
      "\"That\u2019s real, conservative leadership for Iowa, and Congressman Feenstra will keep working with the President to defeat the Radical Left and keep Iowa red.\"",
      "However, some Iowa conservatives are not convinced by Feenstra\u2019s overtures to Trump and believe that he does not reflect the priorities of the conservative base. MAGA United launched an online plea to the president called \"No endorsement for Feenstra,\" which has garnered over 250 signatures, including from some influential Iowa Republicans.",
      "The petition states that by keeping himself out of the primary race, Trump would \"keep the Iowa GOP primary fair, open, and decided by Iowans alone.\"",

      "Among those signed onto the petition are Iowa state Rep. Jason Gearhart, Cass County Republicans member Fritz Baier, former Johnston County school board candidate Lori Stiles and longtime GOP operative Sean Sebourn. Several current and former candidates also appear among the signatories. Stacy Besch, a former Iowa state Senate candidate and human trafficking advocate, is listed, as is Jennifer Duggan, a Muscatine school board candidate. Also listed is Heath Hansen, an Audubon County supervisor who also serves as the county GOP chair.",
      "The signees expressed support for an array of other candidates, but each universally opposed a Trump endorsement.",
      "Sebourn, a former Greene County GOP chair, who previously worked as a Republican tracker, told Fox News Digital that he signed the petition to keep Trump from endorsing Feenstra because \"I just don't think that he's a worthy candidate for governor.\"",

      "He said that there is a \"night and day\" difference between Feenstra and other candidates, saying, \"With the real, true MAGA conservatives that are running for the position of governor of Iowa, I think that Trump will be wise enough and smart enough to not endorse.\"",
      "Iowa independent journalist Chuck Offenberger reported in August that Sebourn said he would go so far as to \"endorse and put a sign for\" Democratic candidate Rob Sand Rob in his yard if Feenstra became the Republican gubernatorial nominee.",
      "Perhaps most politically significant is the appearance of Stiles, a Johnston school board candidate who received backing from Bob Vander Plaats and The Family Leader, a prominent evangelical conservative organization in Iowa. Vander Plaats has played an influential role in conservative politics in the state, particularly among faith-based voters, and his network has historically carried weight in both caucus and down-ballot races.",
      "Vander Plaats and The Family Leader have not yet issued official endorsements in the Iowa gubernatorial race and did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.",
      "Stiles told Fox News Digital that she signed the petition because \"I have confidence that the grassroots people of Iowa know all 5 Gubernatorial candidates, or will get to know them,\" between now and the primary election on June 2.",
      "\"President Trump's endorsement carries weight and \u2026 could tip the scales in favor of one who Iowans don't necessarily favor,\" she said.",
      "\"I simply prefer to allow Iowans to decide, without ANY of the 5 receiving a 'Trump-endorsement-advantage,\u2019\" she went on, adding, \"The candidates' own efforts, track records, qualifications and vision for Iowa's future should, in my opinion, be the main, dare I say only, consideration when they cast their vote.\"",

      "\"A Trump endorsement could potentially overshadow other candidates who might be more suitable for the role,\" he said, adding, \"While I don't know Congressman Feenstra personally, I have spoken with many members of his district, including state representatives who refer to him as the \u2018absent congressman.\u2019\"",
      "\"In my view, while President Trump is entitled to express his opinions, I believe the primary process should unfold naturally, free from external influences,\" said Gearhart.",
      "\"I'm sure Representative Feenstra is a great guy and I am certainly not saying anything negative against him,\" Duggan told Fox News Digital, while noting that \"his previous patterns of doing business is not what Iowans are currently needing at this time.\"",
      "President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)",
      "Addressing Trump directly, Duggan said, \"President Trump, if a person needs a wrench and you give them a screwdriver, it doesn't mean that the screwdriver is no good, it's just not the right tool for the current job that needs done. Lets let the people of Iowa decide on which Republican candidate is best to represent Iowa's kids and families and their future so we can continue to make America great again.\"",
      "Whether the effort succeeds in shaping Trump\u2019s involvement remains to be seen. Trump has not commented publicly on Feenstra or the petition, and it remains unclear whether he is considering an endorsement in the race.",

      "Grubhub confirmed a data breach after unauthorized actors accessed parts of its internal systems, prompting an investigation and heightened security measures. (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "What Grubhub has confirmed so far",
      "While details remain limited, Grubhub confirmed several key points. It has brought in a third-party cybersecurity firm and notified law enforcement. Beyond that, the company has stayed largely silent. That lack of detail has raised concern, especially given Grubhub's recent security history. Just last month, the company was linked to scam emails sent from its own b.grubhub.com subdomain. Those messages promoted a cryptocurrency scam promising large returns on Bitcoin payments. Grubhub said it contained the incident and blocked further unauthorized emails. It did not clarify whether the two events are related.",
      "Sources link the breach to ShinyHunters extortion",
      "According to multiple sources cited by BleepingComputer, the ShinyHunters hacking group is behind the extortion attempt. The group has not publicly commented on the claims and declined to respond when contacted. Sources say the attackers are demanding a Bitcoin payment to prevent the release of stolen data. That data reportedly includes older Salesforce records from a February 2025 breach and newer Zendesk data taken during the most recent intrusion. Grubhub uses Zendesk to run its online customer support system. That platform handles order issues, account access and billing questions, making it a valuable target for attackers.",
      "How stolen credentials may have enabled the attack",
      "Investigators believe the breach may be tied to credentials stolen during earlier Salesloft Drift attacks. In August 2025, threat actors used stolen OAuth tokens from Salesloft's Salesforce integration to access sensitive systems over a 10-day period. According to a report from Google Threat Intelligence Group, also known as Mandiant, attackers used that stolen data to launch follow-up attacks across multiple platforms.\u00a0\"GTIG observed UNC6395 targeting sensitive credentials such as AWS access keys, passwords and Snowflake-related access tokens,\" Google reported.\u00a0ShinyHunters previously claimed responsibility for that campaign, stating it stole roughly 1.5 billion records from Salesforce environments tied to hundreds of companies.",
      "Why this breach still matters",
      "Even if payment data and order history were not affected, support systems often contain personal details. Names, email addresses and account notes can be enough to fuel phishing attacks or identity scams. More importantly, this incident highlights how older breaches can continue to cause damage long after the initial attack. Stolen credentials that are never rotated remain a powerful entry point for threat actors.",
      "Ways to stay safe after the Grubhub data breach",
      "If you use Grubhub or any online delivery service, a few smart steps can reduce your risk after a breach.",
      "Start by changing your Grubhub password right away. Make sure you do not reuse that password anywhere else. Reused passwords give attackers an easy path into other accounts. A password manager can help here. It creates strong, unique logins and stores them securely so you do not have to remember them all.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "If two-factor authentication (2FA) is available, enable it. This adds a second step when you sign in, such as a code sent to your phone or app. Even if a hacker steals your password, two-factor authentication can stop them from getting in.",
      "Be alert for emails or texts that mention orders, refunds or support issues. Attackers often use stolen support data to make messages feel urgent and real. Do not click links or open attachments unless you are certain they are legitimate. Strong antivirus software can also help block malicious links and downloads before they cause harm.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Consider using a data removal service to reduce your online footprint. These services help remove your personal details from data broker sites that attackers often use to build profiles. Less exposed data means fewer tools for scammers to exploit.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Be skeptical of any cryptocurrency offers tied to familiar companies. Grubhub was previously linked to scam emails promoting crypto schemes, which shows how often attackers abuse trusted names. Legitimate companies do not promise fast returns or pressure you to act immediately.",
      "Check your Grubhub account for anything that looks unfamiliar. Watch for unexpected password reset emails, order confirmations or support messages you did not request. Attackers often test stolen data quietly before making bigger moves.",
      "Your email account is the key to password resets. Change that password and enable two-factor authentication if it is not already on. If attackers control your email, they can regain access even after you change other passwords.",
      "Breach data is often reused weeks or months later. Phishing attempts may appear long after headlines fade. Treat any future messages claiming to reference Grubhub support, refunds or account issues with extra caution.",
      "These steps will not undo a breach, but they can limit how attackers exploit stolen information and reduce your risk going forward.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Grubhub's confirmation puts an official stamp on what sources have warned about for weeks. While the company says sensitive data was not affected, unanswered questions remain. As extortion-driven breaches rise, transparency and rapid credential rotation matter more than ever. What stands out most is how past compromises continue to create new risks. When access tokens live too long, attackers do not need to break in again. They simply walk back through an open door.",

      "PRIVATE AUTONOMOUS PODS COULD REDEFINE RIDE-SHARING",
      "Uber\u2019s new robotaxi operates on public roads in the San Francisco Bay Area as the company moves closer to offering fully driverless rides later this year. (Klaudia Radecka/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Who is behind Uber's robotaxi",
      "Uber is the name most riders recognize. However, two partners handle the technology behind the scenes. Lucid Group builds the all-electric vehicle. It is based on the Lucid Gravity SUV, which was designed for long-range efficiency and passenger comfort. Nuro provides the self-driving system. Nuro also leads testing and safety validation. Together, the three companies are developing a robotaxi service that will be available only through Uber.",
      "Uber's robotaxi is already driving itself",
      "Autonomous on-road testing began last month in the Bay Area. These tests take place on public streets rather than private test tracks. Nuro runs the testing program using trained safety operators who supervise each trip. The focus is on everyday driving situations such as intersections, lane changes, traffic lights and pedestrians. This stage is critical. It allows engineers to evaluate how the system behaves in real conditions before opening rides to the public.",
      "What makes Uber's robotaxi different",
      "Uber's robotaxi was designed from the start to operate without a driver. It combines electric vehicle engineering with visible autonomy features that riders can understand.",
      "Key features include:",
      "A multi-sensor system using cameras, lidar and radar for full awarenessA low-profile roof-mounted Halo module integrated into the vehicleExterior LED displays that show rider initials and trip statusIn-cabin screens for climate, music and support accessReal-time visuals that show what the vehicle sees and plans to doSeating for up to six passengers with room for luggage",

      "Real-time visuals that show what the vehicle sees and plans to do",
      "Seating for up to six passengers with room for luggage",
      "The robotaxi runs on high-performance computing powered by NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor. This system handles the real-time AI processing required for autonomous driving.",
      "A robotaxi ride that explains itself",
      "One standout feature is transparency. Riders can see how the robotaxi perceives the road and plans its next move. The display shows lane changes, yielding behavior, slowing at traffic lights and the planned drop-off point. This helps riders understand what the vehicle is doing instead of guessing. Inside the cabin, passengers can adjust heated seats, climate controls and music. They can also contact support or request the vehicle to pull over if needed.",
      "CAN AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REALLY MAKE HIGHWAYS SAFER?",
      "The all-electric Uber robotaxi, built with partners Lucid and Nuro, is now navigating real traffic without a human driver. (INA FASSBENDER / AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Uber plans to scale robotaxis across the U.S. and global markets",
      "Uber plans to deploy 20,000 or more robotaxis over the next six years. These vehicles will operate in dozens of U.S. and international markets. Lucid will integrate all required hardware directly on the production line at its Casa Grande, Arizona factory. Uber will own and operate the vehicles along with third-party fleet partners. Every robotaxi ride will be booked through the Uber app, just like a standard Uber trip.",
      "How Uber is handling robotaxi safety and regulation",
      "Safety sits at the center of this rollout. Nuro's validation process combines simulation, closed-course testing and supervised on-road driving. The system relies on an end-to-end AI foundation model paired with clear safety logic. The goal is predictable, comfortable driving across a wide range of conditions. Uber and its partners are also working with regulators, policymakers and local governments to ensure the service aligns with public safety standards and city planning goals.",
      "When Uber's driverless rides are expected to launch",
      "Uber says the first autonomous rides will launch in a major U.S. city later in 2026. The service will be available exclusively through the Uber app. Production of the robotaxi is expected to begin later this year, pending final validation.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you use Uber, driverless rides may soon appear as an option. These vehicles could offer quieter trips, more consistent driving and improved availability during peak times. For cities, a shared electric robotaxi fleet could help reduce emissions and congestion. For riders, seeing how the vehicle thinks and reacts may make autonomous travel feel less intimidating.",

      "Why emotional intelligence matters for pets",
      "Smart feeders and pet cameras handle the basics. Emotional care is a different story. Pets are social. When routines change, their mood can shift quickly. Aura tracks behavior and listens for changes in sound patterns. It can tell whether a pet feels excited, anxious, lonely, or relaxed. Aura then sends real-time emotional updates to an owner's phone. That makes it easier to spot issues early rather than guessing after the fact.",
      "How Aura interacts with pets at home",

      "Capturing moments that matter",
      "Aura also keeps an eye out for moments worth saving. Using AI pet recognition and intelligent tracking, it captures everyday highlights like playful bursts, calm naps and funny interactions. Aura can automatically turn these clips into short videos. That helps owners stay connected and feel closer to their pets even when they are away. It also makes it easier to capture moments you might never catch on your own and share them with family or post on social media.",

      "How Aura moves and recharges on its own",
      "Movement is a big part of Aura's role in the home. With V-SLAM navigation, binocular vision and AIVI object recognition, Aura moves freely while avoiding obstacles. When the battery runs low, it returns to its feeding and charging dock on its own. That keeps it ready without constant attention from owners.",
      "A bigger ecosystem around pet care",
      "Aura connects to Tuya's broader ecosystem, which opens access to services beyond the home. These include smart pet boarding, health and medical care, behavior training, grooming, customization and community tools. Instead of handling one task, Aura becomes a central hub for pet care that can evolve over time.",
      "More than a pet robot",
      "Aura focuses on pets today, but the technology behind it reaches further. Emotional awareness, proactive assistance and ecosystem integration could also support elder care, home monitoring and family connectivity. Starting with pets gives Tuya a clear emotional use case while setting the stage for future home robotics.",

However, some are still available on third-party software download sites, which continues to pose a risk. If you see any of these names installed in your browser, remove them immediately.",
      "Why malicious Chrome extensions look legitimate",
      "These malicious add-ons are designed to look legitimate. They use professional names, polished dashboards and business-focused descriptions. Some claim to offer faster access to workplace tools. Others say they restrict user actions to protect company accounts. Privacy policies often promise that no personal data is collected. For people juggling daily work tasks or managing business accounts, the pitch sounds helpful rather than suspicious.",
      "What these extensions actually do",
      "After installation, the extensions operate silently in the background. They steal session cookies, which are small pieces of data that tell websites you are already logged in. When attackers get these cookies, they can access accounts without a password. At the same time, some extensions block access to security pages. Users may be unable to change passwords, disable accounts or review login history. One extension even allows criminals to insert stolen login sessions into another browser. That lets them sign in instantly as the victim.",

They blended in, looked professional and quietly did their damage in the background. The good news is that you do not need to be a tech expert to protect yourself. Taking a few minutes to review your extensions, remove anything unfamiliar and lock down your accounts can make a real difference. Small habits, repeated regularly, go a long way in reducing risk. If there is one takeaway here, it is this: convenience should never come at the cost of security. A clean browser and strong account protections give you back control.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Google designed Fast Pair to make Bluetooth connections fast and effortless. One tap replaces menus, codes and manual pairing. That convenience now comes with serious risk. Security researchers at KU Leuven uncovered flaws in Google's Fast Pair protocol that allows silent device takeovers. They named the attack method WhisperPair. An attacker nearby can connect to headphones, earbuds or speakers without the owner knowing. In some cases, the attacker can also track the user's location. Even more concerning, victims do not need to use Android or own any Google products. iPhone users are also affected.",

      "APPLE WARNS MILLIONS OF IPHONES ARE EXPOSED TO ATTACK",
      "Fast Pair makes connecting Bluetooth headphones quick, but researchers found that some devices accept new pairings without proper authorization. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What WhisperPair is and how it hijacks Bluetooth devices",
      "Fast Pair works by broadcasting a device's identity to nearby phones and computers. That shortcut speeds up pairing. Researchers found that many devices ignore a key rule. They still accept new pairings while already connected. That opens the door to abuse.",
      "Within Bluetooth range, an attacker can silently pair with a device in about 10 to 15 seconds. Once connected, they can interrupt calls, inject audio or activate microphones. The attack does not require specialized hardware and can be carried out using a standard phone, laptop, or low-cost device like a Raspberry Pi. According to the researchers, the attacker effectively becomes the device owner.",
      "Audio brands affected by the Fast Pair vulnerability",
      "The researchers tested 17 Fast Pair compatible devices from major brands, including Sony, Jabra, JBL, Marshall, Xiaomi, Nothing, OnePlus, Soundcore, Logitech and Google. Most of these products passed Google certification testing. That detail raises uncomfortable questions about how security checks are performed.",
      "How headphones can become tracking devices",
      "Some affected models create an even bigger privacy issue. Certain Google and Sony devices integrate with Find Hub, which uses nearby devices to estimate location. If a headset has never been linked to a Google account, an attacker can claim it first. That allows continuous tracking of the user's movements. If the victim later receives a tracking alert, it may appear to reference their own device. That makes the warning easy to dismiss as an error.",
      "GOOGLE NEST STILL SENDS DATA AFTER REMOTE CONTROL CUTOFF, RESEARCHER FINDS",
      "Attacker's dashboard with location from the Find Hub network. (KU Leuven)",
      "Why many Fast Pair devices may stay vulnerable",
      "There is another problem most users never consider. Headphones and speakers require firmware updates. Those updates usually arrive through brand-specific apps that many people never install. If you never download the app, you never see the update. That means vulnerable devices could remain exposed for months or even years.",
      "The only way to fix this vulnerability is by installing a software update issued by the device manufacturer. While many companies have released patches, updates may not yet be available for every affected model. Users should check directly with the manufacturer to confirm whether a security update exists for their specific device.",
      "Why convenience keeps creating security gaps",
      "Bluetooth itself was not the problem. The flaw lives in the convenience layer built on top of it. Fast Pair prioritized speed over strict ownership enforcement. Researchers argue that pairing should require cryptographic proof of ownership. Without it, convenience features become attack surfaces. Security and ease of use do not have to conflict. But they must be designed together.",
      "Google responds to the Fast Pair WhisperPair security flaws",
      "Google says it has been working with researchers to address the WhisperPair vulnerabilities and began sending recommended patches to headphone manufacturers in early September. Google also confirmed that its own Pixel headphones are now patched.",
      "In a statement to CyberGuy, a Google spokesperson said, \"We appreciate collaborating with security researchers through our Vulnerability Rewards Program, which helps keep our users safe. We worked with these researchers to fix these vulnerabilities, and we have not seen evidence of any exploitation outside of this report's lab setting. As a best security practice, we recommend users check their headphones for the latest firmware updates. We are constantly evaluating and enhancing Fast Pair and Find Hub security.\"",
      "Google says the core issue stemmed from some accessory makers not fully following the Fast Pair specification. That specification requires accessories to accept pairing requests only when a user has intentionally placed the device into pairing mode. According to Google, failures to enforce that rule contributed to the audio and microphone risks identified by the researchers.",
      "To reduce the risk going forward, Google says it updated its Fast Pair Validator and certification requirements to explicitly test whether devices properly enforce pairing mode checks. Google also says it provided accessory partners with fixes intended to fully resolve all related issues once applied.",
      "On the location tracking side, Google says it rolled out a server-side fix that prevents accessories from being silently enrolled into the Find Hub network if they have never been paired with an Android device. According to the company, this change addresses the Find Hub tracking risk in that specific scenario across all devices, including Google's own accessories.",

      "Remembering to take medication sounds simple. However, missed doses put people at serious health risk every day. Because of that, engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have designed a pill that confirms when someone swallows it. As a result, doctors could track treatment more accurately, and patients could stay on schedule more easily. At the same time, the pill safely breaks down inside the body, which helps reduce long-term risk.",

      "MIT engineers have designed a pill that can report when it has been swallowed. (Mehmet Say)",
      "How the MIT smart pill works",
      "The new system fits inside existing pill capsules. It uses a tiny, biodegradable radio-frequency antenna made from zinc and cellulose. These materials already have strong safety records in medicine. Here is what happens step by step:",
      "You swallow the capsule as usualThe outer coating dissolves in the stomachThe pill releases both the medication and the antennaThe antenna sends a radio signal confirming ingestion",

      "The pill releases both the medication and the antenna",
      "The antenna sends a radio signal confirming ingestion",
      "This entire process happens within about 10 minutes. An external receiver, potentially built into a wearable device, detects the signal from up to two feet away.",
      "Designed to break down safely",
      "Previous smart pill designs relied on components that stayed intact as they passed through the digestive system. That raised concerns about long-term safety. The MIT team took a different approach. Nearly all parts of the antenna break down in the stomach within days. Only a tiny off-the-shelf RF chip remains, and it passes naturally through the body. According to lead researcher Mehmet Girayhan Say, the goal is clear. The system avoids long-term buildup while still reliably confirming that a pill was taken.",

The research team published its findings in Nature Communications and plans further preclinical testing. Human trials are expected next as the technology moves closer to real-world use. This research received funding from Novo Nordisk, MIT's Department of Mechanical Engineering, Brigham and Women's Hospital Division of Gastroenterology and the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.",
      "Why medication adherence remains a major problem",
      "Patients failing to take medicine as prescribed contribute to hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths each year. It also adds billions of dollars to health care costs. This problem hits hardest when patients must take treatment consistently over long periods. That includes people who have received organ transplants, patients with tuberculosis and those managing complex neurological conditions. For these groups, missing doses can have life-altering consequences.",

      "If you or a loved one relies on critical medication, this kind of technology could add an extra layer of safety. It may reduce guesswork for doctors and ease pressure on patients who manage complex treatment plans. At the same time, it raises important questions about privacy, consent and how medical data is shared. Any future rollout will need strong safeguards to protect patients.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "AI assistants are supposed to make life easier. Tools like Microsoft Copilot can help you write emails, summarize documents and answer questions using information from your own account. But security researchers are now warning that a single bad link could quietly turn that convenience into a privacy risk.",
      "A newly discovered attack method shows how attackers could hijack a Copilot session and siphon data without you seeing anything suspicious on screen.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "Because Copilot stays tied to your logged-in Microsoft account, attackers can quietly use your active session to access data in the background. (Photo by Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "What researchers discovered about Copilot links",
      "ILLINOIS DHS DATA BREACH EXPOSES 700K RESIDENTS' RECORDS",
      "Security researchers at Varonis uncovered a technique they call \"Reprompt.\" In simple terms, it shows how attackers could sneak instructions into a normal-looking Copilot link and make the AI do things on their behalf.",
      "Here's the part that matters to you: Microsoft Copilot is connected to your Microsoft account. Depending on how you use it, Copilot can see your past conversations, things you've asked it and certain personal data tied to your account. Normally, Copilot has guardrails to prevent sensitive information from leaking. Reprompt showed a way around some of those protections.",
      "The attack starts with just one click. If you open a specially crafted Copilot link sent through email or a message, Copilot can automatically process hidden instructions embedded inside the link. You don't need to install anything, and there are no pop-ups or warnings. After that single click, Copilot can keep responding to instructions in the background using your already logged-in session. Even closing the Copilot tab does not immediately stop the attack, because the session stays active for a while.",
      "How Reprompt works",
      "Varonis found that Copilot accepts questions through a parameter inside its web address. Attackers can hide instructions inside that address and make Copilot execute them as soon as the page loads.",
      "That alone would not be enough, because Copilot tries to block data leaks. The researchers combined several tricks to get around this. First, they injected instructions directly into Copilot through the link itself. This allowed Copilot to read information it normally shouldn't share.",
      "Second, they used a \"try twice\" trick. Copilot applies stricter checks the first time it answers a request. By telling Copilot to repeat the action and double-check itself, the researchers found that those protections could fail on the second attempt.",
      "Third, they showed that Copilot could keep receiving follow-up instructions from a remote server controlled by the attacker. Each response from Copilot helped generate the next request, allowing data to be quietly sent out piece by piece. The result is an invisible back-and-forth where Copilot keeps working for the attacker using your session. From your perspective, nothing looks wrong.",
      "MICROSOFT SOUNDS ALARM AS HACKERS TURN TEAMS PLATFORM INTO 'REAL-WORLD DANGERS' FOR USERS",
      "Varonis responsibly reported the issue to Microsoft, and the company fixed it in the January 2026 Patch Tuesday updates. There is no evidence that Reprompt was used in real-world attacks before the fix. Still, this research is important because it shows a bigger problem. AI assistants have access, memory and the ability to act on your behalf. That combination makes them powerful, but also risky if protections fail. As researchers put it, the danger increases when autonomy and access come together.",
      "It's also worth noting that this issue only affected Copilot Personal. Microsoft 365 Copilot, which businesses use, has extra security layers like auditing, data loss prevention and admin controls.",
      "\"We appreciate Varonis Threat Labs for responsibly reporting this issue,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CyberGuy. \"We have rolled out protections that address the scenario described and are implementing additional measures to strengthen safeguards against similar techniques as part of our defense-in-depth approach.\"",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safe from AI attacks",
      "Even with the fix in place, these habits will help protect your data as AI tools become more common.",
      "Security fixes only protect you if they're installed. Attacks like Reprompt rely on flaws that already have patches available. Turn on automatic updates for Windows, Edge and other browsers so you don't delay critical fixes. Waiting weeks or months leaves a window where attackers can still exploit known weaknesses.",
      "If you wouldn't click a random password reset link, don't click unexpected Copilot links either. Even links that look official can be weaponized. If someone sends you a Copilot link, pause and ask yourself whether you were expecting it. When in doubt, open Copilot manually instead.",
      "Even after Microsoft fixed the flaw, the research highlights why limiting data exposure and monitoring account activity still matters as AI tools evolve. (Photographer: Prakash Singh/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "A password manager creates and stores strong, unique passwords for every service you use. If attackers manage to access session data or steal credentials indirectly, unique passwords prevent one breach from unlocking your entire digital life. Many password managers also warn you if a site looks suspicious or fake.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second layer of protection, even if attackers gain partial access to your session. It forces an extra verification step, usually through an app or device, making it much harder for someone else to act as you inside Copilot or other Microsoft services.",
      "5) Reduce how much personal data exists online",
      "Data broker sites collect and resell personal details like your email address, phone number, home address and even work history. If an AI tool or account session is abused, that publicly available data can make the damage worse. Using a data-removal service helps delete this information from broker databases, shrinking your digital footprint and limiting what attackers can piece together.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Modern antivirus tools do more than scan files. They help detect phishing links, malicious scripts and suspicious behavior tied to browser activity. Since Reprompt-style attacks start with a single click, having real-time protection can stop you before damage happens, especially when attacks look legitimate.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Check your Microsoft account activity for unfamiliar logins, locations, or actions. Review what services Copilot can access, and revoke anything you no longer need. These checks don't take long, but they can reveal issues early, before attackers have time to do serious damage. Here's how:",
      "Go to account.microsoft.com, and sign in to your Microsoft account.",
      "Select Security, then choose View my sign-in activity and verify your identity if prompted.",
      "Review each login for unfamiliar locations, devices or failed sign-in attempts.",
      "If you see anything suspicious, select This wasn't me or Secure your account, then change your password immediately and enable two-step verification.",
      "Visit account.microsoft.com/devices, and remove any devices you no longer recognize or use.",
      "In Microsoft Edge, open Settings > Appearance > Copilot and Sidebar > Copilot, and turn off Allow Microsoft to access page content if you want to limit Copilot's access.",
      "Review apps connected to your Microsoft account and revoke permissions you no longer need.",
      "A single Copilot link can carry hidden instructions that run the moment you click, without any warning or pop-ups.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Avoid giving AI assistants broad authority like \"handle whatever is needed.\" Wide permissions make it easier for hidden instructions to influence outcomes. Keep requests narrow and task-focused. The less freedom an AI has, the harder it is for malicious prompts to steer it silently.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Reprompt doesn't mean Copilot is unsafe to use, but it does show how much trust these tools require. When an AI assistant can think, remember and act for you, even a single bad click can matter. Keeping your system updated and being selective about what you click remain just as important in the age of AI as it was before.",

      "What happened in the Gulshan ransomware attack",
      "According to a disclosure filed with the Maine Attorney General's Office, Gulshan Management Services, Inc. reported a cybersecurity incident that impacted more than 377,000 individuals. Gulshan is linked to Gulshan Enterprises, which operates around 150 Handi Plus and Handi Stop gas stations and convenience stores across Texas.",
      "WINDOWS 10 USERS FACE RANSOMWARE NIGHTMARE AS MICROSOFT SUPPORT ENDS IN 2025 WORLDWIDE",
      "The company says it detected unauthorized access to its IT systems in late September. Investigators later determined that attackers had been inside the network for roughly ten days before anyone noticed. The intrusion began with a phishing attack, a reminder of how a single deceptive email can still open the door to massive breaches.",
      "Ransomware attacks don\u2019t just hit tech companies. Retailers like gas stations store sensitive customer and employee data that criminals actively target. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "During that window, the attackers accessed and stole personal data, then deployed ransomware that encrypted files across Gulshan's systems. The compromised information includes names, contact details, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. That combination is especially dangerous, since it can be used for identity theft, account takeovers and fraud that may surface months or even years later.",
      "Why the lack of a ransomware claim still matters",
      "So far, no known ransomware group has publicly taken credit for the attack. That might sound like good news, but it does not necessarily change the risk for affected individuals. In many ransomware cases, silence can mean one of two things. Either the attackers have not yet posted stolen data publicly, or the victim company may have resolved the incident privately.",
      "Gulshan's filing states that it restored its systems using known-safe backups. That detail often suggests a company chose to rebuild rather than negotiate with attackers. Even so, once data has been copied out of a network, there is no way to pull it back. Whether or not the stolen information ever appears online, the exposure alone puts affected people at long-term risk.",
      "This incident also highlights a recurring pattern. Retail and service businesses handle huge volumes of personal data but often rely on legacy systems and frontline employees who are prime phishing targets. Gas stations may not feel like obvious hacking targets, but their payment systems, loyalty programs and HR databases make them valuable all the same.",
      "We reached out to Gulshan Management Services for comment regarding the breach, but did not receive a response before our deadline.",

      "If your information was exposed in this breach or any similar ransomware incident, there are concrete steps you can take to reduce the fallout.",
      "If the company offers free credit monitoring or identity protection, enroll in it. These services can alert you early if someone tries to open accounts or misuse your identity. If nothing is offered, consider signing up for a reputable identity theft protection service on your own.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "Check your reports from all major credit bureaus for unfamiliar accounts or inquiries. You're entitled to free reports, and catching issues early makes them much easier to fix.",
      "If criminals expose your Social Security number, place a credit freeze as soon as possible. A credit freeze blocks lenders from opening new accounts in your name, even when thieves have your personal details. The credit bureaus offer freezes for free, and you can temporarily lift one when you apply for credit yourself. This step stops identity theft before it starts, instead of alerting you after the damage is done. If you prefer not to freeze your credit, place a fraud alert instead. A fraud alert tells lenders to verify your identity before approving credit, which adds another layer of protection.",
      "To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "In the Gulshan attack, hackers spent days inside internal systems, stealing personal data before deploying ransomware that locked down files. (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "When Social Security numbers are stolen, tax fraud often follows. Criminals can file fake tax returns in your name to steal refunds before you ever submit your paperwork. An IRS Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN) helps prevent this by ensuring only you can file a tax return using your SSN. It's a simple but powerful safeguard that can block a common form of identity theft tied to data breaches.",
      "Don't just watch for new fraud, proactively secure the accounts you already have. Enable alerts on bank and credit card accounts for large transactions, new payees, or changes to contact information. If your SSN or driver's license number was exposed, consider calling your bank to ask about additional protections or account notes. Acting early can prevent small issues from becoming major financial problems.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Your personal data doesn't just live with banks and hospitals. Retailers, gas stations, and convenience store operators also hold information that can cause real harm if it falls into the wrong hands. When attackers get in through something as simple as a phishing email and stay undetected for days, the damage can spread fast. You can't prevent these breaches yourself, but you can limit how much power stolen data gives criminals by locking down your accounts and staying alert.",

      "Pliyt believes the future of ride-sharing means sharing the ride as little as possible. Instead of one shared cabin, its autonomous vehicle concept divides the interior into four fully independent pods. Each one acts like a private room on wheels.",

      "You decide how social or private your ride feels. Traveling with a companion? The divider between pods can be lowered so you can share the space by choice.",
      "\"We believe rider choice and personal space will be foundational to the future of shared autonomous mobility,\" the company told CyberGuy. \"As vehicles become autonomous, differentiation will shift from driving to experience. Giving riders control over privacy, comfort, and interaction, rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all shared cabin, will be critical for trust and adoption, especially in dense urban environments. Shared mobility doesn't have to mean shared personal space, and we see that as a key evolution of the category.\"",
      "Is Pliyt fully autonomous?",
      "Yes. Pliyt vehicles are designed to operate without human drivers. However, the company does not plan to build its own autonomous driving system. Instead, Pliyt intends to partner with established autonomy providers once development progresses.",
      "\"Our current plan is to launch an initial service in San Francisco around 2028, beginning with controlled, geo-fenced deployments and expanding gradually as autonomy, infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks mature,\" a spokesperson for Pliyt told CyberGuy. \"Our focus today is on building the right vehicle architecture, partnerships, and user experience to support that rollout responsibly.\"",
      "Pliyt\u2019s concept vehicle replaces a shared cabin with four fully enclosed pods designed for personal space and comfort. (Pliyt)",
      "Privacy-first design sets Pliyt apart",
      "Privacy sits at the center of Pliyt's design philosophy. Every pod is built for in-ride anonymity even during shared trips. Fellow passengers cannot see you, and you cannot see them unless you choose to. This approach stands out in a world where many mobility platforms depend on data collection and shared environments. Pliyt positions privacy as foundational rather than optional. The company says no personal identities are visible during rides. The experience aims to feel calm, intentional and free from observation.",
      "CAN AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REALLY MAKE HIGHWAYS SAFER?",
      "Comfort without the awkwardness",
      "Pliyt also leans heavily into comfort. Seats feature what the company calls zero-gravity positioning. You will not float like an astronaut, but the posture is designed to reduce pressure and fatigue. Large windows offer panoramic city views while still maintaining privacy. Personal lighting and climate controls help tailor the ride to your preferences. If relaxing is not your goal, productivity comes built in.

      "Autonomous pods are not entirely new. Companies like Zoox and Waymo already operate self-driving vehicles with unique interiors. Waymo's Zeekr RT, for example, focuses on spacious seating and rider comfort. Pliyt's difference lies in isolation by design. Instead of rethinking a shared cabin, it breaks the vehicle into four private spaces. The result feels closer to a personal lounge than a ride-share.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If this concept becomes reality, ride-sharing could feel very different. No forced conversations. No shared armrests. No feeling watched. For commuters, it could mean working quietly on the way to the office. For travelers, it could mean relaxing without distractions. For introverts, it could mean finally enjoying shared mobility on their own terms. It also raises bigger questions about how future cities balance efficiency with dignity and personal space.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com.",
      "The interior divider can be lowered, allowing passengers to share space with a companion while keeping control over privacy. (Pliyt)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Pliyt is not promising faster rides or cheaper fares. It is promising something more subtle. A calmer, more respectful way to move through cities. Whether the concept scales will depend on partnerships, regulation and public adoption. Still, the idea challenges long-standing assumptions about what ride-sharing has to feel like. If autonomous vehicles are coming either way, designs like this suggest they do not have to feel crowded or impersonal.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Online shopping feels familiar and fast, but a hidden threat continues to operate behind the scenes.",
      "Researchers are tracking a long-running web skimming campaign that targets businesses connected to major payment networks. Web skimming is a technique where criminals secretly add malicious code to checkout pages so they can steal payment details as shoppers type them in.",
      "These attacks work quietly inside the browser and often leave no obvious signs. Most victims only discover the problem after unauthorized charges appear on their statements.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "WHATSAPP WEB MALWARE SPREADS BANKING TROJAN AUTOMATICALLY",
      "Web skimming attacks hide inside checkout pages and steal card details as shoppers type them in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What Magecart is and why it matters",
      "Magecart is the name researchers use for groups that specialize in web-skimming attacks. These attacks focus on online stores where shoppers enter payment details during checkout. Instead of hacking banks or card networks directly, attackers slip malicious code into a store's checkout page. That code is written in JavaScript, which is a common type of website code used to make pages interactive. Legitimate sites use it for things like forms, buttons and payment processing.",
      "In Magecart attacks, criminals abuse that same code to secretly copy card numbers, expiration dates, security codes and billing details as shoppers type them in. The checkout still works, and the purchase goes through, so there is no obvious warning sign. Magecart originally described attacks against Magento-based online stores. Today, the term applies to web-skimming campaigns across many e-commerce platforms and payment systems.",
      "Which payment providers are being targeted?",
      "Researchers say this campaign targets merchants tied to several major payment networks, including:",
      "American ExpressDiners ClubDiscover, a subsidiary of Capital OneJCB Co., Ltd.MastercardUnionPay",
      "American Express",
      "Diners Club",
      "Discover, a subsidiary of Capital One",
      "JCB Co., Ltd.",
      "Mastercard",
      "UnionPay",
      "Large enterprises that rely on these payment providers face a higher risk due to complex websites and third-party integrations.",
      "700CREDIT DATA BREACH EXPOSES SSNS OF 5.8M CONSUMERS",
      "Criminals use hidden code to copy payment data while the purchase still goes through normally. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How attackers slip skimmers into checkout pages",
      "Attackers usually enter through weak points that are easy to overlook. Common entry paths include vulnerable third-party scripts, outdated plugins and unpatched content management systems. Once inside, they inject JavaScript directly into the checkout flow. The skimmer monitors form fields tied to card data and personal details, then quietly sends that information to attacker-controlled servers.",
      "Why web skimming attacks are hard to detect",
      "To avoid detection, the malicious JavaScript is heavily obfuscated. Some versions can remove themselves when they detect an admin session, which makes inspections appear clean. Researchers also found the campaign uses bulletproof hosting. These hosting providers ignore abuse reports and takedown requests, giving attackers a stable environment to operate. Because web skimmers run inside the browser, they can bypass many server-side fraud controls used by merchants and payment providers.",
      "Who Magecart web skimming attacks affect most",
      "Magecart campaigns impact three groups at the same time:",
      "Shoppers who unknowingly give up card dataMerchants whose checkout pages are compromisedPayment providers that detect fraud after the damage is done",
      "Shoppers who unknowingly give up card data",
      "Merchants whose checkout pages are compromised",
      "Payment providers that detect fraud after the damage is done",
      "This shared exposure makes detection slower and response more difficult.",
      "NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "Simple protections like virtual cards and transaction alerts can limit damage and expose fraud faster. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to stay safe as a shopper",
      "While shoppers cannot fix compromised checkout pages, a few smart habits can reduce exposure, limit how stolen data is used, and help catch fraud faster.",
      "Virtual and single-use cards are digital card numbers that link to your real credit or debit account without exposing the actual number. They work like a normal card at checkout, but add an extra layer of protection. Most people already have access to them through services they use every day, including:",
      "Major banks and credit card issuers that offer virtual card numbers inside their apps",
      "Mobile wallet apps like Apple Pay and Google Pay generate temporary card numbers for online purchases, keeping your real card number hidden.",
      "Some payment apps and browser tools that create one-time or merchant-locked card numbers",
      "A single-use card typically works for one purchase or expires shortly after use. A virtual card can stay active for one store and be paused or deleted later. If a web skimming attack captures one of these numbers, attackers usually cannot reuse it elsewhere or run up repeat charges, which limits financial damage and makes fraud easier to stop.",
      "Transaction alerts notify you the moment your card is used, even for small purchases. If web skimming leads to fraud, these alerts can expose unauthorized charges quickly and give you a chance to freeze the card before losses grow. For example, a $2 test charge on your card can signal fraud before larger purchases appear.",
      "Use strong, unique passwords for banking and card portals to reduce the risk of account takeover. A password manager helps generate and store them securely.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Strong antivirus software can block connections to malicious domains used to collect skimmed data and warn you about unsafe websites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Data removal services can reduce how much personal information is exposed online, making it harder for criminals to pair stolen card data with full identity details.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Magecart web skimming shows how attackers can exploit trusted checkout pages without disrupting the shopping experience. While consumers cannot fix compromised sites, simple safeguards can reduce risk and help catch fraud early. Online payments rely on trust, but this campaign shows why that trust should always be paired with caution.",

    "story": [
      "Alphabet Inc. stock surged to a new high after Google released its new Gemini 3 AI model with advanced features including problem-solving at a PhD level, increased accuracy and integration into various Google services.",
      "Apple and Google just made one of the most important artificial intelligence (AI) announcements of the year. Under a new multi-year collaboration, Apple will base the next generation of its Apple Foundation Models on Google's Gemini models and cloud technology.",
      "The companies confirmed the partnership in a joint statement, signaling a major shift in how Apple plans to deliver AI features across the iPhone, iPad and Mac.",

      "Apple and Google have entered a multiyear AI partnership that will shape the future of Apple Intelligence and Siri. (Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why Apple chose Google's Gemini",
      "Apple evaluated multiple AI options before settling on Gemini. According to the joint statement, Apple believes Google's AI provides the strongest foundation for its own models. Gemini has quickly become one of the most capable large language model families, backed by Google's massive cloud infrastructure.",
      "For Apple, this means faster development, more reliable performance and the ability to roll out advanced features without rebuilding everything from scratch. At the same time, Apple says Apple Intelligence will still run on the device and through its Private Cloud Compute system. In other words, Apple controls how user data flows, even if the underlying models come from Google.",
      "The joint statement from Apple and Google",
      "Here is the full joint statement from the two companies:",
      "\"Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be based on Google's Gemini models and cloud technology. These models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year.",
      "\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users. Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards.\"",
      "That last line is critical. Apple is clearly trying to reassure users that privacy remains central, even with Google's technology involved.",
      "CHATGPT'S GPT-5.2 IS HERE, AND IT FEELS RUSHED",
      "Google\u2019s Gemini models will help power Apple\u2019s next-generation AI features while Apple keeps control of on-device processing and privacy. (REUTERS/Norbert von der Groeben)",
      "A long-delayed Siri overhaul finally moves forward",
      "A more personalized Siri is one of the biggest promises tied to this deal. Apple had already previewed major Siri improvements but ran into development problems. Reports described internal frustration, bugs and delays that pushed the revamped assistant further out than planned. This partnership helps explain why. By leaning on Gemini, Apple can accelerate Siri's evolution instead of trying to solve every AI challenge internally. The result should be a smarter assistant that better understands context, handles complex requests and integrates more deeply across Apple apps.",
      "Behind-the-scenes pressure at Apple",
      "This deal did not happen in a vacuum. Apple has faced criticism for moving too slowly on AI while rivals pushed ahead. Apple had reportedly been in talks to license a custom version of Gemini for Siri and was expected to pay roughly $1 billion per year, though the official announcement did not confirm any financial terms.",
      "Apple has also reshuffled its AI leadership. The company recently hired Amar Subramanya as vice president of artificial intelligence. He replaced John Giannandrea, who stepped down from the role after leading Apple's AI strategy since 2018.",
      "Antitrust questions loom",
      "There is also a regulatory angle. Apple and Google already face scrutiny for their long-standing search agreement. That partnership came under renewed attention after U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google holds a monopoly in online search, while still allowing payments to Apple to keep Google as the default search engine on iPhones. This new AI collaboration could attract fresh attention from antitrust regulators who worry about powerful tech companies becoming even more intertwined.",

      "What this means for you",
      "For those of you using Apple devices, the impact is straightforward. You should see smarter Apple Intelligence features arrive faster, starting with a more capable Siri. Tasks like summarizing messages, handling complex reminders and understanding context across apps should improve. At the same time, Apple insists your data stays protected. Apple Intelligence will still rely on device processing and Private Cloud Compute, rather than funneling personal data directly into Google's systems. In short, users get better AI without giving up Apple's privacy stance, at least in theory.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Apple's partnership with Google marks a turning point in its AI story. Instead of going it alone, Apple is betting that combining its privacy-focused platform with Google's AI muscle is the fastest path forward. If Apple delivers on its promises, this deal could finally close the AI gap that has frustrated users and investors alike. The real test will come when those features land on your devices.",

      "Philadelphia DA Larry Krasner drew backlash after vowing to \"hunt\" down ICE agents during a City Hall event tied to new \"ICE OUT\" legislation. (Credit: WTXF)",
      "Philadelphia\u2019s top prosecutor, a George Soros-backed district attorney, is facing scrutiny and backlash after vowing to \"hunt\" down federal immigration agents as city leaders move to curb ICE operations.",
      "Speaking during a morning event outside City Hall tied to newly unveiled \"ICE OUT\" legislation, District Attorney Larry Krasner sharply criticized Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.",
      "\"This is a small bunch of wannabe Nazis. That\u2019s what they are,\" Krasner said. \"In a country of 350 million, we outnumber them. If we have to hunt you down the way they hunted down Nazis for decades, we will find your identities. We will find you. We will achieve justice.\"",
      "WASHINGTON DEM PUSHES BILL TO BAR RECENT ICE HIRES FROM FUTURE POLICE JOBS, SLAMMING TRUMP'S 'OCCUPYING FORCE'",
      "Krasner made the remarks as Philadelphia City Councilmembers Kendra Brooks and Rue Landau introduced a sweeping package of bills aimed at sharply limiting how ICE can operate within city limits.",
      "The proposed legislation would bar ICE agents from using city-owned property, restrict cooperation between city agencies and federal immigration authorities, prohibit data sharing, and limit agents\u2019 access to public facilities \u2014 including libraries, shelters and health centers \u2014 without a judicial warrant.",
      "Krasner framed his comments as a defense of constitutional rights and accused federal authorities of overreach, while praising individuals who film ICE agents during enforcement actions. Critics, however, said the language escalated tensions and raised concerns about rhetoric directed at federal law enforcement officers.",

      "The remarks come just weeks after Pennsylvania lawmakers warned Krasner and Philadelphia County Sheriff Rochelle Bilal that any attempt to prosecute or interfere with ICE officers carrying out federal duties could trigger serious legal consequences and potential intervention from Harrisburg.",
      "Earlier this month, Krasner warned that \"any ICE agent [that] is going to come to Philly to commit crimes\" should \"get the \u2018eff\u2019 out of here,\" saying he would charge, arrest and prosecute such agents. He also argued President Donald Trump would be unable to issue pardons because any cases would be brought at the state level.",
      "Bilal echoed that posture following the fatal shooting of a Minnesota woman during a federal immigration operation, calling ICE officers \"fake, wannabe law enforcement\" and warning agents, \"You don\u2019t want this smoke, \u2019cause we will bring it to you.\"",

      "\"The district attorney and sheriff know they can\u2019t interfere, and they won\u2019t interfere with federal law enforcement,\" Coleman previously told Fox News Digital. \"If they do obstruct federal law enforcement efforts, the Pennsylvania Senate will be the least of their worries.\"",
      "The White House also weighed in Tuesday, sharply criticizing rhetoric directed at federal immigration officers.",
      "\"ICE officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults because of dangerous, untrue smears by elected Democrats,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital. \"Just the other day, an officer had his finger bitten off by a radical left-wing rioter.\"",
      "Jackson said ICE officers \"act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities,\" adding that local officials should work with federal agents \"not against them.\"",

      "House Minority Leader Jesse Topper, R-McConnellsburg, also rebuked Philadelphia officials, calling their comments \"not just hypocritical [but] outright laughable.\"",
      "\"Instead of focusing on scoring political points and further dividing our nation, those seeking to obstruct federal law enforcement should instead focus their time and resources on keeping their communities secure,\" Topper said.",

      "Earlier in the morning \u2014 before 7 a.m. \u2014 Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said, Border Patrol agents had spotted a vehicle with multiple people inside. At the time, the sheriff said, everyone fled when agents tried to make a stop.",
      "Later, the Border Patrol agent recognized what he believed to be that vehicle and conducted a traffic stop, Nanos said. The driver \u2014 who was now the only person inside \u2014 got out and ran away, and the agent gave chase on foot, the sheriff said.",
      "\u201cShots were fired from the suspect, and the agent returned fire. The suspect was hit,\u201d Nanos said.",
      "A spokesperson for the sheriff's department said by email that Schlegel shot at agents on the ground.",
      "Janke said that at one point Schlegel fired at a manned Customs and Border Protection helicopter.",
      "No law enforcement officers were injured, officials said.",
      "Officials said Schleger has a \"previous alien smuggling conviction.\" The U.S. Marshals Service last year issued a federal arrest warrant for escape in relation to that conviction, Janke said.",
      "Federal court records show that Schlegel was serving a 36-month sentence after pleading guilty in 2024 to one count of transportation of illegal aliens for profit and a gun possession count when he allegedly escaped last year.",
      "Schlegel was serving part of that sentence at an institution for people pending release, according to the criminal complaint for the escape case. He signed out to go to alcohol evaluation and counseling on Dec. 15 but never returned, according to the complaint.",
      "Schlegel was in serious but stable condition at a hospital Tuesday afternoon, Nanos said. Janke said Schlegel successfully underwent surgery.",
      "He is expected to be charged by criminal complaint on three federal counts, Janke said: assault on a federal officer, alien smuggling and being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm.",
      "It was not immediately clear Tuesday if Schlegel had an attorney who could speak on his behalf. An attorney listed as representing Schlegel in the prior smuggling case did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Schleger is a resident of Sahuarita, a community south of Tucson and around 35 miles northeast of Arivaca, officials said.",
      "The Pima County Sheriff's Department is investigating the use of force by the Border Patrol agent. It is standard practice to involve the sheriff\u2019s department when a federal agent is involved in a shooting incident in Pima County, the department said.",
      "The CBP Office of Professional Responsibility and the FBI are also investigating, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Tuesday night.",
      "The shooting comes three days after Border Patrol fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and weeks after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis. Those shootings have triggered protests and generated criticism of DHS, including calls for Secretary Kristi Noem's firing.",
      "House Democratic leaders Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Pete Aguilar of California accused the Trump administration in a statement Tuesday of using taxpayer dollars \"to kill American citizens.\" They also threatened to begin impeachment proceedings against Noem in the House if she is not fired.",
      "Asked Tuesday whether Noem would step down, President Donald Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn, \"No.\"",

    "story": [
      "In the first nine months of the Trump administration, a jump in the number of immigration-related street arrests led to an increase in the number of deportations initiated inside the U.S. \u2014and away from the border \u2014 by more than four and a half times, according to a new report.",
      "Researchers from the University of California Berkeley found that Immigration and Customs Enforcement transfers of people from criminal custody to ICE custody as well as street arrests \u2014 people who were not in jail at the time \u2014 quadrupled over that period.",
      "Much of that steep increase was attributable to street arrests rising by more than a factor of 11 \u2014 according to the analysis by the Deportation Data Project at UC Berkeley, a group of academics and lawyers that collect, post and analyze government immigration enforcement data.",
      "Even though the overall number of people under ICE custody increased, the people they arrested in this nine-month period were less likely to have criminal convictions. This resulted in a sevenfold increase in arrests of people with no convictions, according to the report.",
      "\u201cFor both transfers and street arrests, the Trump administration\u2019s decision to stop prioritizing arrests based on factors such as criminal convictions (or to prioritize less) resulted in another well-known trend: the huge increase in the number of arrests of noncitizens not convicted of any crime,\u201d the report said.",
      "Arrests of people with convictions also went up, about 30%, but not as much as those without convictions.",
      "President Donald Trump, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other administration officials have repeatedly said the president\u2019s mass deportation agenda and his administration\u2019s immigration enforcement activities prioritize and target the \u201cworst of the worst.\u201d",
      "NBC News has reached out to the administration about the report\u2019s findings.",
      "Along with more arrests, ICE had more room to hold immigrant detainees: When arrests at the border fell, it freed up space to hold more immigrants arrested and detained within the U.S. The administration adopted rules such as limiting bond and kept more immigrants detained while they fought their immigration cases, according to the report.",
      "The administration also roughly tripled detention beds, using an infusion of increased funding from Congress, and few of those arrested were released.",
      "In the last six months of the Biden administration, about 16% of releases occurred within 60 days of arrest. That fell to 3%, the report said.",
      "Deportations within two months of detention rose from 55% to 69%, largely because of the lower release rate, the report states. Voluntary departures rose by more than 21 times.",
      "\u201cThe increase in detention space and immigrants\u2019 decisions not to fight their cases from detention help explain why, even as ICE arrested people who would be more likely to win their cases, such as those without any criminal convictions, the deportation rate among arrestees shot up,\u201d the report states."

      "A man was released from immigration detention in Minnesota, his attorney said Tuesday, after a federal judge threatened to hold the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in contempt for flouting court orders related to the man's case.",
      "On Monday, Chief U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz ordered acting ICE Director Todd Lyons to appear in court this Friday to answer questions in the case of Juan Tobay Robles, who was arrested by federal immigration agents in Minnesota in early January.",
      "Tobay Robles' attorney, Graham Ojala-Barbour, told NBC News on Tuesday afternoon that he had been informed by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Minneapolis that his client was released and is in Texas. Ojala-Barbour said he hadn't directly heard from Tobay Robles since he was freed.",
      "His release would mean Lyons won't be required to testify in a Minneapolis courtroom on Friday, as Schiltz had ordered.",
      "Schiltz had said in his order Monday that he needed Lyons to explain why Tobay Robles was not given a bond hearing or released from detention within seven days of the judge's order requiring the Trump administration to provide him that hearing, or release him.",
      "\"This is one of dozens of court orders with which respondents have failed to comply in recent weeks,\" Schiltz, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote in his order Monday.",
      "He added later: \u201cThe Court\u2019s patience is at an end. The Court acknowledges that ordering the head of a federal agency to personally appear is an extraordinary step, but the extent of ICE\u2019s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed.\u201d",
      "Schiltz had planned to hold a hearing on Friday at 1 p.m. in Minneapolis, where he said Lyons had to \u201cappear in person to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for violating the Court\u2019s January 14, 2026, order.\u201d",
      "The judge said that the court would cancel the hearing and not require Lyons to appear if the parties filed a notice indicating that Tobay Robles had been released from custody before the hearing.",
      "ICE did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Ojala-Barbour filed a petition on Jan. 8 challenging his client\u2019s detention. Tobay Robles was placed into ICE custody at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, a site of the agency\u2019s St. Paul field office. Schiltz on the same day ordered the Trump administration to respond to his petition by Jan. 12 \u201ccertifying the true cause and proper duration\u201d of Tobay Robles\u2019 confinement.",
      "Court documents show Tobay Robles first entered the U.S. illegally as a child. He is a citizen of Ecuador and entered the U.S. \u201cwithout inspection as a minor, in or around 1999,\u201d filings say.",
      "The court said his case was one of \"numerous recent cases\" challenging the detention of \"aliens who have been living in the United States unlawfully.\"",
      "On Jan. 14, the judge said that Tobay Robles was not subject to mandatory detention under U.S. law and that the Trump administration could not deny his release. The judge ordered a bond hearing for Tobay Robles within seven days and said he must be \u201cimmediately released from detention.\u201d",
      "Ojala-Barbour notified the court on Jan. 23 that his client was still detained and no bond hearing had occurred.",
      "In Schiltz's latest order calling for Lyons to appear in court, he said that the practical consequence of the Trump administration's failure to comply with court orders \"has almost always been significant hardship to aliens (many of whom have lawfully lived and worked in the United States for years and done absolutely nothing wrong).\"",
      "The judge said the court has been \"extremely patient\" with the administration, which he said has sent thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain undocumented immigrants without planning for the filings of hundreds of petitions challenging their detention or lawsuits \"that were sure to result.\"",
      "President Donald Trump and top administration officials have faced widespread criticism and protests over immigration operations in Minnesota. The administration has been surging federal agents to the region since December \u2014 around the same time that conservative influencers resurfaced years-old allegations of day care fraud involving Somali immigrants.",

      "Patel said in an interview with conservative podcaster Benny Johnson that he wanted to know whether any Minnesota residents had put federal agents \u201cin harm\u2019s way\u201d with activities such as sharing agents\u2019 license plate numbers and locations.",

      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "\u201cYou cannot create a scenario that illegally entraps and puts law enforcement in harm\u2019s way,\u201d he said in the interview, which was posted to YouTube.",
      "The investigation quickly drew skepticism from free speech advocates who said the First Amendment protects members of the public who share legally obtained information, such as the names of federal agents or where they are conducting enforcement operations.",
      "\u201cThere are legitimate reasons to share such information, including enabling members of the public to observe and document law enforcement activity and to hold officials accountable for misconduct,\u201d Aaron Terr, director of public advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in an email.",
      "\u201cGiven this administration\u2019s poor track record of distinguishing protected speech from criminal conduct, any investigation like this deserves very close scrutiny,\u201d he said.",
      "For months, digital tools have been at the center of how people have pushed back against immigration enforcement efforts in Minnesota and across the country. The administration\u2019s opponents have used group text chats to track Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, share photos of suspected ICE vehicles and raise awareness for neighbors. In June, administration officials criticized ICEBlock, an app designed to share information about ICE sightings. Apple removed the app from its app store in October, prompting a lawsuit from the app\u2019s developer alleging the administration unlawfully pressured Apple to remove it.",
      "In the past few days, the group text chats \u2014 especially those on the encrypted messaging app Signal \u2014 have drawn attention from right-wing media. On Saturday, Cam Higby, a conservative journalist based near Seattle, said in a thread on X that he had \u201cinfiltrated\u201d Signal groups from around Minneapolis that he alleged were obstructing law enforcement. His thread, which got 20 million views, focused on how the groups share such information as the license plate numbers of suspected federal vehicles. NBC News has not verified Higby\u2019s claims.",
      "Patel said he got the idea for the investigation from Higby.",
      "\u201cAs soon as Higby put that post out, I opened an investigation on it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe immediately opened up that investigation, because that sort of Signal chat \u2014 being coordinated with individuals not just locally in Minnesota, but maybe even around the country \u2014 if that leads to a break in the federal statute or a violation of some law, then we are going to arrest people.\u201d",
      "The Signal Foundation, the nonprofit organization that operates the Signal app, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Signal, which is considered one of the most secure chat apps, is a go-to resource for people concerned about privacy.  It is perhaps best known as the app Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used to share sensitive military information last year in a group chat that accidentally included a journalist.",
      "In the Twin Cities, Signal group chats have been a standard part of toolkits \u2014 along with walkie-talkies and whistles \u2014 used by activists, parents and neighborhood-watch members who have organized as volunteers to warn families about immigration enforcement activities by relaying real-time information, especially near schools. Patrol volunteers have said that, with more than 3,000 federal immigration agents in Minnesota, they are motivated by a desire to protect parents, children and school staff members who are not U.S. citizens.",
      "Patel did not say which laws he thought Minnesota residents may have violated. An FBI spokesperson said the bureau had no further information to provide.",
      "The announcement seemed likely to have implications for the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free speech. Alex Abdo, litigation director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the First Amendment protects the right to record law enforcement officers as they carry out their official responsibilities.",
      "\u201cThe ability of everyday citizens to hold government agents to account, by observing them and advocating for change, is what has distinguished the American experiment with democracy from authoritarian regimes around the world,\u201d Abdo said in an email.",
      "\u201cUnless the FBI has evidence of a crime, and not just evidence of activity the Constitution protects, it should stand down,\u201d he said.",
      "Patel acknowledged in the interview with Johnson that an investigation into group text chats would raise free speech concerns and said the FBI would \u201cbalance\u201d the rights guaranteed by the First and Second amendments with what he said were potential violations of federal law.",
      "\u201cNow, we will balance the First and Second amendment constantly, but we have to let the community know that we will not tolerate acts of violence and an escalation and a violation of the federal code,\u201d he said. The Second Amendment could be at issue because Alex Pretti, the nurse shot and killed by a federal agent Saturday in Minneapolis, was permitted to carry a gun in public and had one with him.",
      "Terr, of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said the government does not get to \u201cbalance\u201d the First Amendment against its other interests.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution takes precedence over any conflicting state or federal law, and over any official\u2019s desire to suppress speech they dislike,\u201d he said in his email.",
      "He added: \u201cThere is a First Amendment exception for speech intended and likely to provoke imminent unlawful action, but that doesn\u2019t apply to just any speech the government claims puts officials in harm\u2019s way. By contrast, if individuals are threatening federal agents or conspiring to physically harm them, that is illegal. But conspiracy requires an agreement to commit a specific crime and a substantial step toward carrying it out.\u201d",
      "Patel also said the FBI had made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in an investigation into groups and people responsible for funding resistance to immigration enforcement. He alleged that the protests and neighborhood monitoring are \u201cnot happening organically\u201d but did not immediately provide evidence."

More than 1,600 plaintiffs \u2014 including over 350 families and over 250 school districts \u2014 accuse the owners of Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Snap of knowingly designing addictive products harmful to young users\u2019 mental health.",

We want these companies to be held accountable for the damage that they\u2019ve done to individual people.\u201d",

      "Measles in South Carolina has spread to at least 789 people, surpassing the 2025 West Texas outbreak that sickened 762 people and killed two young girls.",
      "The majority of cases remain centered in Spartanburg County, mostly among people who were either unvaccinated or didn't know their status, the South Carolina Department of Public Health reported Tuesday. There have been 89 new cases confirmed since Friday, indicating that the outbreak isn't under control.",
      "Health officials said that 557 people are in quarantine for 21 days.",
      "The South Carolina outbreak began this past fall. By January, cases directly linked to the state had been documented in California, North Carolina and Washington. Several other probable cases were reported in Ohio, according to NBC affiliate WKYC of Cleveland.",
      "Dr. Zack Moore, state epidemiologist for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, said he\u2019s keeping watch on vulnerable areas in the western part of the state with low vaccination rates and geographically close to the South Carolina outbreak zone.",
      "\u201cWe know there\u2019s a lot of back and forth travel, so that is certainly a concern,\u201d Moore said during a Jan. 21 media briefing.",
      "North Carolina health officials have reported 14 cases as of Tuesday, some with direct links to South Carolina.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "More than 170 people under quarantine in Union County, North Carolina, are connected to a case at Shining Light Baptist Academy, a private Christian school that has children as young as 6 weeks old.",
      "The quarantine orders stem from an unvaccinated child who attends the school, according to a Union County Public Health alert, \u201cand contracted measles connected to an outbreak in South Carolina. The child attended school while contagious.\u201d",
      "According to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, just 60.1% of students at Shining Light Baptist Academy are vaccinated against measles. A vaccination rate of at least 95% is the accepted level of herd immunity needed to protect against a measles outbreak.",
      "\u201cIf you have schools that have very low vaccination rates, you essentially create a tinder box for measles, because it is so incredibly contagious,\u201d said Dr. Deborah Greenhouse, a past president of the South Carolina chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened in the upstate of South Carolina, and that\u2019s exactly what can happen over and over again if the disease spreads to other areas with low vaccination rates.\u201d",
      "The news was distressing to doctors working to contain the outbreak.",
      "\u201cI am very sad,\u201d said Greenhouse, who is also a pediatrician in Columbia, South Carolina. \u201cIt emphasizes even more that we need to continue the work of trying to educate families in South Carolina and trying to get families to understand that the way we shut this down is by increasing our vaccination rates and by complying with isolation and quarantine.\u201d",
      "Most of those sickened are children and teenagers, health officials said. At least 23 schools in South Carolina have students in quarantine.",
      "South Carolina's outbreak has exploded at a dizzying pace. The first cases were reported in late September and picked up steam during the holidays.",
      "Losing measles elimination status",
      "The South Carolina milestone comes as the U.S. teeters toward losing its measles elimination status. That could occur as soon as this fall if it\u2019s determined that the virus originated from a single source and continued to circulate for a full year.",
      "In a call with reporters on Jan. 20, the new principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Ralph Abraham, appeared to shrug off the matter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just the cost of doing business, with our borders being somewhat porous,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cWe have these communities that choose to be unvaccinated. That\u2019s their personal freedom.\u201d",
      "Small communities opting out of vaccination",
      "It\u2019s close, tight-knit communities with the lowest vaccination rates that have been hit hardest, according to an NBC News data investigation.",
      "South Carolina\u2019s outbreak, health officials said, was first reported among families who immigrated from Ukraine to Spartanburg County in recent decades. The county has one of the highest percentages of nonmedical vaccine exemptions at 8.2%, meaning schoolchildren are opting out of vaccination for personal or religious reasons.",
      "In West Texas, cases occurred mostly in a Mennonite community in Gaines County where nonmedical vaccine exemptions are at 19.5%.",
      "The outbreak concentrated along the border of Arizona and Utah is mostly linked to residents with ties to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Mohave County, Arizona\u2019s nonmedical vaccine exemptions are at 15.9%, and neighboring Washington County, Utah, is at 19.6%.",
      "While Abraham acknowledged that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is \u201ceffective,\u201d he did not explicitly encourage vaccination in outbreak areas.",
      "In 2025, the U.S. recorded more measles cases than in any year since 1991: 2,255, according to the CDC. So far in January, 416 cases have been confirmed nationwide.",
      "The vast majority (93%) of patients have been unvaccinated."

    "story": [
      "The earliest known hand-held wooden tools, used by our early human ancestors around 430,000 years ago, have been uncovered by researchers at an archeological site in Greece.",
      "One is made from the trunk of an alder tree and could have been used for digging, and the other is a small willow or poplar artifact that may have been used to shape stones, according to a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s particularly exciting about finds like this is that we just so rarely have wood preserved for that long,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Annemieke Milks, told NBC News by phone Tuesday.",
      "Stone tools have been recovered by archeologists for centuries because they preserve really well, said Milks, a researcher and a leading expert in early wooden tools at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. \u201cSo it\u2019s really nice to be able to enrich our understanding of human evolution by finding these extremely rare objects,\u201d she added.",
      "Researchers have known that early human ancestors would have been also making use of wood to make tools and now there is evidence of very early use, she added.",
      "The tools were found at a site called the Megalopolis Basin in Marathousa, Greece, about 100 miles southwest of the capital, Athens.",
      "Once a lakeshore, it has provided evidence of other early human ancestor activity, including the making and use of stone and bone artifacts, as well as killing of elephants and other animals, according to researchers.",
      "The smaller tool is particularly interesting, Milks said. \u201cWe have never seen anything like it,\u201d she said, adding that they don't fully understand its function. \u201cIt\u2019s just really different, and it\u2019s tiny. We\u2019re lucky that we found it.\u201d",
      "Researchers know that these artifacts are not just pieces of wood by recognizing \u201cspecific marks made by stone tools on the wood itself,\u201d she said. This \u201chelps us to say, OK, that\u2019s not just a stick, that\u2019s something that humans did something with,\u201d she added.",
      "The methods for analysis and identification of ancient wooden tools have really accelerated in the last decade, providing an unprecedented insight into human history, Milks said.",
      "Direct dating of organic materials, like wood, only goes back to 50,000 years ago, so researchers had to rely on dating sediment and rocks from the site itself. This allowed them to conclude that the tools date back to 430,000 years ago.",
      "It\u2019s likely that the unearthed wooden tools were so well preserved because they were very rapidly buried in sediment that remained wet, and kept away from microorganisms that would eat wood away or rot it, Milks said.",
      "Conditions at the site where the tools were found are \u201cexceptional\u201d and allowed for preservation of delicate organic material, including wood but also seeds and leaves, Katerina Harvati, the study's co-author, said in an email Tuesday.",
      "The discovery highlights the importance of Greece and the Megalopolis Basin in particular for human evolution, said Harvati, a paleoanthropologist and expert in human evolution at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany. It provided \u201ca very rare glimpse\u201d into technology used by early human ancestors that researchers know almost nothing about, she said.",
      "\u201cThey not only push back the temporal timeframe of our knowledge on this technology and expand its geographic range, but also provide new information, in the form of a completely new type of tool, which we record here for the first time,\u201d she added.",
      "Maeve McHugh, associate professor in classical archaeology at England\u2019s University of Birmingham who was not involved in the study, told NBC News the findings are significant, providing an important \u201csnapshot\u201d into the early human ancestor activity that speaks to \u201chow our brains were developing\u201d in that time period.",
      "\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s a wooden object, an organic piece of material \u2014 it\u2019s very rare survival outside of very arid conditions like Egypt, and particularly that it\u2019s so old and so really at the beginning of human or early human history, I think it\u2019s very interesting and important,\u201d she said."

Styles will travel to Amsterdam, London, S\u00e3o Paulo, Mexico City, Melbourne and Sydney to perform, and will also play a whopping 30 shows as part of a residency at Madison Square Garden in New York City.",
      "But excitement to see the Grammy winner in person turned to frenzy when fans attempted to purchase presale tickets for the concerts. Those trying to access the American Express and artist presales posted screenshots on social media of them waiting in lengthy queues with over hundreds of thousands of fans hoping to score tickets.",

      "Another wrote, \u201c17,000 people in line for presale for a tour where people have to travel across the US because the artist is only playing one city. Concert culture has gotten out of hand and live music is no longer accessible to those who it is supposed to inspire.\u201d",

      "For some who managed to make it through the queue, the relief was short-lived when they were met with ticket prices exceeding $1,000. The AmEx presale featured platinum packages that accounted for some of the high prices.",
      "Fans in the queue for New York City tickets were given a message from Ticketmaster: \u201cUpdate: $50, $94.15 and $129.70 tickets are now limited, other options remain. Tickets for this event have been priced in advance by the tour from $50 \u2014 $1,184.40, including service fees. Ticket prices will not change during the presale or onsale.

      "As her athletic dreams take a different turn, she is faced with love, loss, addiction and self-destructive choices that eventually leads her to discover her voice and healing through writing.",
      "Stewart first encountered the memoir in 2017, she shared in a statement, \u201cAnd from the very first page I felt its electric current \u2014 this jagged, nonlinear journey through trauma and memory was unlike anything I\u2019d ever read.\u201d",
      "She noted that after 40 pages, she had \u201csuch a physical reaction that I put the book down, grabbed my phone, and told my team, \u2018I need to speak to the person who wrote this.\u2019\u201d",
      "What drew her to the story, Stewart said, was its fragmentation, explaining, \u201cYuknavitch doesn\u2019t give you a tidy narrative, but instead hands you the pieces of a life in shards, demanding you assemble them yourself. That act of reconstruction \u2014 of watching a story break and then choosing to stitch it back together \u2014 became the beating heart of why I knew this had to be my first film.\u201d",
      "In a December 2025 interview with Vogue, Yuknavitch shared that she had yet to see the movie but when she saw Poots as her \u201call the hairs on my body\u201d stood up.",

      "\u201cWhat swimming meant all through my adolescence was freedom from the house of father. All my mornings and afternoons were small salvations, all those hours and lap after lap away from home and family, two words that nearly killed me,\u201d she wrote in a personal essay for LitHub. \u201cI didn\u2019t care about winning medals or my team or even my name in lights on giant digitalized scoreboards. I cared about the away from him. I cared about how within water, a body could be a body, a body could even be, dare I think it, mine.\u201d",
      "She Was a Victim of Abuse",

      "Season 4 of \u201cThe Traitors\u201d is heating up as the trust between the Traitors becomes fractured and a devious twist is introduced that will send another innocent Faithful home.",
      "Episode 6 of the season, arriving on Peacock Jan. 22, opened with the cliffhanger from the previous episode being resolved. Fans learned if one of the players chose to take a shield in the most recent mission, which would allow the Traitors to commit another murder. But that was just a taste of all the drama that unfolded during the hour.",
      "By the end of the episode, the Faithfuls had planned a coup, and one Traitor decided to turn on another, leading to tension between the trio. Read on for a recap of Episode 6, including the introduction of the next murder in plain sight, below.",
      "Episode 6 \u2018Planning A Coup\u2019",
      "The episode picks up where the cliffhanger left off, with the players learning if a murder happened during the night. One by one, each player safely arrives at breakfast, confirming that no one took a shield during the previous mission. Viewers then see a flashback of the moment last night when host Alan Cumming informs the Traitors that they will not be able to commit a murder. In the turret, the Traitors \u2014 Lisa Rinna of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\u201d Candiace Dillard Bassett of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d and Rob Rausch of \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 6 \u2014 decide that they will banish comedian Ron Funches the next night and murder \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d star Colton Underwood since he suspected Rinna was a Traitor.",
      "After breakfast, Underwood continues to share his theory about Rinna being a Traitor, hoping to draw more suspicion toward her. But the rest of the players still believe that Funches is a Traitor. Meanwhile, Olympic figure skater Johnny Weir has another idea. He proposes that eight Faithfuls get together and form a group, ensuring they will have a majority at the next Round Table.",
      "In the car on the way to the mission, Underwood throws out Rinna\u2019s name again. He previously explained in his confessional that he wanted to say Rinna\u2019s name to as many players as possible to see who defends her. But Rausch, who was in the car with Underwood, realizes that a trap is being set and tells the group it is possible Rinna is a Traitor.",
      "When the group arrives at the mission, Cumming explains that there is $18,000 available to add to the prize pot. The mission is being held at the creepy cabin in the woods seen in previous seasons. The players have to enter the cabin and listen to a set of clues. Then, in pairs, they must run to a nearby gravesite and stand in front of the tombstone with the name of the person who matches the clues. One burial site has two shields, but if a duo takes them then they won\u2019t add gold to the prize pot.",
      "All the duos except Dillard Bassett and Olympic figure skater Tara Lipinski are correct with their guesses, banking $15,000 for the prize pot. At the end of the mission, Cumming informs the remaining three players that no one collected a shield.",
      "Back at the castle, Weir pitches his plan again to get eight players together and vote out Underwood. In the kitchen, Rausch tells a group that he doesn\u2019t believe Funches is a Traitor, confusing Dillard Bassett and Rinna because of the plan they discussed earlier in the episode.",
      "When Weir approaches Rausch and tries to include him in his group of eight, the Traitor senses that a coup is forming. (Hence, the title of the episode). Rausch panics because Underwood is a close ally but he also doesn\u2019t want to vote out Funches.",
      "In another room, Underwood pulls Rinna aside and attempts to execute a plan that he even acknowledges in his confessional \u201cmight be really, really dumb.\u201d \u201cInstead of trying to banish a Traitor, I\u2019m going to try to hold one hostage,\u201d he tells the cameras. He then informs Rinna that he will vote for Funches on one condition: \u201cI will protect you at the Round Table if you protect me in the turret.\u201d",
      "Rinna repeats that she is a Faithful and shuts down his plan for an alliance.",
      "\u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d pro Mark Ballas speaks up first at the Round Table and points out that Funches has been on the chopping block four days in a row. Funches pushes back, mentioning that other players have been wrong about their suspicions but he is the only person still being blamed for \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta\u201d star Porsha Williams being banished in Episode 2.",
      "\u201cTop Chef\u201d host Kristen Kish calls out Underwood next for wrongfully targeting \u201cBig Brother\u201d star Tiffany Mitchell. Weir agrees with her and adds that Underwood makes him \u201cfeel like a puppet.\u201d",
      "But, the conversation circles back to Funches. He says that if the other players think they will find clarity from voting him out, then so be it. He goes around the table and compliments everyone, which makes some of them doubt he is a Traitor.",
      "Underwood uses this opportunity to publicly call out Rinna. He lists his evidence, highlighting Rinna voting for Williams despite her being a fellow housewife. Rinna defends herself but some of the players seem convinced. In a confessional interview, Rausch says that this is a pivotal moment in the game and \u201ceverything is on the line.\u201d",
      "When it is Rausch\u2019s turn to vote, Funches leads with five votes and Rinna and Underwood are tied with four. Rausch says he trusts Underwood and believes Funches is a Faithful. So, he votes for Rinna, marking the first time this season a Traitor has betrayed one of their own. \u201cAs a Faithful, it is my job to get Traitors out of the game,\u201d he says.",
      "However, his plan backfires. Ballas casts the deciding vote for Funches which sends him home.",
      "\u201cThis was very hard for me,\u201d Funches says while standing on the Circle of Truth. \u201cI don\u2019t trust many people and I felt not trusted. And I understand that this road is completely fake so that probably makes it hard to see someone that\u2019s real. I always spoke my truth no matter what and that\u2019s why, again, inside and outside of this game, I am truly Faithful.\u201d",
      "Cumming says he feels \u201cdisappointment and dejection\u201d in the room after Funches\u2019 banishment. \u201cSo, I have something to rouse you from your melancholy,\u201d he announces. \u201cAs we have reached the halfway point of my wicked game tonight, I will be holding a great banquet in my castle hall. And I want you to drink, feast and celebrate life, the greatest gift of all. See you there.\u201d",
      "In their confessionals, Rinna says Rausch betrayed her and Dillard Bassett says he needs to explain his vote.",
      "Cumming speaks directly to the audience and admits he \u201chasn\u2019t been entirely honest with\u201d the players. The episode then flashes back, again, to the last meeting in the turret. Cumming informs the Traitors that they must commit their next murder \u201cin front of everyone.\u201d He presents them with a \u201ccursed amulet\u201d and says one of them must wear it to the banquet. The first Faithful who touches the jewel will be \u201ccursed to death.\u201d Cumming says, \u201cThis will be the toughest, most high stakes murder this castle has ever seen.\u201d Rinna decides she will be the one to wear the amulet and complete the task.",
      "Back to the fallout between the trio after the Round Table, the Traitors quietly meet in the kitchen. Rinna tells Rausch she doesn\u2019t trust him anymore. He explains that it would have looked suspicious to the other players if he voted for Underwood or Funches when it is publicly known how close he is to them.",
      "The episode ends with Rinna, Rausch and Dillard Bassett contemplating who will be their next victim. Episode 7, which will feature the extravagant banquet and the next murder, will be released Thursday, Jan. 27."

      "The meeting follows renewed outreach by Trump\u2019s circle: Russia requested a visit by special envoy Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin in Moscow on Wednesday alongside Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hopeful. ... We need a peace,\u201d Witkoff told reporters ahead of the meeting.",
      "On Monday, the Kremlin said the issue of territory remained fundamental to Russia, the state news agency Tass reported.",

      "Kyiv has repeatedly said it will not hand over territory that Moscow has not already won on the battlefield.",
      "Beyond Maduro",
      "After American special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, the Kremlin demanded their release and condemned what it said was an unacceptable attack on Venezuela\u2019s sovereignty.",
      "But Venezuela matters to Moscow for reasons that go far beyond Maduro.",
      "For Putin, the relationship has been a way to show that Russia is still a global power, not just a country boxed in by Europe. And under Putin\u2019s rule, Moscow has built deep energy and media ties in Caracas that helped it gain a rare foothold in America\u2019s backyard.",
      "Putin\u2019s aim has been \u201cto get out of this idea that Russia is just a regional power, trying to reinvigorate that kind of global or larger global reach that the Soviet Union had,\u201d said Fiona Hill, a former senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council.",
      "After Russia invaded Ukraine, sanctions pushed Moscow to rely on a rapidly growing \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of tankers to keep its own crude oil exports going.",
      "In recent weeks, U.S. forces have begun seizing vessels tied to that network in and around Venezuela as Washington tightens enforcement.",
      "Iran looms",
      "As the death toll from Iran\u2019s crackdown on nationwide unrest rose past at least 5,000, according to activists, Trump sent what he called an \u201carmada\u201d to the Middle East amid hints the U.S. could go beyond sanctions on the country and is considering strikes.",
      "Trump has been contemplating military action against Tehran after its massive crackdown on opposition to the clerical regime, which killed thousands of activists in the streets.",
      "Trump\u2019s plans on Iran matter to Putin because Tehran and the Kremlin have especially close ties that stretch back to the Soviet era. Iran sends drones to Russia that have been used in the war in Ukraine, while Moscow has supplied Iran with many of the weapons it has used to crush protests.",
      "\u201cPutin has a personal stake in ensuring that Iran does not fall,\u201d said Nicole Grajewski, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Paris-based think tank. \u201cIt would have a major impact on Russia.\u201d",
      "\u201cIran for Russia is on its southern periphery,\u201d she said in an interview. Putin deeply dislikes uprisings that overthrow leaders, she added.",
      "Russian oil",
      "Once rooted in Cold War-era defense ties, the Russia-India relationship weakened as the latter\u2019s economy and outlook shifted West and Moscow moved closer to Beijing, New Delhi\u2019s regional rival.",
      "While India did not endorse Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it became a major buyer of Russian oil, which was discounted on global markets because of international sanctions.",
      "Trump has retaliated to India\u2019s moves with secondary sanctions and threats of steep tariffs, among them a proposed 25% levy aimed at countries buying Russian crude.",
      "That squeezes Moscow, but it also hurts New Delhi.",
      "\u201cPutin probably loves the fact that Indians think of this 25% tariff as a U.S. sanction on India,\u201d said Tanvi Madan of the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cSo Russia uses this to say: \u2018Look, the U.S. and Europe are not your friends. They are sanctioning you. They are not reliable.\u2019\u201d",
      "Board of Peace",
      "Trump has offered Putin possible wins on the world stage, for example with an invitation to the Board of Peace. Putin is not the only autocrat to have been invited to join the organization, which was inaugurated Thursday in the Swiss city of Davos, but he is possibly its most controversial: Britain and France cited his participation in the organization as one of the reasons for not joining last week, among other concerns.",
      "\u201cPutin certainly is not a person to ask any questions about peace,\u201d Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen said in an interview this week.",
      "Aside from invading Ukraine, Putin has crushed free speech and political dissent within Russia. The West, led by the U.S., should be exerting more pressure on Russia, Valtonen said.",

      "\u201cI am a little bit fearful also of a future in which we try to rehabilitate Russia and Putin to the world community, especially if there were significant trade deals or the lifting of economic sanctions towards Russia, because, unfortunately, Russia\u2019s threat doesn\u2019t begin or it doesn\u2019t end in Ukraine,\u201d she said.",
      "Asked for comment Monday, the White House directed NBC News to an earlier Trump statement about Putin\u2019s joining the board \u201cWe want everybody. We want all nations. We want all nations where people have control, power,\u201d he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cThat way we\u2019re not ever going to have a problem.\u201d",
      "But Putin himself may have mixed feelings about Trump\u2019s apparently friendly invitation to join what has been described as an alternative to the United Nations since Russia has a permanent seat on the powerful U.N. Security Council. In contrast, the charter of the Board of Peace spells out that one person is fundamentally in charge: Trump, as chairman with a veto."

      "After 843 days and 12 hours, Israelis in \"Hostages Square\" marked the end of a crisis, opening a new chapter in a shaky ceasefire between the Israeli military and Hamas militants that has managed to endure for nearly four months.",
      "\u201cWe are here on a day we prayed for since Oct. 7 for 844 days. The clock kept running, counting every day, every minute, every second,\u201d said Malki Shem-Tov, the father of former captive Omer Shem-Tov, who spoke from the podium below the frozen clock. \u201cSince our worlds stopped on Oct. 7, we never imagined that clock would reach three digits. Thank God we can finally stop counting.\u201d",

      "Now, for the first time since 2014, there are no Israeli hostages in the Gaza Strip, Israeli President Isaac Herzog said.",

      "The earliest known hand-held wooden tools, used by our early human ancestors around 430,000 years ago, have been uncovered by researchers at an archeological site in Greece.",
      "One is made from the trunk of an alder tree and could have been used for digging, and the other is a small willow or poplar artifact that may have been used to shape stones, according to a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s particularly exciting about finds like this is that we just so rarely have wood preserved for that long,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Annemieke Milks, told NBC News by phone Tuesday.",
      "Stone tools have been recovered by archeologists for centuries because they preserve really well, said Milks, a researcher and a leading expert in early wooden tools at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. \u201cSo it\u2019s really nice to be able to enrich our understanding of human evolution by finding these extremely rare objects,\u201d she added.",
      "Researchers have known that early human ancestors would have been also making use of wood to make tools and now there is evidence of very early use, she added.",
      "The tools were found at a site called the Megalopolis Basin in Marathousa, Greece, about 100 miles southwest of the capital, Athens.",
      "Once a lakeshore, it has provided evidence of other early human ancestor activity, including the making and use of stone and bone artifacts, as well as killing of elephants and other animals, according to researchers.",
      "The smaller tool is particularly interesting, Milks said. \u201cWe have never seen anything like it,\u201d she said, adding that they don't fully understand its function. \u201cIt\u2019s just really different, and it\u2019s tiny. We\u2019re lucky that we found it.\u201d",
      "Researchers know that these artifacts are not just pieces of wood by recognizing \u201cspecific marks made by stone tools on the wood itself,\u201d she said. This \u201chelps us to say, OK, that\u2019s not just a stick, that\u2019s something that humans did something with,\u201d she added.",
      "The methods for analysis and identification of ancient wooden tools have really accelerated in the last decade, providing an unprecedented insight into human history, Milks said.",
      "Direct dating of organic materials, like wood, only goes back to 50,000 years ago, so researchers had to rely on dating sediment and rocks from the site itself. This allowed them to conclude that the tools date back to 430,000 years ago.",
      "It\u2019s likely that the unearthed wooden tools were so well preserved because they were very rapidly buried in sediment that remained wet, and kept away from microorganisms that would eat wood away or rot it, Milks said.",
      "Conditions at the site where the tools were found are \u201cexceptional\u201d and allowed for preservation of delicate organic material, including wood but also seeds and leaves, Katerina Harvati, the study's co-author, said in an email Tuesday.",
      "The discovery highlights the importance of Greece and the Megalopolis Basin in particular for human evolution, said Harvati, a paleoanthropologist and expert in human evolution at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany. It provided \u201ca very rare glimpse\u201d into technology used by early human ancestors that researchers know almost nothing about, she said.",
      "\u201cThey not only push back the temporal timeframe of our knowledge on this technology and expand its geographic range, but also provide new information, in the form of a completely new type of tool, which we record here for the first time,\u201d she added.",
      "Maeve McHugh, associate professor in classical archaeology at England\u2019s University of Birmingham who was not involved in the study, told NBC News the findings are significant, providing an important \u201csnapshot\u201d into the early human ancestor activity that speaks to \u201chow our brains were developing\u201d in that time period.",
      "\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s a wooden object, an organic piece of material \u2014 it\u2019s very rare survival outside of very arid conditions like Egypt, and particularly that it\u2019s so old and so really at the beginning of human or early human history, I think it\u2019s very interesting and important,\u201d she said."

      "The Chinese Defense Ministry said in a statement Saturday that Gen. Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, which controls the armed forces, was under investigation and accused of serious \u201cviolations of discipline and law.\u201d",
      "Liu Zhenli, another People\u2019s Liberation Army general and a lower member of the commission who was in charge of the Joint Staff Department, was also put under investigation, the ministry said.",
      "The statement gave no details about the allegations or the charges they faced. An editorial Sunday in the Liberation Army Daily newspaper, the mouthpiece of the country\u2019s armed forces, suggested that Zhang, 75, was accused of corruption and possibly disloyalty to Xi.",
      "Zhang and Liu, it said, \u201cseriously trampled on and undermined\u201d the system of responsibility under the military commission\u2019s chairman \u2014 Xi himself. The pair had also \u201cgravely fostered political and corruption problems that weakened the Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the military,\u201d it said, adding that that had \u201ccaused immense harm\u201d to China\u2019s combat readiness.",
      "Asked about Zhang at a regular briefing of reporters in Beijing, a Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson cited unfamiliarity with the matter. The page with Zhang\u2019s biography on the PLA\u2019s official website has been pulled down, suggesting he may have fallen out of favor.",
      "Zhang was previously considered \u201cuntouchable,\u201d according to Alessandro Arduino, an expert in Chinese security at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cThis is a reminder coming directly from President Xi Jinping that political loyalty stands well before combat readiness,\u201d he said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cPolitical disloyalty is a cardinal sin inside the party. And the message is clear: It\u2019s a political accusation. I think the message is extremely clear: No one is safe.\u201d",
      "Xi could have let Zhang, 75, retire to save face, he said, adding that that was \u201cvery important in China.\u201d Instead, Xi had allowed \u201ca huge political accusation\u201d to be leveled against his longtime ally, Arduino said.",
      "China\u2019s military has undergone a sweeping anti-corruption purge in recent years, in which People\u2019s Liberation Army generals, admirals, government ministers and other officials have been removed from their posts.",
      "Since he came to power in 2012, Xi has launched a variety of anti-corruption drives through various government departments.",
      "More recently the focus has been on the armed forces. In October, the ruling Communist Party expelled He Weidong, the other vice chair of the military commission, and replaced him with commission member Zhang Shengmin. And in 2024, the party expelled two former defense ministers over corruption charges.",
      "But some analysts see the removal of Zhang, a longtime confidant of Xi and a combat veteran of China\u2019s 1979 conflict with Vietnam, as the most significant ouster yet, one that will create a major upheaval at the top of China\u2019s military power structure.",
      "\u201cThis is really almost Shakespearean,\" said Jonathan Czin, a former senior CIA analyst who focused on China and is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank.",
      "He added, \"This is somebody that Xi has had a decadeslong relationship with.\u201d",
      "Of the six generals Xi appointed to the commission in 2022, only one is left, allowing Xi to consolidate power but also heightening the risk of a military miscalculation when it comes to Taiwan, according Steve Tsang, the director of the China Institute at SOAS University of London.",
      "\u201cRemoving generals like Zhang means that there will not be any general who would dare to advise Xi against a military adventure when the time comes, and this increases the risk of a miscalculation,\u201d he said in an email Monday.",
      "Xi has long harbored ambitions of reuniting Taiwan, the self-ruled territory of 23 million people, with China, and his military regularly launches live-fire drills around the island, featuring aircraft and warships.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Officials in Taipei are closely watching what they have called \u201cabnormal\u201d changes to China\u2019s military leadership and will use a range of methods to decipher Beijing\u2019s intentions, Taiwanese Defense Minister Wellington Koo said Monday.",
      "\u201cXi will not order an invasion unless he is certain of victory, but no general will now dare to advise caution if Xi asks: \u2018Is the PLA now ready to liberate Taiwan for the greater glory of China?\u2019\u201d Tsang said, adding that the world was \u201cless safe\u201d after Zhang\u2019s removal.",

      "His successor \u201cwill show what is going to look like a PLA that is first and foremost politically aligned with the party and, by definition, with President Xi himself,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cSick,\u201d Honnold said as he stood at the top spire of the building and waved his arms to those watching below. The event was livestreamed on Netflix with a 10-second delay so the public could closely follow his daring leaps and no-hands holds. The live broadcast of a potentially life-threatening stunt has drawn both excitement and concerns over its ethical implications.",

      "He also had to scale the building\u2019s overhanging structures that resemble \u201cbamboo boxes\u201d on his way up. \u201cBecause it overhangs, it\u2019s more physically demanding. It\u2019s just a little bit tiring. And it\u2019s just, yes, the hardest moves on the climb,\u201d Honnold said."

      "A spokesperson for the WHO said members of its executive board would discuss how to handle the U.S. withdrawal at their meeting next month. Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week that the withdrawal would make both the U.S. and the rest of the world less safe.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really the right decision. I want to say it bluntly,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "Rubio and Kennedy said the U.S. would continue to lead the world in public health, and that it would work with countries and \u201ctrusted health institutions\u201d using a more transparent model that \u201cdelivers real outcomes rather than the bloated and inefficient bureaucracy of the WHO.\u201d",
      "In a call with reporters earlier Thursday, HHS officials provided no details about whether those institutions have the laboratory credentials necessary for surveillance of emerging diseases.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done an analysis. We have plans in place,\u201d said one of the officials, whom HHS did not allow to speak on the record.",
      "Infectious disease experts warned that the exit from WHO is likely to leave dangerous blind spots in disease surveillance and preparedness \u2014 particularly when it comes to one of the most vexing and deadly illnesses the U.S. encounters every year: the flu.",
      "The break-up comes ahead of an annual meeting the WHO convened to discuss which flu strains vaccine manufacturers should include in next season\u2019s shots. The U.S. has long played a major role in the meeting.",
      "HHS officials declined to say whether the U.S. will participate in the meeting, scheduled for Feb. 27.",
      "The U.S. is in the middle of a nasty flu season. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 18 million people have been sickened so far and that nearly 10,000 people, including 32 children, have died.",
      "Jesse Bump, a global public health expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, called the administration\u2019s action \u201can act of monumental stupidity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe reason this matters, in the most immediate sense, is that WHO has a network of 127 laboratories all around the world, and those laboratories detect and sequence flu strains,\u201d Bump said. \u201cWHO is sort of like a library, and the U.S. has had a card to walk right in, get the information you want. We no longer have access. We don\u2019t have that library card.\u201d",
      "Dr. Judd Walson, chair of the department of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said it\u2019s extraordinarily difficult to compare infectious disease notes between countries without a unifying group like WHO.",
      "\u201cIf you have a big surge in a particular disease like flu in country A and you don\u2019t see it in country B but they\u2019re using different diagnostics, they\u2019re sampling different populations, it\u2019s impossible to make those comparisons,\u201d Walson said.",
      "Such surveillance is particularly useful when it comes to flu strains that pop up, like the H3N2 subclade K strain that has dominated the spread of flu so far this year.",
      "The exit from WHO has been in the works since the first Trump administration. As the coronavirus pandemic took hold in April 2020, Trump accused the WHO of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the crisis \u2014 specifically the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China.",
      "Rubio and Kennedy echoed those accusations in their statement Thursday, saying the WHO \u201cobstructed the timely and accurate sharing of critical information that could have saved American lives.\u201d",
      "They also said the WHO had refused to return the U.S. flag hanging outside its headquarters in Geneva, \u201carguing it has not approved our withdrawal and, in fact, claims that we owe it compensation.\u201d",
      "The WHO says the U.S., traditionally its biggest financial contributor, has not paid the $260 million in fees it owes for 2024 and 2025, in violation of U.S. law.",
      "Stephanie Psaki, a distinguished senior fellow at the Brown University School of Public Health who was coordinator for global health security during the Biden administration, said she\u2019s concerned that pulling out of the WHO will leave the U.S. more vulnerable than even before the pandemic.",
      "\u201cThese decisions are not being made based on a strategy or a plan to protect Americans. They\u2019re being made, it seems to me, based on frustrations or vendettas from six years ago,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cThat is scary.\u201d"
