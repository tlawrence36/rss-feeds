      "Anthony Roth Costanzo, who introduced $11 tickets to Opera Philadelphia, aims to surprise audiences again with the company\u2019s new season as it celebrates its 50th anniversary",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Anthony Roth Costanzo, the man who brought $11 opera tickets to Philadelphia, hopes to keep surprising audiences during the company\u2019s new season.",
      "\u201cIt is very much opera. It\u2019s dramatic, it\u2019s cathartic, it\u2019s collaborative in interdisciplinary ways,\u201d Costanzo said of Opera Philadelphia\u2019s 50th anniversary season \u2014 the first he\u2019s been able to plan since taking charge of the financially teetering company last year. \u201cBut it\u2019s different from what your perception of opera might be.\u201d",
      "He slated a work by Rossini to kick things off, with opening night set for Friday. But instead of choosing a repertory staple, Costanzo picked the less-familiar \u201cIl viaggio a Reims.\u201d And the production will be anything but traditional: Director Damiano Michieletto has changed the original setting from an inn to an art gallery where the portraits come alive and sing.",
      "After that the offerings become even more adventurous. There\u2019s a multimedia piece by playwright Sarah Ruhl set to music by Vivaldi \u2014 including \u201cThe Seasons\u201d \u2014 and starring Costanzo, who maintains a flourishing performing career as a countertenor. Then comes a world premiere with libretto by Pulitzer-winner Michael R. Jackson and a score by 10 different composers. Another new opera follows, by Gregory Spears, in which the chorus has the starring role. Finally, bass-baritone Dav\u00f3ne Tines performs a \u201cvaudevillian rendering\u201d of a poem by Langston Hughes.",
      "\u201cAs I put all of the pieces together, I thought, how can I encapsulate this in just a few simple words,\u201d Costanzo said. \u201cAnd what occurred to me was: \u2018Opera, but different.\u2019 And that is the slogan of the season.\u201d",
      "His pride in the lineup is understandable, especially given that when he took over it wasn\u2019t certain there would even be a 2025-26 season.",
      "The company was nearing bankruptcy and needed to quickly raise $4 million, he recalled.",
      "Almost immediately he instituted a \u201cpick your price\u201d policy under which people could buy tickets to any seat in the house starting at $11. (The website gives buyers a range of higher options and invites them to make a donation on top of the purchase. Season subscriptions at higher prices are also still available.)",
      "\u201cI said OK, I have to think like a venture capitalist,\u201d Costanzo said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to spend money to make money. Besides, he said, the old pricing system was projected to bring in only 8% of the revenue the company needed, so little was at risk from the new policy.",
      "The publicity and good will generated by the move helped the company quickly raise $7 million in donations, more than enough to retire the debt. When tickets went on sale for 2024-25, all three operas sold out within three weeks, and the season ended with a surplus of $2.4 million.",
      "Corrado Rovaris, the company\u2019s longtime music director, was on the podium for the season-opening performance last fall of Missy Mazzoli\u2019s \u201cThe Listeners,\u201d a recent work having its U.S. premiere.",
      "\u201cIt was amazing to see the reaction in the house,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBeautiful to see a full house but also to see such an enthusiastic house. Beautiful and very moving.\u201d",

      "Helen Little of New York City is one opera lover who was inspired by Costanzo\u2019s pricing initiative to help the company financially.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant idea,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause the tickets only cover a fraction of the cost of an opera. But the whole point is to spread good will, bring in new people, bring in young people, people who have never been to an opera. And good will is priceless.\u201d",
      "In a good portent for the growth of the company\u2019s audience, two-thirds of those who chose the \u201cpick your price option\u201d had never bought tickets to Opera Philadelphia before, and most were under 45 years old. This year a similar percentage are either first-timers or repeats from last season.",
      "As a result of the brighter financial outlook, the new season offers twice as many performances as last, though the budget is still substantially lower than it was in 2017, when the company launched an adventurous festival format that had several different works in performance over a period of two weeks.",
      "Just how did Costanzo settle on that $11 figure?",
      "\u201cAt first I thought it should be $25,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the problem is that everywhere across the country I see \u2018tickets starting at $25\u2026\u2019 and I thought people would see that and think, Oh, yeah, you can sit up in the top balcony.",
      "\u201cSo I wanted to really distinguish it, and I thought a round number was less sticky \u2026 you don\u2019t remember $15 or $10.\u201d",
      "Marc Scorca, president and CEO of Opera America, said he\u2019s watching the company\u2019s initiatives with great interest, but he cautions that it\u2019s too soon to predict long-term victory.",
      "\u201cI appreciate that they\u2019ve jumped into this with both feet,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you need to have your back against the wall to take a bold experiment.",
      "\u201cI think the learning from it will be important not only to the company but to the field,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAnd that will probably not play out for another couple of years until we see how much of that audience becomes a bona fide public for the company or just took advantage of an opportunity to experiment with something at a low price.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- When it was all over, Kamala Harris couldn't believe it. \u201cI could barely breathe,\u201d she writes in her new book about learning she had lost the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump.",
      "One of her aides peeled \u201cMadame President\u201d off celebratory cupcakes before serving them to crushed staffers. Harris kept asking, \u201cMy God, my God, what will happen to our country?\"",
      "The next morning was no easier. \u201cI was ashamed to realize I was in the denial and bargaining stages of grief, a very long way from acceptance,\u201d she wrote.",
      "It's one of several raw admissions in Harris' book, \u201c107 Days,\u201d that is scheduled for release Tuesday. The title refers to the length of the hyperspeed campaign that the former vice president launched against Trump after Joe Biden dropped out of the race.",
      "Although Harris earned a reputation as guarded and circumspect, the book has the tone of someone who is finished biting her tongue. She concedes mistakes, reveals frustrations and details some of the stranger moments from her race.",
      "The book isn't a winding memoir or a political treatise, and Harris doesn't disclose any future plans. Instead, it reads like a ticking time bomb, with each chapter counting down to Election Day.",
      "Here's some memorable moments.",
      "Harris insists in the book that she had no concerns about Biden's ability to serve as president. \u201cIf I believed that, I would have said so.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut at eighty-one, Joe got tired,\" Harris wrote. \"That's when his age showed in physical and verbal stumbles.\u201d",
      "Harris wrote that Biden's inner circle \u201cshould have realized that any campaign was a bridge too far.\" However, \u201cit seemed that the worse things got, the more they pushed him.\u201d",
      "The tenuous situation unraveled when Biden and Trump faced off with each other. \u201cAs soon as he walked onto the debate stage in Atlanta, I could see he wasn't right,\" Harris wrote.",
      "Biden's team appeared to be in denial. Afterward, they gave Harris talking points that said \u201cJOE BIDEN WON.\"",
      "Harris wrote warmly of her partnership with Biden, but there were frosty moments too. As Biden faced calls to drop out of the race, he invited Harris to join him for a Fourth of July celebration at the White House.",
      "First lady Jill Biden pulled Harris' husband Doug Emhoff aside. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you supporting us?\u201d",

      "\u201cIf you want to put me in the strongest position, you have to endorse me now,\" she recalled telling him. Harris prevailed, and the endorsement happened shortly after Biden announced that he was done.",
      "Campaigns can be hallucinatory affairs, and this one was full of bizarre moments.",
      "Harris writes that she warmed up for her convention speech with a professional voice coach who \u201cwanted me to stand there and emit animal noises.\u201d A little hesitant, Harris got her entire team to make \u201chums, grunts and trills\" with her.",
      "Harris also writes about talking with Trump after a second assassination attempt against him. Despite tearing into her on the campaign trail, Trump proceeded to flatter his opponent.",
      "\u201cHow do I say bad things about you now?\u201d he said. \u201cI'm going to tone it down. I will. You're going to see.\u201d Then Trump said that his daughter Ivanka \u201cis your big fan.\u201d",
      "When the call was over, Harris was left marveling at Trump's ability to turn on the charm. \u201cHe's a con man,\u201d she thought. \u201cHe's really good at it.\u201d",

      "A regal celebration would be fitting for a singular act of her eminence, but to the delight of adoring subjects, there's even more fanfare to bestow. \u201cThe Queens: 4 Legends. 1 Stage.\u201d tour features LaBelle with fellow music legends Chaka Khan, Stephanie Mills and Gladys Knight, 81. The second leg of their royal concert processional kicks off Friday in Greensboro , North Carolina.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re coming to the four of us and loving what they see because we\u2019ve not stopped. We\u2019re phenomenally into what we do. There\u2019s no pretending,\u201d said LaBelle, the \u201cLady Marmalade\u201d and \u201cIf Only You Knew\u201d singer-actor, noting a tour with a collection of this much prestige is unprecedented. \u201cTo come back with the Queen\u2019s tour, it\u2019s just beautiful.\u201d",
      "The first leg of the tour \u2014 produced by Black Promoters Collective \u2014 ran from May through June. Arenas were treated to megahits like Khan\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Every Woman\u201d and \u201cSweet Thing,\u201d Knight\u2019s \u201cMidnight Train to Georgia\u201d and \u201cNeither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye),\u201d Mills\u2019 \u201cHome\u201d and \u201cNever Knew Love Like This Before,\u201d as well as LaBelle\u2019s \u201cThe Right Kinda Lover\u201d and \u201cYou Are My Friend.\u201d",
      "A rotating stage transitions each 45-minute set into the next performance, introducing each artist to their wide cross-section of concertgoers, which often includes multiple generations: parents, grandparents and even great-grandparents. Individually, the impact of Khan, Knight, LaBelle and Mills within the music industry and pop culture can\u2019t be quantified, with fans and critics praising them for never abandoning soul music or their Black audience.",
      "\u201cI hear it all the time. You know, \u2018I was weaned on you,\u2019 from mother to grandmother on down. It\u2019s lovely to hear,\u201d Khan, 72, told The Associated Press in a joint interview with LaBelle and Mills. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can\u2019t grasp the feeling that they\u2019re feeling, but I get it \u2014 I think. And I think it\u2019s pretty special.\u201d",
      "At 17 years old, Mills originated the role of Dorothy in \u201cThe Wiz,\u201d which debuted on Broadway 50 years ago. Now, 68, the Grammy winner affectionally known as \u201cthe baby\u201d by her co-headliners, says there\u2019s no need to slow down.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in the blood. What would we do? Sit at home and not do anything?\u201d said Mills, who hopes for another Broadway stint in the near future. \u201cI was 11 my first Broadway show. So, I\u2019ve been in the business my entire life.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt (New York Historical) has been a very integral element of my life since I was a little boy,\" Caro said Wednesday night during his brief remarks as he accepted the first-ever Historians' Laureate Medal in the organization's 221 year-old existence.",

      "\u201cAnd in a way, as I stand here before you tonight, I have this wonderful feeling that my life has come full circle, in a wonderful circle,\" he said, speaking to hundreds gathered for The New York Historical's \u201cHistory Makers Gala.\u201d",
      "Caro, who turns 90 next month and is still working on the long-awaited fifth Johnson book, has for years been the unofficial laureate of The New York Historical. His career is the subject of a permanent exhibition, his archives are stored there and a research room is named for him. He was introduced at the ceremony by a close friend, singer Judy Collins, who cited Caro's musical approach to his writing, his attention to rhythm and mood.",

      "\u201cHim\u201d has a decent point to make about QB hero worship: These are modern gladiators",
      "American society probably puts more pressure on producing a good quarterback than anything else, which makes it all the more confounding that the Jets can never have one.",
      "OK, OK. So that\u2019s not necessarily the takeaway from \u201cHim,\u201d a new horror thriller about the religious fervor that goes with football. For some of us long-suffering fans, football inspires less Messianic zeal than an annual reminder that this is a dark and cruel world and any delusional preseason hope will be quickly and thoroughly snuffed out.",
      "But Jets fan or not, \u201cHim\u201d has a decent point to make about QB hero worship. These are modern gladiators. But if the issue of some thrillers is that they have nothing to say, the problem with \u201cHim\u201d is that it has exactly one thing to say, which it does again and again and again.",
      "\u201cHim\u201d does have some style, though. Directed by Justin Tipping (\u201cKicks\u201d) and produced by Jordan Peele, \u201cHim\u201d was made with the potent premise of bringing the kind of dark, satirical perspective that characterizes a Monkeypaw production to our violent national pastime. But that promise gets fumbled in an allegorical chamber play that grows increasingly tedious.",
      "Cameron \u201cCam\u201d Cade grew up idolizing Saviors quarterback Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans). As a boy, he watches White win a game on a highlight-reel play that also leaves the QB with a career-threatening injury. \u201cThat\u2019s what real men do,\u201d his father (Don Benjamin) tells him. \u201cThey make sacrifices.\u201d",
      "Fourteen years later, Cam (Tyriq Withers) is on the cusp of entering the pros as a top draft pick. Just before the combine, though, Cam, while practicing alone at night, is struck in the head by a strange pagan spirit-slash-mascot that emerges out of the shadows. The trauma to the head adds a new risk to Cam\u2019s football playing. But if you\u2019re expecting a horror version of 2015\u2019s \u201cConcussion,\u201d that\u2019s a small part of what \u201cHim\u201d aspires to be about.",

      "But what follows over seven days is less a boot camp than a disorienting psychodrama -- a kind of football ayahuasca \u2014 in which the very intense Isaiah pushes Cam to extremes to test whether he has it in him to be the GOAT. The atmosphere is surreal and the editing hallucinatory. Cam is injected with unknown serums, blood gets transfused and pocket-passing drills turn grisly. This is not a game, Cam is told more than once. To paraphrase Dani Rojas, football is life (and maybe death, too).",
      "By settling the movie into Isaiah\u2019s Brutalist estate, \u201cHim\u201d take what could have been something grander and turns into effectively into a battle for QB1 \u2014 albeit one with more primal underpinnings than your average depth-chart contest.",
      "But it\u2019s probably a bad sign for your satire if you have to take reality completely out of it and instead hole up inside a haunted house. There are a few folks around, including Isaiah\u2019s influencer wife (Julia Fox), but somewhere far outside of the frame of \u201cHim\u201d is an enormous football world of arenas, screaming fans and broadcasters \u2014 the world that a movie like \u201cAny Given Sunday\u201d rushed to capture, not evade. \u201cHim\u201d ends up feeling like a gladiator movie that forgot the Colosseum.",

      "Robert Redford was disillusioned with the Hollywood mainstream. The Sundance Kid, who died Tuesday at age 89, knew that there were more stories out there, ones that weren\u2019t getting made into films because of the rigidity of the business. So he made something different, founding Sundance Institute and the Sundance Film Festival as an alternative avenue for emerging filmmakers, where independence was a virtue, not a liability.",

That\u2019s what led to me eventually wanting to create a category that supported independent artists who weren\u2019t given a chance to be heard,\u201d Redford told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe industry was pretty well controlled by the mainstream, which I was a part of. But I saw other stories out there that weren\u2019t having a chance to be told and I thought, \u2018Well, maybe I can commit my energies to giving those people a chance.\u2019 As I look back on it, I feel very good about that.\u201d",
      "In 2019, Redford said he intended to step back from his public facing role at the festival, though he remained the organization's president and founder until his death.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re at a point where I can move on to a different place, because the thing I\u2019ve missed over the years is being able to spend time with the films and with the filmmakers and to see their work and be part of their community,\u201d he said at the 2019 kickoff. \u201cI don\u2019t think the festival needs a whole lot of introduction now: It runs on its own course, and I\u2019m happy for that.\u201d",
      "Redford\u2019s love affair with Utah began much earlier, on a cross-country motorcycle road trip in 1961 when he bought 2 acres of land. By 1969, with more money in his pocket from his film successes, he\u2019d purchased 5,000 acres, some of which was a mountain resort but most of the land was for wilderness preserves. He named it Sundance, after his character in \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d",
      "In 1981, the year he won best picture and director for \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d he established the Sundance Institute, a nonprofit organization and held the first filmmakers lab at the Sundance Mountain Resort, about 13 miles northeast of Provo. A few years later, in 1985, the institute took over what was then known as the U.S. Film Festival, which would later be renamed the Sundance Film Festival. The festival in the mid-80s hosted the Coen brothers \u201cBlood Simple\u201d and Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u201cStranger Than Paradise.\u201d",
      "The festival was really put on the map when Soderbergh premiered \u201csex, lies and videotape\u201d in Park City in 1989. A true indie, the film went on to win the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes and get an Oscar nomination, but it was its box office success that ignited a veritable indie film boom. And Sundance was where all the discoveries were happening. In 1991, the festival premiered \u201cDaughters of the Dust,\u201d \u201cParis is Burning\u201d and \u201cSlacker,\u201d in 1992, Tarantino\u2019s \u201cReservoir Dogs,\u201d in 1993, Wes Anderson brought \u201cBottle Rocket,\u201d and in 1994 \u201cHoop Dreams\u201d and \u201cClerks.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Robert Redford, independent art houses might not have succeeded,\u201d said Gary Meyer, cofounder of Landmark Theatre, and a former festival director at Telluride who also worked with Redford. \u201cHaving the \u2018Sundance Kid\u2019 give his stamp of approval to independent features and documentaries brought audiences to our theaters, while helping launch the careers of dozens of filmmakers \u2026 He made it \u2018cool\u2019 to see adventurous movies when they came to commercial neighborhood theaters.\u201d",
      "In 1994, the Sundance Institute also made a commitment to Indigenous filmmakers by launching a festival program to showcase Native and Indigenous films that continues to this day.",
      "The festival might get the most headlines, but it\u2019s the year-round work of the Institute that has really left a mark on independent cinema. The screenwriting and directing labs have been just as, if not more, influential in helping to launch the first films of many of Hollywood\u2019s top filmmakers over the past 40 years, under the leadership of Michelle Satter, who has helped shepherd projects from \u201cHard Eight\u201d to \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d and \u201cLove & Basketball.\u201d",
      "\u201cSundance changed the trajectory of my career,\u201d filmmaker and labs adviser Gina Prince-Bythewood told the AP in 2023. \u201cHow many of these special projects would have never seen the light of day without Michelle, without Robert Redford\u2019s vision, without this incredible place? It\u2019s actually really scary to think about.\u201d",
      "Native filmmaker Sterlin Harjo (\u201cRez Ball\u201d) said that his career as a young man was defined by Redford\u2019s support for independent cinema and supporting Native storytelling.",

      "Redford had worried for years that the festival had outgrown Park City, Utah. In 1996, an estimated 15,504 attended the festival. In 2015, the number had ballooned to 46,100. It peaked in 2018 with 124,900 festivalgoers. The festival estimated that the 2025 edition had 85,472 in-person attendees, a 17% increase from 2024.",

It\u2019s \u201ca lot to process, going from a legacy that was alive in him to one we have to carry on,\u201d Cooper told the AP. That legacy, he said, centers on spreading the power of storytelling.",

      "NEW YORK -- Born during the Great Depression with sun-kissed California looks, Robert Redford never failed to epitomize something quintessential and hopeful about the American character.",
      "Redford, who died Tuesday at the age of 89, left a movie trail etched into land. He seemed to reside as much across the American landscape as he did on movie screens. He was in the Rocky Mountains of \u201cJeremiah Johnson,\u201d the Wyoming grasslands of \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\u201d the Washington, D.C., alleyways of \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d and the Montana streams of \u201cA River Runs Through It.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the time I was just a kid, I was always trying to break free of the bounds that I was stuck with, and always wanted to go outside,\u201d Redford told The Associated Press in 2018.",
      "Redford, a movie-star paragon, was surely savvy with how he played with and used his all-American image. No one who starred in the baseball drama \u201cThe Natural\u201d (1984) and gave Bernard Malamud\u2019s novel a storybook ending couldn't have some sense of self-mythology. But it was one of Redford\u2019s greatest feats that, despite his fame, he remained innately connected to some aspirational American ideal. Redford, an open-air actor of easy, rugged charm, evoked the kind of regular guy decency that stars like Jimmy Stewart did before him \u2014 only Redford did it through an era of distrust and disillusionment.",
      "\u201cHe was to me a throwback to the actors that I was nuts about when I was growing up and going to movies: real, classical, traditional, old-fashioned movie stars who were very, very redolent of some kind of American essence,\u201d said Sydney Pollack, who directed Redford in \u201cJeremiah Johnson,\u201d \u201cThe Way We Were\u201d and \u201cThree Days of the Condor,\u201d in 1993. \u201cThey were very much a part of the American landscape and they were heroic in a kind of understated way.\u201d",
      "That was most true, perhaps, in Utah. Wanting to escape paved-over Los Angeles, Redford first began buying land there early in his career. In Utah, he would fight to protect both untrampled wilderness and a spirit of moviemaking that had grown increasingly difficult in Hollywood. As a longtime trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group, Redford was an outspoken environmentalist. In the 1970s, he successfully opposed a pair of rural Utah proposals: a six-lane highway and coal-fired power plant.",
      "In the Utah mountains, Redford also launched the Sundance Institute. Beyond Sundance's annual festival for independent film, the institute has been a lifeblood young filmmakers. Its year-round laboratory \u2014 the part of Sundance that Redford was most proud of \u2014 has helped nurture some of the most vital voices in American cinema for decades.",
      "\u201cFor me, the word to be underscored is \u2018independence,\u2019\u201d Redford once said of his legacy. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed in that word. That\u2019s what led to me eventually wanting to create a category that supported independent artists who weren\u2019t given a chance to be heard. The industry was pretty well controlled by the mainstream, which I was a part of. But I saw other stories out there that weren\u2019t having a chance to be told.\u201d",
      "That spirit of independence often infused his films, too. When Redford wanted to make \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d the seminal 1976 film directed by Alan Pakula about Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein\u2019s Watergate investigation, few in the film industry thought there was much drama to be found in a story that was then several years old.",
      "\u201cNixon had already resigned, and the held opinion (in Hollywood) was \u2018No one cares. No one wants to hear about this,\u2019\u201d Redford, who also co-produced the film, said in 2006. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018No, it\u2019s not about Nixon. It\u2019s about something else. It\u2019s about investigative journalism and hard work.\u2019\u201d",
      "If \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d one of the greatest newspaper movies, detailed the hard-earned revelations of Watergate, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d \u2014 one of the greatest political thrillers \u2014 captured the paranoia and disillusionment that followed. If anyone was completely unfamiliar with why Redford was so good, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d would be a good place to start.",

No one has ever been better at playing the regular guy trying to think fast on his feet, and make sense of an ever-darker world.",
      "Though some called for him to, Redford never entered politics, himself. He remained outspoken \u2014 he's in some way the model for the modern Hollywood activist \u2014 on a wide range of issues, including Indigenous and LGBTQ+ rights. The closest he came to running for office was Michael Ritchie's 1972 satire \u201cThe Candidate,\u201d in which Redford played an idealistic lawyer enlisted to challenge a highly favored incumbent Republican senator. Redford\u2019s candidate ultimately wins, but not without sacrificing his principles and seeing much of what he stands for diluted.",
      "Redford\u2019s place, instead, was outside politics. The perfect bookend to his \u201970s movies is \u201cSneakers,\u201d Phil Alden Robinson\u2019s absurdly underrated 1992 caper starring Redford as a former \u201960s radical now living under a false moniker and leading a band of security specialists. They stumble into possession of a computer device that brings the attention of the NSA, CIA, FBI and many others, forcing Redford to, yet again, try to figure out what\u2019s moral in a dangerous (and now newly digital) America.",
      "The world that Redford\u2019s films often presciently depicted seemed to push him further into the wilderness, on screen and off. He largely retreated into retirement over the last decade. When Redford died, he was at his home in the Utah mountains, outside Provo. One of his last films was 2015's \u201cA Walk in the Woods,\u201d playing Bill Bryson ambling along the Appalachian Trail.",
      "The most fitting and elegiac swan song, though was J.C. Chandor\u2019s \u201cAll Is Lost,\u201d a near-wordless 2013 drama about an old man at sea. Redford plays a solo mariner whose sailboat collides with a shipping container. Though terse, the movie reverberates with economic and ecological metaphor. A visibly older and weathered Redford \u2014 no longer the golden, freckled face of his youth \u2014 suffers through increasingly rough and stormy seas, improvising his survival.",
      "For an actor who had covered so much ground, \u201cAll Is Lost\u201d was one last frontier. Redford's unnamed character was credited only as \u201cOur Man.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Major League Baseball has abandoned plans to play two games in London next season because of scheduling issues with West Ham's Olympic Stadium and the sport's television partner.",
      "MLB had hoped to have the New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays meet in London on June 13 and 14, but West Ham is home for its Premier League finale against Leeds on May 24. That left too little time to convert the field to baseball, and MLB was unable to schedule games there for later in June because Fox lacked available broadcast slots due to World Cup commitments.",
      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday after his question-and-answer session at Front Office Sports' \u201cTuned In\u201d event that the London games were definitely off.",
      "MLB played in London for the first time in 2019 when the New York Yankees swept two games from the Boston Red Sox.

It\u2019s a much better ballpark now than it was due to their willingness to make investments in that. We continue to believe that there\u2019s an opportunity there and that we can get at the developed economies in Europe through that London entree.\u201d",

My prediction is there will be some of the more media companies \u2014 the streamers will be really interested in the ability to get access to well-developed economies where they don\u2019t have as much penetration as they do in countries like the United States and Canada.

      "Playwright David Bar Katz is helping artists facing financial stress through The Relentless Award, the largest annual cash prize in American theater",
      "NEW YORK -- Many times in his life, playwright David Bar Katz didn't know how he was going to pay the bills. These days, he's helping the next generation of artists facing that same dilemma.",
      "Katz oversees The Relentless Award, the largest annual cash prize in American theater to a playwright in recognition of a new play. It's celebrating its 10th anniversary this year and, as always, seeking submissions that \u201cexhibit fearlessness.\u201d The award also honors musical theater.",
      "\u201cBeing able to create under financial stress is so difficult, and so anything we can do to give artists a little breathing room is what we want,\u201d says Katz.",
      "The award was inspired by Katz's friend and collaborator Philip Seymour Hoffman, the late actor who was described as relentless in his pursuit of truth in his art. A musical theater honor was added after the 2020 death of another of Katz's friends, Fountains of Wayne co-founder Adam Schlesinger.",
      "\u201cTo me, a big aspect of the award \u2014 the musical and the straight play \u2014 is not merely honoring Phil and Adam, but the idea of expanding their artistic legacies,\u201d says Katz.",
      "Some of the plays that have been recognized have gone on to great success, like Aleshea Harris\u2019 2016 winner \u201cIs God Is,\u201d which has been made into a movie starring Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Vivica A. Fox, Sterling K. Brown and Kara Young.",
      "\u201cAlicia typifies the whole point of the award,\u201d says Katz. \u201cI think at a moment in her life where she, like so many of us other artists, had kind of had it, she won the award and that was incredibly meaningful in her career.\u201d",
      "Other successes include Sarah DeLappe\u2019s \u201cThe Wolves\u201d and Clare Barron\u2019s \u201cDance Nation\u201d \u2014 joint winners in 2015 \u2014 who have gone on to become Pulitzer Prize finalists. \u201cThe impact, especially of those three plays, has been profound in theater,\u201d Katz says.",
      "The musical and the playwriting honors alternate each year. The winner this year is Jack D. Coen, who created the musical comedy \u201cJo Jenkins Before the Galactic Court of Consciousness.\u201d",
      "Cohen will receive $65,000 and his musical \u2014 as well as the works of the finalists \u2014 will be honored at a ceremony and performance on Oct. 12 at Building for the Arts\u2019 multi-theater complex, Theatre Row. Chris Collingwood, of Fountains of Wayne, will be performing as well.",

      "The play \u201cArt\u201d returns to Broadway with a fresh revival and a starry cast",
      "For evidence of how high inflation has gotten, look no further than Broadway. The fancy painting at the heart of the play \u201cArt\u201d cost the equivalent of $40,000 in 1998. In a crackling new revival, it's a hefty $300,000.",
      "The painting in question is a 4-by-5-foot white-on-white work with white lines. Playwright Yasmina Reza puts it at the center of an escalating fight between three male, middle-aged friends that exposes their fault lines, leading to a night in which each are ripped apart by the others and putting a 25-year friendship in jeopardy.",
      "If $300,000 sounds like a ridiculous price for a monothematic canvas, you'll side with Marc, played with pitch-perfect exasperation by Bobby Cannavale. If the painting speaks to you, you'll be with Serge, a flinty, slightly full-of-himself Neil Patrick Harris. If you just want to hang out and not talk about the painting any more, you'll identify with James Corden's hapless Yvan.",
      "Under Scott Ellis' tight and enthralling direction and with three perfectly cast actors who seem to be having a ball at the Music Box Theatre, \u201cArt\u201d frequently erupts in laughter but still has plenty to say about friendship, power dynamics and how we get on each others' nerves. The 90-minute play opened Tuesday night.",
      "This is the first time \u201cArt,\u201d translated from the original French by Christopher Hampton and which won the Tony Award for best play in 1998 starring Alan Alda, Victor Garber and Alfred Molina, has returned to Broadway, and it feels nothing like an antique. Designer David Rockwell puts the latest three lads in an elegant gray, spare living room that reeks of chilly luxury but also has little personality.",
      "Marc believes that Serge \u2014 by buying the Modernist painting against the express aesthetic rules followed by Marc \u2014 is indicating that he has stepped out of Marc\u2019s shadow. It is for him nothing less than a betrayal. Serge finds a new intolerance and inflexibility in his friend and a hostility to things new. They both lobby Yvan to be on their side, and when he vacillates, he is declared a spineless amoeba.",

      "Cannavale's Marc is prone to outbursts and patting his friend's shoulders, less out of affection than an expression of dominance. Harris' Serge goes from needy to flinty to icy, and Corden fills his Yvan with the comedian's gift for physical comedy, literally plunging into a sofa to search for something or looking sheepish as he buttons a jacket.",

      "Robert Redford, who died Tuesday at 89, was known for his deep commitment to activism, especially for Native American rights and the environment",
      "NEW YORK -- Lorie Lee Sekayumptewa, a former administrator with the Navajo Nation Film Office, remembers seeing Robert Redford at traditional cultural dances at the Hopi village of Hotevilla in New Mexico. It was more than 30 years ago and he was serving as executive producer of the 1991 release \u201cThe Dark Wind,\" a drama about Navajo life.",
      "Redford stood out for his Hollywood looks and for his un-Hollywood behavior, from his earnest desire to learn more about the tribe\u2019s spiritual knowledge to his visits to the Navajo Nation, where Sekayumptewa\u2019s father served as the dean of students at the tribal college and would show Redford\u2019s movies at the student union building.",
      "\u201cEven at home, he would bring that camera and film home to us, put up a sheet and we would invite our neighbors and the kids and we would all be there in our living room, watching these movies,\u201d the 54-year-old Sekayumptewa, who is Navajo, Hopi and Sac and Fox Nation, said of Redford.",
      "\u201cWe were all fans.\u201d",
      "Redford, who died Tuesday at age 89, was hardly the only liberal activist to emerge out of Hollywood, but few matched his knowledge and focus, his humility and dedication. Fellow actors and leaders of the causes he fought for spoke of his unusually deep legacy, his fight for Native Americans and the environment that began at the height of his stardom.",
      "In the mid-1970s, around the same time he was appearing in such blockbusters as \u201cThe Sting\u201d and \u201cThe Way We Were,\" he immersed himself in the emerging environmental movement. He successfully opposed a power plant being built in his adopted state, Utah, and lobbied for the landmark bills the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. He also joined the board of the non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council, where he remained a guiding force up to his death.",
      "\u201cHis legacy was extraordinary,\u201d says NRDC CEO and President Manish Bapna. \u201cOne of the things that was most extraordinary about him was that he understood the power of storytelling. He could talk about climate change and the toll it was inflicting on people and communities \u2014 the fisherman coping with rising seas, a family fleeing for their lives from a raging wildfire. He would record messages, give talks or speak in front of Congress.\"",
      "Bapna last saw Redford a few months ago, when they dined in New York City.",
      "\u201cHe chose his words carefully, and every word he said was profound. He said we must continue to find ways to tell stories that reach people,\u201d Bapna said.",
      "Redford had a longtime affinity for the environment. After growing up in Southern California in the 1930s and '40s, he was disheartened to see Los Angeles transform after World War II into a mecca of pollution and traffic jams. In the early 1960s, when he came upon Provo Canyon, Utah, during a cross-country motorcycle trip, he was so awed and invigorated by the landscape that he eventually settled in the area.",
      "Entertainers over time have come to identify and, be identified with, a given cause: Harry Belafonte and civil rights, Paul Newman and nuclear disarmament, Jane Fonda and the Vietnam War. Redford, as much as anyone, helped make the environment an issue for the Hollywood elite, whether for Fonda or Julia Louis-Dreyfus or Leonardo DiCaprio, a fellow NRDC board member who called Redford's death \u201ca huge loss to our community\u201d and cited his legacy an actor and activist.",

Bill Richardson to create the Foundation to Protect New Mexico Wildlife to fight efforts by a Roswell, New Mexico, company and others to slaughter horses. The following year, the foundation reached an agreement with the Navajo Nation to manage thousands of wild horses on the reservation and keep the animals from being sent to slaughter houses.",
      "For Redford, the wild horse was representative of the American West. His advocacy also was channeled through the nonprofit group Return to Freedom, Wild Horse Conservation. The group posted on social media Tuesday that they were heartbroken.",
      "\u201cWe have all lost an irreplaceable artist, activist and environmentalist,\u201d said Neda DeMayo, founder of RTF. \u201cRobert Redford was and is an iconic and inspiring human being forever interwoven with the beauty and majesty of the West.

      "A government watchdog has raised concerns about high administrative costs in Georgia's Medicaid program",
      "ATLANTA -- A federal watchdog reported Thursday that Georgia\u2019s program requiring able-bodied adults to document low-paying work to get Medicaid has spent much more on administrative costs than on providing health care.",
      "The U.S. Government Accountability Office report on Georgia Pathways comes after Republicans mandated similar work requirements throughout the U.S. as part of the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d signed into law by President Donald Trump.",
      "Starting in 2027, most adults who seek Medicaid coverage must first show they are working, taking classes or performing community service for at least 80 hours a month. And they must be extremely poor, earning incomes no higher than the federal poverty line.",
      "The report attributes most of the administrative costs to the implementation of changes in determining eligibility and enrolling people, along with duplicative technology, training and coordination while the state litigated to overcome Biden administration objections.",
      "\u201cNow the entire country can see what we in Georgia already know \u2014 Georgia\u2019s Medicaid work reporting requirement program is the real waste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d Sen. Raphael Warnock, one of the Georgia Democrats who requested the report. \u201cThis report shows that Pathways is incredibly effective at barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer,\" his statement said.",
      "A spokesperson for Republican Gov. Brian Kemp countered that Democrats are responsible for the extra spending.",
      "\u201cNow, as other states prepare to adopt our model and reject one-size-fits-none big government healthcare, Democrats like Senators Ossoff and Warnock are trying to rewrite history after four years of inaction and blame the State for costs associated with their own stonewalling.\"",
      "Millions of eligible people will lose coverage due to the Trump law because the administrative process will make it too difficult for them to repeatedly document their work, critics say, pointing to what happened in Georgia, which is so far the only state that imposes work requirements.",
      "Georgia has among the highest rates of uninsured and is one of 10 states that refused to expand Medicaid to all adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, as envisioned by President Barack Obama's health care overhaul.",
      "Instead, Kemp heralded his July 2023 launch of Georgia Pathways to Coverage, which limits Medicaid for adults to those who earn no more than poverty-level wages, now set at $15,650 a year. Georgia's traditional Medicaid still covers poorer children, disabled adults, poor people in nursing homes and a handful of other adults.",
      "Nationally, most adults on Medicaid in states that expanded it are already working, and in Georgia, an estimated 246,365 adults are potentially eligible for traditional Medicaid or Pathways. But a year after it launched, Pathways had enrolled around 4,300. As of this spring, there were 6,514 adults enrolled, according to the state Department of Community Health.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday posted more than 100 letters to various drug and online prescribing companies, including Hims & Hers, which has built a multibillion-dollar business centered around lower-cost versions of blockbuster obesity injections.",

The formulations cited by regulators are produced by specialty compounding pharmacies and aren't reviewed by the FDA.",
      "\u201cYour claims imply that your products are the same as an FDA-approved product when they are not,\u201d states the warning letter, dated Sept. 9.",

      "A memo signed by President Donald Trump last week directed Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the FDA to ensure that pharmaceutical ads on TV, social media and other websites are \u201ctruthful and non-misleading.\u201d As part of the initiative, the FDA promised to send 100 letters to companies with deceptive ads.",
      "The new FDA letters each contain \u201ccease and desist\u201d language. That\u2019s a different approach for the agency, which typically drafts its letters in highly bureaucratic language citing specific FDA regulations.",
      "Hims has been under scrutiny from Washington for months.",
      "Earlier this year, a Super Bowl ad from the company touted the benefits of its weight-loss medications but didn't list any of their side effects or potential harms. FDA rules require advertisements to present a balanced picture of drug risks and benefits.",
      "Makary singled out the ad in last week\u2019s Journal of the American Medical Association, calling it a \u201cbrazen\u201d example of how advertising is \u201ccontributing to America\u2019s culture of overreliance on pharmaceuticals for health.\u201d",

      "Before that meeting, Kennedy announced he was removing COVID-19 shots from the CDC's recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women. The move was heavily criticized by doctors' groups and public health organizations, and prompted a lawsuit by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups.",
      "Days after Kennedy's announcement, CDC officials said families could still get the 2024-2025 version of COVID-19 shots for their kids in consultation with their doctors. That clarification meant shots would still be covered by the federal government's Vaccines For Children program, which pays for shots for families who lack money or adequate health insurance coverage. It's now responsible for roughly half of childhood vaccinations in the U.S. each year.",
      "As with flu shots, however, there are new COVID-19 formulations each fall, to account for changes in which strains are circulating. The committee has not yet voted on whether to recommend this season's COVID-19 shots or whether those shots should be covered by the VFC program.",
      "Further complicating the picture: When the FDA last month licensed this fall's COVID-19 shots, the agency took the unusual step of narrowing their use for healthy younger adults and children.",
      "If the ACIP simply follows that, and if there is no additional clarifying language from the CDC, then \u201cthat would take away access for roughly half of America\u2019s kids,\u201d said Dr. Sean O'Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "The pediatricians group urges that vaccinations continue for all children ages 6 months to 2 years.",
      "Hepatitis B can cause serious liver infections. In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during use injection-drug use.",
      "But the virus also can be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections.",
      "A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).",
      "Infant vaccinations are stressed for women who have hepatitis B or, crucially, who have not been tested for it. The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.",
      "Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are considered a success, and no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problem with giving kids the shots on their first day of life, Schaffner said.",

      "In a University of Hawaii study of fire survivors conducted in 2024, just over half of children reported symptoms of depression, and 30% were likely facing an anxiety disorder. Nearly half of kids in the study, ages 10 to 17, were experiencing PTSD.",

Both Lahaina and Paradise had housing shortages after their fires, so families had to move away or live with friends to go to school or work in the area. In general, students who don\u2019t have a permanent living arrangement tend to struggle more academically and have more behavioral challenges, research shows.",
      "Many Paradise students still struggle with anxiety and grief, seven years later, making it difficult to fully engage in school. A year after the Camp Fire, 17% of students were homeless, and the suspension rate was 7.4%, compared to 2.5% statewide. The suspension rate remained nearly triple the state average last year, and more than 26% were chronically absent.",
      "Aryah Berkowitz, who lost her home, two dogs and her family\u2019s business in the Paradise blaze, dealt with lingering behavioral challenges following the disaster. For nearly a year afterward, her family of seven, plus a pair of surviving pit bull-Labrador mixes, lived with a friend in nearby Chico, sharing two bedrooms and a bathroom.

      "Some have struggled to retain class material or simply stopped attending in-person classes as they moved between hotel rooms and temporary housing, Lahainaluna High teacher Jarrett Chapin said. A few moved to online learning as their families faced continued instability.",
      "\u201cThey just sort of vanished,\u201d Chapin said.",
      "Maui has long dealt with medical workforce challenges. Even before the fires, it faced a shortage of mental health professionals because they struggled with the state\u2019s high cost of living and housing shortage.",
      "The fires brought burnout and greater economic obstacles, only exacerbating the issue. Since then, Hawaii\u2019s education department has tried to bulk up Maui\u2019s mental health staff by bringing in providers from neighbor islands and the mainland and, more recently, using a $2 million federal grant to support students.",
      "But hiring mental health staff has been so difficult that even the federal money hasn\u2019t made much of a dent. In the first nine months of the grant, the state education department primarily used the money to bus displaced students from other parts of the island to Lahaina schools.",
      "The state has used the money to hire five part-time mental health providers working with students and staff, including one specialist who works in the evenings with students living as boarders on Lahainaluna\u2019s campus, said Kimberly Lessard, a Department of Education district specialist.",
      "Two of the six behavioral health specialist positions in Lahaina schools remained unfilled this summer, as they have been for years due to Maui\u2019s housing shortage and high cost of living, Lessard said.",
      "Valdivia, who still struggles with anxiety from the Upcountry Maui fires, has seen the impacts of the provider shortage firsthand. She\u2019s on a two- to three-month waiting list to see a psychiatrist on Maui, and she\u2019s seeing an O\u02bbahu-based therapist via telehealth because there aren\u2019t enough providers who can meet with her in person.",

      "The school psychologists \u201ccan\u2019t keep up,\u201d said Nellie Zambrana, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Puerto Rico at R\u00edo Piedras. Those who are working are overstretched, according to a study by the university\u2019s Psychological Research Institute. One psychologist, the study said, was assigned to more than 100 students at three schools.",
      "Loren Lapow wasn\u2019t deterred by the storm clouds gathering one June afternoon over D.T. Fleming Beach on Maui. The social worker helped teens carry an inflatable paddleboard to the water\u2019s edge, cheering them on as they swam.",
      "Amid the fun, Lapow directed the teens to reflect on their fears and losses. He asked them how they feel when they smell smoke or think about Lahaina\u2019s famed Front Street, most of which was destroyed in the blaze.",

      "Lapow founded the Maui Hero Project, which his website describes as \u201cadventure-based counseling services.\u201d The eight-week program Lapow started 25 years ago teaches teens basic disaster preparedness skills and immerses them in outdoor activities. It's also a form of mental health support, which Lapow has leaned into since the wildfires.",
      "Lapow\u2019s approach has become a common strategy for nonprofits and therapists trying to reach kids who have balked at discussing their mental health since the fires. But those efforts don't always reach the kids who need the most help.",
      "There\u2019s a strong stigma around seeking mental health services, particularly in Filipino and Latino communities that make up a large portion of Lahaina\u2019s population, said Ruben Juarez, a professor at University of Hawaii who led the research study on fire survivors. Families may see counseling as a sign of weakness, and children may be reluctant to open up to therapists out of fear of being judged or scrutinized, he added.",
      "Yet in the study, Latino teens reported the highest rates of severe depressive and PTSD symptoms. Filipino teens reported some of the highest rates of anxiety.",

      "South Korean investigators have requested an arrest warrant for Hak Ja Han, leader of the Unification Church",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean investigators said Thursday that they have requested an arrest warrant for the leader of the Unification Church. The announcement came a day after they questioned her about allegations that the church bribed the wife of jailed former President Yoon Suk Yeol and a conservative lawmaker.",
      "The church leader, Hak Ja Han, is the 82-year-old widow of the church\u2019s South Korean founder, Sun Myung Moon. She and the church have denied allegations they bribed Yoon\u2019s wife, Kim Keon Hee, and the lawmaker.",
      "Park Sang-jin, an investigator involved in the case, told The Associated Press that a court hearing to decide whether to approve Han\u2019s arrest was scheduled for next Monday.",
      "Kim was arrested and charged last month on allegations including bribery, stock manipulation and meddling in the selection of a legislative candidate. Her lawyers have denied the allegations.",
      "The lawmaker, Kweon Seong-dong , a staunch Yoon loyalist was arrested this week. He has denied receiving money from the church. Investigators visited the headquarters of his conservative People Power Party on Thursday to request documents to examine claims that Unification Church members signed up en masse before the party\u2019s 2023 leadership race to boost Kweon\u2019s candidacy.",
      "The investigation into Kim is one of three special prosecutor probes launched under Seoul\u2019s new liberal government targeting Yoon\u2019s presidency. The others focus on Yoon\u2019s planning and execution of martial law on Dec. 3 and his government\u2019s alleged cover-up of a marine\u2019s drowning death during a 2023 flood rescue operation.",
      "His imposition of martial law, which was short lived, led to his impeachment later that month and removal from office in April.",

The shells have become popular and valuable in the last few decades as a replacement for elephant ivory, which has been increasingly banned.",

      "With little chance of NATO membership for Ukraine, the country\u2019s Western allies have bought into an alternate strategy for helping it repel Russia: invest billions in Ukraine\u2019s weapons industry so it can better defend itself",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- With little chance of NATO membership for Ukraine, the country\u2019s Western allies have bought into an alternate strategy for helping it repel Russian aggression: invest billions in Ukraine's weapons industry so it can better defend itself.",
      "If the strategy works, Ukraine's weapons industry will eventually be able to help equip U.S. and European armies, too, with cutting-edge drones and other military technology being developed in the midst of its war with Russia.",
      "One recent advance in Ukraine\u2019s homegrown arsenal is a quadcopter drone that can evade Russian jamming devices, fly more than 20 kilometers (12 miles) and drop six kilograms (13 pounds) of guided explosives onto tanks and other high-value targets.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians are the leaders in the world in terms of drone technology,\u201d Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration's special envoy for Ukraine said last week at a conference in Kyiv. \u201cWe are working with Ukrainians now to make sure we have got this drone technology exchange, which I think is very important.\u201d",
      "Europeans have been taking the threat from Russia more seriously since the second Trump administration began signaling that NATO members shouldn\u2019t be overly reliant on the U.S. to defend them. Anxieties across Europe were heightened last week after Russian drones launched from Belarus were shot down in Polish airspace.",
      "For its part, Ukraine is seeking investment to triple its weapons production, become less reliant on Western partners to fight Russia \u2013 and hopefully deter future conflicts.",
      "Ukraine's weapons industry now meets nearly 60% of its army's needs, up from 10% when Russia's full-scale invasion began 3 1/2 years ago, according to its defense minister. But its military budget \u2014 $64 billion in 2024 \u2014 is less than half the size of Russia's, which is why it turns to Western allies for weapons and, increasingly, money.",
      "In addition to any private investment, and in lieu of NATO membership, security guarantees for Ukraine will likely center on European governments investing in its army \u2014 essentially paying Kyiv to build its own weapons and plugging in production gaps with mutually beneficial joint ventures.",
      "European countries are eager to do this, said Fabien Hinz of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. \u201cUkraine has the advantage of having battle-tested systems, of having quite low production costs and having entities in place capable of producing these systems rapidly.\u201d",
      "For both sides, the war has necessitated fast cycles of innovation as a matter of survival. How quickly a weapon can be developed, shipped to an army unit and improved upon is a matter of life and death.",
      "Like most defense companies in Ukraine, the maker of the R-34 quadcopter drone \u2014 FRDM \u2014 communicates with soldiers at all hours of the day and quickly incorporates feedback. Its founder, Vadym Yunyk, is guided by the motto: Robots should die in the front lines, not people.",

      "Race engineer Alessandro Tedino told The Associated Press that he wasn\u2019t sure the new record was attainable.

A group of children with Down syndrome, chosen to serve as honorary \u201cmechanics for the day,\u201d removed the red, satiny cover to reveal Barone\u2019s steed: a red-and-black Ferrari SF90.",
      "Barone eased himself into the supercar, then drove back and forth along the length of the deck several times to warm up its V-8 turbo engine. It roared louder with each pass as he pushed its 1,085 horses harder and harder. Then he placed himself at the far end of the 236-meter (774-foot) flight deck and awaited the all-clear.",
      "\u201cHere he goes! Here he goes!\u201d the announcer called as Barone left his mark and zipped past the crowd.

      "\u201cI in no way pretend to be wiser or more experienced than all those who have come before me,\u201d Leo said, adding he was studying the issue and speaking with Chinese people \u201con both sides\" about it.",
      "The Vatican has defended the 2018 accord against criticism that Francis sold out the underground faithful, who endured decades of persecution by the Beijing authorities. The Vatican has said the deal was necessary to prevent an even worse schism in the Chinese church after China named bishops without the pope\u2019s consent.",

      "Western diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the U.S. has been heavily lobbying behind the scenes to prevent the resolution from being adopted. The U.S. has raised the possibility of reducing funding to the International Atomic Energy Agency if the resolution was adopted and if the body moved to curtail Israel\u2019s rights within the agency, the diplomats said.",
      "In 1981, the provision of assistance to Israel under the IAEA\u2019s technical assistance program was suspended as a result of an Israeli strike on a nuclear reactor in Iraq. At the time, the attack was strongly condemned in resolutions by the U.N. Security Council, the IAEA General Conference and the IAEA Board of Governors.",

      "Israel targeted Iranian nuclear and military sites in June, saying it could not allow Tehran to develop atomic weapons and that it feared the Islamic Republic was close. The U.S. inserted itself into the war on June 22, striking three Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran has long maintained that its nuclear program is peaceful.",
      "The text of Iran\u2019s draft resolution contained a paragraph that \u201cstrongly condemned\u201d the \u201cdeliberate and unlawful attacks carried out in June 2025 against nuclear sites and facilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran,\u201d adding that it constituted a \u201cclear violation of international law.\u201d",

      "Native to Indonesia and East Timor, the snow-white birds, their crests flashing like yellow crowns, squawk through the urban parks of the Asian financial hub. They make up roughly 10% of the species' global wild population, which numbers only up to 2,000 mature birds.",
      "Research shows the city\u2019s cockatoo population has stagnated as the birds, which live in tree cavities, are losing natural nesting spaces in old trees due to typhoons and government tree trimming for public safety.

      "MEXICO CITY -- The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday sanctioned members of a Sinaloa cartel faction known as Los Mayos, one of the groups that has tormented Sinaloa's capital in an ongoing war for control.",
      "The move came on the same day that U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley is visiting Mexico, and after the Trump administration designated the Sinaloa cartel as a terrorist group earlier this year.",
      "Hurley is meeting with Mexican authorities and business leaders to discuss strategies for combating drug trafficking, cartel operations and illicit financing. The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement that the official\u2019s main message will be that the department \u201cwill not allow Mexico-based drug cartels to access the U.S. financial system.\u201d",
      "It's part of an ongoing effort by the Trump administration to crack down on cartels. In addition to pressuring Mexico's government to more aggressively pursue the criminal groups, the administration has also doled out rounds of sanctions to cartel leaders, banks it alleged facilitated money transfers for cartels and a rapper accused of laundering money for the groups.",
      "On Thursday, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned the entirety of Los Mayos, the leader of it's armed wing, Juan Jos\u00e9 Ponce F\u00e9lix, as well as five people and 15 companies with alleged connections to the group along the U.S.-Mexico border. It froze all the assets of those listed in the sanctions, and blocked any transactions with them or any related entities or businesses. It also sanctioned another local gang affiliated with the cartel, known as Los Rugrats.",
      "U.S. Treasury officials said that the faction was responsible for producing and trafficking fentanyl and other drugs to the United States and that it controlled a key artery along the border. They also alleged that the group was involved in kidnapping, money laundering and more near the U.S.-Mexico border.",

      "But there are ways to interrupt that downward spiral.",
      "Many people have found cognitive behavioral therapy, a form of talk therapy, helpful to examine internal monologues such as \u201cI\u2019m going to say the wrong thing\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not good enough\u201d \u2014 and replace them with neutral or positive mantras.",

      "Now, instead of jumping to the worst conclusion, she pauses to examine the thought. \u201cWhat did they actually say to you?\u201d she asks herself. \u201cDid they say the actual words, \u2018You\u2019re terrible?\u2019 Did they actually say, \u2018You have to throw out the whole lesson?\u2019\u201d",

      "Some therapists get creative when working with clients to identify negative feelings or beliefs. Avigail Lev, a psychologist with the Bay Area CBT Center in San Francisco, has clients write down the phrases, such as \u201cThey don\u2019t value the work that I\u2019m doing\u201d or \u201cI haven\u2019t done enough to get a raise.\u201d",

      "It can take time and practice to successfully reframe negative thoughts that have been replaying in our mind for years. When Renee Baker was studying architecture in college, professors and instructors frequently tore into her work. The critiques were designed to thicken her skin. But they had a lasting impact.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the self-doubt that comes with being told, literally, \u2018You\u2019re not good enough. Your ideas aren\u2019t good enough. Your work isn\u2019t good enough,\u2019\u201d said Baker, who\u2019s now director of project management at Inform Studio, a design firm. \u201cAt the heart of a lot of my self-doubt is feeling like my voice, and what I think, what I believe, what I am passionate about, isn\u2019t as important as the next person's.\u201d",
      "So Baker worked with a therapist to challenge her damaging core beliefs, exchanging them for more neutral thoughts. At work, she practiced speaking up even when her throat felt tight with anxiety. Over time, she became less anxious and more comfortable sharing her ideas.",
      "You can get specific when you're searching for alternative, healthier mantras.",
      "\u201cWhen we look at this sentence, \u2018They don\u2019t value the work that I\u2019m doing,\u2019 do you have any examples of when you felt your work was valued? Do you have examples of when people appreciated your work?\u201d Lev asked.",

      "Protesters are hitting France with transport strikes, demonstrations and blockades, targeting the Paris Metro and other sectors",
      "PARIS -- Protesters hit France with transport strikes, notably hobbling the Paris Metro, demonstrations and traffic slowdowns and blockades Thursday, pitting the power of the streets against President Emmanuel Macron 's government and its proposals to cut funding for public services that underpin the French way of life.",
      "The first whiffs of police teargas came before daybreak, with scuffles between riot officers and protesters in Paris. Nationwide demonstrations, from France's biggest cities to small towns, were expected to mobilize hundreds of thousands of marchers, voicing anger about mounting poverty, sharpening inequality and struggles for low-paid workers and others to make ends meet.",
      "\u201cWe say \u2018no\u2019 to the government. We\u2019ve had enough. There\u2019s no more money, a high cost of living,\" striking transport worker Nadia Belhoum said at a before-dawn protest targeting a Paris bus depot. She described \u201cpeople agonizing, being squeezed like a lemon even if there\u2019s no more juice.\u201d",
      "Labor unions that called strikes are pushing for the abandonment of proposed budget cuts, social welfare freezes and other belt-tightening that opponents contend will further hit the pockets of low-paid and middle-class workers and which triggered the collapse of successive governments that sought to push through savings.",
      "Opponents of Macron's business-friendly leadership complain that taxpayer-funded public services \u2014 free schools and public hospitals, subsidized health care, unemployment benefits and other safety nets that are cherished in France \u2014 are being eroded. Left-wing parties and their supporters want the wealthy and businesses to pay more, rather than see spending cuts to plug holes in France's finances and to rein in its debts.",
      "\u201cPublic service is falling apart,\u201d said teacher Claudia Nunez. \u201cIt\u2019s always the same people who pay.\u201d",
      "The day of upheaval \u2014 with strikes also impacting schools, industry and other sectors of the European Union\u2019s second-largest economy \u2014 aimed to turn up the heat on new Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu. Macron appointed him last week, tasking Lecornu with building parliamentary support for belt-tightening that brought down his predecessors.",
      "\u201cBringing in Lecornu doesn\u2019t change anything \u2014 he\u2019s just another man in a suit who will follow Macron\u2019s line,\u201d said 22-year-old student Juliette Martin.",
      "\u201cWe want our voices heard. People my age feel like no one in politics is speaking for us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always our generation that ends up with the insecurity and the debt.\u201d",
      "Unions have decried budget proposals by Macron's minority governments, weakened by their lack of a dependable majority in parliament, as brutal and punitive for workers, retirees and others who are vulnerable.",
      "\u201cThe bourgeoisie of this country have been gorging themselves, they don\u2019t even know what to do with their money anymore. So if there is indeed a crisis, the question is who should pay for it,\u201d said Fabien Villedieu, a leader of the SUD-Rail train workers union. \u201cWe are asking that the government\u2019s austerity plan that consists of making the poorest in this country always pay \u2014 whether they are employees, retirees, students \u2014 ends and that we make the richest in this country pay.\u201d",
      "Striking rail workers waving flares made a brief foray into the Paris headquarters of the Economics Ministry, leaving trails of smoke in the air before leaving.",
      "Macron's opponents also continue to denounce unpopular pension reforms that he railroaded through parliament and which raised the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64, triggering a firestorm of anger and rounds of protest earlier in what is his second and last term as president, which ends in 2027.",

It\u2019s a family tradition she\u2019s been doing since she was 15. Now 45, she is struggling to sustain the practice and pass it to her daughter.",
      "In Ghana\u2019s coastal mangroves, oyster farming has been a key source of livelihood dominated for ages by women. Hundreds of women were trained in eco-friendly farming methods for oysters, including mangrove planting and preservation, and selective oyster harvesting, to lessen the impact of climate change.",
      "Mangroves, trees or shrubs that grow along coastlines serve a critical multifunctional purpose in the aquatic ecosystem, ranging from being a home to fish to providing a buffer for coastal erosion from rising sea levels, and protection to land during storms and cyclones.",
      "However, training by the Development Action Association nonprofit has ended after it lost its U.S. aid as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to cut foreign aid contracts. It left the women to try what they can to keep their generational practice and sustain their families as Ghana emerges from its worst economic crisis in a decades.",

      "Mangroves are also increasingly threatened by climate change as global temperatures and sea levels rise.",
      "A single basin of oysters sells for roughly 47 Ghanaian cedis ($4), and Nutekpor sells just enough to feed her family and put her daughters through school.",

      "ATLANTA -- Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s new vaccine advisory committee meets Thursday to begin a two-day session focused on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B and chickenpox.",
      "Votes are expected Thursday afternoon on hepatitis B and on a combined shot against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox, but Department of Health and Human Services officials have not said exactly what proposals would be considered.",
      "Information on the meeting agenda suggests the committee may be poised to roll back \u2014 at least partly \u2014 a longstanding recommendation that all U.S. children get an initial dose of hepatitis B vaccine right after birth.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics and many public health officials support that decades-old practice.",
      "Dr. Mysheika Roberts, health department director in Columbus, Ohio, said rates of the liver disease among children have dropped tremendously since it was put into place.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t understand the rationale of why we would stop providing that vaccine and that guidance to babies when we\u2019ve seen such great progress in that area,\" said Roberts, who was scheduled to join the vaccine panel but was dismissed by Kennedy. \u201cIf it's not broken, why change it?\u201d",
      "The committee's chair, Martin Kulldorff, also has raised the idea of recommending the MMRV combination shot not be given to children younger than 4. In a June presentation to the committee, he discussed rare instances of feverish seizures that have been associated with the first dose, given to kids between ages 1 and 2.",
      "The ACIP last dealt with the issue in 2009, when it said either the combination shot or separate MMR and varicella shots were acceptable for the first dose. Today, most pediatricians suggest separate doses for the first round and give the combined shot for the second dose, pediatrics experts say.",
      "Some doctors and public health experts say they are not aware of any new safety data that would explain the revisiting of those vaccination recommendations. They worry that the panel is raising unwarranted new questions about vaccines in the minds of parents, and that it may limit the ability of families to get their children protected.",
      "The panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors have almost always accepted those recommendations, which are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading antivaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices. On Monday, HHS announced the addition of five more people, some of them noted skeptics of COVID-19 vaccinations or pandemic prevention measures.",

      "The star-studded festivals are still raising public awareness of the challenges facing family farmers, and assisting struggling producers connect with help.",
      "Nelson is now 92,Young is 79 and Mellencamp is 73, but they're still going strong. Organizers announced Wednesday that Minnesota native Bob Dylan will be joining them. Others taking the stage at the University of Minnesota's football stadium will include Dave Matthews,Margo Price,Kenny Chesney,Wynonna Judd, and Nathaniel Rateliff.",
      "This year\u2019s concert comes at a worrying time for American farmers. Farm profitability has been falling. Crop prices are low while production costs are rising. And the Trump administration\u2019s trade wars have added to the insecurity. China has not bought any of the 2025 U.S. soybean crop so far and has turned to America's competitors, such as Brazil, to meet its needs.",
      "A labor dispute nearly derailed the festival this year. Organizers said they would not cross the picket lines of striking teamster service workers at the university, saying \u201cthe farm and labor movements are inseparable.\u201d Nelson got on the phone with Gov. Tim Walz. The university and union reached a deal late last week.",
      "\u201cThe Governor knows how important this event is to farmers and farm country,\u201d Walz spokesperson Claire Lancaster said. \u201cHe worked with all parties involved, including Willie Nelson, to find a solution.\u201d",
      "Farm Aid is thrilled that the show will go on.",
      "\u201cFor four decades, Farm Aid has stood with farmers and workers,\u201d organizers said in a statement that called the agreement \u201ca reminder of what can be achieved when people come together in the spirit of fairness and solidarity.\u201d",
      "CNN will carry five hours of programming from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. CDT, featuring live performances by Nelson, Young, Mellencamp, Dylan, Matthews and Price. CNN will also stream it live on CNN.com, and on its apps without requiring a cable login. Sirius XM will carry it on satellite radio starting at noon CDT. Beginning at 11:30 a.m. CDT, it will also stream on the nugs live music platform and YouTube channel, and at FarmAid.org and on Farm Aid's YouTube channel.",
      "This will be the ninth Farm Aid for Rateliff, whose music combines rock, soul, country, gospel, folk and Americana. He said he joined because he has long felt a connection to farming and the land.",
      "\u201cI grew up in rural Missouri, and grew up with agriculture around me, and we didn\u2019t have much money as a family,\u201d Rateliff recalled in an interview. \u201cSo we had a huge one-acre garden, and my mom canned a lot of stuff, and my dad and I would hunt squirrel and rabbit and deer and whatever else we could eat.\u201d",

      "\u201cFarm Aid was kind of the first rallying point for farmers publicly,\u201d Fahy recalled. \u201cIt was the first time that farmers would reach out and call a number.\u201d",
      "That hotline \u2014 1-800-FARM-AID (1-800-327-6243) \u2014 was one of their first initiatives. Operators mostly come from agricultural backgrounds. Fahy said they can help with immediate needs, then connect farmers with other resources, such as financial and business counseling, legal advice or mental health support, or help them navigate federal farm programs.",
      "While emergency grants aren\u2019t the main focus of Farm Aid \u2014 they\u2019re $500 per farmer and totaled just around $50,000 last year \u2014 Fahy said the money may help a family in financial straits buy groceries or keep the heat on in a barn while they seek longer-term solutions.",

      "Rateliff said he keeps coming back to Farm Aid because not enough has changed. People are still fighting against the concentration of agriculture among bigger and bigger producers, he said. But he said music bridges political differences. He said his own fans include people who voted for Bernie Sanders, a self-named democratic socialist, and for President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cWhat music has the ability to do is bring people together \u2014 to create commonality in a shared human experience \u2014 so that we all can examine ourselves together and see how alike we are,\u201d Rateliff said.",

      "American Express\u2019 latest update to its high-end Platinum Card, unveiled Thursday, comes with a lot more perks and a lofty annual fee of $895",
      "NEW YORK -- The Platinum Card is getting shinier and pricier.",
      "American Express' latest update to its high-end Platinum Card, unveiled Thursday, comes with a lot more perks, including a $400 credit for dining out, and a lofty annual fee of $895.",
      "The Platinum Card refresh is just the latest from the major credit card issuers, and the higher fees may put pressure on some cardholders to choose between the Platinum Card or another high-fee card like Chase\u2019s Sapphire Reserve Card. Or pay close to $2,000 in annual fees for the privilege of carrying two or more of these premium cards.",
      "As part of the revamp, the Platinum Card customers will get a $600 annual hotel credit \u2014 up from $300 \u2014 to use with AmEx\u2019s travel portal; a new $400 credit for using AmEx\u2019s restaurant reservation platform Resy; $300 to use at athletic apparel chain Lululemon; and an increased \u201cdigital entertainment credit\u201d of $300 that AmEx cardmembers can put toward several streaming services or news outlets.",
      "All the new perks are available for AmEx customers to start using immediately. In all, AmEx says the value of the perks on the new Platinum Card total roughly $3,500. These perks are enough to justify the $200 increase in the annual fee, said Howard Grosfield, group president of U.S. Consumer Services at AmEx. The annual fee on the Platinum Card was $550 just five years ago.",
      "\u201cWhat we are trying to do is two things: We want to make sure we are delivering $3,500 in benefits that is far, far in excess of the $895 fee and make it easy to find multiple ways for card members to find benefits that exceed that fee,\u201d Grosfield said in an interview.",
      "None of the Platinum Card\u2019s previous perks, such as a $200 airline fee credit or the credit to shop at Saks Fifth Avenue, are going away, the company said.",
      "People who watch the credit card rewards space closely felt the upgrades were worth it.",
      "\u201cIf nothing else, going to lounges and using the $600 hotel credit will essentially justify the cost each year, and the other items are a bonus,\u201d said Ryan Smith, news managing editor of UpgradedPoints. Smith was briefed on the changes to AmEx's card before the launch.",
      "Also, as part of refresh, AmEx is issuing the stainless steel card with a high-gloss, mirrored finish, a version that may end up pulling double duty as a portable mirror.",
      "Once a niche product whose goal was to \u201csell snobbery\u201d to the high-flying business executive of the 1980s, as one magazine wrote 40 years ago, the Platinum Card is now one of American Express\u2019 most popular products, as millions of Americans have been willing to pay handsomely to play in the game of chasing airline and hotel status and perks. It is estimated that 70% to 80% of all credit cards are now tied to a loyalty programs like hotel, airline or credit card points, according to industry research and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Those programs used to be a rarity a few decades ago.",

      "JPMorgan Chase updated its Chase Sapphire Reserve Card in June, with its own $300 dining credit as well as a new $300 credit to use toward concert and event tickets through StubHub, among other perks. Citigroup released the Strata Elite Card in August. Capital One has a high-end card known as Venture X and fintech company Bilt, the company that cultivated a brand by letting renters pay their rent via credit card, is expected to have a high-end card next year.",
      "When Chase increased the rewards on its Sapphire Reserve Card in June, American Express tried to one-up its rival with a press release letting people know that upgrades to the Platinum Card were coming. The company has been teasing its Platinum Card changes on social media for several weeks.",
      "Not to be outdone by AmEx, Chase said Wednesday it was tweaking some of the rewards on Sapphire Reserve to make them more flexible for its customers, 24 hours before AmEx\u2019s announcement.",
      "AmEx continues to lean heavily on what's been joked about in the industry as the \u201ccoupon book,\u201d where customers are given major discounts for select merchants and partners, while Chase has leaned heavily on giving people bonus points for certain spending. But as part of their broad marketing campaign for the updated card, AmEx leaned heavily on its reach and useability of the benefits. For example, AmEx executives pointed out that its $400 credit on Resy is good at 10,000 restaurants, while Chase's own dining credit is good at only \u201chundreds\u201d of restaurants. AmEx also has a large airport lounge network, either through their own Centurion lounges, or its partnership with Delta Air Lines.",

      "The call also may offer clues about whether the two leaders might meet in person to hash out a final agreement to end their trade war and provide clarity on where relations between the world's two superpowers may be headed.",
      "It would be the second call with Xi since Trump returned to the White House and launched sky-high tariffs on China, triggering back-and-forth trade restrictions that strained ties between the two largest economies.

      "He said his relationship with China is \u201cvery good\u201d but noted that Russia's war in Ukraine could end if European countries put higher tariffs on China. Trump didn\u2019t say if he planned to raise tariffs on Beijing over its purchase of Moscow's oil, as he has done with India.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Thursday didn\u2019t confirm the call or any upcoming summit between the leaders, but spokesperson Liu Pengyu said \u201cheads-of-state diplomacy plays an irreplaceable role in providing strategic guidance for China-U.S. relations.\u201d",

      "The Brenner Base Tunnel, which is being billed as the longest underground rail tunnel in the world when completed, is among four key infrastructure projects that promise to reshape how Italians travel and ship goods by the early 2030s.",
      "Tunnels will cut travel times between Verona and Munich by 40% to three hours, between Milan and Paris by at least 30% to 4\u00bd hours and put the Ligurian port city of Genoa within commuting distance of Italy\u2019s finance and fashion capital \u2014 significantly remaking the Europe transit map.",
      "The boldest and most contested projects of them all, the recently approved Straits of Messina Bridge, will finally link the Italian mainland with Sicily \u2014 a project first envisioned by the ancient Romans and long delayed by modern Italians.",
      "The tunnels and bridge will mark the first significant upgrade to the Italian rail system since the Rome-Milan high-speed rail line was launched in 2008. It drastically reduced travel time between Italy\u2019s financial and political centers, effectively killing the once-lucrative Rome-Milan airline route. The rail line can now be traveled in as little as three hours.",
      "The current projects also aim to reduce truck traffic on highways \u2014 with the biggest impact expected on the Brenner Pass, which is traversed by more than 2.5 million trucks annually, making it one of Europe\u2019s busiest Alpine routes and a crucial north-south link, bringing Italian automotive components and small machinery northward. The Brenner Base Tunnel aims to shift up to half the heavy road traffic to rail.",
      "While pursuing these major projects, Italy's rail network has another 40 strategic projects in the works, many funded with 25 billion euros (nearly $30 billion) in European Union pandemic recovery funds.

      "Passenger train travel time between Milan and Genoa will be cut to about an hour from more than 1\u00bd hours. The cost is 8.5 billion euros ($10 billion) and the tunnels are 90% complete.

      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's nearly unanimous decision Wednesday to reduce its key interest rate was seen by many observers as a quiet show of unity and independence amid President Donald Trump's relentless pressure for steeper cuts and his unprecedented effort to fire a top Fed official.",
      "Many Fed-watchers expected a contentious two-day meeting this week, with the economy's future uncertain and a Trump appointee hastily added to the board just hours before the meeting began. The White House has also floated several members of the Fed's governing board as potential replacements for the current chair, Jerome Powell, when his term ends in May, creating incentives for those officials to push for the deep rate cuts Trump has demanded.",
      "Some economists expected as many as three dissenting votes among the 12 voting members of the rate-setting committee, which would be the most in five years and somewhat unusual for a consensus-driven organization. Even four dissents \u2014 which hasn't happened since 1992 \u2014 weren't out of the question.",
      "Trump has appointed three members to the Fed's governing board \u2014 two in his first term \u2014 all of whom could have voted in favor of steeper cuts.",
      "And many officials on the rate-setting committee are wary of cutting too quickly, with inflation still clearly above the Fed's 2% target. Some observers thought one of those policymakers could dissent in the other direction \u2014 in favor of not cutting rates at all.",
      "Instead, just one official dissented from the Fed's decision to reduce its rate by a quarter-point: Stephen Miran, who was nominated by Trump to an empty seat and hurriedly approved by the Senate late Monday, just hours before the two-day meeting began.",
      "Brian Bethune, a Boston College economist, was impressed by the Fed\u2019s unity in the face of White House pressure.",
      "\u201cThey all came together to support what seems to be a very balanced decision,\u2019\u2019 he said. The nearly unanimous vote \"sends a very strong message that they\u2019re not going to bow to the monarch. They\u2019re going to do what\u2019s appropriate for the economy.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump has said that one of the Fed governors he appointed in 2018 \u2014 Christopher Waller \u2014 is a potential replacement for Powell, and Waller dissented in favor of a rate cut in July, when the Fed kept borrowing costs unchanged. Another Trump appointee from his first term, Michelle Bowman, also dissented in July. Yet on Wednesday they both voted with their colleagues.",
      "On social media, Jason Furman, a top economic adviser in the Obama White House, posted that he was \u201cthrilled\u2019\u2019 that Trump appointees Bowman and Waller did not join in Miran's dissent. \u201cBodes well for the Fed\u2019s independence,\u2019\u2019 wrote Furman, now an economist at Harvard University.",
      "In the weeks leading up to the meeting, Trump sought to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, after accusing her of mortgage fraud, which she has denied. It was the first time in the Fed's 112-year history that a president has sought to remove a governor.",
      "Many legal experts consider the firing a threat to the Fed's independence, as Trump has openly discussed securing a majority on the Fed's governing board. Cook sued to keep her job and a court ruled she could remain on the Fed's board while her lawsuit is resolved.",

      "Previous presidents have appointed their economic advisers to the Fed. Former chair Ben Bernanke was an adviser in the Bush administration before being appointed chair of the Fed. But Miran's case is unusual because he is keeping his position at the White House, while taking unpaid leave.",
      "Powell has always sought to avoid a direct confrontation with Trump and avoided commenting on Cook's case during a news conference Wednesday, and he didn't say anything directly about Miran's status.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re strongly committed to maintaining our independence and beyond that I really don\u2019t have anything to share,\u201d Powell said when asked about Miran.",
      "Powell also repeatedly noted that with inflation still above the Fed's 2% target, while unemployment has also risen, it's not clear what steps the Fed should take next. If it cuts its rate too much, it could overstimulate the economy and accelerate inflation. If it keeps its rate too high, an ongoing hiring slowdown could get worse.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s challenging to know what to do,\u201d Powell said. \"There are no risk-free paths now.\u201d",

      "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney heads to Mexico on Thursday in an effort to diversify trade as America\u2019s neighbors brace for a review of the free trade deal with United States.",
      "The United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, or USMCA, is up for review in 2026. More than 75% of Canada\u2019s exports and more than 80% of Mexico\u2019s go to the U.S.",
      "Canadian Sen. Peter Boehm said Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum will commiserate about U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cWhat are they hearing from the Americans, what we are hearing. It\u2019s an opportunity to talk about how to handle the U.S. administration going forward,\u201d Boehm said.",
      "Carney is looking to improve relations with Mexico during his two-day visit after some of Canada\u2019s provincial premiers talked last year about cutting Mexico out of any new free trade deal with the U.S.",
      "Trump lumped Canada in with Mexico on fentanyl smuggling and promised sweeping tariffs on both countries.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford said then that Trump comparing Canada to the Mexico was \u201cthe most insulting thing I\u2019ve ever heard from our friends and closet allies, the United States of America.\u201d",
      "Boehm said the comments by the premiers, which he deemed out of their lane, upset the Mexicans.",
      "\u201cThe Mexicans are particularly sensitive on these matters and there was concern about that, no doubt,\u201d Boehm said.",
      "Boehm represented the Canadian government when Sheinbaum was sworn in as Mexico\u2019s president last year and is pushing for more engagement with Mexico. He said relations recently improved, noting Mexico appreciated Carney inviting Sheinbaum to the G7 summit in Alberta in June. Carney also sent his foreign minister as well as his finance minister to meet with Sheinbaum in August.",
      "\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realize that we trade more with Mexico than we do with the entire European Union, all of the Europe, including the U.K.,\u201d Boehm said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big deal for us.\u201d",
      "Mexico is Canada\u2019s third-largest trading partner after the U.S. and China. Canada was Mexico\u2019s fifth-largest trading partner in 2024.",
      "But trade with the U.S. remains paramount for both countries and preserving the free trade pact will be critical.",

      "\u201cTrump looms over this visit. Mexico and Canada now share a common threat from the U.S,\u201d said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.",
      "\u201cWhile both leaders are interested in expanding their countries trade with each other, I think their priority is to strategize on how to deal with Trump and the coming renegotiation of the USMCA. Carney and Sheinbaum now recognize that tag-teaming Trump may be more effective than competing for separate deals with Trump, although they are still angling for them.\u201d",
      "Mexico and Canada have had different approaches to manage the negotiations with Trump\u2019s administration but both countries want to increase bilateral commerce within the North American treaty.",

      "The S&P 500 fell 0.1% from its latest all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 125 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1% from its own record set the day before.",
      "Stocks have run to records on expectations that the Fed will announce the first of a series of cuts to rates on Wednesday in hopes of giving the economy a boost. The job market has slowed so much  that traders believe Fed officials now see it as the bigger danger for the economy than the threat of higher inflation because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "The Fed has been holding off on cuts to rates because inflation has remained above its 2% target, and easier interest rates could give it more fuel.",
      "A report on Tuesday said shoppers increased their spending  at U.S. retailers by more last month than economists expected. A chunk of that could be due to shoppers having to pay higher prices for the same amount of stuff. But it could also indicate solid spending by U.S. households could continue to keep the economy out of a recession.",
      "The data did little to change traders\u2019 expectations for a cut to interest rates on Wednesday, followed by more through the end of the year and into 2026.",
      "Such high expectations have sent stocks to records, but they can also create disappointment if unfulfilled. That\u2019s why more attention will be on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell says about the possibility of upcoming cuts in his press conference following Wednesday\u2019s decision than on the decision itself.",
      "Fed officials will also release their latest projections for where they see interest rates and the economy heading in upcoming years, which could provide another potential flashpoint.",
      "For now, global fund managers are tilting their portfolios toward stocks at the highest level in seven months, according to the latest survey by Bank of America. That\u2019s even though a record 58% of them are also saying that stocks look too expensive at the moment.",
      "On Wall Street, Dave & Buster\u2019s fell 16.7% after the entertainment chain reported a weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.",
      "New York Times Co. fell 1.6% after Trump filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the newspaper and four of its journalists on Monday. The lawsuit points to several articles and a book written by Times journalists and published in the lead up to the 2024 election as \u201cpart of a decades-long pattern by the New York Times of intentional and malicious defamation against President Trump.\u201d",

      "There will be three decisive Game 3s over the next two days. That's the first time that's happened since 2015. Last season all four opening round series were sweeps.",
      "\u201cYou look at the standings this year how close it was, usually in the past it was clear cut who the top three were,\u201d Phoenix forward Alyssa Thomas said after the Mercury routed New York on Wednesday night. \u201cThis year there was so much movement and it came down to the wire who was going to be the eight in the playoffs. Credit to how the league is growing and how balanced teams are. It continues to get better.\u201d",
      "The WNBA changed its playoff format this season giving each team at least one home game in the opening round which probably has helped. In the past few years, the better seeded team would have the first two games at home. Indiana and Seattle evened up their series on their home court Tuesday night and Golden State came within a basket of beating No. 1 seed Minnesota on Wednesday night to make it 4 for 4 on series going the distance.",
      "\u201cI think it's super intense. I think numbers don't matter no more. Everyone's 0-0,\u201d Minnesota guard Courtney Williams said. \u201cYou can't take no team lightly. You saw that tonight. These folks came out and gave us a run for our money.\u201d",

      "While the Indiana-Atlanta and Seattle-Las Vegas series saw each team win games on their home court, Phoenix and New York bucked the trend. Both were victorious on each other's home court to force the third game.",
      "\u201cIt didn't help us since we lost the first game at home,\u201d Thomas said laughing. \u201cIt's just nice for everyone to get a home game. Two home games (in a row) last year is unheard of in a three-game series. In order to win a series, you got to win on the road. Tonight we won on the road. It's been a competitive couple of games.\u201d",
      "Back when the playoffs had East and West matchups instead of the top eight playing each other regardless of conference, opening series going the distance was more common.",

      "Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone became the first woman in nearly 40 years to break the 48-second barrier in the 400 meters",
      "As part of his custom, Bobby Kersee ducked into a taxi and was returning to the hotel by the time the 400-meter race at world championships was beginning. He's never been one to watch his star athletes race in person, because once they get to the starting line, he feels his work is finished.",
      "Soon after his departure, the legendary track coach received the phone call he knew would be coming \u2014 his prized prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, the 400-meter hurdler who's now mixing in the 400, was a gold medalist.",
      "Not even her time was a surprise, as she became the first woman in nearly 40 years to break the 48-second barrier on Thursday at worlds in Tokyo. She finished the historically fast race in a blistering 47.78 seconds.",
      "It\u2019s exactly what they trained for. It\u2019s precisely what they expected.",
      "\u201cI knew you had to run under 48 seconds to win and she trained for it. She took on the challenge, took on the risk,\u201d Kersee said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cShe\u2019s just an amazing athlete.\u201d",
      "Her time also broke her own just-established American record and was the second-fastest ever, trailing only the 47.60 by East Germany\u2019s Marita Koch, which was set Oct. 6, 1985.",
      "All part of the plan as McLaughlin-Levrone follows the lead of the coach who's known as the \u201cmad scientist\u201d for his outside-the-box methods.",
      "Kersee has overseen the training of many of track and field's greats: Florence Griffith Joyner, Gail Devers, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Al Joyner, Allyson Felix and, these days, McLaughlin-Levrone.",
      "\u201cI think Bobby believed that the time was there and I believed in Bobby and in our work,\u201d McLaughlin-Levrone said. \u201cIt was really just a matter of putting the pieces together and running my race.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin-Levrone is already the world-record holder in the 400 hurdles. Could she someday be the owner of the 400 mark as well?",
      "\"If a world record is out there to be broken, if I\u2019ve got an athlete that\u2019s capable of breaking it, I\u2019m going after it,\" Kersee said. \u201cI\u2019d be lying to say that I\u2019m not going to try to go after it.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin-Levrone was pushed to the limit Thursday by second-place finisher Marileidy Paulino, who went a 47.98, and Salwa Eid Naser (48.19).",
      "\u201cI think that very soon the women\u2019s 400 world record will be broken,\u201d Naser said. \u201cI never thought of it before, but after tonight\u2019s race I can see that the world record is around the corner.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin-Levrone skipped European meets in order to train for Tokyo. To get her even faster, Kersee brought in former UCLA runner Willington Wright to push her. Kersee felt Wright was the perfect sparring partner for \u201cThe Champ,\u201d which is what he calls McLaughlin-Levrone.",
      "\u201cYour sparring partner makes you work the way you've got to perform in the ring,\u201d Kersee said. \"Willington did that for her. He ran beside her, behind her, in front of her, took her out (fast) and did all the things that she needed to (run that time).",
      "\u201cI kept telling her 47.99 may not win it \u2014 and 47.99 would not have won it tonight.\u201d",

      "\u201cOne of the advantages she has as a 400-meter hurdler is that you know you\u2019ve got to concentrate on coming off that curve, coming home, keeping your form and keeping your stride length and your stride frequency,\u201d Kersee explained. \u201cIf not, you\u2019re going to chop or misstep or what have you. She executed the last part of that race as good as you can expect.\u201d",

      "Equinoxes have been marked and celebrated worldwide for centuries. The fall equinox is often connected with harvest festivals in the Northern Hemisphere. For example, Dozynki, the harvest festival celebrated in Poland and other Eastern European countries, was thought to have been originally tied to the equinox.

      "Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Tiana J. Murillo on Tuesday sided with the Times, whose lawyers argued in a hearing Monday that its coverage last year was fair and protected by free speech.",
      "TMZ argued that its coverage, which followed the Times\u2019 initial reporting, addressed ongoing public controversies and matters of public interest.",
      "The suit claimed stories by TMZ and Yahoo amplified and sensationalized the Times\u2019 reporting and smeared the tribe in the process. Yahoo was dismissed as a defendant earlier this month.",
      "Murillo wrote in her ruling that though some may \u201creasonably perceive\u201d the Times\u2019 and TMZ\u2019s reporting as \u201cinsensitive, disparaging or reflecting a lack of respect, the Court need not, and does not, determine which of these characterizations is most apt.\u201d",
      "The judge added that \u201cregardless of tone, TMZ\u2019s segment contributed to existing debate over the effects of internet connectivity on remote Indigenous communities.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are pleased by the comprehensive and careful analysis undertaken by the court in dismissing this frivolous lawsuit,\" Danielle Rhoades Ha, a spokesperson for the Times, said in a statement Wednesday to The Associated Press. \"Our reporter traveled to the Amazon and provided a nuanced account of tension that arose when modern technology came to an isolated community.\u201d",

Both were instrumental in bringing the tribe the internet connection, which they said has had many positive effects including facilitating emergency medicine and the education of children.",
      "N.

      "Nicas reported that in less than a year of Starlink access, the tribe was dealing with the same struggles the rest of the world has dealt with for years due to the pervasive effects of the internet. The challenges ranged from \u201cteenagers glued to phones; group chats full of gossip; addictive social networks; online strangers; violent video games; scams; misinformation; and minors watching pornography,\" Nicas wrote.",

TMZ posted a story with the headline, \u201cElon Musk\u2019s Starlink Hookup Leaves A Remote Tribe Addicted To Porn.\u201d",
      "The Times published a follow-up story in response to misperceptions brought on by other outlets in which Nicas wrote: \u201cThe Marubo people are not addicted to pornography. There was no hint of this in the forest, and there was no suggestion of it in The New York Times\u2019s article.\u201d",
      "Nicas wrote that he spent a week with the Marubo tribe. The lawsuit claimed that while he was invited for a week, he spent less than 48 hours in the village, \u201cbarely enough time to observe, understand, or respectfully engage with the community.\"",

      "Since Robin was created, its personality and character have changed significantly based on the responses from people it interacts with.",
      "Khachikyan gave the example of Robin\u2019s answer to the question: \u201cWhat is your favorite animal.\u201d Initially they tried having the robot respond with dog. They also tried cat. But when they tried chicken, the children cracked up. So they stuck with it.",
      "\u201cWe created Robin\u2019s personality by really taking users into the equation,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we often say that Robin was designed by users.\u201d",

      "It would be the second call with Xi since Trump returned to the White House and launched sky-high tariffs on China, triggering back-and-forth trade restrictions that strained ties between the two largest economies.

      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Thursday didn\u2019t confirm the call or any upcoming summit between the leaders, but spokesperson Liu Pengyu said \u201cheads-of-state diplomacy plays an irreplaceable role in providing strategic guidance for China-U.S. relations.\u201d",

      "Authorities say that social media platforms should not require age verification for all users when a ban on children under 16 having accounts goes into effect in December in Australia",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian authorities said Tuesday that social media platforms should not demand age verification for all account holders starting from December, when a ban on children under 16 having accounts goes into effect in the country.",
      "The government released guidelines on how platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram should apply the world's first ban on children using social media from Dec. 10. It says verifying the ages of all account holders would be unreasonable.",
      "\u201cWe think it would be unreasonable if platforms reverified everyone\u2019s age,\u201d said Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, who drafted the guidelines. Her use of the word \u201creverified\" suggested the platforms usually already had sufficient data to verify a user was older than 16.",
      "She said the platforms have \u201ctargeting technology\u201d to focus on those under 16.",
      "\"They can target us with deadly precision when it comes to advertising. Certainly they can do this around the age of a child,\u201d she added.",
      "Australia\u2019s Parliament enacted the ban last year, giving the platforms a year to work out its implementation. The platforms face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.",
      "Critics of the legislation fear that banning young children from social media will impact the privacy of all users who must establish they are older than 16.",
      "Inman Grant said claims the ban would see every Australian account holder subjected to age verification as a \u201cscare tactic.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Scientists in Colombia\u2019s Amazon are capturing and testing endangered pink river dolphins to monitor mercury contamination from illegal gold mining and deforestation",
      "PUERTO NARINO, Colombia -- A flash of pink breaks the muddy surface of the Amazon River as scientists and veterinarians, waist-deep in the warm current, patiently work a mesh net around a pod of river dolphins. They draw it tighter with each pass, and a spray of silver fish glistens under the harsh sun as they leap to escape the net.",
      "When the team hauls a dolphin into a boat, it thrashes as water streams from its pink-speckled sides and the crew quickly ferries it to the sandy riverbank where adrenaline-charged researchers lift it onto a mat. They have 15 minutes \u2014 the limit for how long a dolphin can safely be out of the water \u2014 to complete their work.",
      "Fernando Trujillo, a marine biologist leading the effort, kneels beside the animal\u2019s head, shielding its eye with a small cloth so it can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening. He rests his hand gently on the animal and speaks in low tones.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve never felt the palm of a hand. We try to calm them,\u201d said Trujillo, sporting a pink dolphin bandana. \u201cTaking a dolphin out of the water, it\u2019s a kind of abduction.\u201d",
      "One person counts the dolphin's breaths. Another wets its skin with a sponge while the others conduct multiple medical tests that will help show how much mercury is coursing through the Amazon\u2019s most graceful predators.",
      "Trujillo directs the Omacha Foundation, a conservation group focused on aquatic wildlife and river ecosystems, and leads health evaluations of river dolphins. It's a painstaking operation involving experienced fishermen, veterinarians and locals that takes months of planning and happens a couple of times a year.",
      "\u201cWe take blood and tissue samples to assess mercury,\u00a8 Trujillo told The Associated Press from the Colombian riverside town of Puerto Narino. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re using dolphins as sentinels for the river\u2019s health.\u201d",
      "Mercury contamination comes mainly from illegal gold mining \u2014 a growing industry across the Amazon Basin \u2014 and forest clearing that washes mercury that naturally occurs in soil into waterways.",
      "The miners use mercury to separate gold from sediment, then dump the sludge back into rivers, where it enters fish eaten by people and dolphins. Rising global gold prices have fueled a mining boom, and mercury pollution in remote waterways has increased.",
      "Mercury can damage the brain, kidneys, lungs and immune system and cause mood swings, memory loss and muscle weakness in people, according to the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Pregnant women and young children are most at risk, with prenatal exposure linked to developmental delays and reduced cognitive function.",
      "\u201cThe maximum any living being should have is 1 milligram per kilogram,\u201d Trujillo said. \u201cHere, we\u2019re seeing 20 to 30 times that amount.\u201d",
      "In previous years, his team found 16 to 18 milligrams per kilogram of mercury in dolphins, which can suffer the same neurological damage, organ damage and other problems as humans. In Colombia\u2019s Orinoco River, levels in some dolphins have reached as high as 42, levels scientists say are among the most extreme ever recorded in the species.",
      "Trujillo said it's difficult to prove the toxin is directly killing dolphins. Further studies are underway, he added, noting that \u201cany mammal with a huge amount of mercury will die.\u201d",
      "When Trujillo and his team tested their own blood three years ago, his results showed more than 36 times the safe limit \u2014 36.4 milligrams per kilogram \u2014 a level he attributes to decades working in mercury-affected areas and a diet heavy in fish. With medical assistance, his levels have dropped to about 7 milligrams.",
      "\u201cMercury is an invisible enemy until it builds up to a sufficient amount, then it starts to affect the central nervous system,\u201d Trujillo told AP after his team managed to capture and test four pink dolphins. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing evidence of it in Indigenous communities.\u201d",
      "A series of scientific studies and reports \u2014 including work by the International Pollutants Elimination Network and academic researchers \u2014 have found high mercury exposure among Indigenous peoples across the Amazon, including in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Suriname and Bolivia. Hair samples showed averages well above WHO's safe threshold of 1 part per million, with one Colombian community registering more than 22 milligrams per kilogram.",

The International Union for Conservation of Nature listed the pink dolphin as endangered in 2018. Trujillo said exact numbers for the Amazon are unknown, but his organization estimates 30,000 to 45,000 across the basin.",
      "Pink river dolphins also face threats from overfishing, accidental entanglement in nets, boat traffic, habitat loss and prolonged drought.",

It banned mercury use in mining in 2018, ratified the Minamata Convention aimed at reducing mercury in the environment and submitted an action plan in 2024. Authorities cite joint operations with Brazil and recent enforcement sweeps, but watchdogs say efforts remain uneven and illegal mining persists across much of the country.",
      "Other Amazon nations say they\u2019re stepping up. Brazil has launched raids and moved to restrict satellite internet used by illegal gold-mining camps that use mercury, aiming to disrupt logistics and supply lines. Peru recently seized a record 4 tons of smuggled mercury. Ecuador, Suriname and Guyana have filed action plans to cut mercury use in small-scale gold mining.",
      "The dolphin testing operation relies on Jos\u00e9 \u201cMariano\u201d Rangel, a charismatic former fisherman from Venezuela. He leads the charge when it\u2019s time to haul the animals \u2014 which can weigh as much as 160 kilograms (about 353 pounds) \u2014 into the small boats. It's a moment that can end with a stinging blow to the jaw as the dolphins thrash to break free.",
      "\u201cThe most difficult part of the captures is enclosing the dolphins,\u201d Rangel said.",
      "A portable ultrasound machine scans lungs, heart and other vital organs for disease. The team checks for respiratory problems, internal injuries and signs of reproduction, photograph the animals' skin and scars, swab blowholes and genital openings for bacterial cultures, and collect tissue for mercury testing. Microchips are implanted so researchers can identify each animal and avoid duplicating tests.",
      "Omacha has recorded antimicrobial resistance \u2014 bacteria that can\u2019t be killed by common medicines \u2014 and respiratory problems. They have also identified possible emerging diseases, such as papilloma virus, that could pose risks to both dolphins and humans.",
      "After a long morning hauling and testing dolphins, the scientists return to a laboratory in Puerto Narino that's covered with posters of dolphins and manatees and the bones and skulls of dolphins and other animals. They test some samples, prepare others to send to larger facilities and end their day repairing nets and refilling kits to do it all again at dawn.",
      "For Trujillo, each capture, scan and blood test is part of a larger fight.",

      "More than three years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, drones continue to be a key weapon for both sides. Multiple Russian drones crossed into Poland on Wednesday, prompting NATO to send fighter jets to shoot them down and underlining long-held concerns that the fighting might spill over beyond Ukraine's borders.",
      "According to Ukraine\u2019s General Staff, explosions and a fire were reported at the Kirishi refinery. It posted a photo appearing to show a blaze and clouds of smoke against a night sky.",

      "TikTok users in the U.S. may get a reprieve from the threat of a shutdown after the Trump administration announced it has reached a framework deal with China for the ownership of the popular social video platform.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a press conference after the latest round of trade talks between the world\u2019s top two economies concluded in Madrid that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would speak Friday to possibly finalize the deal. He said the objective of the deal would be to switch to American ownership.",
      "He did not disclose the terms of the deal, saying that it is between two private parties, but added that \"the commercial terms have been agreed upon.\u201d",
      "Little is known about the actual deal in the works, including what companies are involved and whether the United States would have a stake in TikTok. Li Chenggang, China\u2019s international trade representative, said the two sides have reached \u201cbasic framework consensus\u201d to properly solve TikTok-related issues in a cooperative way, reduce investment barriers and promote related economic and trade cooperation, according to China\u2019s official news agency Xinhua.",
      "Oracle Corp. has been floated as a likely buyer for the platform. Representatives for the company did not immediately respond to a message for comment on Monday.",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the team was \u201cvery focused on TikTok and making sure that it was a deal that is fair for the Chinese,\u201d but also \u201ccompletely respects U.S. national security concerns.\u201d",
      "Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China\u2019s Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, told reporters in Madrid there was consensus on authorization of \u201cthe use of intellectual property rights such as (TikTok\u2019s) algorithm\u201d \u2014 a main sticking point in the deal.",
      "The sides also agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, he said.",
      "Though he has no clear legal basis to do so, Trump has continued to extend the deadline for TikTok to avoid a ban in the U.S. This gives his administration more time to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership. The next deadline is on Sept. 17, and Trump has already signaled he would extend it if needed.",
      "It is not clear how many times Trump can keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance. While there is no clear legal basis for the extensions, so far, there have been no legal challenges against the administration. Trump has amassed more than 15 million followers on TikTok since he joined last year, and he has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters. He said in January that he has a \u201cwarm spot for TikTok.\u201d",
      "For now, TikTok continues to function for its 170 million users in the U.S. Tech giants Apple, Google and Oracle were persuaded to continue to offer and support the app, on the promise that Trump\u2019s Justice Department would not use the law to seek potentially steep fines against them.",

      "During Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic presidency, Congress and the White House used national security grounds to approve a U.S. ban on TikTok unless its Chinese parent company sold its controlling stake.",

      "As Big Tech\u2019s data centers continue to grow threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are considering bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- With the explosive growth of Big Tech's data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.",
      "Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.",
      "Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.",
      "Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.",
      "That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.",
      "Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,\u201d said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. \u201cData center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.\u201d",
      "That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.",
      "Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.",
      "A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.",
      "The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs \u2014 likely for the biggest power users \u2014 to meet growing demand.",
      "The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast \u2014 twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data \u2014 and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.",
      "Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.",
      "\u201cData center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.",
      "Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.",
      "Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.",
      "The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.",

      "That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.",
      "Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.",
      "\u201cThis is particularly concerning given that states within PJM\u2019s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,\u201d the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.",
      "The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.",
      "Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a \u201cbring your own generation\u201d requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.",
      "In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.",
      "Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.",
      "However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.",
      "To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.",
      "It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.",
      "Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.",
      "But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.",
      "\u201cAnd the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?\" Silverman said. \"Or is there a better way to do it?\u201d",

      "Residents of Annob\u00f3n island in Equatorial Guinea have faced severe internet outages since complaining about dynamite explosions by a Moroccan construction company",
      "LAGOS, Nigeria -- When residents of Equatorial Guinea's Annob\u00f3n island wrote to the government in Malabo in July last year complaining about the dynamite explosions by a Moroccan construction company, they didn't expect the swift end to their internet access.",
      "Dozens of the signatories and residents were imprisoned for nearly a year, while internet access to the small island has been cut off since then, according to several residents and rights groups.",
      "Local residents interviewed by The Associated Press left the island in the past months, citing fear for their lives and the difficulty of life without internet.",
      "Banking services have shut down, hospital services for emergencies have been brought to a halt and residents say they rack up phone bills they can't afford because cellphone calls are the only way to communicate.",
      "When governments shut down the internet, they often instruct telecom providers to cut connections to designated locations or access to designated websites, although it's unclear exactly how the shutdown works in Annob\u00f3n.",
      "The internet shutdown remains in effect, residents confirmed alongside activists, at a moment when the Trump administration has considered loosening corruption sanctions on the country\u2019s vice president.",
      "The Moroccan company Somagec, which activists allege is linked to the president, confirmed the outage but denied having a hand in it. The AP could not confirm a link.",
      "\u201cThe current situation is extremely serious and worrying,\u201d one of the signatories who spent 11 months in prison said, speaking anonymously for fear of being targeted by the government.",
      "In addition to the internet shutdown, \"phone calls are heavily monitored, and speaking freely can pose a risk,\u201d said Macus Menejolea Taxijad, a resident who recently began living in exile.",
      "It is only the latest of repressive measures that the country has deployed to crush criticisms, including mass surveillance, according to a 2024 Amnesty International report.",
      "Equatorial Guinea, a former Spanish colony, is run by Africa\u2019s longest-serving president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who, at 83, has served as president for more than half his life. His son serves as the vice president and is accused of spending state funds on a lavish lifestyle. He was convicted of money laundering and embezzlement in France and sanctioned by the U.K.",
      "On Friday, the U.N.'s top court declined Equatorial Guinea's request for France to return a Paris-based mansion confiscated as part of a corruption probe, ruling that the African nation has not shown it has a \u201cplausible right to the return of the building.\u201d",
      "Despite the country\u2019s oil and gas wealth, at least 57% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty, according to the World Bank. Officials, their families and their inner circle, meanwhile, live a life of luxury.",
      "The Equatorial Guinea government did not respond to the AP\u2019s inquiry about the island, its condition and internet access.",
      "Located in the Atlantic Ocean about 315 miles (507 kilometers) from Equatorial Guinea\u2019s coast, Annob\u00f3n is one of the country\u2019s poorest islands and one often at conflict with the central government. With a population of around 5,000 people, the island has been seeking independence from the country for years as it accuses the government of disregarding its residents.",
      "The internet shutdown is the latest in a long history of Malabo\u2019s repressive responses to the island\u2019s political and economic demands, activists say, citing regular arrests and the absence of adequate social amenities like schools and hospitals.",

      "A new airport that opened in Annob\u00f3n in 2013, which was built by Somagec, promised to connect the island to the rest of the country. But not much has improved, locals and activists say. The internet shutdown has instead worsened living conditions there, collapsing key infrastructure, including health care and banking services.",
      "In 2007, Equatorial Guinea entered into a business deal with Somagec, a Moroccan construction company that develops ports and electricity transmission systems across West and Central Africa.",
      "Annob\u00f3n's geological formation and volcanic past make the island rich in rocks and expands Malabo's influence in the Gulf of Guinea, which is abundantly rich in oil. Somagec has also built a port and, according to activists, explored mineral extraction in Annob\u00f3n since it began operations on the island.",
      "Residents and activists said the company's dynamite explosions in open quarries and construction activities have been polluting their farmlands and water supply. The company's work on the island continues.",
      "Residents hoped to pressure authorities to improve the situation with their complaint in July last year. Instead, Obiang then deployed a repressive tactic now common in Africa to cut off access to internet to clamp down on protests and criticisms.",

      "Somagec\u2019s CEO, Roger Sahyoun, denied having a hand in the shutdown and said the company itself has been forced to rely on a private satellite. He defended the dynamite blasting as critical for its construction projects, saying all necessary assessments had been done.",
      "\u201cAfter having undertaken geotechnical and environmental impact studies, the current site where the quarry was opened was confirmed as the best place to meet all the criteria,\u201d Sahyoun said in an email.",
      "The residents, meanwhile, continue to suffer the internet shutdown, unable to use even the private satellite deployed by the company.",
      "\"Annob\u00f3n is very remote and far from the capital and the (rest of) continent,\" said Alicante, the activist from the island. \u201cSo you're leaving people there without access to the rest of the continent ... and incommunicado.\u201d",

      "Translated into several languages, the group posted it throughout the northwestern Spanish city and distributed it at its ever-growing number of hostels.

We have always lived in harmony with tourism, but when it gets out of hand, when the pressure goes beyond what is reasonable, that is when rejection arises,\u201d said Roberto Almu\u00ed\u00f1a, president of the neighborhood association in the old town that's a UNESCO World Heritage site.",
      "The \u201cCamino de Santiago,\u201d known in English as the Way of St. James, dates back to the 9th century, with pilgrims following its converging trails for up to hundreds of kilometers on paths originating in Portugal and France. The modern popularity it gained with the 2010 film \u201cThe Way\u201d starring Martin Sheen was turbocharged more recently by social media and experience-driven travel after the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Last year, a record half-million people signed up to trek one of the approved routes to the cathedral \u2014 equal to five times the city\u2019s resident population, and marking a 725-fold increase over the last four decades. Added to those masses are ordinary tourists not arriving by trail.",
      "The proliferation of short-term rentals drove annual rent prices up 44% from 2018 to 2023, according to a study commissioned by the city council to the Fundaci\u00f3n Universidade da Coru\u00f1a. That led municipal authorities in May to request the regional government classify the area as a high-pressure zone, like Barcelona or San Sebastian, which would help to limit rent increases.",
      "Already, last November, Santiago's city council enacted a ban on Airbnb-style tourist accommodations in the historic center, arguing at the time in a statement that it was \u201ca necessity arising from its significant growth, which has clear effects on the number of housing units available for residents and on their price.\u201d",
      "Sihara P\u00e9rez, a researcher at the University of Santiago, described finding anywhere to rent in the city as \u201cmission impossible,\u201d while Antonio Jerem\u00edas, 27, told The Associated Press that he's considering moving back in with his mother, because his salary working full-time at a warehouse isn\u2019t enough to make ends meet.",
      "Andrea Dopazo, 32, tried to move out of her parents\u2019 house in a neighborhood located fully 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the city center. But her desire to continue living in the place where she grew up and community ties are strong proved futile, and she had to take something in a town outside Santiago.",
      "\u201cThe only people who have been able to stay in the neighborhoods are those who have been lucky \u2014 or unlucky \u2014 enough to inherit an apartment from their grandparents, uncles or parents,\u201d said Dopazo, who works in human resources.",

      "The State Department is refocusing its foreign health assistance programs around multiyear bilateral deals with recipient countries",
      "NEW YORK -- The State Department on Thursday announced it will refocus its foreign health assistance strategy around multiyear bilateral deals with recipient countries, making aid dependent on negotiations that officials say will help reduce waste and advance American priorities.",
      "\u201cWe must keep what is good about our health foreign assistance programs while rapidly fixing what is broken,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a letter about the new strategy. \u201cWe will continue to be the world's health leader and the most generous nation in the world, but we will do so in a way that directly benefits the American people and directly promotes our national interest.\u201d",
      "The new approach aligns with President Donald Trump\u2019s pattern of dealing with other nations transactionally, using direct talks with foreign governments to promote his agenda abroad. It builds on his sharp turn from traditional U.S. foreign assistance, which supporters say helped U.S. interests by stabilizing other countries and economies and building alliances.",
      "It also fits with Trump's concerns that foreign aid in previous administrations had diverged from America's values. His administration has dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, and cut billions in congressionally approved foreign aid money. A foreign aid freeze earlier this year temporarily paused funding for programs including the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which has been credited with saving more than 26 million lives.",
      "The new plan will give countries more \u201cskin in the game\u201d over the health assistance they receive and incentivize governments to work toward ultimately no longer needing U.S. aid, according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to brief reporters before the strategy was made public.",
      "An overview of the plan released by the State Department said global health programs \u201chave become inefficient and wasteful.\u201d The administration says it will focus future foreign health aid dollars on drugs, diagnostic kits and other front line needs while transitioning other things it once funded, such as program management and technical assistance, to governments in recipient countries.",

      "ATLANTA -- Hyundai Motor Group on Thursday confirmed it is going forward with previously announced plans to expand its Georgia plant, just weeks after an immigration raid delayed the startup of an electric vehicle battery plant at the site.",
      "As part of a broader investment strategy, Hyundai said it would spend $2.7 billion to increase production capacity at the Ellabell site by 200,000 over the next three years, to a total of 500,000 vehicles a year.",
      "The company first announced the expansion in March at the grand opening of the plant west of Savannah, and had said in August that it would invest an additional $5 billion in United States overall. But the raid, which included arrests of more than 300 South Korean citizens, led to questions about the wisdom of the Asian nation investing in the U.S..",
      "The company said it now plans to produce 10 models of electric and hybrid gas-electric vehicles in Georgia, up from the current two the plant has been assembling as it ramps up production. Hyundai says it's still on track to expand production worldwide to 5.6 million vehicles a year by 2030. The automaker pledged that 60% of those vehicles will be electric or hybrid powered, targeting sales in South Korea, North America and Europe.",
      "Hyundai said that it plans to make more than 80% of vehicles sold in the United States domestically by 2030, with total domestic content increasing from 60% to 80%. For the first time, the vehicles would include a mid-sized pickup truck, a key vehicle class in the U.S. market. The company already makes the Santa Cruz model, a four-door compact pickup, that it started selling in 2021.",
      "Hyundai CEO Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz has said the immigration raid will delay opening the battery plant by at least two to three months. Spokesperson Michael Stewart said Thursday that the facility will open in the first half of 2026.",
      "Both Hyundai executives and Georgia officials have been trying to calm the situation since the raid, which mushroomed into a diplomatic dispute between South Korea and the United States.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters Tuesday at a ceremony marking the groundbreaking of a Rivian Automotive electric vehicle plant that he remains confident Georgia's business advantages would \u201cwin out\u201d in terms of foreign investment. The raid may even wind up smoothing the way for South Korean employees to more easily obtain legal permission to help build and operate facilities in the United States, he said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had good conversations with companies that are here doing business in Georgia, companies that are looking to do business here,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve had good conversations with people in the White House about the visa issue.\u201d",

      "The $2.7 billion investment confirmed Thursday will go to expanding capacity at the plant and group affiliates, Stewart said. Hyundai and its onsite affiliates currently have 3,129 employees in Ellabell, he said.",
      "Hyundai and its joint-venture partner in the battery plant, LG Energy Solution, had previously announced $12.6 billion of investments at the Georgia site, with pledges to hire at least 8,500 workers by the end of 2031. State and local governments have promised $2.1 billion in tax breaks and other incentives.",

      "Never-before-seen footage shows two Louisiana deputies punching an inmate more than 50 times during a jailhouse strip-search in 2019",
      "MANSFIELD, La. -- The strip search lasted just six minutes, but when it ended, Jarius Brown had a broken nose, fractured eye socket and a badly swollen face.",
      "Never-before-published footage shows why: Two Louisiana sheriff\u2019s deputies pummeled the naked 25-year-old, flinging him around the DeSoto Parish Detention Center laundry room while landing a flurry of 50 punches.",
      "In the aftermath of the 2019 assault, one of the deputies resigned and the other was suspended. Internal records show the sheriff\u2019s office concluded \u201cthere was no way of defending\u201d the deputies' actions.",
      "Yet, that\u2019s just what the Louisiana State Police did, an Associated Press investigation has found. After waiting months to analyze the graphic video and more than a year to even interview Brown, the agency cleared the deputies of wrongdoing. The state police ultimately supported the deputies\u2019 claims that Brown had been the \u201caggressor\" in an altercation that took place after he had been arrested on charges of stealing a car.",
      "The case might have ended there had federal prosecutors not eventually gotten involved and come to the opposite conclusion: Brown had been the victim of excessive force.",
      "The graphic footage remained under wraps for six years but emerged this month in Brown\u2019s long-running lawsuit seeking damages for his injuries. Brown, now 32, declined to comment through his attorneys.",
      "Gary Evans, a former DeSoto Parish district attorney, said the case underscores the safety net the Justice Department long provided in smaller communities \u2014 a role many advocates fear has been thrown into doubt as the department dials back its civil rights enforcement amid President Donald Trump\u2019s mandate to \u201cunleash\u201d the police.",
      "\u201cThis was a great miscarriage of justice at the state level, and it shows the system has broken down and doesn\u2019t protect citizens,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIn a community like this, the federal government is the only avenue for anything to get done.\u201d",
      "Brown\u2019s beating was just the latest in a litany of police misconduct cases in DeSoto Parish, a rural swath of piney woods and rolling farmlands south of Shreveport, Louisiana.",
      "A month before Brown was pummeled, another deputy was charged with malfeasance after tackling and repeatedly punching a man walking into a grocery store. He agreed to a permanent ban from law enforcement in exchange for the charges being dismissed. In another case, a DeSoto Parish deputy was charged with third-degree rape after ordering a woman he arrested to perform oral sex on him.",
      "Russell Graham, a state police spokesperson, declined to explain his agency\u2019s conclusion that there \u201cwas not sufficient evidence\u201d the deputies in Brown's case committed a crime. He attributed delays in the investigation to the COVID-19 pandemic, which began six months after the beating.",
      "\u201cLSP remains committed to thorough, impartial investigations and working with partners to ensure accountability and uphold public trust,\u201d Graham wrote in an email to AP, adding the agency had \u201cconducted a thorough investigation of this matter when it was presented to them.\u201d",
      "Former deputy Javarrea Pouncy pleaded guilty to using excessive force and was sentenced last year to serve about three years in federal prison. He could not be reached for comment.",
      "The other deputy, DeMarkes Grant, who pleaded guilty to obstructing justice, was released from prison in April after serving a 10-month sentence. Grant told AP he was still \u201cstressed out\u201d and had \u201clost a lot\u201d as a result of his conviction. He declined to say whether he regretted the beating.",
      "\u201cWhat has happened has happened,\u201d he said.",
      "Use of force experts questioned the divergent outcomes at the state and federal level, saying Brown never posed a threat and the beating was excessive.",
      "The grainy footage shows a handcuffed Brown calmly walking into the jail\u2019s laundry room before disrobing. The beating begins halfway through the search, after the deputies confront Brown for not squatting as directed so they could fully search him.",

      "Andrew Scott, a former police chief of Boca Raton, Florida, said there was nothing on the video that would have justified the beating. He could only surmise the deputies were \u201cdelivering retribution.\u201d Any police official who justified the beating after watching the video, Scott added, is \u201cnot a competent or truthful expert.\u201d",

      "Louisiana State Police ultimately provided the beating video to Evans\u2019 successor, Charles Adams, who closed the investigation in 2021. Regardless of what the video shows, Adams told AP, the state police report would have made a state prosecution \u201cvery difficult, if not impossible\u201d because it concluded there wasn\u2019t enough evidence of a crime.",

      "Weeks after the September 2019 beating at the jail, Brown pleaded guilty to \u201dunauthorized use of a motor vehicle\u201d and was sentenced to 18 months behind bars. State police interviewed Brown in jail in early 2021 and reported he \u201cdid not want anything done\u201d about the beating and \u201cwas not interested in pursuing the matter criminally or civilly.\u201d",
      "A local judge, Amy McCartney, dismissed the lawsuit Brown filed against the deputies, ruling in 2023 the beating did not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d An appeals court reversed that decision, and Brown\u2019s lawyers are seeking damages for his injuries and medical expenses.",
      "\u201cJarius Brown survived a horrific, unprovoked beating,\u201d said Brown\u2019s attorney, Michael Imbroscio, adding he is \u201centitled to justice.\u201d Brown also is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, which fought a lengthy legal battle related to the state\u2019s statute of limitations on civil claims stemming from police violence.",

      "The annual Fat Bear Week featuring gluttonous brown bears at Alaska\u2019s Katmai National Park and Preserve is back",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The brawny bruins on the Alaska Peninsula are ready to brawl it out to see which will win this year\u2019s fattest bear title in the wildly popular annual online voting contest known as Fat Bear Week.",
      "The main event featuring adult bears starts next week, but first up Thursday is what the National Park Service calls a \u201cchubby cubby appetizer.\u201d Fat Bear Jr. voters can cast ballots through Friday for their favorite adolescent ursine, with the winner advancing to the big show.",
      "The contest, which began in 2014, is meant to showcase the resiliency of the brown bears, which pack on the pounds each fall to survive the harsh winter by gorging on salmon at Brooks River in remote Katmai National Park and Preserve. People can watch the bears on livestream cameras.",
      "\u201cIt really is an opportunity for people to think about how bears survive, what they need to do to survive, what the ecosystem provides them and look at their individual success stories, as well,\u201d said explore.org naturalist Mike Fitz, who started the contest when he was a ranger at Katmai.",
      "This year's sockeye run has been abundant, so voters can expect some especially corpulent contestants.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at the popular online event:",
      "The 12 bears \u2014 which will be announced Monday \u2014 will be featured in the single-elimination, bracket-style tournament. All voting is done online at www.fatbearweek.org, with the winner declared Sept. 30.",
      "The first round features eight bears squaring off in four separate contests to advance to the second round. Four bears receive first-round byes.",
      "There are about 2,200 brown bears within Katmai, a 6,562-square-mile (16,997-square-kilometer) park on the Alaska Peninsula, which extends from the state\u2019s southwest corner toward the Aleutian Islands. To be featured in the contest, the bears must frequent the area of the main Brooks Camp.",
      "Actually weighing the bears would be a dangerous and monumental task, so it's up to voters to judge size by looks alone. Male brown bears at Katmai weigh about 700 to 900 pounds (318 kg to 408 kg) mid-summer and can bloat to over a 1,000 pounds (454 kg) by September or October, thanks to successful foraging.",
      "A 1,200-pound (544 kg) male bear isn\u2019t unusual at Katmai. Others have been estimated to be about 1,400 pounds (635 kg). Females are about half to two-thirds the size of adult males.",
      "There are factors other than girth to consider, Fitz said.",
      "Voters could consider the challenges some contestants have had to overcome, such as the multitasking females who protect their young and produce milk for the cubs while also fattening up for winter themselves.",
      "There\u2019s precedent for a mama bear to take the prize. Grazer, the two-time defending Fat Bear Week champion, beat one of the biggest bears in the Brooks River, Chunk, in last year\u2019s final.",

      "Chunk is back at the park this year but returned to Brooks River in June with a broken jaw, Fitz said. The right side of his jaw is hanging loose and will never heal properly.",
      "It probably happened in a fight with another bear. When they attack each other, they target the head and neck, and sometimes they lock jaws. The torque can snap a brown bear\u2019s mandible.",

Security Council on Thursday that he would leave his position in the \"near future,\u201d but did not say when. The 69-year-old diplomat said he had intended for a while \u201cto move on for personal reasons\u201d and stayed on because of rapid and major developments in Syria.",
      "Pedersen was appointed as the U.N.'s special envoy to Syria in 2018, seven years into the country's civil war. Amid the chaos, Islamic State group militants took over significant parts of the nation. In 2019, the group lost the last sliver of land its fighters controlled, but sleeper cells linger.",
      "Pedersen was charged with implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254, which aimed to usher in a political solution to the conflict between the government of then-President Bashar Assad and its opponents, but efforts to broker one repeatedly faltered.",
      "The civil war began after mass anti-government protests in 2011 were met by a brutal government crackdown. The fighting killed nearly half a million people and displaced half of the country\u2019s prewar population of 23 million.",
      "The conflict was largely frozen for years, with the country carved up into areas controlled by the government and different opposition groups until December 2024, when Assad was ousted in a lightning rebel offensive led by Syria\u2019s now-interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa.",
      "The country has continued to grapple with deep political, ethnic and religious divides.",
      "Pedersen called for international support for Syria and for its government to give all its people a voice in their nation\u2019s next chapter.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m relieved the truth came out and my charges have been dropped,\u201d El Sammak told The Associated Press. \u201cAt the same, I\u2019m deeply disappointed in the betrayal of the NYPD and how long it took for something that was so clear to everyone \u2014 my innocence \u2014 to be made official.\u201d",

      "Oregon authorities say DNA has helped identify a woman's remains after 49 years",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Valerie Nagle spent decades wondering what happened to her older sister who was last seen in Oregon in 1974. She searched online databases of unidentified persons cases looking for her and sent DNA to a popular ancestry website in the hopes of finding a match.",
      "That all changed in June when authorities in Oregon called Nagle \u201cout of the blue\u201d to ask about comparing her DNA to a cold case known as \u201cSwamp Mountain Jane Doe,\u201d she said. Nagle\u2019s DNA ultimately helped confirm that the remains of a woman found near a mountain creek in Oregon\u2019s Central Cascades in 1976 were that of her sister, Marion Vinetta Nagle McWhorter.",
      "Oregon State Police publicly released the news this week after the remains were identified in June.",
      "\u201cI was very surprised that they called,\u201d Nagle, a 62-year-old who lives in Seattle, told The Associated Press. She was 11 when her sister went missing. \u201cI was really glad that they found me through DNA.\u201d",
      "McWhorter was last seen at a shopping mall in the Portland suburb of Tigard when she was 21.",
      "She was the oldest of five siblings, and Nagle was the youngest. Their mother was Alaska Native of the Ahtna Athabascan people, Nagle said, and her big sister had been named for an aunt who died in a boarding school for Indigenous children in Alaska in 1940.",
      "High rates of disappearances of Indigenous people, particularly women, have festered for generations amid inadequate public safety resources.",
      "Nagle, who lived in New York with her parents and one of her brothers at the time of her sister's disappearance, said her mother may have contacted authorities but that she wasn\u2019t sure of the exact extent of the efforts made by her parents to find her sister.",
      "\u201cI mean, there were, you know, efforts to search, but it was limited,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have that much to go on.\u201d",
      "She does know her sister had come from California to Oregon with plans to continue on to Seattle and eventually Alaska when she called an aunt who lived near the Tigard shopping mall for a ride in October 1974 \u2014 but the aunt didn\u2019t end up meeting up with her, Nagle said.",
      "Nearly 20 years later, the aunt shared another detail with Nagle: When McWhorter called her that day, she told her that a man in a white pickup truck had offered to give her a ride. It was unclear why her aunt waited that long to share that information.",

      "In 2010, a bone sample from McWhorter's remains was sent to the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification, and a profile was created in the national missing persons database NamUs, state police said. An additional bone sample was submitted for DNA extraction in 2020, allowing for a unique genetic marker profile to be produced.",
      "In 2023, Nagle did a DNA test when she signed up for Ancestry, a genealogy company with a DNA database, hoping it would yield a clue about her sister, she said.",
      "But the breakthrough came in April when a first cousin once removed uploaded their genetic profile to FamilyTreeDNA, another genealogy company with a DNA database, Oregon State Police spokesperson Jolene Kelley said in an email Thursday. That allowed genealogists to get a better idea of McWhorter's family tree and led them to find that Nagle was a surviving family member.",
      "\u201cThis case was cold for 49 years. That means that family members lived and died without ever knowing what happened to their missing loved one,\" State Forensic Anthropologist Hailey Collord-Stalder said in a statement, adding that McWhorter \u201clikely did not go missing voluntarily.\u201d",

      "Yancey County saw the region's highest percentage increase. The number of homeless students went from 21 in the 2023-2024 school year to 112 last school year. All but 15 were homeless due to Helene.",
      "Some students enrolled in other school systems, at least temporarily. Others never returned.",
      "Terri Dolan of Swannanoa sent her two young children to stay with her parents in Charlotte ahead of the storm. After seeing the extent of the devastation, Dolan had them enroll in school there. They stayed over a month before returning home.",
      "\u201cMy job is to make money for our family and their job is to go to school,'\u201d Dolan says she\u2019d always told her kids. \"Just because the school wasn\u2019t open here, I felt like they needed to go to school and do their job.\u201d",
      "Some districts receive federal money for services such as transporting homeless students to their usual school buildings and providing tutoring under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. But districts must apply in a competitive process, and they can't request more money immediately after a natural disaster until the next application cycle. Many miss out on McKinney-Vento funding entirely.",
      "Helene-impacted students made up at least a fifth of the homeless population in 16 counties, but only six counties received McKinney-Vento money last funding cycle. Nationally, only 1 in 5 school districts receives McKinney-Vento money due to limited funds, said Barbara Duffield, executive director of Schoolhouse Connection, a nonprofit that advocates for homeless students.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s a disaster, it\u2019s going to involve districts that don\u2019t get money from McKinney-Vento,\u201d Duffield said.",
      "Gwendolyn Bode, a pre-law student at Appalachian State University, had to leave her mud-wrecked apartment complex after Helene. Told she couldn\u2019t get campus housing, she found an Airbnb where she could stay at until her FEMA housing application went through, and then she moved into a hotel.",
      "She felt like she was drowning as she tried to keep up with her classes and a part-time job.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you what I learned,\" Bode said. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell you when I went to class, because (mentally) I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d She found more stability after moving into an apartment for the spring semester.",
      "For Natalie Briggs, now 13, the grief of losing almost everything, coupled with the tight quarters in her grandparents' basement, sometimes got to her \u2014 and to her mother, Liz Barker. Barker said it felt like a \u201ctime with no rules\u201d because there was so much to deal with on top of her job as a health care worker.",
      "The circumstances sometimes led to friction. But Barker said overall, she and Natalie had \u201cdone pretty well\u201d together.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s been a little bit more loving since all of this happened,\u201d Barker said, smiling at her daughter.",

      "The limiting of duty-free organic sugar imports and new tariffs are expected to cause the prices of all kinds of organic products from granola to yogurt to rise in the coming months",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- The price of most organic food could jump this fall due to new policies and tariffs on imported organic sugar, frustrating manufacturers who say the actions won't help sugar growers but could put some food companies out of business.",
      "More than 90% of organic sugar used by U.S. manufacturers is imported. The price of that product increased in August when the Trump administration imposed steep trade tariffs, and will rise even more when high-tier duties on most organic sugar imports take effect Oct. 1.",
      "The result, according to the Organic Trade Association, is that the price of organic sugar is expected to soar by an average of 30%, increasing costs of producing most organic foods \u2014 everything from yogurt to cookies.",
      "Each year, the U.S. imports 1,825 tons (1,656 metric tons) of specialty sugar because it\u2019s required under a World Trade Organization agreement. But demand for organic sugar far exceeds that amount, so the U.S. Department of Agriculture sets an annual quota for the amount of specialty sugar that can be imported into the U.S. duty-free.",
      "Last year, the quota was 231,485 tons (210,000 metric tons), which still wasn\u2019t enough to meet demand. This year, the USDA\u2019s quota taking effect Oct. 1 will be zero, and all organic sugar imports beyond the WTO minimum will be hit with high out-of-quota duties.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said its restrictions on specialty sugar imports are intended to help the U.S. sugar industry. The department didn\u2019t respond to inquiries about its new sugar policy.",
      "The limits on duty-free imports of specialty sugar plus a new 50% tariff on Brazil, which supplies 40% of the U.S.'s organic sugar, is especially difficult because organic products are already more expensive than their conventional counterparts. Growers must meet more requirements to be certified organic, such as restrictions on pesticides and fertilizers.",
      "U.S. manufacturers say that buying domestic organic sugar isn\u2019t an option because there is only one U.S. farm that produces the specialty crop, and converting a conventional farm to organic takes at least three years.",
      "They warn the combined effect of the tariff and import caps may force them either to raise prices or curb production.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially punishing domestic manufacturers for using an ingredient that we really can\u2019t obtain domestically, and don\u2019t have any prospects of obtaining domestically any time in the near future,\u201d said Britt Lundgren, who oversees government affairs for organic yogurt maker Stonyfield.",
      "Tom Chapman, co-CEO of the Organic Trade Association, said he expects \u201cdramatic impacts.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe high tier tariff is so high that we don't see that it's an absorbable rate of tariff, in addition to all the other tariffs that would apply,\u201d Chapman said.",
      "Organic food manufacturers will buy most of the imported organic sugar, though some will be offered on grocery shelves, where home bakers likely will see increased prices.",
      "Demand for organic sugar had already been outpacing imports for the past several years but that did not spur any new domestic producers, organic food manufacturers said.",

      "How much prices will change depends on how much sugar is used in the product. For example, sweeteners that are made almost entirely from organic sugar are likely to see bigger price increases than dairy products, where organic sugar is not the main ingredient.",
      "Many organic food manufacturers are smaller operations, so they are more sensitive to increases in input costs, Willerton said. Some of them may not have the margins to absorb the cost, and they're unable to replace organic sugar substitutes because it would require product reformulation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of small companies involved in this business,\u201d Willerton said. \u201cThese small premium companies producing these products are literally going to find themselves priced out of the market.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser on Thursday defended her policies to Congress as President Donald Trump's law enforcement surge is in its second month and lawmakers act to further limit the city's authority.",
      "She was invited to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to answer questions about crime in the nation's capital. Trump issued an emergency order last month that federalized the city's police department and launched a surge of law enforcement. The emergency order expired earlier this month but federal agencies and the National Guard continue their operations in the city.",
      "Bowser listed off the city's accomplishments in reducing crime, acknowledging that the federal intervention had enhanced those achievements.",
      "\u201cAny crime is too much crime,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cBut we\u2019re trending in the right direction.\u201d",
      "Bowser is leading the city at a time when the district\u2019s self-governance is being challenged in ways never before seen since the passage of the Home Rule Act of 1973, which grants the district some autonomy. Federal leaders retain significant control over local affairs, including the approval of the budget and laws passed by the D.C council.",
      "Committee chair Rep. James Comer berated Bowser and other city officials for D.C. crime, opening the hearing with a litany of recent offenses, many of them crimes involving current and former congressional staff members, including the fatal shooting of Congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym.",
      "\u201cThese high crime rates are largely driven by historically high rates of juvenile crime, which were enabled by ultra-progressive, soft on crime policies enacted by the D.C. Council and supported by the D.C. Attorney General,\u201d he said.",
      "Comer also talked about other changes in D.C. law that had eliminated mandatory minimum sentences for most crimes as well as changes that restricted local police from pursing criminals.",
      "\u201cOfficers cannot execute their duties as effectively, leaving morale, retention and recruitment numbers at historic lows for the Metro Police Department,\u201d he said. \u201cThese actions send every signal to criminals, especially juveniles, that they can commit crimes in the district without accountability.\u201d",
      "Trump has touted the law enforcement surge as a resounding success in driving down the city\u2019s crime rate \u2014 an assertion Bowser has supported. But data showed that crime was already falling before the federal intervention.",
      "The city\u2019s crime has been a central theme for Republicans, including Trump, who proclaimed the emergency in August because of what he described as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and out of control crime. Trump has threatened to issue another emergency order if Bowser follows through on her promise to not cooperate with immigration enforcement.",

      "The bills in question \u2014 including lowering the age at which juveniles can be charged as adults for some crimes to 14 from 16, as well as eliminating D.C.\u2019s role in selecting judges and leaving that solely to the president, passed out of the committee last week. The House Rules Committee passed the same group of bills on Monday and the House, with a number of Democrats supporting the measures, approved the bills.",

      "He called on Congress to help instead, by better resourcing prison-related organizations, fill judicial vacancies and allow the D.C. attorney general to prosecute misdemeanors, which are often overlooked by the U.S. Attorney.",

      "\u201cThese 14 athletes have come forward together hoping to encourage others abused by Rob Murphy to see it wasn\u2019t just them, they did nothing wrong, and NCSU should have protected them,\u201d Sutton said in a statement.",

      "Stephen Colbert, whose show was canceled by CBS two months ago,\u00a0called Kimmel's suspension \"blatant censorship.\"",

      "Their guests the day after Kimmel's suspension varied widely. Fallon's guests were actor Jude Law, journalist Tom Llamas and actor and singer Jonathan Groff \u2014 none of whom addressed Kimmel's situation.",
      "Stewart and Colbert interviewed guests who could address censorship concerns raised by Kimmel's suspension. American and Filipino journalist and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Maria Ressa spoke to Stewart.",
      "When Stewart asked Ressa, the author of \"How to Stand Up to a Dictator,\" for tips on coping with the current moment, Ressa recounted how she and her colleagues at the news site Rappler \"just kept going\" when she was faced with 11 arrest warrants in one year under the Philippines' then-President Rodrigo Duterte.",
      "\"We just kept doing our jobs. We just kept putting one foot in front of the other,\" Ressa said.",
      "Kimmel's show was \"preempted indefinitely\" by ABC on Wednesday following comments he made about the reaction to Kirk's killing on Monday and Tuesday nights.

    "story": [
      "Rapper Cardi B said she will sue anyone who takes her to court in the future after winning a recent assault case in California.",
      "\"This will be the last time that somebody sues me and takes me to court and I won't sue back,\" Cardi B told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I'm gonna sue you until your grandkids is paying me cause I'm so tired of this.\"",
      "Earlier this month, a jury found Cardi B not liable after deliberating for less than an hour in a California civil trial. A security guard had accused the rapper of assault, and her testimony went viral when she candidly admitted to calling the security guard names.",
      "\"When the attorney asked me, like, 'What was you calling her?' You cannot sit here and lie and be like, 'I wasn't calling her no names.' That's not the truth,\" she said. \"I said what I said for real. Like, just don't lie.\"",
      "Following her court victory, Cardi B made headlines when she threw a pen at a reporter who asked a question about her pregnancy, which she had not yet confirmed, and asked if she was concerned about \"paternity issues\" with NFL player Stefon Diggs.",
      "\"I threw it at the floor so he could shut ... up,\" she said, explaining that she thought the question was \"disrespectful\" and \"distasteful.\"",
      "Co-parenting with Offset",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Belcalis Alm\u00e1nzar, filed for divorce from fellow rapper Offset in July 2024 after seven years of marriage. The couple has three children together, and the divorce has not yet been finalized, but Cardi B says she's been ready to move on.",
      "\"I am so tired of people, like, associating me with somebody that is from the past because I filed for divorce a year ago. That should be very clear. I don't deal with that, I don't mess with that, I don't have no contact with that,\" she said.",
      "In a new song \"Man of Your Word,\" from her upcoming album, Cardi B reflects on the relationship, rapping: \"Seven years, I admit it wasn't all bad. Skeletons in my closet too\u2026\" The lyrics continue, \"As a wife I should've realized when you were hurt, but instead I put my music first\u2026But I really do wish you the best. Continue being a winner. If I had one wish, I wish you would've been a man of your word.\"",
      "When asked about the lyrics, she said simply: \"I just wish he was a better person. But it is what it is. Be a better person for your kids.\"",
      "Regarding whether they could successfully co-parent their three children, Cardi B said \"not right now.\"",
      "\"I don't really have hate in my heart anymore. I think he has, like, some type of hate in his heart right now. And I don't know how long that's going to take, because somebody could say it, but their actions don't show it,\" she said.",
      "Cardi B said she is hopeful for unity with Offset.",
      "\"I don't know how long that's going to take for him, but that's always been my wish. I get along with everybody that I dated. We all move on. There shouldn't be any animosity. Your life, my life, separate. We should be able to raise kids. We should be able to ask each other questions. We should be able to say, \"Hey, look what one of the kids just did. Look at the report card,\" she said.",
      "Handling fame and criticism",
      "Despite her tough public persona, Cardi B acknowledged that criticism affects her deeply.",
      "\"A lotta things get to me, you know what I'm saying? I'm the type of person to think and be like, 'What would my daughter think of me? Or, \"What would my mom think of me?\" Or, \"What would my grandparents think of me?\"",
      "She explained that responding to critics is necessary for her mental health.",
      "\"You can't always bottle it inside, because that turns you crazy. That's why some celebrities, they do drugs, they start developing mental issues and stuff like that,\" she said. \"You have to say it. Let it out.\"",
      "The rapper said she sometimes wants to \"go off the grid\" and disappear to a Caribbean island for a year because of the constant scrutiny, but refuses to give up because of what it would teach her daughter.",
      "\"Imagine one day me telling my daughter that. Like, it's like, 'Oh, why'd I give up? Because I couldn't take it.' That's me raising her to be weak on criticism,\" she said.",
      "The interview comes as Cardi B prepares to launch her new album and tour. She credited her strong support system of family, friends and colleagues for helping her navigate fame.",
      "\"Nobody in my team kisses my ass, or my friends or nothing,\" she said. \"I don't want people to cuddle me 'cause I want to be able to see the truth.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Academy Award-winning actor-director Robert Redford (Aug. 18, 1936-Sept. 16, 2025) was one of the biggest movie stars to ever grace the screen. His startlingly-magnetic charisma in such films as \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" \"The Way We Were,\" \"The Sting\" and \"All the President's Men,\" and his nonchalance about his striking good looks, made him one of the leading box office draws of the 1970s and '80s.",
      "He became as well known for founding the Sundance Institute, using his celebrity to help nurture independent films while promoting generations of young filmmakers, as well as environmental and social justice issues. Since 1985 the institute hosted the internationally famous Sundance Film Festival, which has been the launching pad for innumerable talents, from Quentin Tarantino, John Sayles and Christopher Nolan to the Coen Brothers, Ryan Coogler and Jordan Peele, and for such audience favorites as \"Sex, Lies and Videotape,\" \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" \"Beasts of the Southern Wild,\" and \"The Blair Witch Project.\" In 1989 the New York Times called Redford \"a godfather to the American independent film movement.\"",
      "Yet, according to Redford, his fame was hardly predictable. \"I was so much the last choice\" for the role of the Sundance Kid opposite Paul Newman, he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006. \"They tried everything to keep me out of the picture because I wasn't known, compared to Paul.\"",
      "His performance changed all that. Four years later, Redford and Newman re-teamed in Hill's Oscar-winning caper, \"The Sting,\" which won seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Redford was also nominated for best actor for his performance as a small-time con artist out for revenge against a big-city gambler (played by Robert Shaw).",
      "Redford's remarkable screen presence was a highlight of a slew of pictures: \"Downhill Racer,\" \"The Hot Rock,\" \"Jeremiah Johnson,\" \"The Candidate,\" \"The Way We Were\" with Barbra Streisand, \"The Great Gatsby\" with Mia Farrow, \"The Great Waldo Pepper,\" \"Three Days of the Condor\" with Faye Dunaway, \"The Electric Horseman\" with Jane Fonda, and \"Brubaker.\"",
      "But his most surprising film was one which he produced and fought for: the acclaimed 1976 drama, \"All the President's Men,\" the story of Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who uncovered the Watergate scandal. \"It took four years, and the studio, they said, 'Politics? I don't think so,'\" Redford said in 2006. \"'You know, Watergate is a dead issue.' And I said, 'It's not. It's a detective story about investigative journalism and about the American trait of hard work, and hard work [which] led to something that spared us the loss of our first amendment. That to me is worth making.\"",
      "Redford starred in hit after hit, but he told \"Sunday Morning \" in 2018 many of those films he's never watched. Really? \"I don't know. I haven't ever counted 'em, but a lot,\" Redford said. \"'Cause I thought if I look at myself too much, I'm gonna be too aware of myself and that means when I go to do something new, I won't be able to do it without being slightly aware of what I'm doing rather than just being free.\"",
      "He moved on to a job where he wouldn't have to look at himself \u2014 behind the camera, as director of \"Ordinary People,\" starring Mary Tyler Moore and Donald Sutherland. The film won best picture, best supporting actor for Timothy Hutton (in his film debut), and best director for Redford.",
      "While he continued appearing on screen (\"The Natural,\" \"Out of Africa\" with Meryl Streep, \"Legal Eagles,\" \"Indecent Proposal,\" \"Sneakers,\" \"The Last Castle,\" \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier,\" \"Truth,\" \"All Is Lost,\" \"A Walk in the Woods,\" \"The Old Man & the Gun\"), he returned to the director's chair eight times, with an eclectic mix of stories and genres: \"The Milagro Beanfield War,\" about a land war pitting a Hispanic farmer against real estate interests; \"A River Runs Though It,\" a period drama of family and fly-fishing, with Brad Pitt; \"Quiz Show,\" about TV's quiz show scandal in the 1950s; \"The Horse Whisperer,\" about a horse trainer with a remarkable gift; \"The Legend of Bagger Vance,\" a golf fable with Will Smith and Matt Damon; \"Lions for Lambs,\" a political drama of wartime co-starring Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep; \"The Conspirator,\" about the Confederate plot surrounding Lincoln's assassination; and the political thriller \"The Company You Keep.\"",
      "Meanwhile, much of his energy was devoted to the success of the Sundance Institute and its eponymous film festival, held in the mountains of Utah each January, and to its workshops and screenwriting labs.",
      "In 2018, the private Redford reflected to \"Sunday Morning\" on a favorite saying by T.S. Eliot:\" \"There's only the trying. The rest is not our business. It's one of my favorite phrases. Because you can't guarantee where the trying is going to get you. So, you can't guarantee the result. The only thing there is in its place is the trying. That's where the action is.\""

The film also won best picture, and for Redford a best director Oscar.",
      "In the decade following \"Ordinary People,\" he appeared on screen only a few times \u2014 in the baseball tale \"The Natural,\" the Oscar-winning \"Out of Africa\" opposite Meryl Streep, and the romantic comedy \"Legal Eagles.\"",
      "He would also return to the director's chair eight times, with an eclectic mix of stories and genres: \"The Milagro Beanfield War,\" about a land war pitting a Hispanic farmer against real estate interests; \"A River Runs Though It,\" a period drama of family and fly-fishing, with Brad Pitt; \"Quiz Show,\" about TV's quiz show scandal in the 1950s; \"The Horse Whisperer,\" about a horse trainer with a remarkable gift; \"The Legend of Bagger Vance,\" a golf fable with Will Smith and Matt Damon; \"Lions for Lambs,\" a political drama of wartime co-starring Tom Cruise and Streep; \"The Conspirator,\" about the Confederate plot surrounding Lincoln's assassination; and the political thriller \"The Company You Keep.\"",
      "\"One of the lions has passed,\" Streep said in a statement Tuesday. \"Rest in peace my lovely friend.\"",
      "Scarlett Johansson, who said Redford cast her in \"The Horse Whisperer\" when she was just 11 years old, remembered him as someone who was \"patient and warm and kind.\"",
      "\"Every day before each scene, he would take the time to sit with me and walk me through all of the beats that led my character up until that particular point in the story. No matter the reality of the days rush, I always felt he had all the time in the world for our work,\" Johansson said. \"Bob taught me what acting could be, and it was from his generosity and patience that I was inspired to pursue the possibilities of the craft.\"",
      "Redford made perhaps his biggest contribution to movies by founding the Sundance Institute, which developed and fostered the work of young and diverse independent filmmakers outside of mainstream Hollywood. Begun in 1981, Sundance encompassed workshops with writers, directors and actors, and later hosted the internationally recognized film festival.",
      "Asked by Collider in 2019 his reasons for founding the institute, Redford said, \"The goal for me was very simple: to celebrate people who don't get celebrated, who are ignored or undiscovered and who deserve to be discovered.\"",
      "The road to stardom",
      "Charles Robert Redford Jr. was born on Aug. 18, 1936, in Santa Monica, California. Raised in Van Nuys, Redford described his neighborhood as \"lower working class.\" Though he lived in the shadow of Hollywood, he had no interest in a career in the movies.",
      "\"I grew up in kind of a rough neighborhood,\" he said. \"We'd go to matinees, any time there was a love scene on the screen, we'd go, 'Oh boo, you tell 'em lover,' you know, and make fun of the scene. The idea that I would be that guy is just too much for me to take!\"",
      "He attended the University of Colorado in Boulder, where he had an athletic scholarship, but was kicked out after his freshman year for drinking, shortly after the death of his mother, Martha, in 1955.",
      "He ventured to Europe, studying art in France, Italy and Spain, before settling in New York City, where he took art classes at the Pratt Institute while also studying acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He described being self-conscious in his early experiences onstage, but soon recognized \"something unfamiliar was clicking inside.\" He performed in school productions of \"The Seagull\" and \"Antigone,\" attracting an agent, and was soon on Broadway in \"Tall Story\" and \"The Highest Tree,\" before starring with Julie Harris in \"Little Moon of Alban,\" in 1960.",
      "He also made guest appearances on TV shows such as \"Maverick,\" \"Playhouse 90,\" \"Perry Mason,\" \"Naked City,\" \"Route 66\" and \"The Twilight Zone.\" He co-starred with Jason Robards in a 1960 TV version of Eugene O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh,\" directed by Sidney Lumet.",
      "In 1961 he starred on Broadway in \"Sunday in New York,\" and two years later in the Neil Simon comedy \"Barefoot in the Park,\" directed by Mike Nichols. It was a role he repeated in the 1967 film, opposite Jane Fonda.",
      "\"I held some fantasy out in my head that I would return to art, and I carried that maybe five years into my acting career,\" Redford said, \"and then finally one day just looked at myself in the mirror, and I said, 'Who are we kidding? This is what you do. This is what you do well and like it. Give up the idea that you're going to maintain this career in art.'\"",
      "His film appearances grew following a big screen debut in the 1962 World War II drama \"War Hunt\" (co-starring future director Sydney Pollack).",
      "But Redford wasn't considered a big enough name to co-star with Paul Newman in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" \u2014 the studio wanted anyone but him, even after the film's director and screenwriter went to bat for him. It wasn't until Newman, 11 years his senior and already a big name, met with Redford and told the studio he wanted Redford to co-star, that he got the part.",
      "It was a generosity that Redford returned some years later, when he went to bat for Newman to co-star in \"The Sting.\"",
      "\"Follow the money\"",
      "While on a press tour for \"The Candidate,\" his 1972 satire about a California lawyer's run for Senate against a popular incumbent, Redford sought out Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward after reading some of the reports he and Carl Bernstein had written on the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. The movie star was rebuffed. [Bernstein feared Republican backlash to their reporting if it was found out they were talking with Hollywood.] They finally met up in 1973, along with screenwriter William Goldman, and in 1974 Redford bought the film rights to the pair's yet-to-be-published book, \"All the President's Men,\" for $450,000.",
      "Starring Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, and directed by Alan J. Pakula, the film captured the intensity of the reporters' hunt for answers as they sought to \"follow the money\" and unravel the Watergate scandal.",
      "Never mind that audiences knew how the story ended (Nixon resigned); the film was a critical and commercial hit, and became an inspiration for generations of young journalists.",
      "Once Redford had gotten the taste of directing with \"Ordinary People,\" his appearances in front of the camera grew fewer: \"Havana,\" \"Sneakers,\" \"Indecent Proposal,\" \"Up Close & Personal,\" \"The Last Castle,\" \"Spy Game,\" and \"An Unfinished Life\" filled out his acting resume for the years between 1990 and 2005. He also narrated the 1992 documentary \"Incident at Oglala,\" about Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier. Redford's companies, Wildwood Enterprises and Sundance Productions, produced at least two dozen feature films.",
      "Meanwhile, much of his energy was devoted to the success of the Sundance Institute and its film festival, held in the mountains of Utah each January.",
      "Welcome to Sundance",
      "In 1978 the Utah Film Commission established the United States Film Festival as a means to draw visitors to the Wasatch Mountains for something other than skiing. The festival was co-created by Sterling Van Wagenen, who was a cousin of Redford's then-wife, Lola Van Wagenen. Advocating to include independent features in the program, Redford agreed to show up at the festival and participate in a panel. Afterwards, he formed the Sundance Institute, to aid filmmakers wishing to make stories that could not find a home among Hollywood studios that were chasing hugely commercial pictures.",
      "In 1985 the U.S. Film & Video Festival was struggling financially, and so Sundance took it over, eventually replacing the name with its own. Moved to Park City, the festival drew ever-increasing numbers of filmmakers, buyers, agents, publicists, journalists and fans to the tiny town. Beyond the festival, industry professionals would mentor young filmmakers in workshops and screenwriting labs. Wes Anderson's \"Bottle Rocket,\" Kimberly Peirce's \"Boys Don't Cry,\" Paul Thomas Anderson's \"Hard Eight,\" and Miranda July's \"Me and You and Everyone We Know\" were all developed in the Sundance Labs.",
      "In 1989 the festival blew up with the success of Stephen Soderbergh's \"sex, lies, and videotape,\" which won the Audience Award and was picked up by Miramax. Its subsequent theatrical release earned the low-budget dramedy a cool $25 million and an Oscar nomination.",
      "Since then, films and filmmakers who have broken out at the festival have included Quentin Tarantino (\"Reservoir Dogs\"), Robert Rodriguez (\"El Mariachi\"), Kevin Smith (\"Clerks\"), Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\"), Todd Solandz (\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\"), Ryan Coogler (\"Fruitvale Station\"), Damien Chazelle (\"Whiplash\"), Jordan Peele (\"Get Out\"), and the audience favorites \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" \"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" and \"The Blair Witch Project.\"",
      "Sundance also started a program to develop theatrical works, which has resulted in such productions as \"The Laramie Project,\" \"Light in the Piazza,\" and \"Angels in America.\"",
      "Not quite retiring",
      "In 2012 Redford was executive producer and narrator of the documentary \"Watershed,\" about the politics surrounding the Colorado River \u2014 the environmental and cultural damage from misuse of a vital natural resource. Asked by ThinkProgress whether his films can make a difference, Redford said, \"I've given up the idea that I can really change anything, and I just do the best I can. It's either that or do nothing, and we know that nothing doesn't work.\"",
      "The following year Redford starred in \"All Is Lost,\" playing a solo sailor facing disaster at sea when his small craft is crippled in an accident. He did much of the stunt work himself, in a \"storm-tossed\" water tank (the spray from fire hoses cost him partial hearing in one ear). He was hailed for his remarkable performance in which he uttered virtually no dialogue.",
      "\"All in all, it was worth it,\" he told the Salt Lake Tribune. \"I'm proud of the work. I felt it was a chance to do something at this point that was different and bold.\"",
      "Redford also added his name to the roster of Hollywood stars recruited for the Marvel Universe, appearing in \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" and \"Avengers: Endgame\" as (spoiler alert) the leader of a plot against S.H.I.E.L.D. He also starred opposite Nick Nolte in \"A Walk in the Woods,\" played Dan Rather in \"Truth,\" and appeared opposite an animated creature in the Disney film \"Pete's Dragon.\" He also reteamed with Jane Fonda in the romance \"Our Souls at Night,\" their fourth film together.",
      "In 2018 he starred in \"The Old Man & the Gun,\" as an aging bank robber on the run. Redford told \"Sunday Morning\" that he connected very easily with the protagonist as an outlaw: \"I think probably I must've been born with an outlaw sensibility, in terms of my nature, yeah. Because from the time I was just a little kid, I was always wanting to go away from the rules. I wanted to \u2014 I didn't want to break any, I just didn't want to be held by them. In kindergarten, I ran away three times!\"",
      "With the film's release he announced he would be retiring from acting \u2014 but he remained active with voice work and producing documentaries.",
      "In addition to his Oscar win for \"Ordinary People,\" Redford was nominated for directing and producing \"Quiz Show,\" and in 2002 he received an honorary Academy Award for his impact on the industry. Three years later he was named a Kennedy Center honoree. At the Washington ceremony, Paul Newman ribbed Redford, referring to his reputation for lateness: \"Backstage they think the only reason he's even in the vicinity was because they told him this whole thing was yesterday.\"",
      "In 2016 Redford received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The citation read: \"His art and activism continue to shape our nation's cultural heritage, inspiring millions to laugh, cry, think, and change.\" At the presentation ceremony, President Barack Obama remarked, \"As an actor, director, producer, and as an advocate, he has not stopped \u2014 and apparently drives so fast that he had breakfast in Napa and dinner in Salt Lake.\"",
      "Redford was married to Lola Van Wagenen in 1958; they divorced in 1995. They had four children: Scott, who died at age 2 months from sudden infant death syndrome; Shauna, an artist; James (Jamie), a filmmaker and environmental activist, who died of cancer in 2020; and Amy, a director.",
      "In 2009, Redford married artist and environmental activist Sibylle Szaggars.",
      "In 2018, the private Redford reflected to \"Sunday Morning\" on a favorite saying by T.S. Eliot: \"'There's only the trying. The rest is not our business.' It's one of my favorite phrases. Because you can't guarantee where the trying is going to get you. So, you can't guarantee the result. The only thing there is in its place is the trying. That's where the action is.\"",

      "Saudi Arabia will host the Riyadh Comedy Festival, which organizers say will be the \"world's largest comedy festival,\" from Sept. 26 to Oct. 9. Some of North America's most popular comedians, along with comics from Europe and elsewhere, are featured on the bill, including Dave Chapelle, Kevin Hart and Bill Burr.",
      "The festival will be the latest in a series of sports and cultural events hosted by Saudi Arabia's government that critics say amount to an effort to obscure the country's reputation for rampant human rights abuses.",
      "\"The Saudi government has invested billions into high profile entertainment events like these in a deliberate effort to whitewash the country's human rights record and deflect from the egregious abuses that continue to happen inside of the country,\" Human Rights Watch researcher Joey Shea told CBS News. \"These investments are a part of the broader strategy to... have people thinking about a comedy event, for example, rather than the soaring number of executions that are happening inside of the country.\"",
      "HRW noted specifically the state execution of journalist Turki Al-Jasser, who was killed in June following seven years of detention after reportedly being identified as the author of several anonymous tweets criticizing the Saudi royal family.",
      "Al-Jasser had been convicted of terrorism and high treason on the basis of posts he was accused of authoring, according to UNESCO.",
      "UNESCO's director general Audrey Azoulay condemned his execution, saying: \"A death sentence imposed on journalists constitutes a serious attack on freedom of expression and freedom of the press. Journalists must be able to report without fear for their lives or safety.\"",
      "Reporters Without Borders, an organization that works to protect journalists, branded the charges against Al-Jasser as \"false.\"",
      "\"This execution of a journalist went forward to very little international criticism and this is clearly a result of these billions that had been invested in the country's whitewashing strategy,\" Shea told CBS News.",
      "When asked whether they believed the comedians would be able to freely tell jokes at the festival, the HRW researcher predicted there would be clear red lines drawn by organizers to prevent any criticism of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, who has already taken over as ruler of the highly conservative Islamic kingdom, as well as his policies and the broader royal family.",
      "Shea called on the high-profile entertainers attending the event \u2014 funding for which comes from the Saudi government's General Entertainment Authority \u2014   to mitigate the positive effect that their presence might have on the country's reputation for human rights abuses, including by \"speaking out about the abuses.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said he \"made progress\" on the approval of a deal to resolve ownership of\u00a0TikTok\u00a0during a \"very productive\" conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday morning.",
      "During the call, which was set up to finalize an agreement\u00a0over the popular social media platform, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that he agreed to visit China \"in the early part of next year.\" Xi and Mr. Trump also agreed that the Chinese president will visit the U.S. \"at an appropriate time,\" and will meet at the APEC Summit in South Korea in November, the president said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced Monday that U.S. and Chinese negotiators arrived at a framework for an agreement to resolve the matter of TikTok's ownership. And Friday's call between Mr. Trump and Xi was meant to \"complete the deal,\" in Bessent's words. It's not yet clear if a deal is finalized.",
      "\"We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"I also agreed with President Xi that we would meet at the APEC Summit in South Korea, that I would go to China in the early part of next year, and that President Xi would, likewise, come to the United States at an appropriate time. The call was a very good one, we will be speaking again by phone, appreciate the TikTok approval, and both look forward to meeting at APEC!\"",
      "Mr. Trump has allowed TikTok to operate in the U.S., even establishing a White House TikTok account, despite a federal law forcing TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance to divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. That law was upheld by the Supreme Court in a 9-0 decision in June. But the president has repeatedly delayed enforcement of the law through executive action.",
      "China has not yet released a readout of the call between Xi and Mr. Trump.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 11:52:18 -0400",
    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A preliminary agreement between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok could include a licensing deal for the closely guarded secret of the social media company's algorithm, to which access has proved a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market.",
      "But China's position on the fate of TikTok's core technology could be softening. When details of the possible framework deal were released this week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, told reporters in Madrid that the tentative deal with the U.S. over TikTok's fate included an agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, thinks ByteDance executives may be urging the Chinese government to strike a deal so the company can continue earning revenue from the algorithm, while maintaining a foothold in the U.S.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "How would a TikTok licensing deal work?",
      "Mr. Trump, asked Thursday about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. So exactly how a licensing deal would work remains unclear, including whether ByteDance could maintain any sort of outside control over TikTok's algorithm once ownership transfers to U.S. owners.",
      "\"What I understand is they would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use it under certain terms,\" said Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization. \"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it.\"",
      "Kreps added that in retaining a measure of ownership over the algorithm, ByteDance could have the right to access internal TikTok metrics and influence how content is ranked in the U.S., akin to how a software vendor can patch or upgrade licensed software.",
      "The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter,\u00a0said\u00a0this week that TikTok would create a new U.S. app and that the company's engineers would re-create content-recommendation algorithms using technology licensed from ByteDance.",
      "A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the contours of the U.S.-China framework deal over TikTok. \"Any details of the TikTok framework are pure speculation unless they are announced by this administration,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "More details on a possible licensing deal could emerge on Friday, when President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to speak to complete the deal.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, Akoto, the American University assistant professor, said the new arrangement would have to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "When Jingtao, the deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, spoke to the press earlier this week, he indicated the U.S. and China have agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, although its unclear how exactly that would work.",

      "Hyundai Motor Group on Thursday confirmed it is going forward with previously announced plans to expand its Georgia plant, just weeks after an immigration raid delayed the startup of an electric vehicle battery plant at the site.",
      "As part of a broader investment strategy, Hyundai said it would spend $2.7 billion to increase production capacity at the Ellabell site by 200,000 over the next three years, to a total of 500,000 vehicles a year.",
      "The company first announced the expansion in March at the grand opening of the plant west of Savannah, and had said in August that it would invest an additional $5 billion in the United States overall. But the raid, which included arrests of more than 300 South Korean citizens, led to questions about the wisdom of the Asian nation investing in the U.S.",
      "The company said it now plans to produce 10 models of electric and hybrid gas-electric vehicles in Georgia, up from the current two the plant has been assembling as it ramps up production. Hyundai says it's still on track to expand production worldwide to 5.6 million vehicles a year by 2030. The automaker pledged that 60% of those vehicles will be electric or hybrid powered, targeting sales in South Korea, North America and Europe.",
      "Hyundai said that it plans to make more than 80% of vehicles sold in the United States domestically by 2030, with total domestic content increasing from 60% to 80%. For the first time, the vehicles would include a mid-sized pickup truck, a key vehicle class in the U.S. market. The company already makes the Santa Cruz model, a four-door compact pickup, that it started selling in 2021.",
      "Hyundai CEO Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz has said the immigration raid will delay opening\u00a0the battery plant by at least two to three months. Spokesperson Michael Stewart said Thursday that the facility will open in the first half of 2026.",
      "Both Hyundai executives and Georgia officials have been trying to calm the situation since the raid, which mushroomed into a diplomatic dispute between South Korea and the United States.",

Brian Kemp told reporters Tuesday at a ceremony marking the groundbreaking of a Rivian Automotive electric vehicle plant that he remains confident Georgia's business advantages would \"win out\" in terms of foreign investment. The raid may even wind up smoothing the way for South Korean employees to more easily obtain legal permission to help build and operate facilities in the United States, he said.",
      "\"I've had good conversations with companies that are here doing business in Georgia, companies that are looking to do business here,\" Kemp said. \"And I've had good conversations with people in the White House about the visa issue.\"",

      "\"This situation doesn't change our plans to continue expanding and localizing in the United States,\" Stubbs wrote. \"Our investments in America are part of a long-term strategic plan.\"",
      "The $2.7 billion investment confirmed Thursday will go to expanding capacity at the plant and group affiliates, Stewart said. Hyundai and its onsite affiliates currently have 3,129 employees in Ellabell, he said.",
      "Hyundai and its joint-venture partner in the battery plant, LG Energy Solution, had previously announced $12.6 billion of investments at the Georgia site, with pledges to hire at least 8,500 workers by the end of 2031. State and local governments have promised $2.1 billion in tax breaks and other incentives.",
      "The boost at the Ellabell site is the biggest part Hyundai's plan to raise production by 1.2 million vehicles a year worldwide. That includes another 250,000 vehicles out of Pune, India; and 200,000 more at Hyundai's electric vehicle plant in Ulsan, South Korea. The automaker said it would also deliver parts for assembly into an additional 250,000 vehicles at plants in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and North Africa.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut-september-2025-rates-loans-mortgages/",
    "published": "Thu, 18 Sep 2025 13:27:19 -0400",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut since December could be followed by more reductions later in 2025. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday delivered its first rate cut since December, a move that will ripple through everything from home loans to credit cards, although not all Americans will notice the change in the same way.",
      "The Fed cut reduces its federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one-quarter point, shaving its target range to between 4% and 4.25%, down from its prior range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "Though incremental, the policy turn is significant. Fed officials foresee two additional cuts in 2025 and one more in 2026, a trajectory that could lower rates by a full percentage point and lighten the load for millions of borrowers. For now, the quarter-point reduction will trickle through unevenly: some borrowers will see relief almost immediately, while others may notice little change, depending on their rates and the products they hold, according to experts.",
      "\"Any reduction is welcome, and especially if this is the first of several to come, which it sounds like it might be,\"Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, said in a statement. \"That's a positive thing.\"",
      "One area where Schulz doesn't expect consumers to see significant change is on credit card rates. While banks will lower their annual percentage rates in response to the cut, it's probably not going to make much of a dent for people who carry a balance, given that the average APR currently stands at about 20%.",
      "\"That quarter point isn't going to make that much of a difference,\" Schulz said.",
      "Here's where you're most likely to feel an immediate impact from the Fed's reduction \u2014 for better and worse.",
      "Home equity line of credit",
      "A home equity line of credit (HELOC) represents one of the financial products where the Fed rate cut could provide a bigger bang for borrowers' bucks.",
      "A HELOC is a line of credit based on the value of your home. In some ways, it is similar to a credit card, because it provides a maximum credit line that borrowers can draw down and their interest rates are variable \u2014 which means they rise and fall based on the prime rate, which in turn is influenced by the fed funds rate.",
      "If you have a HELOC, you can expect your rate to decline by one-quarter point within a month or two, according to Bankrate. The average HELOC today has a rate of about 8.05%, the financial site notes.",
      "\"HELOCs are one of the types of loans that tend to be directly impacted, so if you do have a HELOC, that quarter-point reduction can be pretty significant,\" Schulz said.",
      "According to CBS News' Managing Your Money, that 0.25 percentage-point reduction could trim a borrowers' costs on a $100,000 HELOC by about $173 annually. Bigger savings could be in store if the Fed carries through with additional rate cuts later this year and in early 2026.",
      "Mortgages",
      "House hunters enjoyed a preemptive benefit from the Fed rate cut, as mortgage rates have declined this month in anticipation of lower rates.",
      "Average rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.35%\u00a0this week, its lowest level in nearly a year. Just two years ago, mortgages approached 8%, hitting their\u00a0highest levels since 2000.",
      "Mortgage rates aren't set by the Fed, but they're heavily influenced by its policy moves, as well as bond market investors' expectations for economic growth and inflation.",
      "\"It's not just about what the Fed is doing today, it's about what they're expected to do in the future, and that's determined by things like economic growth, what's going to happen in the labor market and what do we think inflation is going to be like over the next year or so,\" Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, told AP News.",
      "While additional rate cuts later this year aren't guaranteed to result in lower home loan rates, it's a possibility, said Stephen Kates, financial analyst at Bankrate.",
      "\"It means that they probably could go down more, and they may trend in that direction, even if they don't move in lockstep,\" he added.",
      "High-interest savings accounts",
      "Unfortunately, the Fed's rate cut could have a negative impact on one group: Savers.",
      "Since the Fed started hiking rates in 2022 to battle soaring inflation, high-interest savings accounts and certificates of deposit have been the silver lining for consumers. People who had money to sock away in one of those accounts or a CD could get rates as high as 5% in 2024.",
      "Currently, savers can still find high-interest savings accounts offering 4%, but those might drop soon as banks adjust their offers to reflect the Fed's rate reduction, Schulz said.",
      "\"Expect yields on high-interest savings accounts and CDs to drop. Savers may want to act now by locking in today's still-high rates before they fall further,\" he noted.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to allow President Trump to fire Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to allow President Trump to remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors while a legal challenge to her firing moves forward.",
      "In its request for emergency relief from the high court, the Justice Department said that the justices should freeze a lower court decision that ordered Cook to be reinstated to her post on the Fed Board.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled earlier this week that Cook could remain\u00a0in her role while a legal challenge to her firing moves forward.",
      "Mr. Trump's emergency appeal to the high court comes after Cook participated in a two-day meeting of the Fed's committee that sets interest rates this week. The central bank on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, its first cut since December. The president has repeatedly criticized the Fed for moving too slowly to lower interest rates.",
      "\"That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the request to the Supreme Court. \"Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself \u2014 and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations.\"",
      "Lisa Cook's firing",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook last month over allegations she made misrepresentations on mortgage filings. She has not been charged with any crime and denies wrongdoing. Cook's removal by Mr. Trump was unprecedented \u2014 no president has attempted to remove a Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history. Critics warned that it threatened the independence of the Fed.",
      "Cook swiftly filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing her removal violated the Federal Reserve Act. The law specifies that a president can only remove a governor \"for cause.\" Cook also argued her due process rights were violated because she was not provided notice of the allegations against her and a meaningful opportunity to respond.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb sided with Cook earlier this month, finding that her firing likely violated the Federal Reserve Act and her right to due process under the Fifth Amendment. She ordered Cook to be reinstated to her post on the Fed Board.",
      "The Trump administration sought emergency relief from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which left Cobb's order intact. Judge Bradley Garcia wrote in a concurring opinion that Cook is likely to succeed in her claim that Mr. Trump's attempt to terminate her violated her due process rights. But he wrote that the court did not need to address the meaning of \"for cause\" at this stage in the case.",
      "The White House had said the administration would seek the Supreme Court's intervention, as it has done in several other legal challenges to Mr. Trump's efforts to remove Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies. The high court has so far allowed the president to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission, but it acknowledged in May that the Fed is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "In his filing, Sauer argued that Cook received adequate notice and opportunity to contest her removal.",
      "\"The President notified Cook of the charges against her and waited five days for her to respond before removing her,\" he wrote. \"Having declined to bring any defense to the President's attention or to dispute any material facts, Cook cannot complain about insufficient process.\"",
      "The solicitor general noted that the administration is not contesting the constitutionality of the for-cause removal protection for members of the Fed Board, but instead believes the president's firing of Cook complies with it. Still, Sauer said the district court's finding that conduct that occurred before Cook was appointed to the Fed does not constitute \"cause\" under the Federal Reserve Act\u00a0 was \"flawed.\"",
      "\"The President's strong concerns about the appearance of mortgage fraud, based on facially contradictory representations made to obtain mortgages by someone whose job is to set interest rates that affect Americans' mortgages, satisfies any conception of cause,\" he wrote. \"That is especially true here, where Cook has not disputed any material fact or offered any plausible justification for her conduct.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced last month that he was\u00a0firing Cook, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, from the Fed Board of Governors and had \"sufficient cause\" to oust her. Cook's 14-year-term on the Fed is set to end in January 2038.",
      "The president cited as grounds for her removal claims made by Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that Cook made false statements on mortgage documents.",
      "Pulte alleged in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that Cook claimed two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence on mortgage documents from 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Pulte, who was appointed to lead the FHFA by Mr. Trump, has continued to make accusations against Cook related to mortgage documents.",
      "Cook's lawyers have said she \"did not ever commit mortgage fraud.\" Documents obtained by The Associated Press this week showed that Cook referred to the property as a \"vacation home\" in a loan estimate, potentially undercutting the Trump administration's claims of fraud.",

      "Nvidia said it will spend $5 billion to buy Intel common stock at $23.28 a share. The investment, which is subject to regulatory approvals, comes a month after the U.S. government took a 10% stake in Intel.",
      "\"This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel's CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem \u2014 a fusion of two world-class platforms,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. \"Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.\"",

      "The U.S. government stepped in last month to secure a 10% stake, making it one of Intel's biggest shareholders. Federal officials said they invested in Intel in order to bolster U.S. technology and domestic manufacturing.",
      "The deal is \"bullish for U.S. tech,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a client note.",
      "\"This is a game-changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game,\" Ives said. \"Along with the recent U.S. government investment for 10% (equity stake in Intel) this has been a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors.\"",
      "Nvidia, meanwhile, has soared because its specialized chips are underpinning the artificial intelligence boom. The chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, are highly effective at developing powerful AI systems.",
      "The deal between the two chipmakers comes as China moves to be less dependent on U.S. semiconductor technology. This week, Chinese officials reportedly forbade several large domestic technology companies from purchasing Nvidia chips, and Huawei announced that it was expanding its development of AI chips and manufacturing.",
      "While Nvidia and Intel will work together to develop new chips, a manufacturing deal has yet to be struck between the two. The potential access to Intel's chip foundries by Nvidia poses a risk to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which currently manufactures the tech giant's flagship processors.",

Workers also filed complaints with California's Labor and Workforce Development Agency. If the agency decides not to seek penalties against Starbucks, the workers intend to file a class-action lawsuit in California, according to the complaints.",
      "Starbucks didn't comment directly on them Wednesday, but the company said it simplified its dress code to deliver a more consistent experience to customers and give its employees clearer guidance.",
      "\"As part of this change, and to ensure out partners were prepared, partners received two shirts at no cost,\" the company said Wednesday. Starbucks refers to its employees as \"partners.\"",
      "The dress code sparked a strike at 75 U.S. stores in May soon after it went into effect, with more than 1,000 workers protesting the new policy, according to Starbucks Workers United, which represents workers at 640 of Starbucks' 10,000 company-owned U.S. stores. The union said the dress code should be subject to collective bargaining but isn't a party to the suits.",
      "The new dress code requires all workers in North America to wear a solid black shirt with short or long sleeves under their green aprons. Shirts may or may not have collars, but they must cover the midriff and armpits.",
      "Employees must wear khaki, black or blue denim bottoms without patterns or frayed hems or solid black dresses that are not more than 4 inches above the knee. The dress code also requires workers to wear black, gray, dark blue, brown, tan or white shoes made from a waterproof material. Socks and hosiery must be \"subdued,\" the company said.",
      "The dress code prohibits employees from having face tattoos or more than one facial piercing. Tongue piercings and \"theatrical makeup\" are also prohibited.",
      "Starbucks said in April that the new dress code would make employees' green aprons stand out and create a sense of familiarity for customers. It comes as the company is trying to reestablish a warmer, more welcoming experience in its stores.",
      "Before the new dress code was imposed, Starbucks had a relatively lax policy. In 2016, it began allowing employees to wear patterned shirts in a wider variety of colors to give them more opportunities for self-expression.",
      "The old dress code was also loosely enforced, according to the Colorado lawsuit. But under the new dress code, employees who don't comply aren't allowed to start their shifts.",
      "Brooke Allen, a full-time student who also works at a Starbucks in Davis, California, said she was told by a manager in July that the Crocs she was wearing didn't meet the new standards and she would have to wear different shoes if she wanted to work the following day.

Colorado law also prohibits employers from imposing expenses on workers without their written consent, according to that lawsuit. The plaintiffs seek damages on behalf of all Starbucks workers in those states, whether or not their stores are unionized.",
      "Multiple plaintiffs, like Allen, said they requested reimbursement from Starbucks to conform to the dress code but were denied. Gilbert Cruz, an employee in Aurora, Illinois, requested $10 for the cost of removing a nose piercing.",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 16:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is cutting its benchmark interest rate as the U.S. economy faces headwinds, including a faltering labor market.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points \u2014 its first cut since December \u2014 as the U.S. grapples with a stalling labor market and slower economic growth.",
      "The Fed cut reduces the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 4% and 4.25%, down from its prior range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The last time the central bank eased borrowing costs was in December 2024, when it also trimmed rates by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "Federal Reserve officials are also penciling in two more rate cuts in 2025, but only one in 2026, according to the central bank's summary of economic projections. That may disappoint Wall Street, with investors before the meeting projecting a total of five cuts over the rest of the year and 2026.",
      "According to those median\u00a0projections, Fed officials expect the nation's unemployment rate, currently 4.3%, to reach 4.5% by year-end before ticking down to 4.4% in 2026 and 4.3% the following year.",
      "Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) \u2014 the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation \u2014 is forecast to level off at 3% this year, well above the central bank's 2% annual target, before receding to 2.6% next year and 2.1% in 2027. The median projections for core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, forecast PCE of 3.1% this year.",
      "The move comes as the Fed contends with a two-fold economic challenge: curbing inflation, which has flared in recent months, while supporting job growth, which has slumped. The Fed typically seeks to tame inflation by nudging up interest rates to slow economic growth, while cutting rates in periods when the economy is faltering to encourage consumer spending and business investment.",
      "\"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" Powell said in a press conference following the Fed's two-day meeting.",
      "He added that recent labor data shows that what he termed \"people at the margins,\" which he said include recent college grads, are now having a harder time finding employment.",
      "\"The overall job-finding rate is very, very low, but the layoff rate is also very low,\" Powell noted. \"The concern is that if you start to see layoffs, the people who are laid off, there won't be a lot of hiring going on.\"",
      "In acting to lower interest rates, the Fed is signaling that it views the slowing labor market as a more pressing concern than rising prices, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell underlined at his\u00a0Jackson Hole address\u00a0last month in Wyoming.",
      "\"Concerns for the labor market's health are rising,\" said Cory Stahle, economist in the Indeed Hiring Lab, in a statement after the Fed's decision. \"Unemployment and layoffs are relatively stable at historically low levels, which is encouraging, but they are unlikely to stay that way if labor market conditions deteriorate further.\"",
      "At the same time, Powell said the Fed now views the pass-through of the Trump administration's tariff as being \"smaller and slower\" than central bank officials had expected earlier this year. \"We continue to expect [inflation] to move up, maybe not as much as we would have a few months ago,\" he said.",
      "The rate cut comes amid intense political pressure on the Fed, with President Trump repeatedly accusing Powell of moving too slowly to ease borrowing costs and shore up economic activity.",
      "Mr. Trump is also seeking to put his imprint on the Fed. To that end, he has\u00a0sought to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook from her seat on the central bank's board, alleging that she engaged in mortgage fraud. She has denied committing fraud and challenged Mr. Trump's authority to fire her, with an appeals court ruling Monday that Cook can keep her job.",
      "One vote for a jumbo cut",
      "An economic adviser to Mr. Trump, Stephen Miran, was\u00a0confirmed by the Senate\u00a0on Monday to take an open spot on the Fed's Board of Governors. He will also sit on the 12-member Federal Open Markets Committee, or FOMC, which sets interest rates for the Fed.",
      "\"Stephen Miran was a last-minute addition to the FOMC, but his vote won't drastically alter the outcome. He joined too late to submit an economic projection and path for monetary policy,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a report this week ahead of the Fed's rate cut.",
      "All of the voting FOMC members except one \u2014 Miran \u2014 voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, according to the central bank's statement. Miran voted for a larger cut of 0.50 percentage points, the Fed noted.",
      "A key question for consumers and businesses is whether the Fed trimming borrowing costs for the first time in nearly a year augurs additional cuts in 2025 and heading into 2026. Fed officials have two more meetings this year, set for October and December.",
      "Although the FOMC members were largely united on the size of today's cut, their projections of future cuts show a difference of opinion about the path of monetary policy moving forward. Many of the group's members don't expect the panel to make any more cuts this year, according to the summary of economic projections.",
      "\"That median hides the deep split on the FOMC \u2013\u2013 nine of 19 members don't anticipate further cuts this year,\" Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report.",
      "Powell noted that a quarter-point cut isn't likely to make a huge difference to the economy, but added, \"You have to look at the path\" of future cuts expected later this year and in 2026. \"It starts with a 25 basis point cut \u2014 it's not just one action,\" he said.",

      "Average homeowners insurance costs have risen nearly 70% over the past five years, according\u00a0to data from ICE Mortgage Technology. On average, single-family homeowners with a mortgage now pay $2,370 a year for their property policy. In 2025, homeowners insurance costs rose have risen most sharply in California, where premiums in Los Angeles were up 19.5% compared to a year ago, according to the loan analytics firm.",
      "Soaring homeowners insurance rates are leading some Americans to switch insurers, or do without coverage altogether \u2014 a risky step that can prove financially ruinous and that experts strongly discourage.",
      "\"All things being equal, if you raise prices customers aren't happy,\" J.D. Power managing director Craig Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"As premiums increase, it starts to impact how people perceive insurance, and they start to wonder if their insurer cares about them or their profits.\"",
      "Property insurance premiums vary by geography, and are typically higher in places where residents are more vulnerable to disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires that scientists link to climate change, according to insurance experts.",
      "\"The price of insurance is increasing as the level of risk increases,\" said Sean Kevelighan, CEO of the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group that provides information to consumers. \"We are beginning to see some trends of Americans making tougher decisions about their insurance.\"",
      "According to a recent Realtor.com survey of homeowners, nearly 60% of respondents said they might forgo purchasing property coverage if it becomes too expensive.",
      "\"Households are feeling squeezed, and more are considering going without home insurance altogether,\" Realtor.com economic data analyst Hannah Jones told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What's behind rising premiums?",
      "Several factors have led to the surge in property insurance costs:\u00a0higher home values, mounting climate-related risks, and the higher cost of lumber, steel and other building materials, insurance experts said. In June, the median home sale price in the U.S. hit a record high of nearly $400,000, according to online real estate firm Redfin.",
      "\"We've seen costs related to construction materials rise, and the price of insurance is a reflection of risk, plus the cost to pay a claim,\" Kevelighan said.",
      "\"It's a double whammy,\" Jones added. \"If your home is worth more, it costs more to insure, and also your home is more at risk, so you stand to lose more if you go without insurance.\"",
      "\"We don't recommend going without insurance because it leaves you extremely exposed in case you do suffer property damage, or a complete loss of property,\" she said.",
      "However, homeowners do have alternatives when it comes to choosing an insurer, while there are steps they can take to try to minimize their coverage costs.",
      "\"A few of these things are under people's control,\" NerdWallet homeowners insurance expert Holden Lewis told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you are in a place where there are a lot of wildfires, you can change your landscaping so you don't have flammable materials, for example.\"",
      "A home that's perceived as less vulnerable is less costly to insure, he explained.",
      "\"In storm-vulnerable areas, having storm shutters and tie-downs to keep your roof from blowing off can reduce your premiums,\" he added.",

    "summary": "The IRS adjusts its tax provisions for inflation every year, which can help taxpayers avoid so-called \"bracket creep.\"",
    "story": [
      "Americans could get some financial relief next year when the IRS adjusts its federal income tax brackets for inflation, a change that could help lower taxes for millions of households.",
      "Each fall \u2014 typically in October or November \u2014 the IRS announces inflation adjustments that affects everything from the tax brackets people are subject to based on their income to the size of the standard deduction. Some experts are already projecting those changes by analyzing the same inflation data the tax agency uses as part its annual reset.",
      "Based on that analysis, the IRS is likely to apply an inflation rate of 2.7% in adjusting its brackets and other items, according to Bloomberg Tax. It based its projection on chained Consumer Price Index data for the past 12 months.",
      "Separately, the bottom two tax brackets will see a bigger adjustment next year because of the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which applies a more generous inflation bump for those bands. Those brackets will see a roughly 4% increase in their income thresholds next year, Bloomberg Tax calculated.",
      "The IRS tweaks those thresholds to avoid so-called \"bracket creep,\" which can occur if the bands fail to keep up with inflation. Without those annual adjustments, workers who get a cost-of-living pay increase could be pushed into a higher tax bracket even though their standard of living hasn't changed.",
      "\"If they didn't do it year after year, for example with the standard deduction, it would become less and less meaningful each year for taxpayers,\" Amber Gorski, an analyst at Bloomberg Tax and Accounting, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In other words, you'll have to earn more income next year to reach each higher band of taxation. For instance, a single taxpayer who earns $50,000 in 2025 would have a top tax rate of 22%, but in 2026 their highest marginal rate would be 12%, according to Bloomberg's projections.",
      "How the adjustments could impact you",
      "Some Americans could see a tax break due to the higher thresholds for each bracket.",
      "\"Going into 2026, they could use that information to estimate what their tax return potentially is going to be, and what they might owe in taxes,\" Gorski said.",
      "On top of the higher income thresholds for 2026, some seniors and workers could also benefit from changes implemented under the \"big, beautiful\" bill. Those include an extra $6,000 senior deduction and the elimination of some taxes on tipped income and overtime pay for qualifying workers.",
      "The passage of the tax and spending bill in July ensures that next year's tax bracket rates will remain the same. That means the individual tax rates will remain at 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%, although the thresholds for each band will edge higher because of the inflation adjustments.",
      "Without the new tax law, enacted \u00a0by President Trump in July, the bracket rates would have reverted to their levels before the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Prior to that law, for instance, the highest individual income bracket stood at 39.6%.",
      "The IRS has based its annual inflation adjustments on the so-called\u00a0\"chained Consumer Price Index,\"\u00a0as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Bloomberg notes that some of its projections could vary slightly from the IRS' official announcement, which typically arrives in October.",
      "\"The IRS will issue authoritative guidance, as it usually does, sometime between mid-October and early November,\" an IRS spokesman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "How tax brackets work",
      "There's a common misconception that your top tax rate is what you pay on the entire amount of your annual income, but that's incorrect. Each bracket represents the percentage you'll pay in taxes on each slice of income within that band.",
      "Take the example of the worker who earns $50,000 per year. In 2026, that taxpayer would pay 10% on the first $12,400 of earned income, and then 12% on any income above $12,401 and up to $50,400.",

    "summary": "With the U.S. economy facing headwinds, the Federal Reserve faces pressure to trim interest rates this week for the first time since December 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's rate decision today is shaping up to be its most consequential of the year, with most economists predicting the first cut of 2025. The real suspense is over how deep the reduction could be \u2014 and whether the Fed might signal a broader pivot that could set the course for the rest of the year.",
      "So far, the Fed has resisted calls from President Trump to cut its benchmark interest rate, which helps determine borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Mr. Trump has pointed to the fact that inflation has remained\u00a0relatively muted, so far this year, as evidence the central bank has been too late in lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Apart from Mr. Trump's push for a cut, the Federal Reserve is facing growing economic uncertainty ahead of its Sept. 17 meeting, raising the stakes for a rate decision.",
      "On the one hand, the labor market is showing signs of distress, with hiring slowing to a standstill, which would argue for a cut. But inflation is also creeping higher under the weight of the Trump administration's tariffs, an issue that the Fed has pointed to as its reason for keeping the benchmark rate unchanged so far this year.",
      "Adding to the complications is Mr. Trump's pressure on the Fed to reduce rates. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has responded by stressing the independence of the Federal Reserve, pointing out that the Federal Open Market Committee, its 12-member rate-setting group, relies on economic data to make its policy decisions, rather than political pressure.",
      "\"The committee tries to get a complete picture of the biggest downside risks for the economy, and then at the end of the meeting, there needs to be some sort of weighting \u2014 it's an art as much as science,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, an economics professor at Villanova University.",
      "When will the Fed announce its rate decision?",
      "The Fed will announce its next rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Sept. 17.",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point cut stands at 96%, according to CME FedWatch, which relies on 30-day Fed Funds futures prices to determine the likelihood. There's only a 4% probability of a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, the tracker says.",
      "Economists will also be listening for whether the Fed provides guidance on whether it expects additional rate cuts at its next two meetings in 2025, set for Oct. 29 and Dec. 10.",
      "What data will determine the Fed's decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep inflation low while also ensuring full employment.",
      "But those two goals can be in conflict with each other because rising inflation requires the Fed to boost interest rates, which tamps down spending by making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow. The Fed's best weapon for fighting high unemployment, however, is to cut rates, as that makes it cheaper for businesses to expand and hire more workers.",
      "Fed officials will be closely scrutinizing inflation and jobs data as they determine which side of the dual mandate needs more attention.",
      "While the inflation rate has receded from its 2022 peak, it's still far above the Fed's goal for a 2% annual rate, and has inched up in recent months as the Trump administration's tariffs ripple through the economy, pushing some prices higher.",
      "Meanwhile, the labor market is showing signs of distress, with many sectors \u2014 including manufacturing, which Mr. Trump has vowed to revive \u2014 shedding jobs in August. The result is a marked slowdown in hiring, with employers adding an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus about 106,000 workers each month in 2024.",
      "\"It's going to be very difficult, but it will be weighing these two conflicting objectives,\" Kersting noted.",
      "How does the Fed compare with other central banks?",
      "Mr. Trump's has criticized the Fed's decision to hold off on cutting this year by pointing to decisions by other central banks, such as the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, to reduce their borrowing costs.",
      "\"Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had ZERO. No inflation, great economy \u2014 We should be at least two to three points lower,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media in June.",
      "Yet the U.S. is facing an issue that isn't as pressing for other nations: Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "Because the tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. businesses directly to the federal government, the cost is largely borne by American companies and consumers \u2014 not other nations. The White House has said exporters abroad bear the brunt of tariffs, while Trump administration officials make the case that more balanced trade with U.S. economic partners over the longer term will create jobs, energize the manufacturing sector and generate federal revenue.",
      "Fed Chair Powell has pointed to the tariffs as a reason the Fed has wanted to keep its powder dry, given that many economists believe the import duties will reignite inflation in the U.S.",
      "The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a closed watched inflation gauge, rose at annual rate of 2.9% in August, the sharpest pickup since January. Heavily imported goods, such as coffee, audio equipment and household furniture, saw some of the steepest price hikes last month, CPI data shows.",
      "How are American consumers holding up?",
      "Many Americans are souring on the economy, feeling pressured by higher costs for everything from housing to groceries.",
      "A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that two-thirds of Americans said prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise, and about the same share said they expect that to continue. More than half of consumers said the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only about one-quarter said they believe it's improving.",
      "The CPI has steadily risen since April, when it fell to an annual rate of 2.3%, or just above the Fed's 2% target.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has pointed to mortgage rates that were close to 7% for much of 2025 as a reason for a faltering housing market.",
      "\"Could somebody please inform Jerome 'Too Late' Powell that he is hurting the Housing Industry, very badly? People can't get a Mortgage because of him. There is no Inflation, and every sign is pointing to a major Rate Cut,\" the president wrote\u00a0in an Aug.19 post on social media.",
      "But mortgage rates are determined by several factors beyond the Fed's benchmark rate, including the strength of the U.S. economy and the 10-year Treasury note. Already, rates have declined in recent weeks, dipping to 6.35% for the week of Sept. 11, in anticipation of the Fed's cut and weaker economic data.",
      "Even so, a rate cut could help some consumers by lowering their borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"A declining interest rate environment will provide some relief for borrowers,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"Whether it's a homeowner with a 7% mortgage or a recent graduate hoping to refinance student loans and credit card debt, lower rates can ease the burden on many indebted households by opening opportunities to refinance or consolidate.\"",

      "\"That coverage was at odds with fostering civil dialogue and being willing to listen to the points of view of those who have differing opinions. We should be able to disagree, robustly and passionately, but, ultimately, with respect. We need to do better,\" Comcast executives said.",
      "Dowd, the former chief strategist for Republican President George W. Bush, apologized in a Substack post on Friday, saying he hadn't meant to imply Kirk was to blame for the violence that killed him, the AP reported.

      "Also in the media industry, Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah said in a\u00a0Substack post\u00a0Monday that the company dismissed her last week after she spoke out \"against political violence, racial double standards, and America's apathy toward guns,\" noting that she only referred to Kirk once in a separate social media post.",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Sep 2025 17:19:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Discount retailers like Walmart and Dollar Tree are seeing an influx of more upscale consumers, market research data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Not only low-income shoppers are hunting for deals these days. Better off consumers are also flocking to discount stores to save a few bucks.",
      "Since 2021, budget retailers have seen a large influx of more affluent shoppers, according to data from GlobalData Retail. This year, nearly 28% of high-income people have shopped at discount chains Aldi, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Five Below, Family Dollar, Lidl, Ollie's, PopShelf or Walmart, up from around 20% four years ago, the research and consulting firm found.",
      "A key catalyst for the shift is one that has plagued Americans up and down the income ladder in recent years, experts told CBS MoneyWatch: inflation.",
      "Emerging from the pandemic, many middle- and even upper-income consumers had extra savings after receiving federal stimulus checks and because they chopped their spending on categories like travel and dining out, said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData.",
      "But since then, the financial cushion wealthier consumers once enjoyed has shrunk while the cost of living has risen, leading many to seek out more affordable stores.",
      "\"They don't like the fact that more and more of their money is absorbed by essentials and the basics of life,\" Saunders told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So what has happened is they have sought out better value for money, and they've especially done that in grocery and household essentials.\"",
      "GlobalData defines middle-income as households with annual income of $56,501 to $169,750, while high-income households are those earning more $169,751. The market research firm taps a range of data sources \u2014 including consumer surveys, credit card spending and retailer data \u2014 to build a national picture of the retail landscape.",
      "The migration of higher income consumers to discount retailers has \"accelerated since the pandemic, and especially since the bout of inflation that started in 2021,\" added Saunders, noting that a similar trend followed the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "One of the biggest winners of this trend has been Walmart, according to Saunders. More than 17% of Americans earning six figures today shop at the Arkansas-based company, the world's biggest retailer, up from less than 15% in 2021, GlobalData found.",
      "To be sure, wealthier consumers don't face the same financial constraints as low-income people. But high- and middle-income Americans are also looking for ways to beat inflation and stretch their dollar, experts said.",
      "Inflation is well below its 2022 peak, but remains sticky for food and other essentials. Will Auchincloss, an Americas retail sector partner at EY Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch that elevated prices for many goods and services are forcing consumers across the income spectrum to \"muscle through.\"",
      "Inflation isn't the only thing driving more people to discount retailers. Better brand selection and a more diverse assortment of products has made budget chains more appealing to a wider audience, Saunders said, noting that retailers like Walmart and Aldi are actively courting more upscale shoppers.",
      "\"One of the things Walmart has been doing is refurbishing a lot of its stores, putting a bit more effort into presentation, because it knows that higher-income consumers expect a nicer experience,\" he said. \"If you provide that, the lower-income consumers like it, too.\"",
      "Walmart remodels around 650 stores nationwide on an annual basis, according to a company spokesperson. The\u00a0upgrades\u00a0typically include updated layouts, newly painted exteriors and interiors, interactive displays, new signage and checkouts, and interactive displays \u2014 reminiscent what you might see in an IKEA store \u2014 that allow customers to touch and feel merchandise.",
      "The company has also expanded its brand selections to include manufacturers like Apple and Dell, as well as fashion brands like Scoop and Free Assembly, a Walmart spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Aldi, which did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment, has also tried make its stores more appealing.",
      "\"A lot of their new stores are very bright, they're very clean, they're very shoppable,\" Saunders said.",
      "\"This isn't about bargain-basement value,\" he added. \"This is about great prices, very low prices, but in a pleasant and a very aesthetically pleasing shopping environment.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 For a fourth time, President Trump has pushed back enforcing a bipartisan law that would effectively ban\u00a0TikTok over the video-sharing app's failure to cut ties with ByteDance, its China-based parent company.",
      "The president signed an executive order Tuesday extending the pause on enforcing the law until at least Dec. 16.",
      "The move comes on the heels of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's announcement Monday that U.S. and Chinese negotiators had agreed to \"a framework\" to resolve a dispute over TikTok's ownership. Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are planning to speak Friday \"to firm everything up,\" as Mr. Trump put it Tuesday morning.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "Under the law, ByteDance must divest from TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "Members of Congress and national security officials have for years warned that TikTok could serve as a vehicle for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda. During his first term, Mr. Trump tried unsuccessfully to ban the app, citing the potential security risks.",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has praised TikTok for helping him win the support of young voters and dismissed concerns about the app as \"highly overrated.\" The White House recently launched its own TikTok account.",
      "Mr. Trump has said for months that a deal to sell TikTok is on the verge, but the details of an official agreement, which would be subject to approval from the Chinese government, have yet to be made public.",
      "\"We have American buyers,\" Mr. Trump told reporters last month, adding that he had yet to speak with Xi about a sale.",
      "Mr. Trump also teased a deal in late June, telling Fox News in an interview that a group of wealthy individuals had agreed to buy TikTok and he would be sharing more in the coming weeks. Mr. Trump said he thought Xi \"will probably do it.\"",
      "Discussions with China about a potential sale were happening \"at the highest level,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on June 30.",
      "In late July, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview on CNBC that the \"deal is over to them right now,\" referring to China, and warned that TikTok \"is going to go dark\" if it's not approved.",
      "\"We made the decision. We can't have Chinese control and have something on 100 million American phones,\" he said.",
      "Lutnick said China or ByteDance \"can have a little piece\" but \"Americans will have control\" of the algorithm and \"own the technology.\"",
      "TikTok was a topic of conversation during Bessent's trade talks on Monday with Chinese officials in Spain. When asked by reporters later in the day whether China would have a stake in the company, Mr. Trump said, \"We haven't decided that.\"",
      "An apparent deal in April fell through after Mr. Trump announced new tariffs on China. The deal would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time.",
      "Sources with knowledge of the negotiations told CBS News this week that the latest deal includes technology company Oracle and private equity firm Silver Lake. (David Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington responded on Tuesday morning that China will \"firmly defend its national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, and will carry out technology export approvals according to relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "The statement added that the Chinese government \"also fully respects the will of enterprises and supports them in conducting business negotiations on an equal footing in accordance with market principles.\"",
      "Lawmakers have said that any deal that does not divest TikTok from ByteDance runs afoul of the law, including any arrangement that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. while using ByteDance's algorithm.",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court, TikTok's lawyer said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to completely cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. In legal filings, TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to access global content and vice versa.",
      "Trump claims authority to not enforce law",
      "Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor, said it's not unusual for laws to go unenforced, but it's typically because there are resource constraints or the law is ambiguous. The TikTok law is \"completely unambiguous,\" he said.",
      "\"There's no room to argue that the law doesn't say what it says and there's also no resource constraint,\" he said. \"I don't think that there is a sort of similar instance of this sort of flagrant attempt to let a company violate the law.\"",
      "In letters to tech companies earlier this year, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote that Mr. Trump \"determined that an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform would interfere with the execution of the president's constitutional duties to take care of the national security and foreign affairs of the United States.\"",
      "Bondi said the Justice Department is \"irrevocably relinquishing\" any legal claims against the companies, informing them that they can continue to make TikTok available in their app stores \"without violating the act, and without incurring any legal liability.\"",
      "The letters were made public in early July as part of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits.",
      "\"Whatever your view of prosecutorial discretion, it does not give the president the power to say that something prohibited by statute is actually lawful,\" said Zachary Price, a professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco. \"It would at most let you suspend enforcement. In other words, you might be able to never seek penalties under the law, but \u2026 you can't tell them that they're acting lawfully when they're violating the statute.\"",
      "Anupam Chander, a law professor at Georgetown University, called the claims in Bondi's letters an \"excessive assertion of presidential power.\"",
      "But Chander said that by not enforcing the law instead of shutting it down, Mr. Trump may have a better chance at accomplishing what Congress insisted was the law's intent: to force a sale.",
      "\"It's a lot harder to sell a dead horse than a live horse,\" Chander said. \"If you force it to shut down and then hope in six months that you might engineer a sale \u2014 at that point, the value might have diminished so much that there's very little reason, very little economic incentive for ByteDance to sell at all.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's non-enforcement of the law has prompted some pushback from lawmakers, though the intensity has been relatively muted compared to the alarms Congress sounded over the app's potential national security risks.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said he \"made progress\" on the approval of a deal to resolve ownership of\u00a0TikTok\u00a0during a \"very productive\" conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday morning.",
      "During the call, which was set up to finalize an agreement\u00a0over the popular social media platform, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that he agreed to visit China \"in the early part of next year.\" Xi and Mr. Trump also agreed that the Chinese president will visit the U.S. \"at an appropriate time,\" and will meet at the APEC Summit in South Korea in November, the president said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced Monday that U.S. and Chinese negotiators arrived at a framework for an agreement to resolve the matter of TikTok's ownership. And Friday's call between Mr. Trump and Xi was meant to \"complete the deal,\" in Bessent's words. It's not yet clear if a deal is finalized.",
      "\"We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"I also agreed with President Xi that we would meet at the APEC Summit in South Korea, that I would go to China in the early part of next year, and that President Xi would, likewise, come to the United States at an appropriate time. The call was a very good one, we will be speaking again by phone, appreciate the TikTok approval, and both look forward to meeting at APEC!\"",
      "Mr. Trump has allowed TikTok to operate in the U.S., even establishing a White House TikTok account, despite a federal law forcing TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance to divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. That law was upheld by the Supreme Court in a 9-0 decision in June. But the president has repeatedly delayed enforcement of the law through executive action.",
      "China has not yet released a readout of the call between Xi and Mr. Trump.",
      "The two leaders have had ups and downs in their relationship. The U.S. president has said he holds \"great respect\" for Xi, while often voicing frustration with China's trade practices. Xi also raised eyebrows this summer with a show of unity with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who walked alongside Xi as he showcased missiles, drones and advanced weapons systems in China's largest-ever military parade.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Friday passed a Republican measure to keep the government funded until Nov. 21, teeing up a fight in the Senate over the GOP plan to avoid a shutdown.",
      "The short-term funding bill passed the House in a 217 to 212 vote, with one Democrat voting in favor and two Republicans in opposition. Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana voted against the bill, while Democratic Rep. Jared Golden of Maine supported it.",
      "The measure faces serious headwinds in the upper chamber, where 60 votes are required to advance a funding bill. With a 53-seat majority, Republicans will need to earn the support of at least seven Democrats to move the bill forward. At this point, Senate Democrats appear nearly united in their opposition, with most citing Republicans' unwillingness to negotiate over Democratic priorities, notably health care.",
      "The Senate is expected to vote on the House measure on Friday, as well as Democrats' own proposal. Both votes are expected to fail, leaving lawmakers without a clear path forward to avoid a funding lapse at the end of the month. Both chambers are currently scheduled to be in recess until Sept. 29.",
      "\"Republicans know that this partisan, reckless, dirty spending bill is dead on arrival in the United States Senate, and yet Republicans continue to refuse to even discuss protecting the health care of the American people,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said on the floor before the vote.",
      "Asked after the vote if he was open to negotiating with Democratic leaders in the event of a shutdown, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said \"heck no,\" as long as Democrats are dug in on their funding demands.",
      "Earlier this week, House GOP leaders\u00a0unveiled their bill, which would extend current spending levels for seven weeks. The legislation also funds additional security for lawmakers in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, to the tune of $30 million for Congress and $58 million for the executive and judicial branches. Johnson said Friday that the House could pass additional security funding in a standalone bill next month.",
      "Democrats have proposed a counteroffer to the funding bill that would keep the government open for a month and provide more than $320 million in security funds. But it would also permanently extend enhanced tax credits under the Affordable Care Act that expire at the end of the year, roll back Medicaid cuts in President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and restore funding for public broadcasters that was rescinded earlier this year.",
      "All are nonstarters with Republicans, who say those provisions do not belong in a short-term funding bill.",
      "\"This is what my friends on the other side asked for \u2014 a clean bill. No partisan riders, no tricks, no things. And give it to us for a short period,\" said Rep. Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican. \"You got exactly what you asked for.\"",
      "Though Democrats often support measures to keep the government funded, the party is under intense pressure to stand up to Republicans and the White House. During the last funding fight in March, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer allowed Republicans to move ahead with their spending bill, a move that earned him severe criticism by members of his own party. Many Democrats argued it would have been better to allow the government to shut down than to go along with Republicans.",
      "Schumer, a New York Democrat, told Punchbowl News on Thursday that he believes that Republicans would bear the brunt of the blame for a shutdown this time around, and that Democrats' position is \"quite strong.\" He struck a defiant tone on the Senate floor after the House bill passed.",
      "\"When we were in the majority for four years, there was not a shutdown. Not one. Why? Because we did what you're supposed to do: talk in a bipartisan negotiation and each side has input. The reason we're having a shutdown now is you and your leadership refuse to talk to Democrats and have any input, and want only your imprimatur on the bill, which we believe hurts Americans badly with health care,\" Schumer said, addressing Republicans.",
      "Democratic leaders have urged their Republican counterparts to negotiate with them on a funding plan. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Johnson suggested there's no need, since Democrats regularly support \"clean\" continuing resolutions to keep the government funded.",
      "\"Chuck Schumer's counteroffer is not a serious one,\" Johnson told reporters Friday. \"He knows these are not negotiable items. \u2026 We were very careful to put no partisan measures in this. There's no poison pills. None of that.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-designating-antifa-terrorist-organization/",
    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 10:18:40 -0400",
    "summary": "Legal experts say Trump lacks authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, but the planned move could still affect some law enforcement approaches.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced on social media Wednesday that he's designating antifa as a \"major terrorist organization.\" But what that action would mean for the movement remains unclear, given that antifa has no official leadership or organization structure, and the president lacks authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, experts say.",
      "The president's announcement comes as he and his supporters continue to denounce \"radical left wing political violence\" following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk last week. After Kirk's killing, Mr. Trump blamed rhetoric from the \"radical left,\" saying that it is \"directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.\"",
      "Officials described the attack on Kirk as \"targeted,\" and family members of the suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, said he had \"become more political\" in recent years. Robinson wrote in text messages to his roommate that he had carried out the attack because he \"had enough of [Kirk's] hatred,\" according to court filings. There has not been evidence presented to the public linking Robinson to antifa.",
      "This is not the first time Mr. Trump has argued antifa poses a threat \u2014 in his first term, he claimed the movement was behind looting and rioting during protests against police brutality in 2020. A November 2021 report on anarchist and left-wing violence in the U.S. from George Washington University's Program on Extremism and the National Counterrorism, Innovation, Technology and Education Center noted that the first Trump administration largely labeled the threat from anarchist violent extremists as originating from antifa.",
      "What is antifa?",
      "Short for \"anti-fasict,\" antifa activism can be traced back to antiracists who opposed the activities of members of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, according to a June 2020 report from the Congressional Research Service. But the movement gained attention after the violent clashes between white nationalists and anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.",
      "The Congressional Research Service describes antifa as \"decentralized\" and lacking a \"unifying organizational structure or detailed ideology.\" Instead, it consists of \"independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals\" that largely believe in the principles of anarchism, socialism and communism.",
      "\"There is no single organization called antifa. That's just not the way these activists have ever organized themselves,\" said Michael Kenney, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has studied antifa. \"There's tremendous variation inside that movement, even on issues like political violence.\"",
      "The FBI has warned about violence perpetrated by antifa adherents, and in 2017, then-FBI Director Chris Wray told Congress that the bureau was looking into \"a number of what we would call anarchist extremist investigations, where we have properly predicated subjects who are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology,\" according to CRS.",
      "Wray, who was appointed FBI director by Mr. Trump during his first term, also acknowledged in congressional testimony in 2019 that the FBI doesn't investigate ideology, but does investigate violence. Then, in 2020, he said antifa is a \"movement or an ideology,\" not an organization.",
      "A 2020 assessment from the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that far-right attacks and plots have outpaced those from other perpetrators, including far-left networks. A 2022 study from the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism also found that \"right-wing extremists\" are more violent than left-wing actors.",
      "But CSIS said its data has indicated a rise in violent activity by \"antifa extremists, anarchists and related far-left extremists,\" which it said is likely connected to the \"concurrent increase in violent far-right activity.\"",
      "What could Trump's suggested designation do?",
      "Mr. Trump announced in May 2020 that the U.S. would be designating antifa as a \"major terrorist organization following nationwide unrest in response to the death of George Floyd,\" but nothing followed from that.",
      "Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the president does not have the authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, even if this were an \"organization.\"",
      "\"There is no legal mechanism that I'm aware of within U.S. code that would give the president or the federal government the power to declare a domestic 'group' as a major terrorist organization or a major terrorist group,\" he said.",
      "The administration could, however, shift antifa to a higher priority for federal law enforcement, Baumgartner said, which could lead to more frequent investigations or arrests.",
      "The FBI and Department of Homeland Security don't officially designate U.S. extremist groups as \"domestic terrorist organizations,\" in part because of First Amendment concerns, according to CRS.",
      "A 2023 report from the research entity also noted that the government does not provide a \"precise, comprehensive, and public explanation of any particular groups it might consider to be domestic terrorist organizations,\" and it warned that listing groups in that way may infringe on free speech rights or \"the act of belonging to an ideological group, which in and of itself is not a crime in the United States.\"",
      "\"At this point, it's not a crime in America to have 'leftist' political beliefs along the lines that some anti-fascists do,\" Kenney said.",
      "He added that designating groups as domestic terrorist organizations could also raise Fourth Amendment concerns regarding surveillance.",
      "\"Do we as Americans still enjoy the right to free speech, to nonviolent political expression of our views, however unpalatable the Trump administration might find those views? Yes,\" Kenney said.",
      "While the U.S. does not have a list of domestic terrorist organizations, it does have a Foreign Terrorist Organizations list. Among the groups on the list are Hamas, al Qaeda and ISIS, which are known to operate transnationally. These groups are not related to the antifa movement.",
      "Kenney said that if the president were to try to designate antifa as a foreign terrorist organization, it would unlock tools like economic sanctions to bring greater pressure on the movement. Mr. Trump hasn't said he has this in mind, though he said he'd recommend \"those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated.\" A foreign terrorist designation, if it were possible, would make it a crime to provide material support to antifa. Making this designation would present other challenges, however.",
      "\"When the president refers to antifa, whether in remarks to reporters or speeches, he's usually referring to domestic non-state actors and domestic incidents, so how are they going to portray that as foreign? That's not clear to me,\" Kenney said.",
      "Can the Justice Department charge someone associated with antifa with domestic terrorism?",
      "No. The FBI defines domestic terrorism as \"violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\" But it is not a chargeable offense under federal law.",
      "\"You can't prosecute an ideology,\" Baumgartner said.",
      "But there are numerous federal criminal statutes that could apply to domestic terrorism.",
      "In the case of Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who killed nine Black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015, he was convicted of 33 counts of federal hate crimes, obstruction of religious exercise and firearms charges.",
      "Payton Gendron, who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, in 2022, is facing federal hate crime and weapons charges. Gendron also pleaded guilty to a state terrorism charge.",
      "Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia criminalize the act of domestic terrorism, according to the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law. In 21 states and D.C., it is a crime to provide support to further an act of terrorism or a terror.",
      "Harsher punishments a possibility",
      "But Baumgartner said that where alleged domestic terrorism does come into play at the federal level is in increased penalties for perpetrators. Prosecutors have sought harsher punishments for felony offenses that \"involved, or was intended to promote, a federal crime of terrorism.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked federal judges in 2023 to apply a terrorism adjustment in cases involving members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, far-right organizations whose members were convicted on charges stemming from the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, including seditious conspiracy.",
      "When ex-Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was sentenced for multiple crimes related to the riot, prosecutors succeeded in applying the terrorism enhancement to his sentencing, although the judge did not allow it to heavily affect the length of the 22-year sentence. Mr. Trump issued Tarrio a full pardon upon taking office in January. He also commuted the sentences of members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers.",

    "story": [
      "The European Union proposed Friday bringing forward a ban on Russian gas imports as part of a new package of sanctions aimed at sapping Moscow's war chest after pressure from President Trump.",
      "Under the measures presented for approval by the bloc's member states, the European Commission said it aims to phase out liquefied natural gas (LNG) purchases from Russia by January 2027 \u2014 one year earlier than planned.",
      "\"Russia's war economy is sustained by revenues from fossil fuels. We want to cut these revenues. So we are banning imports of Russian LNG into European markets,\" commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said. \"It is time to turn off the tap.\"",
      "The proposal comes as the United States pressures the EU to end fossil fuel imports from Russia and the bloc seeks, in turn, to persuade Mr. Trump to take a tougher stance on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Trump has so far held back from upping pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin but said last week he was ready to do so if allies stopped buying Russian oil and hit China with tariffs.",
      "Von der Leyen did not give full details of the sanctions package, but officials told the Reuters news agency it would also target Chinese refineries, special economic zones, and Russian and central Asian banks.",
      "\"We are now going after these who fuel Russia's war, who purchase oil in breach of sanctions,\" von der Leyen said, according to Reuters. \"We target refineries, oil traders, petrochemical companies in third countries including China.\"",
      "The 27-nation EU has already banned most Russian oil under previous rounds of sanctions, slashing the share it imports from 29% in early 2021 to 2% by mid-2025. Only Hungary and Slovakia, friendly to Moscow and Mr. Trump, still buy it.",
      "The multiple rounds of European sanctions imposed since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022 have sought to sap its war chest with everything from asset freezes to a near-complete ban on importing Russian oil.",
      "Despite a push to end decades of European dependency, Russia still supplied 19% of the EU's gas in 2024 \u2014 down from 45% before the war. This is in part down to an increase in purchases of liquefied natural gas (LNG) transported by sea, which has\u00a0partially offset a sharp fall in pipeline imports.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a move to decertify an organ procurement organization and steps to reform the organ donation system.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced on Thursday new action to reform the nation's organ transplant system, as well as a move to decertify an organ procurement organization.",
      "\"Every American should feel safe becoming an organ donor and giving the gift of life, yet decades of ignored patient safety concerns have driven more and more Americans off the donor list,\" Kennedy said. \"Today, under President Trump's leadership, we are taking bold action and historic action to restore trust in the organ procurement process.\"",
      "Transplant experts said last year there had been a\u00a0spike\u00a0in people revoking\u00a0organ donor\u00a0registrations, after a report that a Kentucky man who'd been declared dead woke up just as a team was preparing to remove his organs. Since then, there have been more\u00a0reports\u00a0of attempts to remove organs from patients who had mistakenly been declared dead.",
      "Kennedy said at a news conference that \"we are acting because of years of documented patient safety data failures and repeated violations of federal requirements, and we intend this decision to serve as a clear warning.\"",
      "The secretary said the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency, a division of the University of Miami Health System, \"has a long record of deficiencies directly tied to patient harm.\"",
      "\"Unlike the Biden administration, which ignored these problems and failed to act, the Trump administration is setting a new standard that patient safety comes first,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Kennedy said along with the decertification, HHS is reforming the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and \"investing in new ways to encourage organ donation.\"",
      "In July, HHS announced a plan to begin reforming the organ transplant system, citing a federal investigation that \"revealed disturbing practices by a major organ procurement organization.\"",
      "Kennedy said in a statement at the time that the investigation, conducted by the Health Resources and Services Administration under HHS, showed \"that hospitals allowed the organ procurement process to begin when patients showed signs of life,\" calling it \"horrifying\" and pledging to hold accountable organ procurement organizations that coordinate access to transplants.",
      "HHS said the investigation examined 351 cases where organ donation was \"authorized, but ultimately not completed,\" finding that nearly 30% showed \"concerning features,\" like neurological signs in patients that the agency said are incompatible with organ donation. And at least 28 patients \"may not have been deceased at the time organ procurement was initiated.\"",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the national transplant waiting list, and 13 people die every day waiting for a transplant, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. There are 55 organ procurement organizations nationwide that serve specific geographic regions.",
      "House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith and House Oversight Subcommittee Chairman David Schweikert wrote a\u00a0letter to Life Alliance Organ Recovery Center in July demanding documents about reports that claim the organization \"knowingly and deliberately engaged in a Medicare fraud scheme.\" The letter also cites reporting from The New York Times on a case involving the organization in which, the lawmakers said, \"clinicians sedated a patient, withdrew life support, and waited for death before removing the organs of a patient who was crying and biting on his breathing tube which one Life Alliance employee interpreted as the patient not wanting to die.\"",
      "\"Patient safety lapses have long been a recurring issue for your organization and others like it, reflecting a history of ongoing concerns rather than isolated incidents,\" the chairmen wrote.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency for comment.",
      "The Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, of which Life Alliance is a member, pledged in a statement \"that we and our members will keep saving lives nationwide\" and \"will continue to support the team at Life Alliance to ensure South Florida organ donors, transplant patients and their families have access to organ donation and transplantation services.\"",
      "\"As advocates for the patients and donor families we serve, OPOs are committed to and invested in the ongoing improvement of our nation's organ donation and transplantation system,\" the group said. \"Patient safety is the top priority for everyone involved in this lifesaving work and it guides our actions every day.\"",
      "Kennedy has been pushing major changes to the nation's health care systems since he was sworn in earlier this year. And he has faced criticism in recent weeks over his leadership of the department amid a number of departures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Wednesday, Susan Monarez, who was ousted as CDC director by Kennedy less than a month after she was confirmed, testified before a Senate committee that she faced pressure from the secretary to change the childhood vaccine schedule, regardless of whether there was scientific evidence to support doing so.",
      "Kennedy testified before a different Senate committee earlier this month, where he defended the CDC shake-up, saying changes at the health agency were \"absolutely necessary.\" The secretary denied pressuring the former director to preapprove upcoming vaccine recommendations, and accused her of lying about why she was fired.",

Kimmel had said \"the MAGA gang\" was trying to portray Kirk's killer as \"anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"",
      "\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said. \"These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\"",
      "In a social media post Wednesday night, the president praised ABC for the decision, and said the other network late-night comedians, NBC's Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, should also be off the air. CBS News has reached out to NBC News for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One, \"If you go back, I guess they haven't had a conservative on in years or something, somebody said, but when you go back and take a look, all they do is hit Trump,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're licensed. They're not allowed to do that.\"",
      "The FCC, an independent agency, issues eight-year licenses to individual broadcast stations, many of which are owned and operated by television networks. On its website, the FCC says the \"First Amendment and the Communications Act expressly prohibit the Commission from censoring broadcast matter.\" It also states that the commission's role in overseeing content on the air waves \"is very limited.\"",

      "\"I think Brendan Carr is doing a great job,\" the president told reporters.",
      "It's not the first time Mr. Trump has floated canceling broadcast licenses.",
      "Last month, the president said NBC and ABC \"give me 97% BAD STORIES,\" and he would be \"totally in favor\" of revoking their FCC licenses.",

      "\"It may be in bad taste. It may be bad for the country when people are trying to normalize political violence. But it is protected by the First Amendment,\" said Volokh, a professor emeritus of law at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\"I would say it's basically prohibited for the government to say you can't mock or make fun of or even celebrate his death,\" said Younes, who currently serves as national legal director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.",
      "Volokh says comments like Bondi's \"are likely to further confuse people, whether citizens or law enforcement or others, about what's protected and what's not protected.\"",
      "\"I think they may also kind of send a message that we are going to try to find a way of punishing this speech,\" Volokh added.",
      "Bondi also said Monday the Justice Department could prosecute businesses that refuse to print photos of Kirk for customers, citing a worker at an Office Depot who declined to print flyers for a Kirk vigil. Office Depot called the incident \"completely unacceptable\" and said the staff member no longer works for the company.",
      "\"There is no federal law that prohibits copy shops or print shops from discriminating based on the content of the message,\" Volokh said.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said Bondi was solely referencing the Office Depot incident, which the department's civil rights division looked into.",
      "Less clear, according to legal experts, is whether the federal government can deport non-citizens or revoke their visas over their views on Kirk, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio has floated. Volokh says the laws around this are \"unsettled.\"",
      "\"While it is true that the executive's power when it comes to immigration is very vast, I think the First Amendment constrains it,\" Younes said. She pointed to the Trump administration's attempts to remove students for participating in pro-Palestinian protests, which have been met with pushback at the district court level.",
      "What can private companies do?",
      "The First Amendment doesn't stop private employers from choosing to fire people for speech, though some states like California have their own legal protections.",
      "However, in some cases, it can be illegal for the government to use its power to pressure a private company into firing a staff member \u2014 a concept known as \"jawboning.\"",
      "Government officials can try to persuade private companies to take a certain action, according to Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, but they cannot coerce companies by making threats.",
      "Volokh said it likely doesn't qualify as jawboning if elected officials merely express the view that people should be fired, as long as they don't cross the line into threatening to take action. For example, on Vance's call for people to contact the employers of anybody who celebrates Kirk's death, Volokh said, \"it's hard to see that as unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"You would have to show the private employer didn't want to fire you, but they were just acting because they were afraid of some kind of repercussions from the government,\" noted Younes.",
      "There's a fine line between broadly encouraging companies to fire employees who praised Kirk's assassination, and giving instructions to specific firms, according to Goldstein. He pointed to a contrast between Vance's comments advising podcasts listeners to call people's employers, and a tweet by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.",
      "Duffy praised American Airlines, United and Delta for suspending employees, and wrote, \"The next step should be to fire them.\"",
      "\"A rational airline who sees this message might feel some coercive effect on their decision making,\" said Goldstein, noting Duffy's power over the airline industry.",
      "Lakier said it's not a violation of the First Amendment if a company fires an employee of their own volition. But, she said, \"the problem is, in many of these cases, it's going to be because of political sympathy.\"",
      "\"The employers who are firing them, maybe implicitly fear that if they don't, they're going to face the government's wrath or they want to curry favor by firing,\" she said.",
      "In general, however, \"If we're talking about private companies and you are an at-will employee, then that means exactly as it sounds like, which is that an employer can fire you at will,\" said CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School.",
      "Government workers have some free speech protections, but it's complicated",
      "In many cases, Trump allies have spotlighted public employees who criticize Kirk.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called celebrations of Kirk's death by service members or civilian workers \"unacceptable\" last week, and said the Pentagon is \"tracking\" them. Since then, at least one Marine officer has been relieved of his recruiting duties pending an investigation into his post about Kirk, and two Army officers have been suspended pending a review into their posts, according to a Marine official and an Army official.",
      "A Secret Service agent who expressed negative opinions about Kirk on Facebook was also placed on leave last week.",
      "At the state level, Oklahoma's top education official has said teachers who celebrate Kirk's assassination \"will be banned from teaching,\" and teachers in several other states have been investigated or placed on leave over their comments. Others have pushed for action against employees at public colleges like Clemson University.",
      "People who work for the government have some free speech protections, especially for speech that they make while off the clock, legal experts say.",
      "\"Government employees do have First Amendment rights of freedom of speech,\" said Calvert. \"However, those rights are not unlimited and may be restricted if the employee's speech somehow interferes with the ability of the employer \u2026 to effectively and efficiently deliver its services to the public.\"",
      "Calvert said \"every case is going to be unique.\"",
      "Prior court rulings have established several factors for assessing the speech rights of government employees, according to Calvert and Volokh. Those include whether the worker spoke in their personal capacity, whether it relates to a matter of public concern and whether the worker's right to speak out outweighs the government's interest in delivering its services.",
      "But the military is a slightly separate case, according to Volokh, because \"there are more restrictions that are permissible on service members' speech.\"",
      "Volokh said the military is different \"in part because of a sense that \u2026 this is an environment where discipline is really important, where self-discipline is really important, where unit cohesion is really important, where commitment to the right ideas is very important.\"",
      "\"It's going very, very far\"",
      "Some First Amendment advocates are uncomfortable with vocal calls for people to be fired \u2014 even if they don't run afoul of the Constitution.",
      "\"It's going very, very far. This is not being limited to people saying, 'I'm glad Charlie Kirk is dead and I wish everyone like him was dead, too,'\" Younes said. \"It's being applied to people who just are saying they didn't like Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "Goldstein said that some officials may be understandably lashing out after the death of their friend, but particularly in the context of Kirk's career as free speech advocate, the reaction has gone too far.",
      "\"What a weird way to react in memory of Charlie Kirk, who was known for listening to people and disagreeing with them, and moving on,\" Goldstein said.",
      "Graham  Kates, \n                                                  \n                                  Eleanor  Watson, \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen and \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Wednesday that he will designate antifa as a terrorist organization, and is recommending investigations into people who allegedly fund it.",
      "It's unclear when the designation will take place, or what legal implications it will have. Antifa \u2014 short for anti-fascist \u2014 is a loose affiliation of mostly left-leaning activists, and generally is not considered to be a highly organized group.",
      "\"I am pleased to inform our many U.S.A. Patriots that I am designating ANTIFA, A SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER, AS A MAJOR TERRORIST ORGANIZATION,\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post. \"I will also be strongly recommending that those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated in accordance with the highest legal standards and practices. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "The White House referred CBS News to an interview with Fox News in which Mr. Trump said antifa \"causes tremendous incitement, and the things they say and the things they do are horrible.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made a similar announcement that antifa would be designated as a terrorist group during his first term in 2020, when the country was gripped by turbulent protests, but never followed through on the threat.",
      "Over the last week, the president and his allies have railed against what Mr. Trump has called \"radical left political violence\" following the deadly shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Hours after Kirk was killed last Wednesday, Mr. Trump vowed to \"find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity, and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it.\"",
      "Earlier this week, after a reporter asked Mr. Trump if he planned on designating antifa as a domestic terror group, he responded, \"it's something I would do.\" He also floated racketeering charges against people that he claimed have funded \"agitation.\"",
      "The legal impact of designating a U.S.-based group like antifa as a terrorist organization is not clear. Federal law allows the government to formally label international groups as \"foreign terrorist organizations\" and criminally charge people who offer support to them, but a similar legal mechanism doesn't exist for alleged domestic terrorist groups, according to a Congressional Research Service report.",

    "story": [
      "A federal immigration judge has ordered Mahmoud Khalil \u2014 a former Columbia University graduate student linked to pro-Palestinian protests \u2014 to be deported to either Algeria or Syria.",
      "The ruling was issued last week, but it first came to light in court papers filed by Khalil's lawyers on Wednesday as part of his lawsuit against the government. A green card holder, Khalil alleges the Trump administration detained him for months and sought to deport him as part of a wider policy of punishing foreign students for protesting Israel's conduct in its war against Hamas. The Trump administration has accused him of \"hateful behavior and rhetoric.\"",
      "On Friday, Louisiana-based immigration Judge Jamee Comans denied Khalil's motion for a waiver preventing his removal from the U.S. because he allegedly misrepresented his background on his green card paperwork. Comans once again ordered him to be deported to either Algeria, where Khalil is a citizen, or Syria, where he was born.",
      "Khalil now has 30 days to appeal Comans' ruling to a Justice Department body called the Board of Immigration Appeals, and if his appeal is rejected, he will lose his green card status and be ordered to leave the country, his lawyers said in a letter Wednesday to U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz.",
      "Lawyers for Khalil told Farbiarz they plan on amending his lawsuit against the administration in light of \"these latest, highly unusual developments.\" In a statement Wednesday, Khalil's legal team argued the immigration judge \"rushed to a decision without providing a hearing on the evidence as due process requires, engaging in multiple procedural irregularities.\"",
      "\"It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech,\" Khalil said in the statement. \"Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again.\"",
      "Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CBS News: \"It is a privilege to be granted a visa or green card to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans, and harass Jews, take over buildings and deface property, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.\"",
      "Khalil has denied advocating for violence or engaging in antisemitic speech during campus protests at Columbia, saying in court papers he is \"committed to peaceful protest.\"",
      "The legal fight between Khalil and the federal government stretches back to March, when he was first detained by immigration agents in New York. Khalil is one of several international students who were detained due to their links to pro-Palestinian campus activism, which the Trump administration alleges is riddled with antisemitism \u2014 a charge the protesters deny.",
      "Initially, the Trump administration argued Khalil could be deported under a federal law allowing noncitizens to be removed if the Secretary of State determines that their presence poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\"",
      "In June, Farbiarz blocked the government from deporting Khalil on foreign policy grounds, finding his \"career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled.\" A month later, Khalil was released from immigration detention in Louisiana.",
      "But his immigration case continued under a separate allegation leveled by the Trump administration. In addition to the foreign policy claims, the government had accused Khalil of leaving out details about his past associations on his immigration paperwork, including membership in a United Nations agency that works with Palestinians and his \"continuing employment\" at the British Embassy in Lebanon.",
      "In last week's ruling, Comans found that Khalil was not legally entitled to a waiver of deportation on those allegations. The immigration judge also said that Khalil shouldn't get discretion from the court because of the \"gravity of his conduct.\" She called Khalil an intelligent, ivy-league educated individual\" who should've known disclosure was required.",
      "\"This Court finds that Respondent's lack of candor on his [immigration forms] was not an oversight by an uninformed, uneducated applicant,\" the judge wrote. \"Rather, this Court finds that Respondent willfully misrepresented material fact(s) for the sole purpose of circumventing the immigration process and reducing the likelihood his application would be denied.\"",
      "Khalil has denied making misrepresentations, saying he was not a member of the U.N. agency, but was instead an unpaid intern through Columbia. He has also stated that he stopped working at the British Embassy in Beirut in 2022, despite the government's claims that he continued working there after that.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to allow President Trump to fire Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to allow President Trump to remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors while a legal challenge to her firing moves forward.",
      "In its request for emergency relief from the high court, the Justice Department said that the justices should freeze a lower court decision that ordered Cook to be reinstated to her post on the Fed Board.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled earlier this week that Cook could remain\u00a0in her role while a legal challenge to her firing moves forward.",
      "Mr. Trump's emergency appeal to the high court comes after Cook participated in a two-day meeting of the Fed's committee that sets interest rates this week. The central bank on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, its first cut since December. The president has repeatedly criticized the Fed for moving too slowly to lower interest rates.",
      "\"That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the request to the Supreme Court. \"Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself \u2014 and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations.\"",
      "Lisa Cook's firing",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook last month over allegations she made misrepresentations on mortgage filings. She has not been charged with any crime and denies wrongdoing. Cook's removal by Mr. Trump was unprecedented \u2014 no president has attempted to remove a Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history. Critics warned that it threatened the independence of the Fed.",
      "Cook swiftly filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing her removal violated the Federal Reserve Act. The law specifies that a president can only remove a governor \"for cause.\" Cook also argued her due process rights were violated because she was not provided notice of the allegations against her and a meaningful opportunity to respond.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb sided with Cook earlier this month, finding that her firing likely violated the Federal Reserve Act and her right to due process under the Fifth Amendment. She ordered Cook to be reinstated to her post on the Fed Board.",
      "The Trump administration sought emergency relief from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which left Cobb's order intact. Judge Bradley Garcia wrote in a concurring opinion that Cook is likely to succeed in her claim that Mr. Trump's attempt to terminate her violated her due process rights. But he wrote that the court did not need to address the meaning of \"for cause\" at this stage in the case.",
      "The White House had said the administration would seek the Supreme Court's intervention, as it has done in several other legal challenges to Mr. Trump's efforts to remove Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies. The high court has so far allowed the president to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission, but it acknowledged in May that the Fed is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "In his filing, Sauer argued that Cook received adequate notice and opportunity to contest her removal.",
      "\"The President notified Cook of the charges against her and waited five days for her to respond before removing her,\" he wrote. \"Having declined to bring any defense to the President's attention or to dispute any material facts, Cook cannot complain about insufficient process.\"",
      "The solicitor general noted that the administration is not contesting the constitutionality of the for-cause removal protection for members of the Fed Board, but instead believes the president's firing of Cook complies with it. Still, Sauer said the district court's finding that conduct that occurred before Cook was appointed to the Fed does not constitute \"cause\" under the Federal Reserve Act\u00a0 was \"flawed.\"",
      "\"The President's strong concerns about the appearance of mortgage fraud, based on facially contradictory representations made to obtain mortgages by someone whose job is to set interest rates that affect Americans' mortgages, satisfies any conception of cause,\" he wrote. \"That is especially true here, where Cook has not disputed any material fact or offered any plausible justification for her conduct.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced last month that he was\u00a0firing Cook, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, from the Fed Board of Governors and had \"sufficient cause\" to oust her. Cook's 14-year-term on the Fed is set to end in January 2038.",
      "The president cited as grounds for her removal claims made by Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that Cook made false statements on mortgage documents.",
      "Pulte alleged in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that Cook claimed two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence on mortgage documents from 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Pulte, who was appointed to lead the FHFA by Mr. Trump, has continued to make accusations against Cook related to mortgage documents.",
      "Cook's lawyers have said she \"did not ever commit mortgage fraud.\" Documents obtained by The Associated Press this week showed that Cook referred to the property as a \"vacation home\" in a loan estimate, potentially undercutting the Trump administration's claims of fraud.",

I would like to request a gold statue be erected in place of Mario the Dragon, on the crossing of Market and I think 31st Street, in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Thank you all,\" Rogers continued.",
      "Rogers attends school in Pennsylvania but had recently traveled to Utah, according to Talbot. He was staying with family in Park City.",
      "The affidavit says investigators discovered the residence where Rogers was staying and interviewed him.",
      "When detectives asked Rogers about the video, he allegedly admitted to making it and said it was \"posted as a joke on an unlisted YouTube video and sent to 12-15 people,\" according to the affidavit. It further notes that Rogers \"admitted to leaning to the left but did not claim any particular party,\" and said he used the word \"woke\" as \"a vague idea.\"",
      "Several agencies were under alert for a possible violent attack at the UVU campus, according to the affidavit, which found probable cause to charge Rogers with making a threat of terrorism, causing an emergency agency to act.",
      "\"Blake posted a threat involving bodily injury, death, or substantial property damage and he caused an official or volunteer agency organized to deal with emergencies to take action due to the actor's conduct posing a serious and substantial risk to the general public,\" it said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-vaccine-panel-meeting-science-politics-vaccination/",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 18:31:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A two-day meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, with new members appointed by RFK Jr., could reshape public trust in childhood vaccines and reduce access.",
    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is convening Thursday and Friday of this week under an unaccustomed spotlight. The committee, known as ACIP, usually attracts little attention as it deliberates vaccine schedules and eligibility, but suddenly finds itself navigating political scrutiny, public skepticism and internal upheaval.",
      "The stakes extend well beyond the technical details of dosing intervals or eligibility cutoffs. The panel's decisions could reshape public trust in childhood vaccines, restrict access to vaccines through Medicaid and Medicare, and signal whether scientific consensus or political pressure will steer the nation's vaccination strategy.",
      "The precise language of the measures the ACIP will be voting on has not been shared with CDC staff or made public, but here is what CDC experts believe may be on the table:",
      "Congressional scrutiny",
      "At a hearing on Wednesday of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, former CDC Director Susan Monarez and former CDC Chief Medical Officer and Deputy Director for Program and Science Dr. Debra Houry painted a sobering picture of a CDC under political siege.",
      "In her remarks, Monarez recounted her recent firing, saying it came after she refused to pre-approve new vaccine policies and insisted that to be credible, such decisions cannot be divorced from scientific evidence.",
      "Houry, who resigned hours after Monarez was ousted, said, \"Secretary [Robert F.] Kennedy [Jr.]'s actions repeatedly censored CDC science, politicized our processes, and stripped agency leaders of the ability to protect the health of the American people.\" She added, \"I could not in good conscience remain under those conditions.\"",
      "Together, their accounts paint a picture of personal views and political positions increasingly overriding science, thereby eroding the CDC's core mission. The fallout, critics say, is likely to be measured not in headlines, but in children's lives.",
      "The administration is pushing back on this narrative. Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, charged that Monarez \"was tasked with returning the CDC to its core mission after decades of bureaucratic inertia, politicized science and mission creep corroded its purpose and squandered public trust. Instead, she acted maliciously to undermine the president's agenda and was fired as a result.\"",
      "Inside the agency, Jim O'Neill, the acting CDC director and deputy secretary of HHS, struck a different tone in an email to CDC staff obtained by CBS News. He highlighted the CDC's history of victories \u2014 from malaria eradication to identifying HIV \u2014 and argued that over time the agency had drifted from its core mission. \"Not every health decision is the government's business. \u2026 CDC and other science agencies lost the American public's trust and faith during the later stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we are working hard to refocus and earn that trust back,\" he wrote. \"Rigorous science, transparency about data and reasoning, and treating our fellow citizens as adults who can make their own informed decisions will be well received whenever we can offer them.\"",
      "The competing narratives have left CDC staff caught in the middle. One longtime CDC staffer put it bluntly: \"Part of this upcoming [ACIP] meeting is really all about criticizing the data.\" The staffer said the imperative inside the agency has shifted from one of problem-solving to point-scoring: \"It feels less about protecting the public and more about putting science on trial,\" as the staffer put it.",
      "An unusual process and unusual members",
      "What makes this week's ACIP meeting striking is not only the agenda \u2014 votes on the combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine, the universal newborn hepatitis B vaccine dose, and COVID vaccine eligibility \u2014 but who will be voting.",
      "In June, Kennedy removed all 17 sitting members of ACIP and replaced them with a smaller group of allies, many of whom have questioned vaccine safety or mandates. Then, just days before this week's meeting, he appointed five more members, bringing the total of his picks now serving on the panel to 12.",
      "Some of the new members include controversial figures: Dr. Robert Malone, who has spread misinformation about COVID vaccines; biostatistician Martin Kulldorff, who opposed vaccination mandates for children; and Catherine Stein, who has downplayed the severity of COVID. Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist, has promoted ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine despite studies showing they are not effective treatments for COVID, and warned against vaccinating children despite evidence of benefits. Others, like pharmacist Hillary Blackburn and surgeon Dr. Raymond Pollak, are not vaccine specialists by training.",
      "Critics note that several appointees have served as paid expert witnesses against vaccine makers, posing potential financial, professional, and ideological conflicts of interest. Normally, vetting of ACIP members takes months or years, with careful conflict-of-interest checks. Kennedy's accelerated appointments, combined with Monarez's forced resignation, have triggered alarm among career scientists.",
      "At its June meeting, the ACIP abandoned its long-standing evidence-to-recommendation framework and featured what numerous scientific, medical and public health experts regarded as inaccurate claims by new members, as well as a presentation from a well-known anti-vaccine advocate. This week, the concern many experts have is whether scientific rigor can prevail.",
      "COVID vaccine",
      "CDC staff members emphasize that the precise wording of the measures ACIP members will vote on has not been disclosed. What insiders expect, however, is a narrowing of the list of conditions that classify someone as being at high risk for severe COVID. That shift could mean fewer people would be recommended for vaccination even if they might still benefit.",
      "Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, a prior ACIP working group lead who resigned from the CDC earlier this year, warned that limiting recommendations could send the wrong signal, saying, \"People may interpret a narrower recommendation as meaning the vaccine doesn't work, when in fact it's still highly protective against severe disease.\"",
      "The possible exclusion of healthy pregnant women and healthy infants from the high-risk category is also drawing attention. Pregnancy and early infancy have long been recognized as periods of elevated vulnerability, and experts worry that dropping these groups from the recommendation would not only reduce their protection but would erode public confidence in maternal and pediatric vaccination.",
      "Last month, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended that all infants and toddlers aged 6 to 23 months receive the COVID vaccine. The group cited data showing that children under 2 have the highest COVID hospitalization rates among pediatric age groups, comparable to adults aged 50-64, and that more than half of those hospitalized had no underlying conditions.",
      "The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, the national organization representing high-risk pregnancy experts, has reaffirmed its recommendation that all pregnant and breastfeeding women receive the COVID vaccine.",
      "And the West Coast Health Alliance, which includes Washington, Oregon, California and Hawaii, has recommended that all adults and children who want a COVID vaccine in those states can get one. Those recommendations are informed by the AAP, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers, who oversaw data on COVID hospitalizations, noted that pregnant women and infants remain uniquely vulnerable, making the question of maternal and early childhood COVID vaccination particularly sensitive. Havers resigned from the CDC earlier this year, saying she no longer had confidence that the data collected by her team would be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to inform vaccine policies.",
      "Less clear is whether ACIP will also raise the age threshold for routine vaccination from 65+ to 75+. Dr. Helen Chu, an infectious disease physician at the University of Washington, emphasized that while severe outcomes are rarer in the 65-74 group, simultaneous issues such as diabetes and heart disease complicate the picture. \"Age is a blunt instrument,\" she said.",
      "Hepatitis B: The birth-dose debate",
      "Hepatitis B remains a global killer, causing more than a million deaths annually from liver cancer and cirrhosis.",
      "Dr. Samuel So, director of the Asian Liver Center at Stanford University, calls the universal newborn hepatitis B vaccine \"one of the most successful public health initiatives of the past 30 years.\"",
      "The U.S. shifted from targeted to universal infant vaccination in 1991 after data showed\u00a0too many cases of hepatitis B among pregnant women were missed during prenatal care. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose for newborns before hospital discharge, and in 2018 tightened the timing to within 24 hours of birth.",
      "The rationale was clear: Even with screening guidelines, about 12% of commercially insured and 16% of Medicaid-enrolled pregnant patients were not tested for hepatitis B. A universal birth dose serves as a safety net, protecting infants whose parent's infection has been missed while also boosting on-time series completion.",
      "Before birth-dose policies took hold, the U.S. saw an estimated 1,000 preventable infections in newborns each year. When infection occurs at birth, about 90% of infants develop chronic hepatitis B and one-quarter later die prematurely from cirrhosis or liver cancer if they're not treated. The risk is set at birth.",
      "Reconsidering the birth-dose alarms experts. \"Undoing decades of progress,\" Dr. So warns, would leave many at risk for a preventable type of cancer. And Dr. Anna Lok, director of clinical hepatology at the University of Michigan, warns that \"even when it [hepatitis B vaccination] is recommended and it should be done in every newborn baby, we know it's not always done. And when it becomes optional, it means that it will be rarely done. And that is going to be the problem.\"",
      "Alex Lee, a 68-year-old retired civil engineer and volunteer with Hep B Free in San Francisco, said the stakes are painfully personal. Lee acquired hepatitis B from his mother. He later developed cirrhosis and then liver cancer before a life-saving transplant in 2013. His mother also required a transplant, and two of his siblings live with the virus.",
      "\"I didn't want my daughters to go through what I went through,\" Lee said. \"That's why I made sure they all got vaccinated. Pulling back now would be a huge mistake.\"",
      "MMRV: Convenience vs. perception of risk",
      "For parents, the MMRV vaccine offers an obvious convenience: one shot instead of two.",
      "But the combination vaccine carries a slightly higher risk of fever-related \"febrile\" seizures when used as the first dose in young toddlers aged 12-23 months. That risk\u00a0reflects the age at which the vaccine is given, not the fact that it is a first dose. Febrile seizures are most common between 14 and 18 months of age, when children are naturally at peak susceptibility. Febrile seizures are rare and almost always resolve without lasting effects, but are frightening for families and can erode trust in vaccines.",
      "\"That's why\u00a0ACIP recommended\u00a0splitting MMR and varicella [vaccines] at 12 to 23 months. There was no reason to change the second dose, where no excess risk has ever been seen,\" explained one CDC expert.",
      "By contrast, studies show no elevated risk when MMRV is given for the second dose at ages 4 to 6 years old, after children have outgrown the highest-risk window. Reconsidering recommendations without new evidence has led experts to wonder why the issue is being reopened and whether it risks sowing doubt.",
      "Trust and precedent",
      "What happens at the ACIP meeting in Atlanta this week is unusual, not just for the agenda, but for what it represents. Reevaluating long-standing vaccine guidance is rare; experts fear that doing so in such a politicized and polarized climate is riskier still.",
      "A KFF/Washington Post poll found that about one in three parents now say they should be able to decline routine school-entry vaccines for their children, even if that creates health risks for others. That's up from 16% in 2019 and a sign of growing unease about routine childhood vaccination. A confusing or seemingly inconsistent decision from the CDC panel could deepen distrust at a fragile moment.",
      "Beyond the votes",
      "Even the process itself may prove consequential. If CDC scientists are marginalized, as insiders suggest, the ACIP risks becoming a stage for ideological performance rather than scientific review. One CDC staffer put it bluntly: \"Part of this upcoming meeting is really all about criticizing the data.\" The staffer went on to say, \"It feels less about protecting the public and more about putting science on trial.\"",
      "What's next?",
      "According to America's Health Insurance Plans, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry in the United States, commercial \"[h]ealth plans will continue to cover all ACIP-recommended immunizations that were recommended as of September 1, 2025\u2026 through the end of 2026.\" This includes updated formulations of the COVID and influenza vaccines. But vaccine coverage under Medicare and Medicaid may change based on new ACIP recommendations.",
      "However, the real test will be the public's reaction. Will most parents still accept that the MMRV vaccine remains safe? Do hospitals continue to administer the hepatitis B vaccine at birth? Do older adults, confused by shifting COVID guidance, skip shots altogether?",
      "\"Process matters because trust matters,\" Houry said in her prepared testimony. \"If people believe outcomes are predetermined, or that recommendations are slanted by ideology rather than scientific data, they are less likely to accept even well-supported recommendations,\" she said.",
      "This week's ACIP meeting will test whether that trust can endure, not only in the science of vaccines but in the institutions charged with safeguarding them.",

      "Vance announced Sunday in a post on X that he had the \"honor of hosting the Charlie Kirk Show\" to \"pay tribute to my friend.\" Speaking from his office in the White House complex Monday, Vance said he was \"filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for\" as he kicked off the show.",
      "\"But I'm going to try to do my best,\" Vance said.",
      "Kirk, a conservative activist, was assassinated last week during a Utah Valley University event hosted by his organization, Turning Point USA, in Orem, Utah. The 31-year-old was close to Vance, along with President Trump and his family.",
      "After his death, Kirk's body was flown on the vice president's plane, Air Force Two, to Kirk's home state of Arizona. Vance canceled a planned trip to New York to mark 24 years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attack to fly to Utah to retrieve Kirk's body. Vance said Monday that he was honored to be able to \"take Charlie's remains from Utah to Arizona.\"",
      "Vance has described his longtime friendship with Kirk, who was also a key ally in his political rise. Vance said in a post on X after Kirk's death that the slain conservative activist was one of the first people he called when he considered running for Senate in 2021, and he said Kirk advocated for him to become the vice-presidential nominee \"both in public and private.\"",
      "The vice president described Kirk as a \"true friend.\" On Monday, Vance called Kirk \"the smartest political operative I ever met,\" saying \"I owe so much to Charlie.\"",
      "Kirk's youth turnout operation has also been credited with helping Mr. Trump's 2024 election bid, while Kirk himself was known to have influenced some of the Trump administration's personnel decisions. Vance said much of \"the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,\" adding that Kirk \"didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.\"",
      "The president announced last week that he would\u00a0award Kirk\u00a0the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously.",
      "Andrew Kolvet, the executive producer of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" said on CNN Monday that Vance's hosting of the show \"came about because he asked if he could do it.\"",
      "\"Charlie and JD were friends. They were actual friends,\" Kolvet said, adding that \"a lot of the people that are running the federal government are personal friends of Charlie's and they were in the trenches together, the campaign, and they've known each other for years.\"",
      "During the show Monday, Vance urged that \"we have to make sure that the killer is brought to justice,\" previewing discussions of what he called the \"incredibly destructive movement of left-wing extremism that has grown up over the last few years, and I believe, is part of the reason why Charlie was killed by an assassin's bullet.\"",
      "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who was among the guests on the show, echoed the sentiment, saying \"we are going to channel all of the anger that we have over the organized campaign that led to this assassination, to uproot and dismantle these terrorist networks.\"",
      "\"We are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people, it will happen, and we will do it in Charlie's name,\" Miller pledged.",
      "Vance said he has heard \"many calls in the last few days for unity, and for healing\" in the wake of Kirk's assassination, saying \"you have no idea how desperately I want that.\" But he added that \"first, we must tell the truth.\"",
      "\"I really do believe that we can come together in this country, I believe, we must,\" Vance said. \"But unity, real unity can be found only after climbing the mountain of truth.\"",
      "The vice president claimed people on the left are more likely to celebrate and defend political violence, saying \"this is not a both sides problem.\"",
      "\"If both sides have a problem, one side has a much bigger and malignant problem, and that is the truth we must be told,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects preserved in amber for the first time in South America, providing a fresh glimpse into life on Earth at a time when flowering plants were just beginning to diversify and spread around the world.",
      "Many of the specimens found at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador date to 112 million years ago, said Fabiany Herrera, curator of fossil plants at the Field Museum in Chicago and co-author of the study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment. At least six types of arthropods were found preserved, according to the study.",
      "Almost all known amber deposits from the past 130 million years have been in the Northern Hemisphere, and it's long been \"an enigma\" that scientists have found few in southern regions that once comprised the supercontinent Gondwana, said David Grimaldi, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the discovery.",
      "This marks the first time researchers have identified ancient beetles, flies, ants and wasps in fossilized tree resin in South America, said Ricardo P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente, a paleoentomologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, who also was not involved in the new study.",
      "\"Amber pieces are little windows into the past,\" P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente said, adding that the discovery will help researchers understand the evolving interactions between flowering plants and insects that lived during the era of the dinosaurs.",
      "The researchers uncovered hundreds of fragments of amber, some containing ancient insects, pollen and tree leaves, at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador that's on the edge of what is today the Amazon basin.",
      "Two types of amber were discovered, according to the study: There was a more common form of amber found around the roots of resin-producing plants, and a rarer form of the material formed from resin exposed to air. The amber formed around the roots did not hold any specimens, the study said.",
      "\"A different kind of forest\"",
      "The discoveries provide evidence that the area was once a \"humid, resinous forest ecosystem,\" according to the study.",
      "But today's rainforest is much different from what dinosaurs roamed through, Herrera said. Based on an analysis of fossils in the amber, the ancient rainforest contained species of ferns and conifers, including the unusual Monkey Puzzle Tree, that no longer grow in Amazonia.",

    "summary": "A new study on chimpanzees in Uganda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire supports a theory that humans may have inherited a taste for alcohol from primate ancestors.",
    "story": [
      "In the forests of Uganda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, chimps crowd into fig and plum trees, feasting on fruit that's sweet, soft and just a little boozy. A new study shows those daily snacks quietly add up to the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages for humans.",
      "A team of scientists at University of California Berkeley and other institutions tested the fruit chimps actually snack on: figs in Uganda's canopy and the plum-like fruits on the forest floor in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Collecting the data wasn't easy \u2014 with little electricity beyond solar panels and constant humidity threatening the instruments, researchers spent three seasons hauling equipment and calibrating test kits to measure alcohol in many different tropical fruits.",
      "In the end, they found that on average, the fruit's alcohol content came in at about .3% by weight. This is kombucha-level, but when chimpanzees eat 10 pounds of fruit a day and weigh around 90 pounds, it adds up to about 14 grams of ethanol, equating to about two cocktails for a human.",
      "But don't picture chimps swinging drunkenly from the trees. To actually get drunk, they'd have to binge on fruit until their bellies ballooned, the researchers said. Instead, they're exposed to a steady low dose, a quiet buzz from nature's own fermentation process.",
      "Senior author of the paper and UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology Robert Dudley first floated the \"drunken monkey\" hypothesis in 2000, arguing that our attraction to alcohol could come from ancestral fruit-eating habits. Dudley argued that it makes sense primates would be tuned to alcohol, since their diets have long revolved around ripe fruit.",
      "\"Once you start eating, it acts as an aperitif,\" he said. \"The pleasure of association with drinking alcohol increases feeding rates.\"",
      "Other animals chase the same buzz too.",
      "\"Open a bottle of beer outside and a fruit fly appears almost instantly,\" Dudley said.",
      "Spider monkeys in Panama, slow lorises in Malaysia and even elephants have been documented consuming naturally fermented fruit or nectar.",
      "What makes this study different is that it provides the first direct chemical measurements of ethanol in the fruits that wild chimps routinely eat, and then connects those numbers to daily intake.",
      "The open question is whether chimps are actually selecting fruit for its alcohol content or just chasing sugar and calories. Either way, Dudley says the story connects to us.",
      "\"We inherited the taste for alcohol,\" Dudley said. \"Even though our diets have diversified \u2026 that bias to consume quickly when this molecule is present could still be a powerful force.\"",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have discovered what's thought to be the oldest known mummies in the world in southeastern Asia dating back up to 12,000 years.",
      "Mummification prevents decay by preserving dead bodies. The process can happen naturally in places like the sands of Chile's Atacama Desert or the bogs of Ireland where conditions can fend off decomposition. Humans across various cultures also mummified their ancestors through embalming to honor them or send their souls to the afterlife.",
      "Egypt's mummies may be the most well-known, but until now some of the oldest mummies were prepared by a fishing people called the Chinchorro about 7,000 years ago in what's now Peru and Chile.",
      "A new study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences pushes that timeline back.",
      "Researchers found human remains that were buried in crouched or squatted positions with some cuts and burn marks in various archaeological sites across China and Vietnam and to a lesser extent, from the Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.",
      "Studying the bones further, scientists discovered the bodies were likely exposed to heat. That suggested the bodies had been smoke-dried over a fire and mummified by hunter-gatherer communities in the area.",
      "The practice \"allowed people to sustain physical and spiritual connections with their ancestors, bridging time and memory,\" study author Hirofumi Matsumura with Sapporo Medical University in Japan said in an email.",
      "The results were \"a great surprise,\" said Hsiao-chun Hung, senior research fellow at Australian National University.",
      "\"The bones are so ancient, and it is remarkable to discover that this tradition is so old, connecting the practices of ancient peoples with those still found in some communities today,\" Hung said.",
      "The process allowed relatives to maintain contact with the deceased, and in some cases was believed to allow the spirit to roam freely during the day and return to a body at night.",
      "\"I believe this reflects something deeply human \u2014 the timeless wish that our loved ones might never leave us, but remain by our side forever,\" Hung told Agence France-Presse.",

      "The findings offer \"an important contribution to the study of prehistoric funerary practices,\" she said in an email.",

    "story": [
      "The sun has become more and more active over the last 16 years, in a turn that surprised scientists and could affect space weather and technology on Earth, NASA announced\u00a0this week.",
      "A new research, conducted by two NASA scientists and published earlier in September in the peer-reviewed\u00a0Astrophysical Journal Letters, shows that solar activity has ramped up after 2008 \u2014 an unexpected reversal following a decades-long decline that was initially thought to foreshadow a period of historic inaction on the surface of the sun.",
      "\"All signs were pointing to the Sun going into a prolonged phase of low activity,\" Jamie Jasinski, a space plasma physicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the study's lead author, said in a statement. \"So it was a surprise to see that trend reversed. The Sun is slowly waking up.\"",
      "An uptick in solar activity could influence space weather, potentially leading to more solar storms,\u00a0solar flares\u00a0and coronal mass ejections, the researchers found. Space weather patterns have the potential to directly impact spacecraft operations and the safety of astronauts, but\u00a0they may be felt on Earth, too, as space weather can affect power grids, GPS systems and radio communication, according to NASA.",
      "The downward trend was documented from the 1980s until 2008, when the space agency determined that the sun had reached its weakest point on record. The sun's action, or inaction, tends to fluctuate in 11-year cycles, according to NASA, although some patterns draw on longer.",
      "Earth is currently in\u00a0Solar Cycle 25, which began in 2020. The last cycle maintained an average length of 11 years and was the weakest solar cycle to occur in a century, according to the National Weather Service. Scientists thought the sun would stay in what they dubbed \"deep solar minimum,\" believing that the stretch of quietness from the sun would continue, eventually leading to a new phase of record low activity.",
      "\"But then the trend of declining solar wind ended,\" Jasinski said in NASA's announcement.",
      "His study, co-authored by Marco Velli, a fellow researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, instead tracked increasing bursts of solar plasma and stronger magnetic field measurements throughout the solar system, which are all affected by the sun.",
      "Solar Cycle 26 is expected to begin some time between January 2029 and December 2032, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said, but the agency has not yet produced a prediction for the next cycle.",
      "In order to better track space weather, NASA announced that it will launch the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) and\u00a0Carruthers Geocorona Observatory\u00a0missions, as well as the NOAA's\u00a0SWFO-L1\u00a0mission, from Falcon 9 as early as next week. It comes just a few months after\u00a0SpaceX helped NASA launch TRACERS twin satellites which are studying how the electrically-charged solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"Space weather predictions are critical for supporting the spacecraft and astronauts of NASA's Artemis campaign, as understanding the space environment is a vital part of mitigating astronaut exposure to space radiation,\" NASA said Monday.",
      "In May 2024, NASA officials recorded the\u00a0strongest geomagnetic storm in more than 20 years. Several X-class solar flares \u2014 the largest of B-class, followed by C and M \u2014 sent the\u00a0northern lights\u00a0to far lower latitudes than normal,\u00a0as far south as Mexico.",
      "Geomagnetic storms have the ability to impact how and whether technology functions on a massive scale, electrical engineer David Wallace explained in\u00a0The Conversation\u00a0last year.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 11:52:18 -0400",
    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A preliminary agreement between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok could include a licensing deal for the closely guarded secret of the social media company's algorithm, to which access has proved a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market.",
      "But China's position on the fate of TikTok's core technology could be softening. When details of the possible framework deal were released this week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, told reporters in Madrid that the tentative deal with the U.S. over TikTok's fate included an agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, thinks ByteDance executives may be urging the Chinese government to strike a deal so the company can continue earning revenue from the algorithm, while maintaining a foothold in the U.S.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "How would a TikTok licensing deal work?",
      "Mr. Trump, asked Thursday about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. So exactly how a licensing deal would work remains unclear, including whether ByteDance could maintain any sort of outside control over TikTok's algorithm once ownership transfers to U.S. owners.",
      "\"What I understand is they would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use it under certain terms,\" said Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization. \"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it.\"",
      "Kreps added that in retaining a measure of ownership over the algorithm, ByteDance could have the right to access internal TikTok metrics and influence how content is ranked in the U.S., akin to how a software vendor can patch or upgrade licensed software.",
      "The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter,\u00a0said\u00a0this week that TikTok would create a new U.S. app and that the company's engineers would re-create content-recommendation algorithms using technology licensed from ByteDance.",
      "A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the contours of the U.S.-China framework deal over TikTok. \"Any details of the TikTok framework are pure speculation unless they are announced by this administration,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "More details on a possible licensing deal could emerge on Friday, when President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to speak to complete the deal.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, Akoto, the American University assistant professor, said the new arrangement would have to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "When Jingtao, the deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, spoke to the press earlier this week, he indicated the U.S. and China have agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, although its unclear how exactly that would work.",

      "Nvidia, the world's leading chipmaker, announced on Thursday that it's investing $5 billion in Intel and will collaborate with the struggling semiconductor company.",
      "The two companies will team up to work on custom data centers that form the backbone of artificial intelligence infrastructure as well as personal computer products, Nvidia said in a press release.",
      "Nvidia said it will spend $5 billion to buy Intel common stock at $23.28 a share. The investment, which is subject to regulatory approvals, comes a month after the U.S. government took a 10% stake in Intel.",
      "\"This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel's CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem \u2014 a fusion of two world-class platforms,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. \"Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.\"",
      "The two companies said they will work on \"seamlessly connecting\" their architectures.",
      "In morning trading, Intel shares jumped 25%, its biggest one-day percentage gain in decades. Nvidia shares added 2%.",
      "For data centers, Intel will make custom chips that Nvidia will use in its AI infrastructure platforms. While for PC products, Intel will build chips that integrate Nvidia technology.",
      "The agreement provides a lifeline for Intel, which was a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, but fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel fell even farther behind in recent years amid the artificial intelligence boom that's propelled Nvidia into the world's most valuable company. Intel lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, and expects to slash its workforce by a quarter by the end of 2025.",
      "The U.S. government stepped in last month to secure a 10% stake, making it one of Intel's biggest shareholders. Federal officials said they invested in Intel in order to bolster U.S. technology and domestic manufacturing.",
      "The deal is \"bullish for U.S. tech,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a client note.",
      "\"This is a game-changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game,\" Ives said. \"Along with the recent U.S. government investment for 10% (equity stake in Intel) this has been a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors.\"",
      "Nvidia, meanwhile, has soared because its specialized chips are underpinning the artificial intelligence boom. The chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, are highly effective at developing powerful AI systems.",
      "The deal between the two chipmakers comes as China moves to be less dependent on U.S. semiconductor technology. This week, Chinese officials reportedly forbade several large domestic technology companies from purchasing Nvidia chips, and Huawei announced that it was expanding its development of AI chips and manufacturing.",
      "While Nvidia and Intel will work together to develop new chips, a manufacturing deal has yet to be struck between the two. The potential access to Intel's chip foundries by Nvidia poses a risk to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which currently manufactures the tech giant's flagship processors.",

TikTok has long denied that the Chinese authorities exert any influence on the platform.",
      "The concerns stretch back to Mr. Trump's first term. The president signed an executive order to ban TikTok in the U.S. in 2020 on national security and data privacy grounds, but the move was blocked by a judge.

      "Shares of the electric vehicle maker rose more than 5% in morning trading.",
      "Musk purchased various amounts of shares at different prices on Friday, according to a regulatory filing. The move may be viewed by the markets as the billionaire remaining confident in the company's future.",
      "Earlier this month Tesla released a proposed pay package for Musk that would possibly make him the world's first trillionaire if he hits a series of extremely aggressive targets for the company over the next decade.",
      "Tesla said in a regulatory filing that it will hand Musk shares worth as much as 12% of the company in a dozen separate packages if the company meets certain performance targets, including massive increases in car production, share price and operating profit. If approved by shareholders, the new pay package could make Musk the world's first trillion dollar executive, and would mark a new level of outsized pay in a country already known for extreme compensation. But the payoff is in shares, not cash, and the goals are extreme as well.",

To receive all the shares offered and make him the world's first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $8.5 trillion, double that of the world's most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia.",

      "\"We're stocking up on these items since we were short over the past year, and we'd like to have a good reserve for the future.\"",
      "Among the more mouth-watering items being delivered \"are what I'd call specialties,\" Contella said. \"The crew can eat these during any of the upcoming holidays or at any time really, but these are foods like clams, oysters, crab, roast turkey and smoked salmon, plus treats like candies, cookies and ice cream.\"",
      "\"We also have a high school breakfast competition food called ... shakshuka scramble. It's based on a popular dish throughout North Africa and the Middle East made of eggs cooked in spicy sauce.\"",
      "Mounted atop pad 40 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, the Falcon 9's first stage engines thundered to life at 6:11 p.m. EDT, generating 1.7 million pounds of thrust to push the rocket up into the early evening sky on a northeasterly trajectory matching the space station's orbit.",
      "After powering out of the thick lower atmosphere, the first stage separated, reversed course and flew itself back to a spectacular landing at the Space Force station to chalk up SpaceX's 67th Florida touchdown and its 505th successful booster recovery overall.",
      "The Falcon 9's second stage, meanwhile, put the Cygnus into the planned preliminary orbit and released it to fly on its own 14-and-a-half minutes after liftoff. If all goes well, the spacecraft will catch up with the space station early Wednesday for capture by the lab's robot arm.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said he \"made progress\" on the approval of a deal to resolve ownership of\u00a0TikTok\u00a0during a \"very productive\" conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday morning.",
      "During the call, which was set up to finalize an agreement\u00a0over the popular social media platform, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that he agreed to visit China \"in the early part of next year.\" Xi and Mr. Trump also agreed that the Chinese president will visit the U.S. \"at an appropriate time,\" and will meet at the APEC Summit in South Korea in November, the president said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced Monday that U.S. and Chinese negotiators arrived at a framework for an agreement to resolve the matter of TikTok's ownership. And Friday's call between Mr. Trump and Xi was meant to \"complete the deal,\" in Bessent's words. It's not yet clear if a deal is finalized.",
      "\"We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"I also agreed with President Xi that we would meet at the APEC Summit in South Korea, that I would go to China in the early part of next year, and that President Xi would, likewise, come to the United States at an appropriate time. The call was a very good one, we will be speaking again by phone, appreciate the TikTok approval, and both look forward to meeting at APEC!\"",
      "Mr. Trump has allowed TikTok to operate in the U.S., even establishing a White House TikTok account, despite a federal law forcing TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance to divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. That law was upheld by the Supreme Court in a 9-0 decision in June.

    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A preliminary agreement between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok could include a licensing deal for the closely guarded secret of the social media company's algorithm, to which access has proved a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market.",
      "But China's position on the fate of TikTok's core technology could be softening. When details of the possible framework deal were released this week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, told reporters in Madrid that the tentative deal with the U.S. over TikTok's fate included an agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, thinks ByteDance executives may be urging the Chinese government to strike a deal so the company can continue earning revenue from the algorithm, while maintaining a foothold in the U.S.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "How would a TikTok licensing deal work?",
      "Mr. Trump, asked Thursday about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. So exactly how a licensing deal would work remains unclear, including whether ByteDance could maintain any sort of outside control over TikTok's algorithm once ownership transfers to U.S. owners.",
      "\"What I understand is they would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use it under certain terms,\" said Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization. \"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it.\"",
      "Kreps added that in retaining a measure of ownership over the algorithm, ByteDance could have the right to access internal TikTok metrics and influence how content is ranked in the U.S., akin to how a software vendor can patch or upgrade licensed software.",
      "The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter,\u00a0said\u00a0this week that TikTok would create a new U.S. app and that the company's engineers would re-create content-recommendation algorithms using technology licensed from ByteDance.",
      "A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the contours of the U.S.-China framework deal over TikTok. \"Any details of the TikTok framework are pure speculation unless they are announced by this administration,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "More details on a possible licensing deal could emerge on Friday, when President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to speak to complete the deal.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, Akoto, the American University assistant professor, said the new arrangement would have to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "When Jingtao, the deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, spoke to the press earlier this week, he indicated the U.S. and China have agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, although its unclear how exactly that would work.",

Two of the Vibrio vulnificus deaths in Louisiana this year were in people who ate contaminated raw oysters, the state health department said in August.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 10:18:40 -0400",
    "summary": "Legal experts say Trump lacks authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, but the planned move could still affect some law enforcement approaches.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced on social media Wednesday that he's designating antifa as a \"major terrorist organization.\" But what that action would mean for the movement remains unclear, given that antifa has no official leadership or organization structure, and the president lacks authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, experts say.",
      "The president's announcement comes as he and his supporters continue to denounce \"radical left wing political violence\" following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk last week. After Kirk's killing, Mr. Trump blamed rhetoric from the \"radical left,\" saying that it is \"directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.\"",
      "Officials described the attack on Kirk as \"targeted,\" and family members of the suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, said he had \"become more political\" in recent years. Robinson wrote in text messages to his roommate that he had carried out the attack because he \"had enough of [Kirk's] hatred,\" according to court filings. There has not been evidence presented to the public linking Robinson to antifa.",
      "This is not the first time Mr. Trump has argued antifa poses a threat \u2014 in his first term, he claimed the movement was behind looting and rioting during protests against police brutality in 2020. A November 2021 report on anarchist and left-wing violence in the U.S. from George Washington University's Program on Extremism and the National Counterrorism, Innovation, Technology and Education Center noted that the first Trump administration largely labeled the threat from anarchist violent extremists as originating from antifa.",
      "What is antifa?",
      "Short for \"anti-fasict,\" antifa activism can be traced back to antiracists who opposed the activities of members of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, according to a June 2020 report from the Congressional Research Service. But the movement gained attention after the violent clashes between white nationalists and anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.",
      "The Congressional Research Service describes antifa as \"decentralized\" and lacking a \"unifying organizational structure or detailed ideology.\" Instead, it consists of \"independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals\" that largely believe in the principles of anarchism, socialism and communism.",
      "\"There is no single organization called antifa. That's just not the way these activists have ever organized themselves,\" said Michael Kenney, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has studied antifa. \"There's tremendous variation inside that movement, even on issues like political violence.\"",
      "The FBI has warned about violence perpetrated by antifa adherents, and in 2017, then-FBI Director Chris Wray told Congress that the bureau was looking into \"a number of what we would call anarchist extremist investigations, where we have properly predicated subjects who are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology,\" according to CRS.",
      "Wray, who was appointed FBI director by Mr. Trump during his first term, also acknowledged in congressional testimony in 2019 that the FBI doesn't investigate ideology, but does investigate violence. Then, in 2020, he said antifa is a \"movement or an ideology,\" not an organization.",
      "A 2020 assessment from the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that far-right attacks and plots have outpaced those from other perpetrators, including far-left networks. A 2022 study from the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism also found that \"right-wing extremists\" are more violent than left-wing actors.",
      "But CSIS said its data has indicated a rise in violent activity by \"antifa extremists, anarchists and related far-left extremists,\" which it said is likely connected to the \"concurrent increase in violent far-right activity.\"",
      "What could Trump's suggested designation do?",
      "Mr. Trump announced in May 2020 that the U.S. would be designating antifa as a \"major terrorist organization following nationwide unrest in response to the death of George Floyd,\" but nothing followed from that.",
      "Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the president does not have the authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, even if this were an \"organization.\"",
      "\"There is no legal mechanism that I'm aware of within U.S. code that would give the president or the federal government the power to declare a domestic 'group' as a major terrorist organization or a major terrorist group,\" he said.",
      "The administration could, however, shift antifa to a higher priority for federal law enforcement, Baumgartner said, which could lead to more frequent investigations or arrests.",
      "The FBI and Department of Homeland Security don't officially designate U.S. extremist groups as \"domestic terrorist organizations,\" in part because of First Amendment concerns, according to CRS.",
      "A 2023 report from the research entity also noted that the government does not provide a \"precise, comprehensive, and public explanation of any particular groups it might consider to be domestic terrorist organizations,\" and it warned that listing groups in that way may infringe on free speech rights or \"the act of belonging to an ideological group, which in and of itself is not a crime in the United States.\"",
      "\"At this point, it's not a crime in America to have 'leftist' political beliefs along the lines that some anti-fascists do,\" Kenney said.",
      "He added that designating groups as domestic terrorist organizations could also raise Fourth Amendment concerns regarding surveillance.",
      "\"Do we as Americans still enjoy the right to free speech, to nonviolent political expression of our views, however unpalatable the Trump administration might find those views? Yes,\" Kenney said.",
      "While the U.S. does not have a list of domestic terrorist organizations, it does have a Foreign Terrorist Organizations list. Among the groups on the list are Hamas, al Qaeda and ISIS, which are known to operate transnationally. These groups are not related to the antifa movement.",
      "Kenney said that if the president were to try to designate antifa as a foreign terrorist organization, it would unlock tools like economic sanctions to bring greater pressure on the movement. Mr. Trump hasn't said he has this in mind, though he said he'd recommend \"those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated.\" A foreign terrorist designation, if it were possible, would make it a crime to provide material support to antifa. Making this designation would present other challenges, however.",
      "\"When the president refers to antifa, whether in remarks to reporters or speeches, he's usually referring to domestic non-state actors and domestic incidents, so how are they going to portray that as foreign? That's not clear to me,\" Kenney said.",
      "Can the Justice Department charge someone associated with antifa with domestic terrorism?",
      "No. The FBI defines domestic terrorism as \"violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\" But it is not a chargeable offense under federal law.",
      "\"You can't prosecute an ideology,\" Baumgartner said.",
      "But there are numerous federal criminal statutes that could apply to domestic terrorism.",
      "In the case of Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who killed nine Black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015, he was convicted of 33 counts of federal hate crimes, obstruction of religious exercise and firearms charges.",
      "Payton Gendron, who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, in 2022, is facing federal hate crime and weapons charges. Gendron also pleaded guilty to a state terrorism charge.",
      "Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia criminalize the act of domestic terrorism, according to the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law. In 21 states and D.C., it is a crime to provide support to further an act of terrorism or a terror.",

    "story": [
      "Fellow late-night show hosts used a mix of humor, expressions of solidarity and even a song to respond to the suspension of\u00a0ABC host Jimmy Kimmel\u00a0in their shows on Thursday.",
      "Jon Stewart, who made a special appearance to skewer Kimmel's suspension, opted for satire to critique ABC for suspending \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" indefinitely following comments Kimmel made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "Stephen Colbert, whose show was canceled by CBS two months ago,\u00a0called Kimmel's suspension \"blatant censorship.\"",
      "Meanwhile, NBC's Jimmy Fallon praised Kimmel and vowed to keep doing his own show as usual. Then an announcer spoke over him and replaced most of his critiques about President Trump with flattery.",
      "Their guests the day after Kimmel's suspension varied widely. Fallon's guests were actor Jude Law, journalist Tom Llamas and actor and singer Jonathan Groff \u2014 none of whom addressed Kimmel's situation.",
      "Stewart and Colbert interviewed guests who could address censorship concerns raised by Kimmel's suspension. American and Filipino journalist and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Maria Ressa spoke to Stewart.",
      "When Stewart asked Ressa, the author of \"How to Stand Up to a Dictator,\" for tips on coping with the current moment, Ressa recounted how she and her colleagues at the news site Rappler \"just kept going\" when she was faced with 11 arrest warrants in one year under the Philippines' then-President Rodrigo Duterte.",
      "\"We just kept doing our jobs. We just kept putting one foot in front of the other,\" Ressa said.",
      "Kimmel's show was \"preempted indefinitely\" by ABC on Wednesday following comments he made about the reaction to Kirk's killing on Monday and Tuesday nights. The suspension came after media giant Nexstar announced in a news release that it would indefinitely preempt Kimmel's show on all its stations due to the host's remarks. Sinclair Broadcast Group, another major station owner, also said it was pulling the show.",
      "Nexstar has\u00a0a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.",
      "\"The decision to preempt 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' was made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision,\" a Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News in an email Thursday.",
      "FCC Chairman Brendan Carr also said his agency had a strong case for holding Kimmel, ABC and network parent Walt Disney Co. accountable for spreading misinformation.",
      "Kimmel has not commented.",
      "Stewart's show opened with a voice-over promising adherence to the party line.",
      "\"We have another fun, hilarious administration-compliant show,\" it said.",
      "He lavished praise on the president and satirized his criticism of large cities and his deployment of the National Guard to fight their crime.",
      "\"Coming to you tonight from the real (expletive), the crime-ridden cesspool that is New York City. It is a tremendous disaster like no one's ever seen before. Someone's National Guard should invade this place, am I right?\" Stewart said.",
      "\"The Daily Show\" set was refashioned with decorative gold engravings, in a parody of the new gold accents that Mr. Trump has added to many parts of the Oval Office.",
      "Stewart fidgeted nervously with his notes as though he was worried about mis-speaking or deviating from his talking points. When members of the audience reacted with an \"aww,\" he whispered, \"What are you doing? Shut up. You're going to (expletive) blow this for us.\"",
      "He took on a more stilted tone when he started describing Mr. Trump's visit to the United Kingdom, calling the president \"our great father.\"",
      "\"Gaze upon him. With a gait even more majestic than that of the royal horses that prance before him,\" he said.",
      "Stewart normally hosts only on Mondays. The Emmy winner helmed \"The Daily Show\" from 1999 through 2015, delivering sharp, satirical takes on politics and current events and interviews with newsmakers. He returned to host once a week during the run-up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election.",
      "Fallon opened his \"Tonight Show\" monologue addressing Kimmel's suspension.",
      "\"To be honest with you all, I don't know what's going on. And no one does. But I do know Jimmy Kimmel, and he's a decent, funny and loving guy, and I hope he comes back,\" he said.",
      "Colbert started his monologue on Thursday with the animated song \"Be Our Guest\" from Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" but replaced the lyrics with \"Shut your trap. Shut your trap.\"",
      "He later addressed Kimmel directly, saying he stands with him and his staff.",
      "\"If ABC thinks that this is going to satisfy the regime, they are woefully naive,\" he said.",
      "He also responded to remarks Carr made that it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming, \"they determine falls short of community values.\"",
      "\"Well, you know what my community values are, buster? Freedom of speech,\" Colbert said to loud applause from his audience.",
      "When Colbert talked with New Yorker editor David Remnick about Kimmel's suspension, he said: \"What we are seeing now is the government acting at the direction of the president of the United States to put pressure on, to manipulate, to silence and even to shut down institutions of the free world.\"",
      "David Letterman, Colbert's predecessor on \"The Late Show,\" lamented the networks' moves.",
      "\"I feel bad about this, because we all see where see this is going, correct? It's managed media,\" Letterman said during an appearance Thursday at The Atlantic Festival 2025 in New York. \"It's no good. It's silly. It's ridiculous.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tropical Storm Gabrielle formed Wednesday morning over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the\u00a02025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters expect the weather system to remain over open waters for the next several days and haven't yet warned of any hazards that could potentially affect land.",
      "Gabrielle is forecast to become a hurricane by Sunday, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center.",
      "The storm's current forecast predicts that Gabrielle's track will carry it north of the Caribbean and away from land, but the system could pass to the east of Bermuda next week as it continues to strengthen over the open waters of the central Atlantic Ocean, CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said.",
      "A map produced by Nolan shows Gabrielle's anticipated path through Tuesday, at which point it may be packing hurricane-force winds. The storm could pass near the Caribbean as it strengthens on Sunday, according to the map. The forecast track shows Gabrielle remaining north of the Caribbean islands and away from land.",
      "On Friday morning, Gabrielle was situated roughly hundreds of miles east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands and nearly 1,000 miles southeast of Bermuda. It was tracking west-northwest at 12 mph, the National Hurricane Center said, and was expected to make a \"gradual turn toward the northwest\" by Friday night.",
      "Its maximum sustained winds were 50 mph, just over the threshold that differentiates a tropical depression from a tropical storm. Gabrielle grew from a tropical depression in the Atlantic that meteorologists initially flagged earlier on Wednesday.",
      "Tropical-storm-force winds extended outward some 150 miles from Gabrielle's center, the hurricane center said. The storm will likely continue to move west-northwest or northwest during the next few days, the agency said. There is \"little change in strength\" expected over the next 48 hours, but the center forecast \"some gradual intensification\" late in the weekend.",
      "The storm may have some impacts to Bermuda early next week, Nolan said.",
      "Gabrielle took shape about one week after what was historically considered the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs annually from June 1 to Nov. 30 and has in the past become most active around Sept. 10.",
      "Officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration initially predicted the 2025 season would be busier than usual and produce more named storms than an average year, but hurricane activity has so far been quieter than anticipated.",
      "At the start of the season, NOAA's outlook suggested that between 13 and 19 named storms would form in the Atlantic, with as many as nine strengthening into hurricanes and as many as five becoming Category 5 storms, which are the most powerful. The agency revised the outlook slightly in August, predicting that the season would see 13 to 18 named storms, including five to nine hurricanes, two of which could be major.",
      "Of the six named tropical storms that have developed this year before Gabrielle, only one, Chantal, made landfall\u00a0in the U.S.",

    "summary": "Marion McWhorter went missing in Oregon in 1974. Now, remains found two years later have been identified as her, through DNA analysis.",
    "story": [
      "Portland, Oregon \u2014 Valerie Nagle spent decades wondering what happened to her older sister, who was last seen in Oregon in 1974. She searched online databases of unidentified persons cases looking for her and sent DNA to a popular ancestry website in the hopes of finding a match.",
      "That all changed in June when authorities in Oregon called Nagle \"out of the blue\" to ask about comparing her DNA to a cold case known as \"Swamp Mountain Jane Doe,\" she said. Nagle's DNA ultimately helped confirm that the remains of a woman found near a mountain creek in Oregon's Central Cascades in 1976 were that of her sister, Marion Vinetta Nagle McWhorter.",
      "Oregon State Police publicly released the news this week after the remains were identified in June.",
      "\"I was very surprised that they called,\" Nagle, a 62-year-old who lives in Seattle, told The Associated Press. She was 11 when her sister went missing. \"I was really glad that they found me through DNA.\"",
      "McWhorter was last seen at a shopping mall in the Portland suburb of Tigard when she was 21.",
      "She was the oldest of five siblings, and Nagle was the youngest. Their mother was an Alaska Native of the Ahtna Athabascan people, Nagle said, and her big sister had been named for an aunt who died in a boarding school for Indigenous children in Alaska in 1940.",
      "High rates of disappearances of Indigenous people, particularly women, have festered for generations amid inadequate public safety resources.",
      "Her remains were found by a moss hunter who saw a skull with several teeth and notified law enforcement immediately,\u00a0CBS Portland, Oregon affiliate KOIN-TV\u00a0reports. The hunter showed authorities where the skull was found.",
      "Investigators recovered additional skeletal remains, a clog-style shoe, a frayed leather coat, a leather belt with beadwork, two metal rings and degraded Levi's jeans, the station says.",
      "Nagle, who lived in New York with her parents and one of her brothers at the time of her sister's disappearance, said her mother may have contacted authorities but that she wasn't sure of the exact extent of the efforts made by her parents to find her sister.",
      "\"I mean, there were, you know, efforts to search, but it was limited,\" she said. \"We didn't have that much to go on.\"",
      "She does know her sister had come from California to Oregon with plans to continue on to Seattle and eventually Alaska when she called an aunt who lived near the Tigard shopping mall for a ride in October 1974 - but the aunt didn't end up meeting up with her, Nagle said.",
      "Nearly 20 years later, the aunt shared another detail with Nagle: When McWhorter called her that day, she told her that a man in a white pickup truck had offered to give her a ride. It was unclear why her aunt waited that long to share that information.",
      "Nagle said that when she learned this puzzle piece, she \"started in earnest with more searching,\" including by checking databases with unidentified persons cases.",
      "\"I remember spending a lot of time on those pages, just scrolling through and trying to look,\" she said.",
      "In 2010, a bone sample from McWhorter's remains was sent to the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification, and a profile was created in the national missing persons database NamUs, state police said. An additional bone sample was submitted for DNA extraction in 2020, allowing for a unique genetic marker profile to be produced.",
      "In 2023, Nagle did a DNA test when she signed up for Ancestry, a genealogy company with a DNA database, hoping it would yield a clue about her sister, she said.",
      "But the breakthrough came in April when a first cousin once removed uploaded their genetic profile to FamilyTreeDNA, another genealogy company with a DNA database, Oregon State Police spokesperson Jolene Kelley said in an email Thursday. That allowed genealogists to get a better idea of McWhorter's family tree and led them to find that Nagle was a surviving family member.",
      "\"This case was cold for 49 years. That means that family members lived and died without ever knowing what happened to their missing loved one,\" State Forensic Anthropologist Hailey Collord-Stalder said in a statement, adding that McWhorter \"likely did not go missing voluntarily.\"",
      "\"\"This was one of our oldest unidentified cases. And I think it just goes to show you that no matter how long somebody persists in being unidentified, we won't give up trying to identify them,\" he told KOIN.",
      "The Linn County Sheriff's Office is working to determine the circumstances of McWhorter's death, state police said.",
      "For Nagle, an important piece of the puzzle is solved.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced on Thursday new action to reform the nation's organ transplant system, as well as a move to decertify an organ procurement organization.",
      "\"Every American should feel safe becoming an organ donor and giving the gift of life, yet decades of ignored patient safety concerns have driven more and more Americans off the donor list,\" Kennedy said. \"Today, under President Trump's leadership, we are taking bold action and historic action to restore trust in the organ procurement process.\"",
      "Transplant experts said last year there had been a\u00a0spike\u00a0in people revoking\u00a0organ donor\u00a0registrations, after a report that a Kentucky man who'd been declared dead woke up just as a team was preparing to remove his organs. Since then, there have been more\u00a0reports\u00a0of attempts to remove organs from patients who had mistakenly been declared dead.",
      "Kennedy said at a news conference that \"we are acting because of years of documented patient safety data failures and repeated violations of federal requirements, and we intend this decision to serve as a clear warning.\"",
      "The secretary said the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency, a division of the University of Miami Health System, \"has a long record of deficiencies directly tied to patient harm.\"",
      "\"Unlike the Biden administration, which ignored these problems and failed to act, the Trump administration is setting a new standard that patient safety comes first,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Kennedy said along with the decertification, HHS is reforming the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and \"investing in new ways to encourage organ donation.\"",
      "In July, HHS announced a plan to begin reforming the organ transplant system, citing a federal investigation that \"revealed disturbing practices by a major organ procurement organization.\"",
      "Kennedy said in a statement at the time that the investigation, conducted by the Health Resources and Services Administration under HHS, showed \"that hospitals allowed the organ procurement process to begin when patients showed signs of life,\" calling it \"horrifying\" and pledging to hold accountable organ procurement organizations that coordinate access to transplants.",
      "HHS said the investigation examined 351 cases where organ donation was \"authorized, but ultimately not completed,\" finding that nearly 30% showed \"concerning features,\" like neurological signs in patients that the agency said are incompatible with organ donation. And at least 28 patients \"may not have been deceased at the time organ procurement was initiated.\"",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the national transplant waiting list, and 13 people die every day waiting for a transplant, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. There are 55 organ procurement organizations nationwide that serve specific geographic regions.",
      "House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith and House Oversight Subcommittee Chairman David Schweikert wrote a\u00a0letter to Life Alliance Organ Recovery Center in July demanding documents about reports that claim the organization \"knowingly and deliberately engaged in a Medicare fraud scheme.\" The letter also cites reporting from The New York Times on a case involving the organization in which, the lawmakers said, \"clinicians sedated a patient, withdrew life support, and waited for death before removing the organs of a patient who was crying and biting on his breathing tube which one Life Alliance employee interpreted as the patient not wanting to die.\"",
      "\"Patient safety lapses have long been a recurring issue for your organization and others like it, reflecting a history of ongoing concerns rather than isolated incidents,\" the chairmen wrote.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency for comment.",
      "The Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, of which Life Alliance is a member, pledged in a statement \"that we and our members will keep saving lives nationwide\" and \"will continue to support the team at Life Alliance to ensure South Florida organ donors, transplant patients and their families have access to organ donation and transplantation services.\"",
      "\"As advocates for the patients and donor families we serve, OPOs are committed to and invested in the ongoing improvement of our nation's organ donation and transplantation system,\" the group said. \"Patient safety is the top priority for everyone involved in this lifesaving work and it guides our actions every day.\"",
      "Kennedy has been pushing major changes to the nation's health care systems since he was sworn in earlier this year. And he has faced criticism in recent weeks over his leadership of the department amid a number of departures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Wednesday, Susan Monarez, who was ousted as CDC director by Kennedy less than a month after she was confirmed, testified before a Senate committee that she faced pressure from the secretary to change the childhood vaccine schedule, regardless of whether there was scientific evidence to support doing so.",
      "Kennedy testified before a different Senate committee earlier this month, where he defended the CDC shake-up, saying changes at the health agency were \"absolutely necessary.\" The secretary denied pressuring the former director to preapprove upcoming vaccine recommendations, and accused her of lying about why she was fired.",

      "On Wednesday, ABC yanked Kimmel's late-night talk show over a monologue comment about the suspect in Charlie Kirk's assassination, hours after Carr had told right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson that Kimmel's comments were \"a very, very serious issue right now for Disney,\" which owns ABC. Kimmel had said \"the MAGA gang\" was trying to portray Kirk's killer as \"anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"",
      "\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said. \"These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\"",
      "In a social media post Wednesday night, the president praised ABC for the decision, and said the other network late-night comedians, NBC's Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, should also be off the air. CBS News has reached out to NBC News for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One, \"If you go back, I guess they haven't had a conservative on in years or something, somebody said, but when you go back and take a look, all they do is hit Trump,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're licensed. They're not allowed to do that.\"",
      "The FCC, an independent agency, issues eight-year licenses to individual broadcast stations, many of which are owned and operated by television networks. On its website, the FCC says the \"First Amendment and the Communications Act expressly prohibit the Commission from censoring broadcast matter.\" It also states that the commission's role in overseeing content on the air waves \"is very limited.\"",
      "The president praised Carr, who's being criticized by some conservatives who say he went too far in pressuring ABC.",
      "\"I think Brendan Carr is doing a great job,\" the president told reporters.",
      "It's not the first time Mr. Trump has floated canceling broadcast licenses.",
      "Last month, the president said NBC and ABC \"give me 97% BAD STORIES,\" and he would be \"totally in favor\" of revoking their FCC licenses.",

      "Santa Monica, California \u2014 It's no secret that a trip to the grocery store is costing more these days. Food prices grew by a half-percent from July to August, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index \u2014 the fastest monthly change since the fall of 2022.",
      "And overall grocery prices in August rose 2.7% compared to one year ago, according to the CPI.",
      "\"Tariffs have a huge impact on grocery prices,\" food industry analyst Phil Lempert, editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News.",
      "Lempert believes the Trump administration's tariffs are one of three primary reasons that Americans are seeing a rise in grocery prices, with the others being climate change and labor shortages.",
      "\"We can't grow our food where we used to grow it,\" Lempert said of the impact of climate change. \"... Now it's had to move to Central and Latin America... Number two is the labor shortage... And then third is our tariffs.\"",
      "One of the products that has seen some of the biggest price jumps is coffee, which has jumped 21.7% compared to one year ago, according to the CPI.",
      "\"We got 50% tariffs on coffee from Brazil, and we import about 35% of our coffee beans, unroasted, from Brazil,\" Lempert said. \"... Yes, coffee's going to get more expensive.\"",
      "He also says the U.S. should brace for shrinkflation \u2014 when food and product manufacturers keep prices the same, but reduce the size of items, meaning consumers are ultimately paying more for the same amount.",
      "A September 2024 analysis from Lending Tree found that about one-third of approximately 100 common consumer products had shrunk in size or servings since the start of the pandemic.",
      "As an example, Lempert showed CBS News coffee bean packets in one grocery store in Santa Monica, California, that used to be sold in 16-ounce sizes, but are now 10.5 ounces.",
      "\"What they're doing is they're trying to put less in the package, hoping that you and I are not going to observe that, and keep that price either stable or just slightly increased,\" Lempert explained.",
      "Lempert says shrinkflation is \"absolutely not\" going away. According to his analysis, higher prices are changing consumer behavior, with more shoppers choosing less expensive store brands, shopping at multiple stores in an effort to find deals, and buying in bulk.",
      "\"No. 1, always have a shopping list,\" says Lempert on his advice on seeking out savings. \"... Don't waste food... Take doggy bags from restaurants, use leftovers, freeze leftovers.

    "published": "Thu, 18 Sep 2025 17:49:27 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump administration figures have vowed to pursue anyone who mocks or celebrates Kirk's death, alarming First Amendment advocates.",
    "story": [
      "In the week since conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated at a Utah university event, comments from some of his critics have ignited a battle over free speech in an increasingly polarized nation.",
      "Kirk, who routinely debated progressive students at his Turning Point USA events and espoused controversial opinions on his podcast, was a stalwart proponent of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Hate speech does not exist legally in America,\" he wrote on X last year. \"There's ugly speech. There's gross speech. There's evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment.\"",
      "But over the last several days, the administration he supported and the president he helped reelect have vowed to crack down on some speech about his death.",
      "Last week, Pentagon officials promised to \"address\" federal employees who mock or celebrate Kirk's death. On Monday, the State Department said it will revoke visas\u00a0over social posts that \"celebrate\" Kirk's death.",
      "That same day, Vice President JD Vance hosted Kirk's podcast and encouraged listeners to call the employers of anyone \"celebrating Charlie's murder.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday said people who post \"hate speech\" should be \"shut down\" and suggested that the Trump administration would pursue people who engage in hate speech.",
      "\"There's free speech, and then there's hate speech,\" Bondi said in an\u00a0interview. \"We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.\" The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld free speech rights, even if it is hate speech. She later said on X that \"hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected.\" The Justice Department referred CBS News to Bondi's comments when asked whether the administration considers celebrations of Kirk's assassination as threats of violence.",
      "\"Democrat critics are lying about the Administration's actions \u2014 this effort will target those committing criminal acts and hold them accountable,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Asked about Bondi's remarks, President Trump told ABC News' Jonathan Karl on Tuesday: \"We'll probably go after people like you because you treat me so unfairly; it's hate.\"",
      "Kimmel \"indefinitely\" taken off air",
      "Late Wednesday, ABC announced it would \"indefinitely\" pre-empt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr said the network should \"take action\" for the comedian's suggestion that Kirk's alleged killer is a Trump supporter. ABC's move came after station owners Nexstar and Sinclair said they were pulling the show indefinitely. Carr thanked Nexstar and Sinclair for taking action.",
      "Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the FCC to approve it. Nexstar told CBS News in a statement it made the decision to pre-empt\u00a0Kimmel \"unilaterally\" and did not consult with the FCC beforehand.",
      "On Truth Social, Mr. Trump referred to it as a cancellation and congratulated ABC for \"finally having the courage to do what had to be done,\" and added: \"That leaves Jimmy [Fallon] and Seth [Meyers], two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!!\"",
      "Anna Gomez, one of two FCC commissioners working with Carr and the lone Democrat on the commission, called Kimmel's penalty a dangerous new precedent.",
      "\"This administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression, not because it glorifies violence or breaks the law, but because it challenges those in power and reflects views they oppose,\" she said on CNN Wednesday.",
      "In a statement on Thursday, she added: \"This FCC does not have the authority, the ability, or the constitutional right to police content or punish broadcasters for speech the government dislikes. \u2026 Free speech is the foundation of our democracy, and we must push back against any attempt to erode it.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, also criticized the move.",
      "\"When the head of the FCC is talking openly about taking away the broadcast license, then that is the government trying to exercise censorship. It's not a question of whether you agree with Mr. Kimmel or disagree with Mr. Kimmel. The point is one of the government not coming in and making decisions about whose speech gets heard,\" she said, adding, \"Everyone should care, no matter what your political view is.\"",
      "The First Amendment and hateful speech",
      "In general, the First Amendment \u2014 which bars the government from \"abridging the freedom of speech\" \u2014 protects most forms of hateful speech, aside from a narrow set of exceptions that include threats of violence and incitement.",
      "Bondi's initial comments about hate speech stood out among those made by administration officials because of her position as the nation's top prosecutor, said Adam Goldstein, vice president of strategic initiatives at the nonprofit Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.",
      "\"I especially don't want to see an attorney in charge of the Justice Department saying that,\" he said. \"It's the kind of thing that would get you a bad grade in your constitutional law class.\"",
      "Jenin Younes, a First Amendment attorney who worked on a case accusing the Biden administration of social media censorship, told CBS News, \"These are all the same people who were railing against cancel culture and the idea of hate speech just a few years ago, when it was the left doing it.\"",
      "\"The worry is that lawmakers will just define hate speech to mean anything the opposite party says, and so that's why the court has said it's not up to the government to decide what's within the bounds of acceptable discourse and what's not,\" Genevieve Lakier, a University of Chicago law professor, told CBS News. \"There's no definition of hate speech, because the whole point is there's no neutral definition of hate speech.\"",
      "In most cases, Lakier said, \"simply saying 'he had it coming' \u2026 does not fit the very, very, very narrow definition of incitement that is available in the case law.\"",
      "Are offensive comments illegal?",
      "First Amendment legal scholar Eugene Volokh told CBS News that, in most circumstances, the government cannot go after ordinary people for making insensitive or offensive public comments about Kirk's killing.",
      "\"It may be in bad taste. It may be bad for the country when people are trying to normalize political violence. But it is protected by the First Amendment,\" said Volokh, a professor emeritus of law at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\"I would say it's basically prohibited for the government to say you can't mock or make fun of or even celebrate his death,\" said Younes, who currently serves as national legal director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.",
      "Volokh says comments like Bondi's \"are likely to further confuse people, whether citizens or law enforcement or others, about what's protected and what's not protected.\"",
      "\"I think they may also kind of send a message that we are going to try to find a way of punishing this speech,\" Volokh added.",
      "Bondi also said Monday the Justice Department could prosecute businesses that refuse to print photos of Kirk for customers, citing a worker at an Office Depot who declined to print flyers for a Kirk vigil. Office Depot called the incident \"completely unacceptable\" and said the staff member no longer works for the company.",
      "\"There is no federal law that prohibits copy shops or print shops from discriminating based on the content of the message,\" Volokh said.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said Bondi was solely referencing the Office Depot incident, which the department's civil rights division looked into.",
      "Less clear, according to legal experts, is whether the federal government can deport non-citizens or revoke their visas over their views on Kirk, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio has floated. Volokh says the laws around this are \"unsettled.\"",
      "\"While it is true that the executive's power when it comes to immigration is very vast, I think the First Amendment constrains it,\" Younes said. She pointed to the Trump administration's attempts to remove students for participating in pro-Palestinian protests, which have been met with pushback at the district court level.",
      "What can private companies do?",
      "The First Amendment doesn't stop private employers from choosing to fire people for speech, though some states like California have their own legal protections.",
      "However, in some cases, it can be illegal for the government to use its power to pressure a private company into firing a staff member \u2014 a concept known as \"jawboning.\"",
      "Government officials can try to persuade private companies to take a certain action, according to Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, but they cannot coerce companies by making threats.",
      "Volokh said it likely doesn't qualify as jawboning if elected officials merely express the view that people should be fired, as long as they don't cross the line into threatening to take action. For example, on Vance's call for people to contact the employers of anybody who celebrates Kirk's death, Volokh said, \"it's hard to see that as unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"You would have to show the private employer didn't want to fire you, but they were just acting because they were afraid of some kind of repercussions from the government,\" noted Younes.",
      "There's a fine line between broadly encouraging companies to fire employees who praised Kirk's assassination, and giving instructions to specific firms, according to Goldstein. He pointed to a contrast between Vance's comments advising podcasts listeners to call people's employers, and a tweet by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.",
      "Duffy praised American Airlines, United and Delta for suspending employees, and wrote, \"The next step should be to fire them.\"",
      "\"A rational airline who sees this message might feel some coercive effect on their decision making,\" said Goldstein, noting Duffy's power over the airline industry.",
      "Lakier said it's not a violation of the First Amendment if a company fires an employee of their own volition. But, she said, \"the problem is, in many of these cases, it's going to be because of political sympathy.\"",
      "\"The employers who are firing them, maybe implicitly fear that if they don't, they're going to face the government's wrath or they want to curry favor by firing,\" she said.",
      "In general, however, \"If we're talking about private companies and you are an at-will employee, then that means exactly as it sounds like, which is that an employer can fire you at will,\" said CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School.",
      "Government workers have some free speech protections, but it's complicated",
      "In many cases, Trump allies have spotlighted public employees who criticize Kirk.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called celebrations of Kirk's death by service members or civilian workers \"unacceptable\" last week, and said the Pentagon is \"tracking\" them. Since then, at least one Marine officer has been relieved of his recruiting duties pending an investigation into his post about Kirk, and two Army officers have been suspended pending a review into their posts, according to a Marine official and an Army official.",
      "A Secret Service agent who expressed negative opinions about Kirk on Facebook was also placed on leave last week.",
      "At the state level, Oklahoma's top education official has said teachers who celebrate Kirk's assassination \"will be banned from teaching,\" and teachers in several other states have been investigated or placed on leave over their comments. Others have pushed for action against employees at public colleges like Clemson University.",
      "People who work for the government have some free speech protections, especially for speech that they make while off the clock, legal experts say.",
      "\"Government employees do have First Amendment rights of freedom of speech,\" said Calvert. \"However, those rights are not unlimited and may be restricted if the employee's speech somehow interferes with the ability of the employer \u2026 to effectively and efficiently deliver its services to the public.\"",
      "Calvert said \"every case is going to be unique.\"",
      "Prior court rulings have established several factors for assessing the speech rights of government employees, according to Calvert and Volokh. Those include whether the worker spoke in their personal capacity, whether it relates to a matter of public concern and whether the worker's right to speak out outweighs the government's interest in delivering its services.",
      "But the military is a slightly separate case, according to Volokh, because \"there are more restrictions that are permissible on service members' speech.\"",
      "Volokh said the military is different \"in part because of a sense that \u2026 this is an environment where discipline is really important, where self-discipline is really important, where unit cohesion is really important, where commitment to the right ideas is very important.\"",
      "\"It's going very, very far\"",
      "Some First Amendment advocates are uncomfortable with vocal calls for people to be fired \u2014 even if they don't run afoul of the Constitution.",
      "\"It's going very, very far. This is not being limited to people saying, 'I'm glad Charlie Kirk is dead and I wish everyone like him was dead, too,'\" Younes said. \"It's being applied to people who just are saying they didn't like Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "Goldstein said that some officials may be understandably lashing out after the death of their friend, but particularly in the context of Kirk's career as free speech advocate, the reaction has gone too far.",
      "\"What a weird way to react in memory of Charlie Kirk, who was known for listening to people and disagreeing with them, and moving on,\" Goldstein said.",
      "Graham  Kates, \n                                                  \n                                  Eleanor  Watson, \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen and \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "In a legal complaint\u00a0filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the regulatory agency also alleged that Live Nation, which owns Ticketmaster, used \"bait-and-switch pricing\" tactics by advertising lower ticket prices than what was actually available to customers, and by selling millions of tickets to brokers\u2014 often at a significant markup \u2014 despite limits that artists had placed on such sales.",
      "\"The FTC alleges that in public, Ticketmaster maintains that its business model is at odds with brokers that routinely exceed ticket limits,\" the agency said in a news release. \"But in private, Ticketmaster acknowledged that its business model and bottom line benefit from brokers preventing ordinary Americans from purchasing tickets to the shows they want to see at the prices artists set.\"",
      "The agency said Live Nation's and Ticketmaster's business practices violate the Better Online Ticket Sales Act and other laws barring deceptive sales tactics.",

      "The decision by the IOC after a meeting in Milan on Friday was expected and maintains the same sanctions as the Summer Games in Paris last year.",
      "The IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in October 2023 after sanctions were imposed due to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, saying it violated the Olympic Charter.",
      "\"We also spoke about the Independent Neutral Athletes (AINs). This will be nothing new,\" IOC President Kirsty Coventry said at a press conference, according to Reuters. \"The Executive board will take the exact same approach that was done in Paris (2024 Olympics). Nothing has changed.\"",
      "Previously, Russian athletes were permitted to compete under the Russian Olympic Committee, or \"ROC,\" which last made its appearance during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. They were allowed to compete under the \"ROC\" after a series of scandals curtailed their access to the Games, but that was changed for the Paris Games.",
      "Last summer, Russian athletes could only take part under a neutral flag and individual events. They competed without the Russian or Belarusian flag and anthem. Instead, they took part as neutral athletes.",

      "Russian and Belarusian athletes who reach qualifying times will be first vetted for any links to the Russian military or support for the more than three-year war in Ukraine, both of which will exclude them, the IOC said.",
      "Why is Russia banned from the Olympics?",
      "Olympic athletes from Russia have faced a series of scandals and challenges in recent years.",
      "The scandal of Russian athletes taking illegal performance-enhancing drugs burst into public view in 2015 after a series of leaks and investigations. In November 2015, the entire Russian track and field team was suspended after the World Anti-Doping Agency found\u00a0what it called\u00a0a \"culture of cheating.\"",
      "A 2016\u00a0report\u00a0identified more than 1,000 individuals linked to a Russian state-sponsored doping scheme between 2011 and 2014. Russia was banned in 2017 because of the scheme but the IOC gave individual athletes the chance to apply for admission to compete as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia.\" Only 168 Russian athletes passed the vetting process to participate in the 2018 Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, under a neutral Olympic flag. This was the second time Russian athletes had participated under the neutral flag after being in the Unified Team of 1992.",

    "story": [
      "The European Union proposed Friday bringing forward a ban on Russian gas imports as part of a new package of sanctions aimed at sapping Moscow's war chest after pressure from President Trump.",
      "Under the measures presented for approval by the bloc's member states, the European Commission said it aims to phase out liquefied natural gas (LNG) purchases from Russia by January 2027 \u2014 one year earlier than planned.",
      "\"Russia's war economy is sustained by revenues from fossil fuels. We want to cut these revenues. So we are banning imports of Russian LNG into European markets,\" commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said. \"It is time to turn off the tap.\"",
      "The proposal comes as the United States pressures the EU to end fossil fuel imports from Russia and the bloc seeks, in turn, to persuade Mr. Trump to take a tougher stance on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Trump has so far held back from upping pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin but said last week he was ready to do so if allies stopped buying Russian oil and hit China with tariffs.",
      "Von der Leyen did not give full details of the sanctions package, but officials told the Reuters news agency it would also target Chinese refineries, special economic zones, and Russian and central Asian banks.",
      "\"We are now going after these who fuel Russia's war, who purchase oil in breach of sanctions,\" von der Leyen said, according to Reuters. \"We target refineries, oil traders, petrochemical companies in third countries including China.\"",
      "The 27-nation EU has already banned most Russian oil under previous rounds of sanctions, slashing the share it imports from 29% in early 2021 to 2% by mid-2025. Only Hungary and Slovakia, friendly to Moscow and Mr. Trump, still buy it.",
      "The multiple rounds of European sanctions imposed since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022 have sought to sap its war chest with everything from asset freezes to a near-complete ban on importing Russian oil.",
      "Despite a push to end decades of European dependency, Russia still supplied 19% of the EU's gas in 2024 \u2014 down from 45% before the war. This is in part down to an increase in purchases of liquefied natural gas (LNG) transported by sea, which has\u00a0partially offset a sharp fall in pipeline imports.",

      "Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities issued a statement on Tuesday saying it had referred the case to public prosecutors and other relevant law enforcement agencies to take the necessary measures to recover the artifact.",
      "The statement noted that some photos that had circulated online were not actually of the missing bracelet, which was \"a golden bracelet adorned with spherical lapis lazuli beads, belonging to King Amenemope.\"",
      "Photos that circulated online showed another item that remains on display at the museum, which was never missing.",
      "The ministry said authorities delayed going public with the disappearance, which came to light on Sept. 9, in an effort to secure the investigation's progress. It said all Egyptian air, sea and land crossings were put on alert to prevent the artifact being smuggled out of the country, as has occurred in other smuggling cases.",
      "But the reality of the disappearing bracelet was much simpler, though no less sad for Egypt.",
      "The Egyptian Ministry of Interior announced Thursday that four suspects had been arrested. It said that on Sept. 9 the bracelet was stolen from a safe inside the museum's restoration laboratory by a restoration specialist working at the museum.",
      "She allegedly gave it to an acquaintance who owns a sliver shop in Cairo, who then sold it to the owner of a gold workshop for the equivalent of about $3,800. That shop owner then sold it for around $4,000 to another gold workshop owner, the ministry said, who melted the bracelet down to reshape into other gold jewelry.",
      "Along with its statement, the Ministry of Interior released security camera video showing a shop owner receiving the bracelet, weighing it, and then paying one of the suspects.",
      "The ministry said all involved individuals had been placed under arrest, and the proceeds from the sale of the bracelet recovered.",
      "Social media users have voiced outrage not only that bracelet was allegedly stolen by a restoration specialist working for the museum, but that she didn't appear to recognize its true value. Many have been left lamenting the fact that the bracelet that managed to survive over 3,000 years is now gone forever.",

    "summary": "The outgoing head of Britain's MI6 spy agency says Russia's Vladimir Putin is \"stringing us along,\" with no interest in a Ukraine peace deal.",
    "story": [
      "There is \"absolutely no evidence\" that Russia's President Vladimir Putin wants to negotiate peace in Ukraine, the outgoing head of Britain's foreign intelligence agency said Friday in a speech. Sir Richard Moore, chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6 as it is more commonly known, said Putin was \"stringing us along.\"",
      "\"He seeks to impose his imperial will by all means at his disposal. But he cannot succeed,\" Moore said. \"Bluntly, Putin has bitten off more than he can chew. He thought he was going to win an easy victory. But he \u2014 and many others \u2014 underestimated the Ukrainians.\"",
      "Moore was speaking at the British consulate in Istanbul after five years as head of MI6. He leaves the post at the end of September.",
      "During his tenure, Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a war that has seen tens of thousands killed and still rages, principally in eastern Ukraine.",
      "Moore said the invasion had strengthened Ukrainian national identity and accelerated its westward trajectory, as well as pushing Sweden and Finland to join NATO.",
      "\"Putin has sought to convince the world that Russian victory is inevitable. But he lies. He lies to the world. He lies to his people. Perhaps he even lies to himself,\" Moore told a news conference.",
      "He said that Putin was \"mortgaging his country's future for his own personal legacy and a distorted version of history\" and the war was \"accelerating this decline.\"",
      "Speaking Thursday during a state visit to the U.K., President Trump voiced frustration with Putin, saying he had hoped the war in Ukraine would be easy to end \u2014 as he suggested it would before taking office \u2014\u00a0 \"because of my relationship with President Putin,\" but that the Russian leader had \"really let me down.\"",
      "That remark came about a month after Mr. Trump met with Putin in Alaska, and said after their summit that he believed the Russian leader wanted to end the war.",
      "Moore, who previously served as the U.K.'s ambassador to Ankara, the Turkish capital, added that \"greater powers than Russia have failed to subjugate weaker powers than Ukraine.\"",
      "Analysts say Putin believes he can outlast the political commitment of Ukraine's Western partners and win a protracted war of attrition by wearing down Ukraine's smaller army with sheer weight of numbers.",
      "Ukraine, meanwhile, is racing to expand its defense cooperation with other countries and secure billions of dollars of investment in its domestic weapons industry.",
      "Recruiting digital spies",
      "Moore's speech came as the U.K. foreign office announced the launch of a new dark web portal by MI6 aimed at recruiting \"new agents in Russia and around the world.\"",
      "Called \"Silent Courier,\" the U.K. government said the portal would harness the anonymity of the dark web and allow \"anyone in the world with access to sensitive information relating to terrorism or hostile intelligence activity to securely contact the U.K. and offer their services.\"",
      "The U.K. foreign office said instructions for how to access the portal would be available on its YouTube channel, and that it was modeled on a similar approach taken by the United States Central Intelligence Agency.",
      "\"We're asking those with sensitive information on global instability, international terrorism or hostile state intelligence activity to contact MI6 securely online,\" Moore said during his speech in Istanbul, according to a foreign office statement. \"Our virtual door is open to you.\"",
      "The foreign office also said a new partnership with Google Cloud would improve communications between the U.K. and the U.S.",
      "\"Following the U.S. President's historic second State Visit to the U.K. this week, the U.K. and U.S. continue to strengthen their defence and security relationship in an increasingly uncertain world,\" the foreign office said. \"Last week, a new partnership with Google Cloud means the U.K. and U.S. can communicate securely, so the UK and our closest ally can outmatch hostile actors who seek to cause chaos for working people by disrupting their everyday lives, including trying to steal sensitive information and launching targeted cyber campaigns.\"",

It appeared to be part of efforts by the Taliban to be recognized internationally as the legitimate government of Afghanistan more than four years after they retook power over the country as the U.S. military pulled out.",
      "The case of Peter and Barbie Reynolds, aged 80 and 75, underlined the concerns of the West over the actions of the Taliban since they overthrew the country's U.S.-backed government in a 2021 lightning offensive. The Reynolds had lived in Afghanistan for 18 years and run an education and training organization in the country's central province of Bamiyan, choosing to remain in the country after the Taliban seized power.",
      "An official with knowledge of their release told CBS News on Friday that they were freed following mediation led by Qatar, an energy-rich nation on the Arabian Peninsula that mediated talks between the U.S. and the Taliban before the American withdrawal.",
      "The official said their freedom was secured after many months of negotiations by Qatari officials with the Taliban, working in close coordination with the British government and the couple's family.",
      "In a statement released by the U.K. government, Hamish Falconer, Minister for the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan, said he was \"relieved to hear that Peter and Barbie Reynolds are no longer detained in Afghanistan, and their ordeal has come to an end. I look forward to them being reunited with their family soon.\"",
      "He said the British government had \"worked intensively since their detention and has supported the family throughout,\" and he thanked Qatar for its \"essential role in this case.\"",
      "The Reynolds were largely held separately during their detention, but the Qatari embassy in Kabul \"provided them with critical support, including access to their doctor, delivery of medication, and regular communication with their family,\" the official familiar with the case told CBS News, adding that the couple were on their way home Friday.",
      "The Reynolds' family members in the United Kingdom had repeatedly called for the couple's release, saying they were being mistreated and held on undisclosed charges. While the Taliban rejected the abuse allegations, they have never explained what prompted their detention.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Taliban government or the U.K. Foreign Office about the couple's release.",
      "In July, United Nations human rights experts warned the couple's physical and mental health was deteriorating rapidly and that they were at risk of irreparable harm or even death.",
      "Earlier this month, the Taliban said it had reached an agreement with U.S. envoys on a prisoner exchange as part of an effort to normalize relations. The meeting came after the Taliban in March released U.S. citizen George Glezmann, who was abducted while traveling through Afghanistan as a tourist.",
      "In April, the Reynolds' American children appealed to President Trump in a video, asking for his help in securing their release.",
      "The Reynolds were detained in February along with their American friend Faye Hall and their Afghan interpreter as they traveled to the British couple's home in Bamiyan province, the family told CBS News.",
      "Hall, an U.S. citizen, was\u00a0released in the spring\u00a0into the custody of Qatari officials, who helped broker her release and return to the U.S., as the Reynolds family marked eight weeks of their parents being detained.",
      "Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban's ambassador in Qatar, told CBS News at the time that Hall was released as a \"goodwill gesture\" and that the administration \"want to have positive relations with (the) U.S. and other countries.\"",
      "Afghanistan remains a focus of President Trump. On Thursday, while visiting the U.K., Mr. Trump said the U.S. was working to regain control over the Bagram Air Base in the country.",
      "\"We're trying to get it back. Because they need things from us,\" Mr. Trump said during his state visit to Britain. \"We want that base back.\"",
      "The president said one reason the U.S. wanted control of the base is its location, calling it an \"hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,\" apparently referring to the time it would take to fly to the unspecified location from the airfield.",

      "Race engineer Alessandro Tedino told The Associated Press that he wasn't sure the new record was attainable. The ship had been out at sea overnight, and the crew emerged in the early morning to find its flight deck wet. They immediately set to drying it, with the job finished by late summer sunbeams.",
      "\"If it remained wet, then of course it's impossible to have the maximum speed and best brakes. It can be very, very dangerous,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects preserved in amber for the first time in South America, providing a fresh glimpse into life on Earth at a time when flowering plants were just beginning to diversify and spread around the world.",
      "Many of the specimens found at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador date to 112 million years ago, said Fabiany Herrera, curator of fossil plants at the Field Museum in Chicago and co-author of the study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment. At least six types of arthropods were found preserved, according to the study.",
      "Almost all known amber deposits from the past 130 million years have been in the Northern Hemisphere, and it's long been \"an enigma\" that scientists have found few in southern regions that once comprised the supercontinent Gondwana, said David Grimaldi, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the discovery.",
      "This marks the first time researchers have identified ancient beetles, flies, ants and wasps in fossilized tree resin in South America, said Ricardo P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente, a paleoentomologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, who also was not involved in the new study.",
      "\"Amber pieces are little windows into the past,\" P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente said, adding that the discovery will help researchers understand the evolving interactions between flowering plants and insects that lived during the era of the dinosaurs.",
      "The researchers uncovered hundreds of fragments of amber, some containing ancient insects, pollen and tree leaves, at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador that's on the edge of what is today the Amazon basin.",
      "Two types of amber were discovered, according to the study: There was a more common form of amber found around the roots of resin-producing plants, and a rarer form of the material formed from resin exposed to air. The amber formed around the roots did not hold any specimens, the study said.",
      "\"A different kind of forest\"",
      "The discoveries provide evidence that the area was once a \"humid, resinous forest ecosystem,\" according to the study.",
      "But today's rainforest is much different from what dinosaurs roamed through, Herrera said. Based on an analysis of fossils in the amber, the ancient rainforest contained species of ferns and conifers, including the unusual Monkey Puzzle Tree, that no longer grow in Amazonia.",
      "\"It was a different kind of forest,\" said Herrera.",
      "The amber deposits were previously known to geologists and miners who worked at the Genoveva quarry. Study co-author Carlos Jaramillo at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute first heard of them about a decade ago and set out to find the exact location, aided by geology field notes.",
      "\"I went there and realized this place is amazing,\" Jaramillo said. \"There's so much amber in the mines,\" and it's more visible in the open quarry than it would be if hidden under dense layers of vegetation.",
      "Researchers will continue to analyze the amber trove to learn more about Cretaceous-era biodiversity \u2014 including the insects that contributed to evolution by feeding on flowering plants. \"Amber tends to preserve things that are tiny,\" said Grimaldi.",
      "\"It's the time when the relationship between flowering plants and insects got started,\" said P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente. \"And that turned out to be one of the most successful partnerships in nature.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 19:56:08 -0400",
    "summary": "A new study on chimpanzees in Uganda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire supports a theory that humans may have inherited a taste for alcohol from primate ancestors.",
    "story": [
      "In the forests of Uganda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, chimps crowd into fig and plum trees, feasting on fruit that's sweet, soft and just a little boozy. A new study shows those daily snacks quietly add up to the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages for humans.",
      "A team of scientists at University of California Berkeley and other institutions tested the fruit chimps actually snack on: figs in Uganda's canopy and the plum-like fruits on the forest floor in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Collecting the data wasn't easy \u2014 with little electricity beyond solar panels and constant humidity threatening the instruments, researchers spent three seasons hauling equipment and calibrating test kits to measure alcohol in many different tropical fruits.",
      "In the end, they found that on average, the fruit's alcohol content came in at about .3% by weight. This is kombucha-level, but when chimpanzees eat 10 pounds of fruit a day and weigh around 90 pounds, it adds up to about 14 grams of ethanol, equating to about two cocktails for a human.",
      "But don't picture chimps swinging drunkenly from the trees. To actually get drunk, they'd have to binge on fruit until their bellies ballooned, the researchers said. Instead, they're exposed to a steady low dose, a quiet buzz from nature's own fermentation process.",
      "Senior author of the paper and UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology Robert Dudley first floated the \"drunken monkey\" hypothesis in 2000, arguing that our attraction to alcohol could come from ancestral fruit-eating habits. Dudley argued that it makes sense primates would be tuned to alcohol, since their diets have long revolved around ripe fruit.",
      "\"Once you start eating, it acts as an aperitif,\" he said. \"The pleasure of association with drinking alcohol increases feeding rates.\"",
      "Other animals chase the same buzz too.",
      "\"Open a bottle of beer outside and a fruit fly appears almost instantly,\" Dudley said.",
      "Spider monkeys in Panama, slow lorises in Malaysia and even elephants have been documented consuming naturally fermented fruit or nectar.",
      "What makes this study different is that it provides the first direct chemical measurements of ethanol in the fruits that wild chimps routinely eat, and then connects those numbers to daily intake.",
      "The open question is whether chimps are actually selecting fruit for its alcohol content or just chasing sugar and calories. Either way, Dudley says the story connects to us.",
      "\"We inherited the taste for alcohol,\" Dudley said. \"Even though our diets have diversified \u2026 that bias to consume quickly when this molecule is present could still be a powerful force.\"",

      "The researchers say that Ukrainian children in the eastern regions occupied by Russia since its full-scale invasion began in February 2022 have been sent to the facilities where, \"in many cases, (they) are placed in programs of forced militarization that include, though are not limited to, combat and paratrooper training.\"",
      "\"Children at some facilities have been engaged in the production of military equipment for Russia's armed forces, including drones,\" the Yale study said.",
      "The researchers said their conclusions were based on \"publicly available data sources and commercially available satellite imagery,\" and that the analysts \"evaluated each data source for reliability, veracity, and credibility using assessment criteria derived from the Berkeley Protocol\" for open-source research, and an intelligence assessment framework used by NATO.",
      "The Yale researchers do not provide an estimate of the total number of children abducted by Russia. They note that while some have been returned, \"other groups of children have been held indefinitely. In some cases, children who have entered this network of camps, so-called family centers, and other facilities have entered Russia's program of coerced fostering and adoption, eventually being placed with families in Russia and becoming naturalized citizens of the Russian Federation.\"",
      "The report details at least eight different types of facilities to which Ukrainian children have been taken, including summer camps, mental health institutions, at least one military base and even a monastery. It said the objective for Russian authorities is to indoctrinate the Ukrainian children with pro-Russian, anti-Ukrainian cultural and patriotic narratives.",
      "Ukraine's state-run \"Bring Kids Back\" program, launched by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, says more than 19,500 Ukrainian children have been abducted since Russia's invasion began. It says only about 1,600 have been returned, including 101 who were bought back in August.",
      "In March 2023, the U.N.'s International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of committing \"the war crime of unlawful deportation of population (children) and that of unlawful transfer of population (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation.\"",
      "The court also issued an arrest warrant for Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, the commissioner for children's rights in the Office of the President, accusing her of committing the same crimes.",
      "Zelenskyy said last week that he would raise the issue of abducted Ukrainian children during the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York next week. He said he would host the event along with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and that \"many leaders will join us.\"",

      "Von der Leyen, in her own post, thanked Mr. Trump, and added that \"every single Ukrainian child abducted by Russia must be returned to their families.\"",
      "Mr. Trump didn't mention Russia specifically in his own remarks. First lady Melania Trump, several days before the White House meetings, had penned an open letter to Putin pleading with the Russian leader to protect \"the innocence of these children,\" though not specifying which children she was referring to.",

      "Putin's government \"appears determined to erase Ukraine's existence as a state by attempting to rob it of its future,\" the Biden-era State Department report said, adding that \"mounting evidence shows Russia uses forcible relocation, re-education, and, in some cases, adoption of Ukraine's children as key components of its systematic efforts to suppress Ukraine's identity, history, and culture.\"",

    "story": [
      "Christian Brueckner, the convicted rapist identified by German prosecutors as the prime suspect in the 2007 disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann in Portugal, was released from prison in northern Germany on Wednesday after serving his sentence in an unrelated rape case.",
      "Shortly after 9 a.m. local time, Brueckner was driven out of the Sehnde prison in a black Audi, accompanied by his lawyer and a police escort. Police confirmed that he had left the facility but said they did not know where he was going.",
      "Brueckner, 48, just completed a seven-year prison sentence for the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal. Upon his release, he was fitted with an electronic ankle tag, a condition imposed to enable authorities to monitor his movements. His lawyers have declined to say where he will live.",
      "German prosecutors have said they believe Brueckner is responsible for McCann's disappearance from her family's vacation rental home in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz, citing evidence including cell phone data that placed him near the resort at the time. McCann was 3 years old at the time.",
      "Brueckner, who lived for years in Portugal's southern Algarve region, where Praia da Luz is located, has multiple prior convictions for sexual offenses, including against children, and a long record of petty crimes. Despite the circumstantial evidence, however, he has never been charged in relation to the McCann case and has always denied any involvement in her disappearance.",
      "To many observers, the case has highlighted significant differences between the legal systems in Germany and the U.K.",
      "Mark Stephens, a consultant at the British legal firm Howard Kennedy, told CBS News the legal thresholds differ between the countries.",
      "\"In the U.K. and the U.S., you need to believe there's better than a 50% chance of a successful prosecution before charges are brought. Circumstantial evidence can be used. The law recognizes that you won't always have key evidence. In a rape case, for example, you need some kind of corroboration, some supporting evidence. But in a murder case, that's the exception \u2014 you don't need that. So, you could prosecute if you thought the circumstantial evidence was sufficient.\"",
      "In Germany, however, he said the legal system sets a much higher threshold for prosecution.",
      "\"The prosecutors' statement says they haven't gathered enough direct evidence to charge him,\" said Stephens. \"That's because under German rules, circumstantial and inferential evidence isn't admissible in the same way.\"",
      "Madeleine's disappearance remains one of the most high-profile unsolved cases in the world, and even after his release, Brueckner will likely remain at the center of the inquiry, as he's been since German prosecutors publicly\u00a0identified him as a suspect\u00a0in 2020.",
      "British investigators had hoped to question Brueckner just days before his release in Germany, to clarify key details about his movements in Praia da Luz around the time that McCann vanished. The London Metropolitan Police submitted a formal request for an interview with him, but Brueckner declined to speak with the investigators earlier this week.",

    "summary": "Some ancient societies in Asia appear to have smoke-dried their dead, effectively mummifying them thousands of years earlier than their Egyptian counterparts, new research has found.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have discovered what's thought to be the oldest known mummies in the world in southeastern Asia dating back up to 12,000 years.",
      "Mummification prevents decay by preserving dead bodies. The process can happen naturally in places like the sands of Chile's Atacama Desert or the bogs of Ireland where conditions can fend off decomposition. Humans across various cultures also mummified their ancestors through embalming to honor them or send their souls to the afterlife.",
      "Egypt's mummies may be the most well-known, but until now some of the oldest mummies were prepared by a fishing people called the Chinchorro about 7,000 years ago in what's now Peru and Chile.",
      "A new study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences pushes that timeline back.",
      "Researchers found human remains that were buried in crouched or squatted positions with some cuts and burn marks in various archaeological sites across China and Vietnam and to a lesser extent, from the Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.",
      "Studying the bones further, scientists discovered the bodies were likely exposed to heat. That suggested the bodies had been smoke-dried over a fire and mummified by hunter-gatherer communities in the area.",
      "The practice \"allowed people to sustain physical and spiritual connections with their ancestors, bridging time and memory,\" study author Hirofumi Matsumura with Sapporo Medical University in Japan said in an email.",
      "The results were \"a great surprise,\" said Hsiao-chun Hung, senior research fellow at Australian National University.",
      "\"The bones are so ancient, and it is remarkable to discover that this tradition is so old, connecting the practices of ancient peoples with those still found in some communities today,\" Hung said.",
      "The process allowed relatives to maintain contact with the deceased, and in some cases was believed to allow the spirit to roam freely during the day and return to a body at night.",
      "\"I believe this reflects something deeply human \u2014 the timeless wish that our loved ones might never leave us, but remain by our side forever,\" Hung told Agence France-Presse.",
      "The researchers theorize that the practice may have been common in ancient Asian civilizations.",
      "\"This tradition may have been known among hunter-gatherer societies across a vast region, for many millennia,\" they wrote in the study,",
      "Dating methods used on the mummies could have been more robust and it's not yet clear that mummies were consistently smoke-dried across all these locations in southeastern Asia, said human evolution expert Rita Peyroteo Stjerna with Uppsala University in Sweden, who was not involved with the research.",
      "The findings offer \"an important contribution to the study of prehistoric funerary practices,\" she said in an email.",
      "Mummies are far from a thing of the past. Even today, Indigenous communities in Australia and Papua New Guinea smoke-dry and mummify their dead, scientists said.",

    "summary": "Christian Brueckner, a sex offender identified as the prime suspect in the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann, is set to be released from a German prison.",
    "story": [
      "Berlin \u2014\u00a0Christian Brueckner, the convicted sex offender named by German authorities as the prime suspect in the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann almost two decades ago, has refused to be interviewed by U.K. police just days before his expected release from prison.",
      "The 48-year-old German national is due to walk free by Wednesday after serving a seven-year sentence for a separate crime, the rape of a 72-year-old American woman in the same region of Portugal from which McCann vanished during a vacation with her family.",
      "While Brueckner remains under formal investigation over McCann's 2007 disappearance, he has never been charged in connection with the case and he continues to deny any involvement.",
      "His decision to decline the London Metropolitan Police's formal request for an interview is being seen as a setback in the long running search for answers in the case that has frustrated investigators in Britain, Portugal and Germany for years.",
      "British Investigators hoped to question Brueckner to clarify key details about his movements in Praia da Luz, the resort town in Portugal's southern Algarve region from which McCann, then three, disappeared. She vanished from her family's rental apartment while her parents had dinner nearby.",
      "For many connected to the case, Brueckner's looming release represents both a pivotal moment and an obstacle. Authorities have been weighing how much oversight they can reasonably maintain over the convicted sex offender once he is no longer behind bars.",
      "Prosecutors in the city of Braunschweig have petitioned the regional court in Hildesheim for what's known as supervisory oversight, a form of monitoring similar to parole that could allow them to impose strict conditions on Brueckner after his release, possibly including an ankle tracking tag.",
      "Brueckner could also be required to declare a fixed place of residence, inform authorities of any change in address or workplace, and face restrictions on where he is permitted to travel. Such restrictions could include barring him from areas linked to his past crimes. He could also be prohibited from leaving Germany without requesting explicit approval from authorities.",
      "Brueckner's attorney Friedrich Fuelscher declined to comment when asked by CBS News about the possibility of his client being subjected to supervisory oversight measures.",
      "A regional court will ultimately decide what measures, if any, to implement following Brueckner's release.",
      "Even if supervisory oversight measures are granted, they are unlikely to satisfy critics who believe the circumstantial evidence linking Brueckner to the McCann case should dictate more close cooperation with British investigators.",
      "His refusal to answer U.K. detectives' questions means they won't get a chance to push him about inconsistencies in his alibis or to confront him directly with witness statements they have gathered over the last 18 years.",
      "The McCann case remains one of the world's most high-profile missing persons investigations.",
      "Brueckner has been at the center of the inquiry since German prosecutors publicly identified him as a suspect in 2020, citing phone records and his history of violent crimes in Portugal's Algarve region. But no charges have ever been brought against him in the McCann case, as the circumstantial evidence has been deemed insufficient to move forward with charges under German law.",

Jeanne Shaheen, said \"it's a winnable race for the right person who reflects our state's values, not the values of Washington.\"",

      "\"This is an incredibly important race. It's an incredibly important time for the country and I feel it might be the right time to step up,\" Sununu told Fox News Digital.",
      "He said that \"over the last few weeks, people in New Hampshire have reached out. They've encouraged me to run for Senate, because they know how important it is that New Hampshire has the right kind of voice in Washington, someone who will stand up for our state, someone who won't just be a rubber stamp for anyone else, but will represent New Hampshire every single day.\"",

      "But the Republican Party has dramatically changed since the former senator last ran for office 17 years ago. The GOP, under the firm control of President Donald Trump and his America First agenda and MAGA movement, has been transformed from a business-orientated platform into a more populist party.",
      "Asked if there's still room for an old-school fiscal conservative in Trump's GOP, Sununu said, \"good decision-making, good leadership, never goes out of style. Standing up for your state, standing up for your neighbors and your friends, and the things that make New Hampshire strong never goes out of style.

      "Brown endorsed Trump ahead of his 2016 New Hampshire primary victory, which launched him toward the GOP presidential nomination and ultimately the White House. Brown later served as U.S. ambassador to New Zealand during Trump's first term.",
      "And Innis claims that he's the most pro-Trump candidate in the race.",
      "Asked if he could win a Republican primary race that could turn into a Trump loyalty test, Sununu said \"the real question is, can you be effective? Can you work with other members of Congress? Can you work with this White House? Can you provide the kind of leadership it takes to get things done? And I know I can do that.\"",
      "\"If there's a primary, I've seen them before. I've been through them before,\" he added. \"I'm very comfortable with where we are today, and over the next few weeks, I'll continue to get people's perspective, put together a good team, make sure we have a winning message and make a decision in October.\"",
      "Trump, whose endorsement in Republican primaries is extremely influential, has remained neutral to date.",

      "The \"One Conversation at a Time\" tour, previewed exclusively to Fox News Digital, is sponsored by the Kirk-founded nonprofit, Turning Point USA, which seeks to engage young people in conservative politics. Hollyhand's tour will include stops at 10 big-name universities across the broader southeast, including in Florida, South Carolina, and Mississippi \u2014 whose undergraduate populations average between 30,000 and 40,000 people, according to data from the U.S. News & World Report.",
      "Hollyhand, who wields considerable influence in his own right \u2014 he's both a podcast host and author who met Kirk in fourth grade, when Kirk appeared as a guest on his podcast \u2014 told Fox News Digital in an interview that Kirk's death should inspire people to speak up and engage with others face-to-face.",

      "Kirk, who died at 31, differentiated himself from other political \"influencers\" because of his authenticity, Hollyhand said. He established a presence in large part because of his college stops, where he'd sit for hours at a \"Prove Me Wrong\" table to debate young people face-to-face.",
      "He leaped onto the national stage at a time when the Republican Party had been struggling to attract young voters, compared to then-President Barack Obama and the considerable star power wielded by the Democratic Party. And while Kirk's views were unabashedly controversial, they were seen as a welcome breath of fresh air for many Republicans, who often felt out of place and unrepresented on college campuses.",
      "\"Charlie has really large shoes to fill, not just because he was a tall guy with a big shoe size,\" he laughed, \"but because he genuinely inspired a generation, and it wasn't a simple task.\"",

      "Hollyhand, who first met Kirk when he was in fourth grade, acknowledged he is not embarking on the tour without fear. The threats against him had skyrocketed in the days since Kirk's killing, necessitating a meeting with his security detail, who required they escort him to his classes.",
      "The threats against him were also more detailed, \"explicitly mentioning [my] walks to classes,\" he said.",

      "\"What if I went back to being a normal college student partying it up and going to classes? It would be a lot safer,\" he said. \"I wouldn't have to have a detail walk with me to class.\"",
      "\"And so, when Turning Point reached out about doing this tour for Charlie, [that] is why I'm doing this, not because it's easy, but because it's hard and because it is terrifying.\"",

      "Watch for anyone loitering near the carousel and observing passengers closely. Stay aware of your surroundings while handling travel documents.",
      "Opt for mobile boarding passes instead of printed ones. This removes the risk of discarded paper passes falling into the wrong hands.",
      "Avoid printing your full home address or primary phone number. Instead, use your name, a travel-only email and either a P.O. box or work address. You can even create a simple alias email just for travel, which forwards to your main inbox but keeps your real address private. This way, airlines and honest finders can still reach you without exposing sensitive personal details to scammers.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Another way to protect yourself is by putting a small tracker inside your luggage, such as an\u00a0Apple AirTag or a\u00a0similar Bluetooth tracker. These devices connect to your phone and let you see where your bag is in near real-time. If your suitcase goes missing or ends up in the wrong place, you\u2019ll know faster than waiting for the airline to track it down.",
      "Place the tracker inside your bag rather than on the handle so it can\u2019t be easily removed. Check its location through your phone before leaving the airport, and keep an eye on it during layovers. While AirTags can\u2019t prevent someone from misusing an old luggage tag, they give you proof of where your bag actually is if you ever need to dispute a lost luggage claim or theft.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "While the luggage tag scam may not be widespread yet, it exploits a simple oversight that most travelers rarely consider. Until airlines and airports put better safeguards in place, the burden falls on passengers to protect their own information.

      "APPLE WINS BLOOD OXYGEN BATTLE FOR WATCH OWNERS",
      "Apple Watch Series 11 now includes FDA-cleared hypertension notification. (Apple)",
      "Apple Watch hypertension alerts explained",
      "Hypertension is often called the \"silent killer\" because it can strike without symptoms. Left unchecked, it increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and kidney disease. By adding passive blood pressure monitoring, Apple Watch aims to help millions detect early warning signs.",
      "Using its optical heart sensor, the watch reviews how your blood vessels respond to heartbeats over 30-day periods. If it detects consistent patterns of hypertension, you'll get a notification. Apple expects the feature could alert more than 1 million people with undiagnosed hypertension in its first year alone.",
      "Apple Watch sends users a \"Possible Hypertension\" alert when heart data shows consistent signs of elevated blood pressure. Paired with the iPhone, users can log blood pressure and follow up with doctors. (Apple)",
      "Clinical validation of Apple Watch hypertension feature",
      "Apple built the new hypertension notification feature on a foundation of years of health research. Since the launch of Apple Watch, heart health tools like ECG, AFib History and irregular rhythm notifications have helped users catch issues early. The hypertension notification now extends that mission by addressing one of the most common and dangerous silent conditions.",
      "The feature works in the background during waking hours, analyzing photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, changes in blood volume under the skin, to detect patterns that suggest chronic high blood pressure. You do not need to calibrate the feature or take direct blood pressure readings with the watch. Instead, the device tracks signals over 30 days and sends a notification if consistent signs of hypertension appear.",
      "CAN YOUR APPLE WATCH DETECT PREGNANCY?",
      "Study results confirm accuracy of hypertension alerts",
      "Apple developed the algorithm using data from more than 100,000 study participants across diverse ages, races, body types, and health statuses. The company then validated its accuracy through a pivotal clinical study with over 2,000 participants, who wore Apple Watch alongside an at-home cuff to compare results.",
      "The validation study showed the feature achieved a specificity rate above 92%, meaning it minimized false positives. Sensitivity rates were especially strong for Stage 2 hypertension, the more severe form of the condition, where the feature identified more than half of users at risk. That accuracy could help prevent strokes, heart attacks and kidney disease in those who may not otherwise know they have hypertension.",
      "Importantly, the study confirmed that the feature performed consistently across age groups, genders, races and skin tones, making it reliable for Apple's global user base. Apple also ran usability testing to fine-tune onboarding and notification language so people understand the alerts and what actions to take next.",
      "By passively monitoring and flagging possible signs of hypertension, Apple Watch helps fill a dangerous gap in diagnosis. Hypertension often goes unnoticed for years, but now, you can be alerted within just one month of wearing the watch.",

      "\"I\u2019m glad to see Apple turning attention toward hypertension\u2014the number one preventable cause of heart attack and stroke. Their approach automatically flags signals that suggest you may have high blood pressure and encourages you to check it out. That\u2019s especially important because so many people remain undiagnosed. The feature also provides a way to archive blood pressures, so if people are measuring at home, they can bring that information to their doctor. This isn\u2019t a one-stop solution, but it has the potential to help consumers take charge of their health and identify hypertension earlier. The caveat is that people shouldn\u2019t rely on it exclusively\u2014regular care remains essential.\"",

      "What if your old bottle of cooking oil could help save the planet and your smartphone? That's the big idea behind a groundbreaking discovery by researchers in Finland.",
      "Scientists from the University of Helsinki and the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 have found that you can recover silver from electronic waste using common kitchen ingredients like vegetable oil and hydrogen peroxide. This sustainable, scalable method published in the Chemical Engineering Journal could change how we mine precious metals from our growing piles of electronic junk.",

      "OLD SMARTPHONES ARE BEING TURNED INTO TINY DATA CENTERS",
      "Scientists have discovered a new method of silver extraction from electronics by using cooking oil. (Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How cooking oil recovers silver from electronic waste",
      "Here's how it works. Fatty acids found in oils like sunflower or olive oil are mixed with hydrogen peroxide. When heated slightly, this combo safely dissolves silver from old circuit boards, wires or keyboard connectors. Then, using ethyl acetate, a far less toxic alternative to industrial solvents, researchers pull out the silver in a solid form. Unlike traditional methods that rely on harsh acids or cyanide-based solutions, this technique avoids toxic runoff and air pollution. Think of it as salad dressing meets science lab, without the environmental mess.",
      "Why recycling silver from e-waste is urgently needed",
      "Silver powers the devices you use every day, such as phones, solar panels, electric vehicles and even medical tech. But less than 20% of it gets recycled. As demand rises and natural resources shrink, finding clean ways to reclaim silver isn't just smart, it's necessary. Silver prices have surged sixfold in the last 25 years. At the same time, supply has lagged. That makes e-waste a goldmine, literally, for anyone who can unlock its hidden metals without poisoning the environment.",

      "Fatty acids found in cooking oil can stabilize silver ions for easier extraction. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)",
      "How scientists extract silver using fatty acids and light",
      "To figure out exactly how this all works, researchers used advanced computer models to study how fatty acids interact with silver ions. The process not only stabilizes the silver but also allows for easy recovery using light and simple solvents. Better still, the ingredients can be reused, and there's no chemical waste or massive cost. And it's highly selective. The method targets silver while leaving other metals behind, a major step forward in urban mining. In testing, even silver-coated keyboard connectors were cleanly processed into pure elemental silver powder using this system.",
      "Indian laborers sift through a heap of pre-owned mobile phones in an electronic waste workshop Dec. 5, 2023, in New Delhi, India.\u00a0 (Yawar Nazir/Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "This research brings us closer to safe, at-home or small-scale recycling kits that could recover silver from old gadgets. Recyclers and manufacturers could adopt this method to reduce chemical waste and operating costs, while protecting workers and the environment. This method supports a future where nothing goes to waste. It keeps valuable materials in use, cutting down the need for mining and pollution. Silver is vital for making many of the tech items we use every day. Reusing it responsibly means cleaner energy at a lower cost and less reliance on mined resources.",

      "We've long known that waste is a problem. Now, it might also be the solution.

      "Hackers who break into one account often attempt to use the same password across your other logins. This tactic becomes even more dangerous when AI is involved because a chatbot can quickly test stolen credentials across hundreds of sites. The best defense is to create long, unique passwords for every account you have. Treat your passwords like digital keys and never reuse the same one in more than one lock.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "The hacker who abused Claude didn't just steal files; they organized and analyzed them to find the most damaging details. That illustrates the value of your personal information in the wrong hands. The less data criminals can find about you online, the safer you are. Review your digital footprint, lock down privacy settings, and reduce what's available on public databases and broker sites.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

      "Even if a hacker obtains your password,\u00a02FA\u00a0can stop them in their tracks. AI tools now help criminals generate highly realistic phishing attempts designed to trick you into handing over logins. By enabling\u00a02FA, you add an extra layer of protection that they cannot easily bypass. Choose app-based codes or a physical key whenever possible, as these are more secure than text messages, which are easier for attackers to intercept.",
      "AI-driven attacks often exploit the most basic weaknesses, such as outdated software. Once a hacker knows which companies or individuals are running old systems, they can use automated scripts to break in within minutes. Regular updates close those gaps before they can be targeted. Setting your devices and apps to update automatically removes one of the easiest entry points that criminals rely on.",
      "One of the most alarming details in the Anthropic report was how the hacker used AI to craft convincing extortion notes. The same tactics are being applied to phishing emails and texts sent to everyday users. If you receive a message demanding immediate action, such as clicking a link, transferring money or downloading a file, treat it with suspicion. Stop, check the source and verify before you act.",
      "The hacker in this case built custom malware with the help of AI. That means malicious software is getting smarter, faster and harder to detect. Strong antivirus software that constantly scans for suspicious activity provides a critical safety net. It can identify phishing emails and detect ransomware before it spreads, which is vital now that AI tools make these attacks more adaptive and persistent.",

      "After President Donald Trump announced that he was designating the leftist agitation group Antifa as a terrorist organization in the wake of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, one expert said the president has \"powerful\" tools at his disposal to dismantle the group.",
      "Michael Balboni is an attorney and former member of the New York State Assembly and Senate. During his time in office, he chaired the state senate's Homeland Security Committee, and was later appointed to the state's Domestic Terrorism Task Force under Governors Andrew Cuomo and Kathy Hochul.",
      "U.S. terrorism laws under the Immigration and Nationality Act only apply to foreign groups, so there is no federal statute for prosecuting domestic organizations as terrorists. Trump still has a tool available to combat Antifa, though, in the form of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).",

      "\"RICO doesn't relate only to one specific act and one specific time,\" Balboni told Fox News Digital. \"It could be an analysis of an ongoing criminal enterprise.\"",
      "He explained that for a defendant to be convicted under the RICO Act, there must be an existence of an enterprise, a pattern of racketeering activity within the past decade, a demonstration that the threat of continued criminal behavior exists and that the defendant must be associated with or employed by the enterprise.",
      "\"Perhaps you could even use RICO or other statutes to try to do an enterprise-wide roll-up of these individuals, whether or not you need to designate them as a terrorist group,\" Balboni said, adding that it's a \"very powerful tool.\"",
      "But, he warned, the Trump administration will have to be very careful not to impede upon the First Amendment rights of Americans who are peacefully protesting, versus far-left groups who commit violent acts like many across the country did in the wake of George Floyd's 2020 death or the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles earlier this year.",

      "\"So this is what President Trump has been able to do successfully,\" he said. \"He's been able to take a concept and then kind of take the existing laws and wrap it around the concept.\"",

      "In what would be a long-term fix to control domestic terrorism, Balboni noted that Congress could pass a law against terrorism that includes domestic enemies separately from the anti-terror law in the Immigration and Nationality Act. They could also amend the current law to include domestic terrorists.",

      "Officials said the notice will start a review of whether the Macadam Avenue facility is following the rules of its 2011 land use permit, which bars keeping people overnight or for more than 12 hours.",

      "Under land use permitting rules, a landowner or operator has 30 days after receiving a notice of violation to correct the issue. If substantial evidence of a violation exists, a fine can be issued.

      "The 26-year-old former Ivy Leaguer is accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, a Minnesota father of two, outside a shareholder conference in New York City on Dec. 4. Mangione allegedly kept journals that described his plans for the attack, his intent to send a message and condemnations of the health insurance industry.",
      "\"This case is not a Prohibition case nor a draft-dodging situation \u2014 it was an outright premeditated murder,\" said Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD sergeant and criminal justice professor at Penn State Lehigh Valley. \"My only concern is that Alvin Bragg has lost a number of high profile cases and was just dealt another blow with the dismissal of the terror charge in this case.\"",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 In a vote that divided Democrats, the House on Friday passed a resolution honoring slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk and rejecting the political violence of recent years.",
      "The vote was 310-58, with 95 Democrats joining all 215 Republicans in voting yes on the nonbinding resolution. The 58 no votes all came from Democrats \u2014 mostly members of the Congressional Black and Hispanic caucuses \u2014 and another 38 Democrats voted present. Another 22 Democrats did not vote.",
      "The resolution passed nine days after a gunman assassinated the 31-year-old Kirk while he was speaking to a large crowd at Utah Valley University.  Kirk was a co-founder of Turning Point USA, which helped turn out the youth vote for Donald Trump in 2024. The alleged shooter has been charged on seven counts, including aggravated murder.",
      "While all lawmakers have denounced Kirk\u2019s killing, some Democrats had wanted the party to make a more forceful stand against the Kirk resolution, which, among other things, states that his \"commitment to civil discussion and debate stood as a model for young Americans across the political spectrum, and he worked tirelessly to promote unity without compromising on conviction.\"",
      "While few spoke out against the resolution publicly before the vote, critics have pointed out that Kirk had disparaged Martin Luther King Jr., called the Civil Rights Act of 1964 a \u201chuge mistake\u201d and was a vocal opponent of transgender rights.",
      "\u201cAs a Black woman, the verbal assault on so many Black women coming out of his mouth stunned me,\u201d Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., told NBC News, citing Kirk's past comments questioning the intelligence of former first lady Michelle Obama, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and others. \u201cHe insulted so many. This country stands on the shoulders of Black women.\u201d",
      "Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the former chairman of the committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack, said he also voted no because of Kirk's comments about Black Americans.",
      "Kirk \"made this horrendous statement that if he gets on a plane and sees a Black pilot, he doesn't know if this is a DEI hire,\" Thompson said. \"So I think that kind of offensive, divisive language is not something that Congress ought to be involved in honoring. Look, again, it was bad he got killed in the way he did. But to try to somehow sanitize [his record]? I just go with the facts.\"",
      "The issue has not only split Democrats, but also progressive leaders in the party. Rep. Jamie Raskin, of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee and a leading progressive voice on Capitol Hill, voted in favor of the resolution. He said that he didn\u2019t agree with every phrase in it, but that this is a moment for both parties to come together.",
      "\u201cIn general, the statement opposes and deplores political violence, and we need to oppose and denounce political violence across the board, in every case, regardless of the victim, regardless of the perpetrator,\u201d Raskin told reporters. \u201cWe just have to think about what it means for one of our fellow citizens to lose his life to political violence.\u201d",
      "Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., an immigrant and a leader of the Progressive Caucus who has been an outspoken critic of Kirk, said after his death that it\u2019s \u201ceffed up\u201d that people have described Kirk as \u201cjust wanting to have a civil debate.\u201d",
      "Friday's vote ends an emotional and tense week on Capitol Hill as members grappled with Kirk's death. Earlier in the week, the House narrowly rejected a separate GOP resolution to censure Omar and strip her of her committee assignments for criticizing Kirk.",
      "The broader five-page resolution, sponsored by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was discussed during House Democrats\u2019 closed-door caucus meeting Thursday. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told rank-and-file members that he and members of his leadership team would vote yes on the Kirk resolution, according to three Democratic sources in the room.",
      "But Jeffries advised members that they could make up their own minds and vote their conscience, given that it\u2019s such a unique situation, the sources in the room said.",
      "\u201cThe resolution is very down the middle and straightforward,\u201d said a Democratic aide familiar with leadership\u2019s approach to the matter.",
      "The resolution condemns Kirk\u2019s assassination, offers condolences to his family and praises him as a \u201ccourageous American patriot\u201d who peacefully debated his critics in public.",
      "It honored Kirk for \u201cengaging in respectful, civil discourse across college campuses, media platforms, and national forums, always seeking to elevate truth, foster understanding, and strengthen the Republic\"; exercising his First Amendment rights with \u201chonor, courage, and respect for his fellow Americans\u201d; and working \u201ctirelessly to promote unity without compromising on conviction.\u201d",
      "\u200bIn addition, the resolution also calls upon all political leaders to \u201cstand united in unequivocal condemnation of political violence, regardless of their ideology\u201c and calls on \u201call Americans \u2014 regardless of race, party affiliation, or creed \u2014 to reject political violence, recommit to respectful debate, uphold American values, and respect one another as fellow Americans.\u201d",
      "Kirk's funeral will be held Sunday in Arizona. The president and other major Republican leaders are expected to attend.",
      "In a floor speech honoring Kirk, Johnson said the activist was \"never motivated by hatred\" for his political opponents.",
      "\"And so even though he could defeat anybody in a debate so often \u2014 and I saw this myself when he would vanquish someone in a policy argument \u2014 he was the first person after that to reach out a hand of friendship or offer an arm around the shoulder of someone who he had just defeated in a contest,\" Johnson said.",
      "\"Why? Because it wasn't about winning ... the policy arguments. It was about the people,\" he said. \"And Charlie loved vigorous debate, but he loved people more.\""

      "Russia and other foreign adversaries have pounced on the assassination of Charlie Kirk as an opportunity to spread propaganda aimed at aggravating U.S. political divisions and painting America as an unstable country on the decline, according to researchers.",
      "Soon after the news broke about Kirk\u2019s murder, Russian state media and pro-Kremlin voices on social media suggested that the United States was poised for a possible civil war and that dark conspiracies \u2014 possibly involving elements of a \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2014 had played a role in the murder.",
      "Chinese state media portrayed the attack as yet another example of a troubled society in decline, plagued by political disorder and gun violence. State media posted video of lawmakers arguing in Congress and highlighted U.S. experts discussing a climate of violence.",
      "Iran\u2019s media posted baseless allegations that Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence agency had possibly orchestrated Kirk's killing.",
      "In the week after the conservative activist was shot at Utah Valley University, state media in Russia, China and Iran mentioned Kirk 6,200 times from Sept. 10 (the day of the shooting) to Sept. 17, according to a report from the fact-checking site NewsGuard.",
      "Each of those countries maintain covert online influence operations, which when aimed at American audiences often stress divisive narratives, according to Western governments and researchers. It was not clear, however, whether their campaigns gained much traction in recent days with a U.S. populace already significantly divided over Kirk\u2019s assassination and legacy.",
      "Darren Linvill, the director of Clemson University\u2019s Watt Family Innovation Center Media Forensics Hub, which tracks state-sponsored online disinformation campaigns, said there was little evidence that foreign propagandists had made much of an effort to inflame the issue with fabricated social media accounts, which have been used by Russia and others to push divisive narratives since at least 2016.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen a few Russian Matryoshka accounts, but they had zero organic engagement,\u201d he said, referring to a Russian operation that posts fake news stories that appear to come from legitimate news outlets.",

      "Neither the Russian Embassy nor Iran's U.N. Mission in New York immediately responded to requests for comment.",

      "\"At the same time, we firmly oppose attempts by certain U.S. media outlets and individuals to unfairly drag China into such issues,\" he added at a news briefing in Beijing. \"We strongly oppose the spread of false information and smears against China.\"",
      "Emerson Brooking, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab, said Russia\u2019s international news outlet, RT, devoted extensive coverage to the assassination and was one of the first media outlets to broadcast graphic footage of Kirk\u2019s shooting.",
      "\u201cIt is extraordinary the degree to which Russian state media and RT specifically centered their coverage on the Kirk assassination,\u201d Brooking said.",
      "\u201cAs the hours passed, RT was amplifying and directing its focus toward individual Americans who had posted insensitive things about Kirk,\u201d Brooking said.",
      "By highlighting social media posts from left-leaning critics of Kirk, Russian media echoed conservative voices and appeared to be trying to align themselves with America\u2019s political right, he said.",
      "According to NewsGuard and other research, the Russian media\u2019s portrayal of the killing of Kirk resembled its coverage of the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump last year, which it blamed on Kyiv.",
      "\u201cUkraine has found the culprit in Kirk\u2019s death: it turned out to be Zelensky,\u201d read a recent headline in the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.",
      "There is no evidence of a conspiracy related to Kirk\u2019s murder and prosecutors say the shooting suspect who has been charged, Tyler Robinson, is a U.S. citizen who acted alone.",
      "The propaganda push from abroad came as the Trump administration has shut down teams across the federal government that tracked and analyzed information warfare waged by Russia and other foreign adversaries. The State Department said Wednesday it had halted what was left of its effort. Earlier this year, it closed the Global Engagement Center, which had flagged foreign disinformation campaigns in the past.",
      "The Russia state news agency TASS published a column by a pro-Russian former member of Ukraine\u2019s Parliament, Artem Dmitruk, who wrote \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that \u201cI declare with full responsibility: Zelensky\u2019s hand is both ideological and practical in the assassination attempt on Donald Trump and the murder of Charlie Kirk.\u201d",
      "Dmitruk claimed that Zelenksyy\u2019s government had worked to prevent Trump from being re-elected and that the murder of Kirk was part of the same plot.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump is set to speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday as they try to finalize a deal to keep the popular short-video app TikTok operating in the United States.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 President Donald Trump said that he had made progress on several issues with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a call Friday morning, including on the \"approval of the TikTok deal,\" and that he plans to meet with Xi in person in November and in China early next year.",
      "Trump summarized their conversation, which a White House official said began at 8 a.m. ET, in a Truth Social post in which he said he appreciates \"the TikTok approval,\" but stopped short of announcing any kind of finalized deal. As expected, the call also appeared to touch on the ongoing trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.",
      "\"I just completed a very productive call with President Xi of China. We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Trump said that he agreed with Xi that they would meet at the APEC summit in South Korea, that Trump would go to China early next year, and that Xi would eventually come to the U.S.",
      "\"The call was a very good one, we will be speaking again by phone, appreciate the TikTok approval, and both look forward to meeting at APEC!\" the president wrote.",
      "Separately, Chinese state media said Trump and Xi had a \u201ccandid and in-depth exchange of views\u201d and that the call was \u201cpragmatic, positive, and constructive.\u201d Xi said the U.S. should avoid taking restrictive trade measures \u201cto prevent undermining the outcomes achieved through multiple rounds of consultations,\u201d according to a readout published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "On TikTok, Xi said the Chinese government \u201crespects the will of companies and is pleased to see companies conduct business negotiations on the basis of market rules and reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and balance interests,\u201d the readout said.",
      "\u201cWe hope the U.S. side will provide an open, fair, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies investing in the United States,\u201d it said.",
      "This was the first call between Trump and Xi since June, when Trump said they had spoken for about 90 minutes in a discussion focused on trade.",
      "On TikTok, Trump told Fox News on Thursday that the two sides were \u201cvery close to deals on all of it,\u201d adding that his relationship with China is \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201cit sounds like they\u2019ve approved TikTok.\u201d",
      "The app, which is estimated to have about 170 million active users in the U.S., faces a ban unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, agrees to sell the app\u2019s U.S. assets to U.S. owners. The sale is required under a law Congress passed last year, citing national security concerns.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump formally extended the deadline for a TikTok deal for a fourth time, until Dec. 16, a day after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Beijing and Washington had struck a \u201cframework\u201d for an agreement, without providing details such as who would be taking over TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "Trump has gone back and forth on the ban, but he credits TikTok with helping him win last year\u2019s presidential election and has expressed concern about alienating its huge and youthful user base. He said Thursday during a visit to the U.K. that the app \u201chas tremendous value\u201d and that \u201cvery rich people and companies are going to be owning it.\u201d",
      "At the height of trade tensions in April, U.S. and Chinese tariff rates reached as high as 145%, in what amounted to a mutual trade embargo. Since then they have been lowered under another \u201cframework\u201d deal, with new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods capped at 30%, while China imposes a 10% additional tariff on U.S. goods.",
      "The lower tariff rates are set to expire on Nov. 10 unless a deal is reached or the trade truce is extended again.",
      "The two countries also continue to tussle over export controls on strategically important products such as rare earths, which China has a near-monopoly over, and U.S. chip technology.",
      "U.S. officials have said the TikTok sale is necessary because of Chinese laws that require Chinese companies to share data requested by the government. They also cite concerns about data collection and the algorithm the app uses to recommend content to users, which they say is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese officials.",
      "TikTok denies sharing user data with Chinese authorities and says the U.S. has never provided evidence of Beijing trying to manipulate the algorithm.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance say the powerful algorithm, which has helped fuel the app\u2019s global success, is proprietary and thus difficult to sell to a U.S. company under Chinese law.",
      "There are concerns that TikTok may continue to use the Chinese algorithm in the U.S.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., the committee\u2019s ranking member, have both expressed opposition to any deal that keeps the algorithm under Chinese control or allows ByteDance to maintain an operational relationship with the new American TikTok.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has all the leverage he needs to strike a deal that saves TikTok and complies with the law \u2014 which means making sure TikTok\u2019s data and algorithm are truly in American hands,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Any deal would most likely need to be approved by Congress as well as ByteDance\u2019s board.",
      "Compared with five years ago, when Trump first called for a ban during his first term, TikTok is more mature as a platform and less likely to keep growing, said Dimitar Gueorguiev, an associate professor of political science and director of Chinese studies at Syracuse University.",
      "\u201cTikTok is, I think, a less valuable bargaining chip from the Chinese perspective, and an easier concession,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, for the United States, it\u2019s as visible and kind of politically salient as ever.\u201d",
      "While the details of the TikTok deal remain unclear, Gueorguiev said, the broader question is \u201ccan the Trump administration, as well as their counterparts in Beijing, convert on whatever progress we observe today and keep it going\u201d to achieve a \u201clarger bargain\u201d between the U.S. and China.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re thinking about what is the ultimate outcome of this, and who wins and who loses, there\u2019s still a lot to be told,\u201d he said."

      "President Donald Trump has said he hopes to see Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan returned to U.S. control, suggesting a renewed American presence in the country now again ruled by the Taliban.",
      "\"We're trying to get it back,\" Trump said of Bagram during a news conference Thursday alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that capped a whirlwind state visit to the United Kingdom.",
      "Taking aim at the Biden administration's fraught withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as a \"total disaster,\" Trump criticized the decision to relinquish Bagram Airfield, which quickly fell under the control of the Taliban as they swept back into power in 2021.",
      "\"We gave it to them for nothing,\" said Trump, who has long criticized the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. \"We want that base back,\" he said.",
      "About an hour's drive north of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, Bagram served for years as a crucial hub in the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. At its peak around 2012, the sprawling airfield saw more than 100,000 U.S. troops pass through its compound.",
      "Late Thursday, Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Afghan Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea of Bagram returning to the U.S.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan and the U.S. need to interact with each other and can have economic and political relations based on mutual respect and common interests,\u201d Jalaly said on the social platform X. \u201cThe Afghans have not accepted a military presence in history, and this possibility was completely rejected during the Doha talks and agreement, but the door is open for further interaction.\u201d",
      "Trump made clear at least one motivating factor for his interest in reclaiming Bagram, noting its proximity to rival superpower China.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,\u201d Trump said during his comments Thursday, which came a day before he was spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid ongoing trade negotiations.",
      "Addressing journalists later on Air Force One, Trump said Bagram was \"one of the most powerful bases in the world in terms of runway strength and length,\" adding: \"You could land anything there.\" He emphasized again that the base was \"an hour away from where they make their missiles \u2014 China.\"",
      "Addressing Trump's comments Friday, Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China \"respects Afghanistan\u2019s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.",
      "\"Afghanistan\u2019s future should be decided by its own people,\" Lin said, adding: \"Stirring up tension and creating confrontation in the region won\u2019t be popular.\"",
      "China, which has made strides in rapidly expanding its nuclear stockpile, is estimated to have accumulated about 600 warheads, according to the Chicago-based nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.",
      "Of course, greater surveillance on China wouldn't be the only advantage to regaining Bagram.",
      "A presence at the base could also aid in regional counterterrorism efforts, among other factors that could appeal to Trump.",
      "It remains unclear to what extent, if any, the U.S. has been in talks with the Taliban on the future of Bagram.",
      "\u201cEven if the Taliban considered this, China most certainly would do everything it can to entice the Taliban to keep the U.S. out of Afghanistan and has far more leverage and enticements to make this happen,\" Bill Roggio, editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Long War Journal, cautioned in comments shared online Thursday.",
      "\"The Trump administration should be very careful not to grant the Taliban concessions only to be prevented access to Bagram in the end,\" he said.",
      "The Taliban have been working to rehabilitate their global standing, with the militant group freeing American George Glezmann, a Delta Air Lines mechanic, in March amid efforts to normalize relations between Afghanistan and the U.S.",
      "On Friday, the Taliban also released British couple Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband, Peter Reynolds, 80, who were detained by the Interior Ministry in February, according to Sky News, NBC News' sister outlet in the United Kingdom.",
      "Trump's comments came as the Pentagon continues to push ahead with a review into the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, during which 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghans were killed at Kabul's airport in a bombing by the Islamic State terrorist group.",
      "Trump, who began the process for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during his first term, has been a fierce critic of the Biden administration's handling of the drawdown.",
      "The White House under President Joe Biden largely blamed the Trump administration for the chaotic withdrawal, with a National Security Council report released in 2023 arguing that Biden's options for executing the operation were \"severely constrained by conditions created by his predecessor.\""

      "He left Thursday for a White House that he\u2019s remaking to suit his tastes. Workers have been digging up trees to accommodate his passion project: a new ballroom that will seat up to 900 guests.",

Next week, he heads to Long Island to watch the Ryder Cup golf tournament at the fabled Bethpage Black course.",
      "Since his inauguration, Trump has been fashioning a presidency aligned with his preferences, taking presidential diversions in new directions. He has taken about a third as many domestic trips to promote policy initiatives than last time around, while plunging into pursuits that one might consider, well, fun.",
      "Presidents have long sought ways to lighten the burden. Barack Obama golfed and played full-court basketball with friends. Joe Biden regularly attended Mass and relaxed at his beach house in Delaware. At the start of the modern presidency, Franklin D. Roosevelt routinely mixed pre-dinner cocktails for aides and friends at what he dubbed \u201cThe Children\u2019s Hour.\u201d",

      "No longer a candidate, Trump has done fewer campaign-style events so far this year, though he is expected to return to the trail for the 2026 congressional elections, a person close to the White House said.",
      "Meantime, the onetime real estate magnate is taking on projects that pique his interest. One involves White House\u2019s decor: picking out paintings for the walls that had been lying in storage.",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s enjoyment; to other people, it\u2019s work,\u201d he told NBC News in an interview over the summer.",
      "A beneficiary of Trump\u2019s approach is Vice President JD Vance. Vance has picked up some of the tasks that past presidents typically shouldered, giving him on-the-job training and potentially setting him up for a presidential bid of his own in 2028. Vance has been traveling into battleground states touting Trump\u2019s signature legislative achievement, giving voters an early look at the \u201928 Republican front-runner.",
      "And Vance will represent the U.S. at the Group of 20 summit meeting of global leaders in South Africa in November, standing in for Trump.",
      "While King Charles feted Trump and treated him to a carriage ride at Windsor Castle this week, Vance, back home, toured a precision metal stamping plant in Howell, Michigan, and touted the president\u2019s tax cuts.",

      "\"We had a very sick country one year ago, and today I believe we're the hottest country anywhere in the world,\" Trump said during his remarks Wednesday at the state banquet hosted by the royal family.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is the most hardworking and effective president in history, as evidenced by his over 200 Executive Orders that have vastly outpaced his recent predecessors and helped cool inflation, unleash American energy, secure the border and more,\" Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement. \"While the President is spending ample time in the Oval Office working on Americans\u2019 behalf, he also leverages a strategic travel schedule \u2014 which has included foreign trips that delivered massive investments into our country, as well as events that meet people where they are, from UFC fights, to America 250 events, to sporting events.\"",
      "Trump has added gilded flourishes to the Oval Office, while paving over the Rose Garden to protect high-heeled shoes and wingtips from the soggy grass. At a dinner he hosted on the new patio earlier this month for Republican lawmakers, he christened the event the \u201cRose Garden Club,\u201d a nod to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach.",
      "Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, one of the lawmakers who attended, said that beforehand: \u201cWe went into the Oval Office and we talked to the president at length. He was showing us around: the portraits he\u2019d hung and the renovation he had in there, gold leaf, and he\u2019s very proud of it. And it was absolutely beautiful.\u201d",

      "So far this year, he\u2019s been to the Daytona 500 NASCAR race, the Super Bowl, two UFC mixed martial arts events, a college wrestling championship, the men\u2019s U.S. Open tennis finals and the FIFA World Cup soccer finals, among other contests.",

      "With North America hosting the World Cup next year, soccer seems to have captured Trump\u2019s interest. Gianni Infantino, the FIFA president, has attended each of six events Trump has held involving professional soccer. By contrast, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer hasn\u2019t spoken to Trump once since the inauguration on Jan. 20, a Schumer spokesman said.",

      "\u201cOr the Trump Kennedy Center,\u201d as Infantino put it.",
      "For now, Trump is chairman of the center and is using it to fulfill his own aesthetic vision. He said he was \u201cvery involved\u201d in choosing who would receive Kennedy Center honors this year. (The winners include Sylvester Stallone, who, after the 2024 election, called Trump \u201cthe second George Washington.\u201d)",
      "Breaking tradition, Trump will personally host the awards ceremony in December. Will he host a future ceremony and announce himself a winner from a pool of candidates he helped to cull?

Trump drew a laugh from the crowd at an appearance last month when he said he had wanted the award, waited in vain and then decided, \u201cThe hell with it, I\u2019ll become chairman and I\u2019ll give myself an honor.\u201d",
      "For a president who relishes excess, the British made sure he wouldn\u2019t leave the U.K. feeling underwhelmed. They treated him to the largest military ceremony for a visiting leader in living memory, complete with 1,300 military personnel and 200 horses.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican-controlled House on Friday passed a stopgap bill to fund the government until just before Thanksgiving, daring Democrats in the Senate to reject the measure and risk a shutdown at the end of this month.",
      "The vote was 217-212, with one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, joining Republicans in voting yes. Two Republicans \u2014 conservative Reps. Tim Burchett of Tennessee and Victoria Spartz of Indiana \u2014 and all other Democrats voted against the bill.",
      "The short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution or CR, now heads to the Senate, where Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and other Democrats have vowed to defeat it and have offered their own competing funding plan.",
      "Both measures are expected to be rejected when they come to the Senate floor later Friday. What happens next is uncertain.",
      "To overcome a filibuster, 60 votes are needed in the Senate, meaning any bill to avert a shutdown and buy appropriators more time to strike a longer-term funding deal must be bipartisan.",
      "The House bill extends federal funding at current levels without any other policy changes. It would keep the government open through Nov. 21.",
      "The Senate Democratic bill would fund the government through Oct. 31 with a series of policy demands. It would permanently extend Obamacare subsidies set to expire at the end of the year, as well as reverse Medicaid cuts enacted in President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "It also addresses Trump funding cuts that have infuriated Democrats in recent months: It would lift the freeze on foreign aid funding that the White House is withholding through \u201cpocket rescissions\u201d and restore funding for public broadcasting.",
      "\u201cDemocrats have a different option. We address the crises Americans face in health care, in Medicaid, in inflation and in higher costs,\u201d Schumer told reporters Thursday.",
      "He accused Trump of ordering House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., not to sit down and negotiate with him and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., on how to keep the government\u2019s lights on.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump made it clear, don\u2019t even bother dealing with the Democrats,\" Schumer said, referencing an interview Trump gave to Fox News. \"Thune and Johnson listen to Trump. They are not independent actors. They don\u2019t represent an independent Congress, an independent House or an independent Senate. And when Donald Trump says don\u2019t negotiate with Democrats, they don\u2019t and come up with 20 excuses.\u201d",
      "Johnson, in an appearance on Fox News on Thursday night, defended the GOP legislation, which is backed by Trump. Johnson has characterized it as a \"clean\" CR, a point disputed by Democrats who argue it extends \"status quo\" funding levels that were driven down by Trump's cuts.",
      "\"We need a few more weeks to finish this good work\" on a longer-term funding deal, Johnson said on Fox. \"What we did, in a responsible manner as Republicans in charge, is we offered a totally clean short-term CR to get that job done. Chuck Schumer saw that. He returned a counteroffer that is filled with partisan wish lists and poison pills and demands.\"",
      "Unless the House and the Senate can pass the same funding legislation and earn Trump's signature, the government will shut down Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year. In a shutdown, mandatory services, such as Border Patrol, the Postal Service and Social Security, will continue, but federal workers, including the military, will go unpaid.",

Throughout the series he bounces between relationships with his ex-wife; his bartender Anna (who is drugged and sexually assaulted by art gallery owner Jules, played by John Ales); Joe, an old family friend (and small-time mob boss played by Oscar-winner Troy Kotsur); Wes (Sope Dirisu), one of his investors in the restaurant, and Roxie (Amaka Okafor), his talented chef, among many others.",
      "When Vince returns to town after burning bridges out West, though, the juggling act Jake has been starting to master crumbles bit by bit \u2014 thanks in part to Vince\u2019s outstanding debts with Joe.",
      "Why Did Vince and Jake Have Problems with Each Other?",
      "Money is the current-day problem for both brothers \u2014 Vince owes Mancuso, who alternates between trying to make it right with him and sending his bumbling, vicious henchmen (Junior, played by Forrest Weber; and Babbit, played by Chris Coy)  after him, while Jake keeps juggling funds to try and take over the kitchen at a classic New York City restaurant (the real-life, former Four Seasons).",
      "But both are plagued by issues dating back to childhood. Viewers learn early on that their parents are no longer in the picture, and that their childhood home has to be cleaned out and sold (again, to give them some liquid cash) \u2014 and they know the Friedken brothers\u2019 father died many years ago.",
      "What viewers don't know until the end of the series is just how their father died \u2014 and why.",
      "Turns out that the brothers\u2019 parents had a tumultuous relationship that came to a head one night when their father abused their mother \u2026 and Vince tried protecting her by dropping a bowling ball on their father\u2019s head. For years he thought he\u2019d saved Jake from knowing what happened, but Jake admits he did witness what happened, but said nothing.",
      "What Happened to Anna?",
      "Bartender Anna is one of the true tragedies of the story. Sexually assaulted at the club early on, she refuses to come back to work. Jake, not knowing at the time what happened, fires her.",
      "Over time, the chance that she might tell her story to a reporter leads to two separate sets of visitors: Campbell, lawyer of the art gallery dealer who raped her (\"The Gilded Age's\" Morgan Spector), who convinces her to leave the country \u2014 and Babbit and Junior.",
      "Babbit and Junior, sent by Vince, show up as she's preparing to go to the airport. As she tries to escape them, she falls and hits her head in the bathroom, which kills her.",
      "Who Are the 'Black Rabbit' Robbers?",
      "The idea to rob the Rabbit originates with Jake, who knows there will be valuable jewelry in the Rabbit on a particular night, and that the jewelry can be turned into cash to pay for various debts.",
      "But he backs out of the plan, thinking it will collapse without him. Junior and Vince go forward with it, storming the restaurant wearing masks and waving guns.",
      "How Does \u2018Black Rabbit\u2019 End?",
      "Before Vince left town originally, he and a co-worker/friend named Trevor (Michael Patrick Thornton) drunkenly dared one another to leap from one building to another, and while Vince dodged the jump at the last minute, his friend was seriously injured.",
      "Trevor relates this story in front of a crowd at the Rabbit early on in the series, ending with, \u201cSo as I see it, you owe me a jump.\u201d",
      "This might seem like a passing mention \u2014 but in the series\u2019 final episode, as everything crashes down around the brothers, Vince and Jake both have to reckon with the decisions they\u2019d made, and their relationships. Trying to outrun the cops, the brothers take a moment to finally confess their sins to one another \u2014 including Vince telling Jake, \u201cI killed our dad.\u201d And Jake saying, \u201cI know.\u201d",
      "The pair end up on the roof of the Rabbit with the walls closing in. Vince calls in his location to the police and confesses to his recent crimes and some old ones. Jake tries to tell him they\u2019d figure it all out and everything would be fine, but Vince says, \u201cI should have untied you years ago,\u201d then looks out at the Brooklyn Bridge and notes, \u201cI owe a jump.\u201d",
      "A moment later, when Jake turns his back on Vince for a moment \u2014 Vince pays his debt, purposefully falling backwards off the roof.",
      "As the series concludes, Jake listens to his brother on old tapes they\u2019d made when they were in the band, then later goes back to work as a bartender at someone else\u2019s restaurant while Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s classic \u201cManhattan\u201d plays in the background."

      "\"We had a side conversation after we filmed for about 20 minutes, just catching up and talking about life,\" she says. \"It was really, really nice to be able to connect with him on-camera, but also off-camera as well. He's so personable and so friendly, so that was so amazing.\"",
      "While looking back at the full-circle moment, Rand says that she wants everyone to know that there's always a \"light at the end of the tunnel\" no matter how grim your situation might be.",
      "\"I'm here now and it's kind of crazy,\" she laughs.",
      "Rand adds that she hopes she'll be able to see Horan in the future again.",
      "\"I'll be on the lot for sure in December, so maybe we can have a little reunion moment next time he's here on 'The Voice' and catch up. I would love that,\" she adds.",
      "Some of Rand's sweet reunion with Horan was shown on the Sept. 18 episode of TODAY. While meeting up with the idol, Rand asked Horan how it feels to be in the entertainment industry since she aspires to work behind the scenes in film or TV.",
      "\"It's amazing. It's a great industry. You make what you want of it,\" he said before sharing some sage advice.",
      "\"Just work hard and be humble and try to have as much of a good time as you possibly can, like I did,\" he added.",
      "After giving Rand her props for coming so far in her career, Horan then gave Rand a big hug as he said goodbye.",
      "\"It's a pleasure to see you and meet you again. I appreciate everything,\" Rand said.",
      "\"It's lovely to see you,\" Horan replied. \"I'm happy for you.\"",
      "\"The Voice\" Season 28 is set to premiere on Monday, Sept. 22, at 8 p.m. ET on NBC and will stream the next day on Peacock."

      "Trump summarized their conversation, which a White House official said began at 8 a.m. ET, in a Truth Social post in which he said he appreciates \"the TikTok approval,\" but stopped short of announcing any kind of finalized deal. As expected, the call also appeared to touch on the ongoing trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.",
      "\"I just completed a very productive call with President Xi of China. We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Trump said that he agreed with Xi that they would meet at the APEC summit in South Korea, that Trump would go to China early next year, and that Xi would eventually come to the U.S.",
      "\"The call was a very good one, we will be speaking again by phone, appreciate the TikTok approval, and both look forward to meeting at APEC!\" the president wrote.",
      "Separately, Chinese state media said Trump and Xi had a \u201ccandid and in-depth exchange of views\u201d and that the call was \u201cpragmatic, positive, and constructive.\u201d Xi said the U.S. should avoid taking restrictive trade measures \u201cto prevent undermining the outcomes achieved through multiple rounds of consultations,\u201d according to a readout published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "On TikTok, Xi said the Chinese government \u201crespects the will of companies and is pleased to see companies conduct business negotiations on the basis of market rules and reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and balance interests,\u201d the readout said.",
      "\u201cWe hope the U.S. side will provide an open, fair, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies investing in the United States,\u201d it said.",
      "This was the first call between Trump and Xi since June, when Trump said they had spoken for about 90 minutes in a discussion focused on trade.",
      "On TikTok, Trump told Fox News on Thursday that the two sides were \u201cvery close to deals on all of it,\u201d adding that his relationship with China is \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201cit sounds like they\u2019ve approved TikTok.\u201d",
      "The app, which is estimated to have about 170 million active users in the U.S., faces a ban unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, agrees to sell the app\u2019s U.S. assets to U.S. owners. The sale is required under a law Congress passed last year, citing national security concerns.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump formally extended the deadline for a TikTok deal for a fourth time, until Dec. 16, a day after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Beijing and Washington had struck a \u201cframework\u201d for an agreement, without providing details such as who would be taking over TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "Trump has gone back and forth on the ban, but he credits TikTok with helping him win last year\u2019s presidential election and has expressed concern about alienating its huge and youthful user base. He said Thursday during a visit to the U.K. that the app \u201chas tremendous value\u201d and that \u201cvery rich people and companies are going to be owning it.\u201d",
      "At the height of trade tensions in April, U.S. and Chinese tariff rates reached as high as 145%, in what amounted to a mutual trade embargo. Since then they have been lowered under another \u201cframework\u201d deal, with new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods capped at 30%, while China imposes a 10% additional tariff on U.S. goods.",
      "The lower tariff rates are set to expire on Nov. 10 unless a deal is reached or the trade truce is extended again.",
      "The two countries also continue to tussle over export controls on strategically important products such as rare earths, which China has a near-monopoly over, and U.S. chip technology.",
      "U.S. officials have said the TikTok sale is necessary because of Chinese laws that require Chinese companies to share data requested by the government. They also cite concerns about data collection and the algorithm the app uses to recommend content to users, which they say is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese officials.",
      "TikTok denies sharing user data with Chinese authorities and says the U.S. has never provided evidence of Beijing trying to manipulate the algorithm.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance say the powerful algorithm, which has helped fuel the app\u2019s global success, is proprietary and thus difficult to sell to a U.S. company under Chinese law.",
      "There are concerns that TikTok may continue to use the Chinese algorithm in the U.S.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., the committee\u2019s ranking member, have both expressed opposition to any deal that keeps the algorithm under Chinese control or allows ByteDance to maintain an operational relationship with the new American TikTok.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has all the leverage he needs to strike a deal that saves TikTok and complies with the law \u2014 which means making sure TikTok\u2019s data and algorithm are truly in American hands,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Any deal would most likely need to be approved by Congress as well as ByteDance\u2019s board.",
      "Compared with five years ago, when Trump first called for a ban during his first term, TikTok is more mature as a platform and less likely to keep growing, said Dimitar Gueorguiev, an associate professor of political science and director of Chinese studies at Syracuse University.",
      "\u201cTikTok is, I think, a less valuable bargaining chip from the Chinese perspective, and an easier concession,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, for the United States, it\u2019s as visible and kind of politically salient as ever.\u201d",
      "While the details of the TikTok deal remain unclear, Gueorguiev said, the broader question is \u201ccan the Trump administration, as well as their counterparts in Beijing, convert on whatever progress we observe today and keep it going\u201d to achieve a \u201clarger bargain\u201d between the U.S. and China.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re thinking about what is the ultimate outcome of this, and who wins and who loses, there\u2019s still a lot to be told,\u201d he said."

      "Ukrainian children have been taken to over 200 different facilities across Russia, including locations where they have been subjected to forced \u201cre-education\u201d and military training in a clear violation of international law, according to new research.",
      "Eight different types of facilities, ranging from summer camps to religious sites to military academies stretching across the entire expanse of Russia, have been identified in the report from the Yale School of Public Health Humanitarian Research Lab published Tuesday.",
      "The study was initiated at Ukraine\u2019s request to better understand the full size of the network of facilities where children are held, to help them eventually return to their homeland, Nathaniel Raymond, the executive director of the research lab, said in a telephone interview Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that all the people involved in different ways to bring the kids back have the most accurate geospatial information possible, and this is it,\u201d he said.",
      "Using open-source intelligence, news reports and Russian government documents, as well as satellite imagery, the Yale report identified 210 different locations where children are taken. Some are brought to locations temporarily, while others are given Russian citizenship and coerced into forced adoption, the report says.",
      "At most sites, children go through \u201cre-education\u201d programs to enforce Russian patriotism, including lectures in Russian history and singing the national anthem, it adds.",
      "Others, particularly older children, have received military training at cadet academies and a military base, including \u201cdrone control and tactics training,\u201d and have participated in shooting and grenade-throwing competitions, according to the report.",
      "The researchers said they cannot verify if any of the children given military training were ever conscripted into the Russian military or were otherwise deployed in the war in Ukraine.",
      "Russia\u2019s children\u2019s rights commissioner, Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, and the country\u2019s foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s official \u201cBring Kids Back\u201d program, which partners the government with other countries and international organizations to return kids from Russia, has recorded nearly 20,000 cases of unlawful deportations and forced transfers of children.",
      "The new report does not estimate the number of children who have been held either temporarily or indefinitely in Russia. But Raymond said identifying the locations gives a better sense of the scale, comparing it to the carnival game of trying to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar.",
      "\u201cRight now, with this report, we volumetrically know as much as we\u2019re probably going to know how big the jar is, and the jar is gigantic,\u201d he said.",
      "The report builds on research that has helped support allegations of war crimes against Russian President Vladimir Putin issued by the International Criminal Court, which has issued an arrest warrant accusing him of overseeing the forced abductions and deportations. The ICC has also accused Lvova-Belova of committing similar crimes.",
      "The Kremlin has previously denied the allegations and said the warrants were \u201coutrageous.\u201d",
      "Ukraine has made the return of abducted children central to any talks with Russia to end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy raised the issue with President Donald Trump during a meeting at the White House last month, days after Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin in Alaska.",
      "Last week, Zelenskyy announced plans to hold a \u201chigh-level event\u201d on abducted children during the meeting of the U.N. General Assembly later this month.",
      "The research was hampered after State Department funding for the Conflict Observatory program, which Yale was part of, was cut by executive order by Trump. It has not been restored. All of the data would have been lost, but a contractor working on the project in Florida protectively kept a backup, according to Raymond.",

      "Speculation had gone into overdrive prior to the announcement, with experts wondering whether Masaryk may have conveyed a fateful warning before Europe's descent back into war. His words are believed to have been dictated to his son Jan, surviving both World War II and subsequent communist rule.",

      "Masaryk became the first president of Czechoslovakia in 1918 after it declared independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was defeated in World War I. He served until 1935. Jan became foreign minister at the end of World War II, until his sudden death in 1948.",
      "In the envelope, Masaryk talked extensively about his death and subsequent funeral and reflected on the complex political situation in the ethnically diverse country.",
      "As well as derisive comments about a Slovak politician, he urged keeping the German minority part of the state. \u201cGive them what they deserve, but no more,\u201d he said of the Germans, according to the state broadcaster.",

      "\u201cMasaryk is still very revered\u201d in the country, Cornwall told NBC News in a telephone interview. \u201cI can\u2019t think of an American equivalent. Perhaps he\u2019s George Washington or Abraham Lincoln.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump has said he hopes to see Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan returned to U.S. control, suggesting a renewed American presence in the country now again ruled by the Taliban.",
      "\"We're trying to get it back,\" Trump said of Bagram during a news conference Thursday alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that capped a whirlwind state visit to the United Kingdom.",
      "Taking aim at the Biden administration's fraught withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as a \"total disaster,\" Trump criticized the decision to relinquish Bagram Airfield, which quickly fell under the control of the Taliban as they swept back into power in 2021.",
      "\"We gave it to them for nothing,\" said Trump, who has long criticized the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. \"We want that base back,\" he said.",
      "About an hour's drive north of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, Bagram served for years as a crucial hub in the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. At its peak around 2012, the sprawling airfield saw more than 100,000 U.S. troops pass through its compound.",
      "Late Thursday, Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Afghan Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea of Bagram returning to the U.S.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan and the U.S. need to interact with each other and can have economic and political relations based on mutual respect and common interests,\u201d Jalaly said on the social platform X. \u201cThe Afghans have not accepted a military presence in history, and this possibility was completely rejected during the Doha talks and agreement, but the door is open for further interaction.\u201d",
      "Trump made clear at least one motivating factor for his interest in reclaiming Bagram, noting its proximity to rival superpower China.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,\u201d Trump said during his comments Thursday, which came a day before he was spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid ongoing trade negotiations.",
      "Addressing journalists later on Air Force One, Trump said Bagram was \"one of the most powerful bases in the world in terms of runway strength and length,\" adding: \"You could land anything there.\" He emphasized again that the base was \"an hour away from where they make their missiles \u2014 China.\"",
      "Addressing Trump's comments Friday, Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China \"respects Afghanistan\u2019s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.",
      "\"Afghanistan\u2019s future should be decided by its own people,\" Lin said, adding: \"Stirring up tension and creating confrontation in the region won\u2019t be popular.\"",
      "China, which has made strides in rapidly expanding its nuclear stockpile, is estimated to have accumulated about 600 warheads, according to the Chicago-based nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.",
      "Of course, greater surveillance on China wouldn't be the only advantage to regaining Bagram.",
      "A presence at the base could also aid in regional counterterrorism efforts, among other factors that could appeal to Trump.",
      "It remains unclear to what extent, if any, the U.S. has been in talks with the Taliban on the future of Bagram.",
      "\u201cEven if the Taliban considered this, China most certainly would do everything it can to entice the Taliban to keep the U.S. out of Afghanistan and has far more leverage and enticements to make this happen,\" Bill Roggio, editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Long War Journal, cautioned in comments shared online Thursday.",
      "\"The Trump administration should be very careful not to grant the Taliban concessions only to be prevented access to Bagram in the end,\" he said.",
      "The Taliban have been working to rehabilitate their global standing, with the militant group freeing American George Glezmann, a Delta Air Lines mechanic, in March amid efforts to normalize relations between Afghanistan and the U.S.",
      "On Friday, the Taliban also released British couple Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband, Peter Reynolds, 80, who were detained by the Interior Ministry in February, according to Sky News, NBC News' sister outlet in the United Kingdom.",
      "Trump's comments came as the Pentagon continues to push ahead with a review into the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, during which 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghans were killed at Kabul's airport in a bombing by the Islamic State terrorist group.",
      "Trump, who began the process for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during his first term, has been a fierce critic of the Biden administration's handling of the drawdown.",
      "The White House under President Joe Biden largely blamed the Trump administration for the chaotic withdrawal, with a National Security Council report released in 2023 arguing that Biden's options for executing the operation were \"severely constrained by conditions created by his predecessor.\""

      "Any plans to take over the land or property left behind by displaced Palestinians would be a violation of international law, experts say.",
      "\u201cThis plan is tied to the plan to dispel or expel the civilian population, the so-called voluntary emigration plan, and then afterwards to assume permanent control over Gaza. And this is illegal,\u201d said Adil Haque, a law professor and expert on the law of armed conflict at Rutgers University.",
      "Smotrich\u2019s comments mirror remarks this year in which Trump described a possible U.S. takeover of Gaza to turn it into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d Trump did not flesh out details of that takeover plan, and there was no official reaction from the administration to the plan Smotrich described Wednesday.",
      "But a White House official told NBC News that Trump has been supportive of reconstruction plans for Gaza, which is home to about 2 million people.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has long promoted solutions that would help the people of Gaza rebuild,\u201d the official said. \u201cHowever, Hamas must first agree to disarm and give up rule in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Israeli bombs battered Gaza City on the second day of a devastating incursion into a dense urban environment that has sent thousands of Palestinians streaming south in hope of finding safer ground. A spokesperson for the Health Ministry in Gaza said more than 100 people were killed Wednesday, 80 of them in Gaza City alone.",
      "If Smotrich\u2019s real estate plan gains support among other officials within the Israeli government, the civilians escaping the Gaza City offensive may not have homes to go back to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s appalling that any state would seek to profit from the suffering and dispossession of a civilian population,\u201d said Haque, the Rutgers law professor. \u201cKilling, injuring, displacing ordinary people is one of the most serious actions that any state can take, and they should only do so when it\u2019s absolutely necessary for some defensive purpose.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so to seek instead to profit by it, to acquire territory, to sell it to others, to benefit from it is just completely unacceptable,\u201d he said.",
      "A United Nations commission said Tuesday that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. It called on the international community to end the campaign and punish the top officials it found responsible for inciting it.",
      "More than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza, a grim milestone that was reached Wednesday, according to local health officials, whose numbers are considered credible by the United Nations and other international experts.",
      "The conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, with the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage. The Israeli military believes about 20 of the 48 hostages still in Gaza are alive."

      "Townsend, who is in the Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen for the finals of the Billie Jean King Cup, came under fire after she expressed shock and confusion at local delicacies served at a buffet, including bullfrogs and soft-shelled turtles.",
      "\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Townsend, 29, said of sea cucumbers that were among the dishes available in a video posted on her Instagram account that has since been deleted. \u201cThis is crazy. I have never seen one of these up close, especially not to eat.\u201d",

      "Her comments have been widely criticized as culturally insensitive on Chinese social media, with relevant hashtags getting over 85 million views on Weibo, a platform similar to X.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s totally normal to come across foods that aren\u2019t your taste when competing abroad,\u201d a Weibo user wrote. \u201cBut it\u2019s really inappropriate to openly express disgust to the world.\u201d",

      "LONDON \u2014 President Donald Trump enjoys spectacle, but this is not what Britain had in mind.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer fought to offer Trump a second state visit starting Wednesday \u2014 an unprecedented flourish meant to bolster Starmer\u2019s authority and flatter the American leader at a crucial moment for the United Kingdom and its allies.",
      "Instead, Trump arrived in a fractious Britain to meet with political leaders beset by long-running discontent and royals navigating family feuds.",
      "Should he open the country's notorious tabloids, the president could survey the fallout from flag-waving far-right marchers in the streets, feverish speculation about the prime minister's position and a family summit over tea that sought to ease those royal tensions.",
      "The backdrop could hardly be worse for the carefully planned choreography of pomp and ceremony.",
      "The prime minister\u2019s hand-picked ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, was fired last week after revelations of his years-old correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender and financier.",
      "Appointing Mandelson was billed as a savvy move designed to curry favor with Trump, but it has instead detonated into the gravest crisis of Starmer\u2019s premiership so far \u2014 crystalizing bubbling frustrations with his yearlong tenure. Starmer\u2019s deputy, Angela Rayner, also resigned in September after admitting she underpaid property taxes.",
      "Starmer's approval ratings continue to plunge as far-right Reform UK, led by Trump ally Nigel Farage, capitalizes on the public discontent to pull ahead in some polls.",
      "This has all fueled growing whispers of a leadership contest \u2014 a remarkable reversal for a prime minister who won a huge majority just 15 months ago on a vow of stability.",
      "On the streets, the mood is darker still.",
      "A far-right march led by Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record, drew more than 100,000 people to the streets of the capital Saturday. Elon Musk, formerly Trump\u2019s right-hand man in the White House, called into the rally. He urged a \u201cdissolution of Parliament\u201d and told attendees that \"you either fight back or you die,\" in comments that were condemned by Starmer and others.",
      "While the politics look volatile, Trump's state visit will showcase an institution Britain has long turned to as a bastion of consistency and grandeur.",
      "Yet, his arrival at Windsor Castle on Wednesday, where King Charles III is expected to make a speech in honor of the president, comes at a time when the royals are also under renewed scrutiny.",
      "Prince Andrew is back in the headlines thanks to renewed coverage of Epstein, an unwelcome reminder of unresolved questions about his role. Meanwhile, the frenzied coverage of Prince Harry\u2019s tea with the king last week has resurfaced family tensions that led father and son to go almost two years without meeting.",
      "While Harry suggested Sunday that he wants to see his father more often, relations with his brother, Prince William, the heir to the throne, do not appear to have improved.",
      "Starmer had hoped that hosting a U.S. president \u2014 with all the King\u2019s Guards, red carpets and palace banquets that it will entail \u2014 would broadcast strength and competence.",
      "But Trump's visit, analysts say, may only amplify Britain\u2019s domestic turmoil, rather than mask it.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s administration tends to be very interested in the domestic politics of European countries,\u201d said Olivia O\u2019Sullivan, director of the UK in the World Programme at the London-based think tank Chatham House.",
      "For Starmer, there\u2019s \u201ca pretty challenging landscape at home and overseas,\u201d she told NBC News, and a likelihood that Trump may \u201csay something or address something outside of the carefully diplomatically choreographed statements and announcements.\u201d",
      "The prospect of a second state visit for Trump drew criticism, with opponents accusing Starmer of needlessly flattering a deeply polarizing figure in the U.K. A mass demonstration is planned on the first day of his trip, with a further protest planned near Windsor Castle.",
      "The risk, experts argue, is that Trump\u2019s presence could further weaken Starmer at home.",
      "\u201cTrump is so unpopular with most Brits that no one \u2014 not even Nigel Farage \u2014 is going to win many voters over by being seen close to him,\u201d said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.",
      "A recent poll found that 70% of Britons disliked Trump, and 44% thought his state visit should be canceled.",
      "While many on Britain\u2019s far right \u201clove Trump,\u201d he added, \u201can awful lot more Brits think he\u2019s either nuts or dangerous \u2014 or both \u2014 so anyone seen to be fanboying him will get short shrift.\u201d",
      "While Trump will get his desired display of grandeur when he lands in London, turmoil bubbles underneath."

      "Tests by two foreign laboratories show that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned before he died in an Arctic penal colony last year, his wife said Wednesday.",
      "Russia\u2019s prison service reported in February 2024 that Navalny died after having felt unwell following a walk around the high-security facility in a remote town above the Arctic Circle where he was serving a combined 30\u00bd-year jail sentence.",
      "He was 47.",
      "His wife, Yuliya Navalnaya, has since taken up the mantle of his struggle against official corruption and President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government, in which he survived several poisoning attempts.",
      "She said in a video on X early Wednesday that she had managed to have lab tests conducted in a bid to confirm the suspicion that he died at the hands of the Kremlin.",
      "\u201cWe managed to transfer Alexei\u2019s biological materials abroad,\u201d Navalnaya wrote.",
      "\u201cLaboratories in two different countries conducted examinations. These laboratories, independently of each other, concluded that Alexei was poisoned,\u201d she said.",
      "Navalnaya did not give any further details about the tests or which countries were involved. In her video message, she said her husband's biological materials were \"smuggled abroad.\"",
      "\u201cI demand that the laboratories that conducted the analyses publish their results\u201d she added, before she appeared to accuse them of \"pandering to Putin on account of so-called higher considerations.\"",
      "Russia's Foreign Affairs Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday, \"I don\u2019t know anything about these statements of hers and I can\u2019t say anything on this.\"",
      "News of Navalny's death drew outrage from the West, where many leaders blamed Putin. Former President Joe Biden said he was \u201cboth not surprised and outraged.\u201d",
      "The Kremlin dismissed what it said were \u201cabsolutely rabid statements.\u201d",
      "Navalny\u2019s team said afterward that his mother and lawyers were denied access to his body and were told the probe into what killed him had been extended.",
      "Navalnaya accused the Kremlin of hiding his body to cover up having killed him. He had previously been poisoned with a military nerve agent while on a business trip in Russia in 2020 \u2014 an attempt on his life that he blamed directly on Putin.",
      "Navalny\u2019s body was finally returned a week after his death, and thousands turned out to mourn him at a funeral in Moscow.",
      "Hundreds of people were detained in the days after Navalny\u2019s death for simply laying flowers in his honor at memorials around Russia."

      "Happily for the president, he will see a lot of King Charles III and little of everyday Britons in a two-day trip where he\u2019ll make history as the first elected leader to receive not one but two state visits courtesy of the royal family.",
      "Looming over Trump\u2019s arrival in Europe is the war playing out on the east end of the continent. Hostilities between Russia and Ukraine took an escalatory turn last week when Russian drones entered Poland\u2019s airspace and were shot down.",
      "The incident renewed fears that Russian President Vladimir Putin may widen the conflict and threaten other European democracies unless he is stopped. As the war grinds on, Trump\u2019s effort to make peace has stalled, giving rise to complaints among some diplomats and members of Congress that he is not putting enough pressure on Putin to halt the attacks.",
      "The war figures to come up when Trump meets privately on Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers, his official country residence outside London. There, the two leaders will view the archives of former Prime Minister Winston Churchill.",
      "The symbolism is unmistakable. Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt forged an invaluable friendship as they joined to fight Nazi Germany in World War II. Russia was part of the troika that defeated Adolf Hitler.",
      "Now, the West faces threats from a Russian dictatorial regime, and Europe again is beseeching the U.S. president to come to its aid.",
      "Whether Trump is on board seems to depend on the day. He has sent mixed signals about responsibility for the war, which began in 2022 when Russia sent tanks and troops rolling into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rallied his country and prevented a quick rout. In a post on his social media site Saturday, Trump wrote that the war is not his. Rather, he wrote, \u201cit is [former President Joe] Biden\u2019s and Zelenskyy\u2019s war.\u201d He did not mention Putin.",
      "But speaking to reporters the following day, he cast Russia as the \u201caggressor.\u201d",
      "Trump said over the weekend that he is prepared to slap \"major\" sanctions on Russia, but first wants all 32 nations in the NATO military alliance to stop buying Russian oil.",
      "\u201cI hope that the leaders who meet Trump these days behind closed doors are very frank about it,\u201d Marko Mihkelson, who chairs the foreign affairs committee in Estonia\u2019s Parliament, said in an interview. \u201cIf Mr. Trump thinks that this is not his war or that he can run away and that Ukraine is somehow a faraway country, that would be an epic mistake.\u201d",
      "First, though, comes the pomp. World leaders have long used flattery in attempting to win favor with Trump. In this instance, Starmer hand-delivered an invitation from King Charles during a meeting in the Oval Office in February. Trump\u2019s last state visit, in 2019, was a \u201ctremendous success,\u201d gushed Starmer, who is relying on Trump to stand up for Ukraine and prevent further Russian aggression.",
      "\u201cEvery time the European Union tries to push against Trump, they\u2019ve gone to incredible efforts to butter him up,\" said Michael Bociurkiw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank. He mentioned that Mark Rutte, secretary-general of the NATO military alliance, called Trump \"Daddy\u201d at a summit in June and how European leaders praised Trump during a visit to the White House in August to discuss the war, likening them to a \u201ccheerleading squad meeting with the football coach.\u201d",
      "The upcoming state dinner \"is another iteration of what has become the strategy for dealing with Trump,\" said Michael McFaul, who was ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration.",
      "\"I'm not surprised that they [the British] are going to do it, and because of our cultural and historical connections, they can do it like virtually no other country in the world,\" he continued.",
      "A group called the \u201cStop Trump Coalition\u201d is staging a protest during the president's visit, but he isn\u2019t likely to see it. He\u2019ll be an overnight guest of the king and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle on Wednesday and will join the royal couple for a carriage procession inside the private estate. By contrast, when French President Emmanuel Macron visited earlier this year, his carriage ride took him through the town of Windsor."

      "Trump has stopped short of imposing his promised punishment on the Kremlin, and Ukraine\u2019s allies have so far not outlined a defined set of security guarantees they could offer Kyiv to help end the war.",
      "But in an apparent show of frustration about his role as mediator in the 3\u00bd-year war, Trump said Tuesday that it looked as though he would \u201chave to sit in the room with them, because they can\u2019t sit in a room together.\u201d",

      "He made the comments after Zelenskyy told NBC News' British partner, Sky News, that Trump had \u201cenough force to make Putin afraid of him.\u201d",
      "Europe has \u201calready introduced 18 sanctions packages\u201d against Russia,\u201d  Zelenskyy said. \u201cAll that\u2019s lacking now is a strong sanctions package from the U.S. More needs to be done, quicker.\u201d",
      "On security guarantees, Zelenskyy said he really wanted to have all the agreements in place and a \u201cdocument that is supported by the U.S. and all European partners.\u201d",

      "Zelenskyy said Putin was \u201ctrying to find a way out of isolation\u201d through diplomacy with Trump, adding the meeting in Alaska \u201cgave a lot to Putin.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe, if it was a trilateral meeting, we would have some result,\u201d he said.",
