    "story": [
      "The Library of Congress has named Arthur Sze the new U.S. poet laureate",
      "At a time when its leadership is in question and its mission challenged, the Library of Congress has named a new U.S. poet laureate, the much-honored author and translator Arthur Sze.",
      "The library announced Monday that the 74-year-old Sze had been appointed to a one-year term, starting this fall. The author of 12 poetry collections and recipient last year of a lifetime achievement award from the library, he succeeds Ada Lim\u00f3n, who had served for three years. Previous laureates also include Joy Harjo, Louise Gl\u00fcck and Billy Collins.",
      "Speaking during a recent Zoom interview with The Associated Press, Sze acknowledged some misgivings when Rob Casper, who heads the library\u2019s poetry and literature center, called him in June about becoming the next laureate. He wondered about the level of responsibilities and worried about the upheaval since President Donald Trump fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden in May. After thinking about it overnight, he called Casper back and happily accepted.",
      "\u201cI think it was the opportunity to give something back to poetry, to something that I\u2019ve spent my life doing,\u201d he explained, speaking from his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. \u201cSo many people have helped me along the way. Poetry has just helped me grow so much, in every way.\u201d",
      "Sze\u2019s new job begins during a tumultuous year for the library, a 200-year-old, nonpartisan institution that holds a massive archive of books published in the United States. Trump abruptly fired Hayden after conservative activists accused her of imposing a \u201cwoke\u201d agenda, criticism that Trump has expressed often as he seeks sweeping changes at the Kennedy Center, the Smithsonian museums and other cultural institutions.",
      "Hayden\u2019s ouster was sharply criticized by congressional Democrats, leaders in the library and scholarly community and such former laureates as Lim\u00f3n and Harjo. It also led to a debate over who has the authority to decide on an interim replacement.",
      "Although the White House announced that it had named Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche as the acting librarian, daily operations are being run by a longtime official at the library, Robert Randolph Newlen. Events such as the annual National Book Festival have continued without interruption or revision.",
      "Laureates are forbidden to take political positions, although the tradition was breached in 2003 when Collins publicly stated his objections to President George W. Bush\u2019s push for war against Iraq.",
      "Newlen is identified in Monday\u2019s announcement as acting librarian, a position he was in line for according to the institution's guidelines. He praised Sze, whose influences range from ancient Chinese poets to Wallace Stevens, for his \u201cdistinctly American\u201d portraits of the Southwest landscapes and for his \u201cgreat formal innovation.\u201d",

      "\u201cLike Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, Sze forges something new from a range of traditions and influences \u2014 and the result is a poetry that moves freely throughout time and space,\u201d his statement reads in part.",
      "Sze\u2019s official title is poet laureate consultant in poetry, a 1985 renaming of a position established in 1937 as consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. The mission is loosely defined as a kind of literary ambassador, to \u201craise the national consciousness to a greater appreciation of the reading and writing of poetry.\u201d Initiatives have included Robert Pinsky\u2019s \u201cFavorite Poem Project,\u201d for which the public would share thoughts on works of their choosing, and Lim\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cYou Are Here,\u201d which included poetry installations at national parks.",
      "Sze wants to focus on a passion going back more than a half-century to his undergraduate years at the University of California, Berkeley \u2014 translation. He remembers reading some English-language editions of Chinese poetry, finding the work \u201cantiquated and dated\u201d and deciding to translate some of it himself, writing out the Chinese characters and engaging with them \u201con a much deeper level\u201d than he had expected. Besides his own poetry, he has published \u201cThe Silk Dragon: Translations from the Chinese.\u201d",
      "\u201cI personally learned my own craft of writing poetry through translating poetry,\u201d he says. \u201cI often think that people think of poetry as intimidating, or difficult, which isn\u2019t necessarily true. And I think one way to deepen the appreciation of poetry is to approach it through translation.\u201d",
      "Sze is a New York City native and son of Chinese immigrants who in such collections as \u201cSight Lines\u201d and \u201cCompass Rose\u201d explores themes of cultural and environmental diversity and what he calls \u201ccoexisting.\u201d In a given poem, he might shift from rocks above a pond to people begging in a subway, from a firing squad in China to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s plantation in Virginia. His many prizes include the National Book Award for \u201cSight Lines\u201d and such lifetime achievement honors as the Jackson Poetry Prize and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.",
      "He loves poetry from around the world but feels at home writing in English, if only for the \u201crichness of the vocabulary\u201d and the wonders of its origins.",
      "\u201cI was just looking at the word \u2018ketchup,\u2019 which started from southern China, went to Malaysia, was taken to England, where it became a tomato-based sauce, and then, of course, to America,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was just thinking days ago, that\u2019s a word we use every day without recognizing its ancestry, how it\u2019s crossed borders, how it\u2019s entered into the English language and enriched it.\u201d",

      "Hart died at his home in Los Angeles, according to his friend and co-author, Glenn Ballantyne. He had been in poor health since breaking his hip last year.",
      "Boyce and Hart were a prolific and successful duo in the mid-1960s, especially for the Monkees, the made-for-television group promoted by Don Kirshner. They wrote the Monkees' theme song, with its opening shot, \"Here we come, walkin' down the street,\" and enduring chant, \"Hey, hey, we're the Monkees,\" and their first No. 1 hit, \u201cLast Train to Clarksville.\u201d The Monkees' eponymous, million-selling debut album included six songs from Boyce and Hart, who also served as producers and used their own backing musicians, the Candy Store Prophets, as session players.",

      "As Boyce and Hart grew in fame and the Monkees took more control of their work, they pursued their own careers, releasing the albums \"Test Patterns\" and \"I Wonder What She's Doing Tonite\" and appearing on such sitcoms as \"I Dream of Jeannie\" and \"Bewitched.\" They also were politically active. They campaigned for Robert F. Kennedy when he ran for president in 1968 and wrote the brassy \"L.U.V. (Let Us Vote)\" in support of the 26th Amendment, which in 1971 lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Their other songs included the Monkees' melancholy \"I Wanna Be Free\" and the theme to the daytime soap opera \"Days of Our Lives.\"",

      "In the 1970s and '80s, Hart managed several hits with other collaborators and even contributed material to another TV act, the Partridge Family. He worked with Austin Roberts on \"Over You,\" an Oscar-nominated ballad performed by Betty Buckley in \"Tender Mercies,\" and with Dick Eastman on \"My Secret (Didja Gitit Yet?)\" for New Edition. He and Bryce toured with Dolenz and fellow Monkee Davy Jones in the '70s, put out the album \"Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart\" and received renewed attention when the Monkees enjoyed a comeback in the 1980s.",

      "He also befriended Boyce, a singer and songwriter from Charlottesville, Virginia, with a \"very unusual personality, spontaneous and extroverted, yet very cool at the same time.\" Boyce and Hart helped write the top 10 hit \"Come a Little Bit Closer\" for Jay and the Americans and were a strong enough combination that Kirshner recruited them for his Screen Gems songwriting factory: They were assigned to the Monkees. Asked to come up with songs for a quartet openly modeled on the Beatles, they devised a twangy guitar line similar to the one for the \"Paperback Writer\" and wrote \"Last Train to Clarksville,\" a chart topper in 1966 based in part on Hart's mishearing of the Beatles hit (he thought Paul McCartney was singing \u201ctake the last train\u201d near the end; McCartney was singing \u201cpaperback writer\u201d).",
      "When Kirshner suggested a song with a girl's name in the title, they turned out \"Valleri\" and reached the top 5. For the show's theme song, a stroll outside was enough.",
      "\"Boyce began strumming his guitar and I joined in by snapping my fingers & making noises with my mouth that simulated an open & closed hi-hat cymbal,\" Hart wrote in his memoir. \"We had created the perfect recipe for inspiration and started singing about just what we were doing: 'Walkin' down the street.'\"",

      "A new Whitney Houston song has arrived 13 years after her death",
      "NEW YORK -- It sounds impossible, but that's the magic of it. On Thursday, a new Whitney Houston song arrives 13 years after her death.",
      "English singer Calum Scott is responsible. The single is a duet between Scott and Houston, a balladic reinterpretation of the timeless \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me),\u201d using Houston's original vocal stems. (Stems are the individual musical elements that, when combined, make up a song.)",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even something I could have dreamt as a possibility, and the fact that I'm getting to do it is, geez, one of the honors of my career,\u201d Scott told The Associated Press. Houston's voice is one that soundtracked his childhood \u2014 courtesy his mom \u2014 and he refers to Houston as one of the most influential performers in his life and the lives of many.",
      "\u201cTimeless,\u201d he describes her.",
      "Here's how the new song came into existence.",
      "Such an undertaking couldn't be possible without the approval of a number of parties. Specifically, it required Pat Houston, Whitney\u2019s sister-in-law and the executor of her estate, and Primary Wave, which acquired the copyrights to hit Whitney Houston songs as part of a 2022 deal.",
      "Pat Houston says the idea for Scott's \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d actually came from Primary Wave. They were familiar with Scott's live cover version of the song from his stint opening for Ed Sheeran in 2024. On that tour, Scott stripped the 1987 classic down into a ballad, blending it with Robyn's \u201cDancing On My Own.\u201d",
      "After hearing what Scott could do with the song \u2014 taking it from its up-tempo pop spirit to a big-hearted ballad, while also taking into consideration that 2025 marks the 40th anniversary of Houston's music career \u2014 Pat Houston was on board. It was yet another opportunity for celebration. \u201cI said, you know what, this is a no-brainer. This is the Houston style. So, let\u2019s go with this,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWhitney was a balladeer and that\u2019s why we all fell in love with her,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd Calum turned the song into a beautiful ballad.\u201d",
      "First, the Houston estate and Primary Wave provided Scott with the original vocal stems, produced by her longtime producer Narada Michael Walden. Then Scott recorded the song with producers Jon \u201cMAGS\u201d Maguire, Andrew Yeates and Charlie T in the U.K. in \u201cabout a week,\u201d he recalls. They were joined by a string section, which gave additional dimension to their somber take on the song.",
      "\u201cTake a pop song and make it sad,\u201d Scott jokes of his approach.",
      "Recording the ballad made sense because, as Scott points out, the lyrics to the original song are a bit melancholic. \u201cYou want to dance with somebody who loved you, you know, you're not actually dancing with them,\u201d he says. It's about yearning. But in an early demo, the chorus was recorded in a minor chord \u2014 which sounded a bit too depressing. The change was made swiftly; even slowed, the song needed some of that Houston ebullience.",

      "Another early decision: The new song would start with just Houston's voice, alone, in the first verse. \u201cWhitney starts the song because this is her song,\u201d Scott says simply. \u201cI would never dare stand in front of Whitney for that first verse.\u201d",
      "Eagle-eyed (eared?) fans might notice the sound of a snare drum bleeding into her vocal on that verse \u2014 because it was originally recorded to tape, not digitally, and because \u201cwe can\u2019t change anything like that because those are etched into the song and into her vocal,\u201d says Scott. \u201cAnd to remove it would be taking a piece away.\u201d",
      "It's one of the reasons they kept the song's iconic key change in the last chorus as well.",
      "\u201cI really had to dig for those high notes,\u201d he says of the recording. \u201cIt was an honor just to harmonize with her.\u201d",
      "Scott looked to the original songwriters for approval \u2014 the dream team of George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam. They were immediately on board.",
      "\u201cSome people would have come in and they would have added something ... to boost their visibility next to Whitney. And he had the boldness to tear it all down and just have acoustic piano, just Whitney, and then give her the first verse,\u201d said Merrill. \u201cAnd I mean, this is his project. To me, that\u2019s showing such respect.\u201d",
      "That, and they recognize Scott as a virtuosic vocalist. \u201cHis music really features his voice, as with Adele or Whitney, and rightly so because he can carry it off,\u201d said Rubicam. \u201cThere aren\u2019t just hundreds of people who can carry that off with his kind of power.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a good vocal match together,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey both got a lot of emotionality and command also of their vocal instrument. ... Whitney could overpower a lot of people. But for Calum, he\u2019s confident and he had a vision about it and they both are meeting at an emotional level.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like I gently walked alongside Whitney,\u201d says Scott. The song is meant to feel alive, channeling the spirit of Houston \u2014 not a tribute, but an active single. It's why their version of \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d will be featured on his new album \u201cAvenoir,\u201d out Oct. 10.",
      "\u201cThis is as much part of my story as any other song on the album,\u201d he says. \u201cJust being given the honor of it has been, you know, I could die a very happy man now.\u201d",
      "\u201cForty years ago, this particular song was hot then and it\u2019s hot now,\u201d says Pat Houston. \u201cSo why not keep producing. But it\u2019s the right connection, it's the right platform and it certainly is the right artist to collab with her on this.\u201d",

      "\"Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale\" brings change to the Crawley family as they face the 1930s",
      "Change comes slowly to the Downton Abbey universe and its Crawley family. Just watch Robert Crawley go flat-hunting in London.",
      "Wait, what? FLAT-HUNTING? The Earl of Grantham? Well, yes, and it\u2019s the most amusing scene in \u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale\u201d (a self-announcing title if there ever was one).",
      "Just look at proud and starched Robert (Hugh Bonneville), trying to be open-minded but utterly flummoxed by this \u201cflat\u201d in which you cannot go \u201cup\u201d to bed because there is no \u201cup.\u201d Well, you can go \u201calong\u201d to bed, suggests daughter Mary (Michelle Dockery, as always the sensible center of things) trying to make it all sound manageable.",
      "But the prospect of flat-living \u2014 rather than maintaining a mansion in London \u2014 is a thing the Crawleys must consider as they move into the 1930s, with financial and social instability always around the corner. \u201cFamilies like us need to keep moving to survive,\u201d says Mary, with the weight of Downton Abbey\u2019s future itself resting on her shoulders.",
      "A note to those coming in cold to the franchise here: Well, it\u2019s going to be quite hard. Writer Julian Fellowes and director Simon Curtis do not engage in hand-holding when it comes to mastering the Crawley family tree or the broader family of servants that Downton fans know and love. Even those who saw the first two films \u2013 the last in 2022 \u2013 might feel the need for a refresher.",
      "We begin in London\u2019s West End, at a show by Noel Coward, attended by Downton inhabitants from all levels. They\u2019re all there to watch dashing actor Guy Dexter (Dominic West), who in the last movie asked former butler Thomas Barrow to become his dresser, and more. It\u2019s nice to see Barrow is happy now, able to live life as a gay man \u2014 even if Robert can\u2019t quite grasp their relationship (change is slow, remember).",
      "Meanwhile Mary is shopping in London with sister Edith, and the importance of this scene is perhaps to remind us that the real star of the \u201cDownton\u201d universe, after that stupendous house of course, are the costumes. Mary finds a sleek red satin gown that is quite possibly the most smashing outfit we\u2019ve seen yet.",
      "But when she puts it on for a society ball, trouble erupts. As the family arrives we learn that Mary\u2019s divorce decree has come through \u2014 and this means, alas, that she will become a pariah. The newspaper screams news of \u201cdivorce in high places,\u201d and indeed, the ball\u2019s hostess actually kicks Mary out of the party because royalty is coming. Mary\u2019s concerned parents are outraged \u2014 but they stay, and their daughter heads out, quipping that she hopes a taxi will agree to take her.",
      "Soon enough we\u2019re back at Downton, and there is one very big difference: no longer does Violet Crawley, aka Maggie Smith, with her inimitable style and those hilarious quips, rule the halls. She died in the last film \u2014 and Smith died in 2024. But the film is dedicated to her in more ways than one.",

      "Harold arrives from America with some unfortunate news \u2013 he\u2019s wasted away much of their family fortune. Accompanying him is friend Gus, a handsome and clever type \u2014 or so it seems \u2014 who has been advising Harold on his finances.

      "Then there\u2019s Simon Russell Beale as the pompous Hector, who tries to hold onto local tradition but runs up against Isobel (Penelope Wilton), and a charming Arty Froushan as Noel Coward himself. The playwright is the closest thing in Downton world to a modern celebrity \u2014 everyone wants to be with him, no matter station nor gender, and he winds up helping Mary overcome her social shunning.",
      "Nowhere to be seen is dashing Hugh Dancy, who played a film director (besotted with Mary) in the last movie. But the character that director anointed as a screenwriter, Joseph Moseley (Kevin Doyle), is back, and Fellowes must have enjoyed writing this line for him: \u201cIn many ways the writers are the stars of cinema.\u201d",

      "\u201cSometimes I feel that the past is a more comfortable place than the future,\u201d someone says in a poignant moment.

      "Ed Sheeran has long sought to bring people together with his music, whether it be his emotionally resonant acoustic ballads or unproblematic, danceable pop hits",
      "NEW YORK -- Ed Sheeran has long sought to bring people together with his music, whether it be his emotionally resonant acoustic ballads or unproblematic, danceable pop hits. \u201cPlay,\u201d his eighth studio album out Friday, stays in that familiar lane for the most part.",
      "In his quest, Sheeran has maintained an everyman quality by carefully evolving with the status quo (while, largely, removing himself from public discourse, save his copyright court win and more recent promotional pop-ups in everyman places, like a New York City ice cream shop just this week). The aesthetic of Ed Sheeran, global star, still matches that of Ed Sheeran, up-and-coming troubadour. Most of the time, it's still just Sheeran, his guitar and his loop pedal against the world.",
      "Of course, Sheeran, like most pop stars, knows that as his stardom has risen and his audience widened, the meaning of that relatability has shifted. His listeners, over a decade in, know that too. So \u201cPlay,\u201d the first project in a new series from Sheeran named for symbols (he's said \u201cRewind\u201d will be next), uses Sheeran's global acclaim to his advantage \u2014 without straying too far from his singer-songwriter roots.",
      "Recorded throughout his \u201cMathematics World Tour\u201d and finished in Goa, India, the project feels split. There are moments that herald the return of Sheeran the hitmaker, an exciting development after his last two albums \u2014 the final chapter of his mathematics series, \u201cSubtract,\u201d and the folk-pop \u201cAutumn Variations\u201d \u2014 were well received but failed to produce the kind of chart-toppers that created Sheeran, the megastar. Most tracks, however, fall more in line with those albums, deviating little from the narrative songwriting toolkit that raised Sheeran, the artist.",
      "Sheeran turned to new collaborators for a couple songs that are already established hits. The addictive \u201cSapphire\u201d features Indian singer Arijit Singh, who ranks among Spotify's most popular artists globally. A Farsi version of the single \u201cAzizam,\u201d written and produced with Ilya Salmanzadeh, Savan Kotecha and Johnny McDaid, was released in April featuring Iranian singer Googoosh. Sheeran isn't just eyeing the U.S. and U.K. charts here \u2014 he's playing for cross-cultural domination, and having fun while doing it.",
      "The rest of the tracks, those that feel more classically Sheeran, see old themes recycled: \u201cOld Phone\u201d provides him the space to remember old friends and reminisce about his changing personal life, just as the landscape in 2017's \u201cCastle on the Hill\u201d provided a tangible marker of memory. The conceit of the sappily sweet \u201cCamera\u201d \u2014 \u201cI don't need a camera to capture this moment\u201d \u2014 comes in conflict with that of Sheeran's own beloved \u201cPhotograph\u201d from 2014's \u201cMultiply.\u201d",
      "There are still moments that feel like they'll stick: Sheeran's ode to his daughters, \u201cFor Always,\u201d with cooing backing vocals from co-writer Amy Allen, is sure to be a favorite father-daughter dance track, right behind the groovy \u201cThe Vow\u201d on wedding playlists.",
      "Sheeran flexes his pen on \u201cOpening,\u201d the album's first track. Bounded by glittery verses about boundaries, he raps about his family, his mental health, that court case, fame and what comes next. \u201cBeen a long time up top but I ain\u2019t complacent/If I look down I can see replacements,\u201d he raps at one point. \u201cGotta make dreams and chase them.\u201d",
      "Sheeran wants to be for everyone. And to do that, he'll still be an everyman.",

      "Fans of Jane Austen are celebrating the 250th anniversary of the beloved author's birth with costumed balls and themed events",
      "LONDON -- Ellie Potts goes dancing with her friends most weeks. They don\u2019t put on the latest Taylor Swift or Ed Sheeran, though \u2014 they much prefer English country dances that were popular more than 200 years ago.",
      "As the music starts, about two dozen men and women curtsy and bow, extend a gloved hand to their partner, before dancing in circles or skipping in elaborate patterns around each other.",
      "Like many of her fellow Hampshire Regency Dancers, Potts is a devotee of Jane Austen and all things from the Regency period. Not only have they studied the books and watched all the screen adaptations \u2014 they also research the music, make their own period dresses, and immerse themselves in dances Austen and her characters would have enjoyed in centuries past.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been interested in Jane Austen since I was about 8 or 9,\u201d said Potts, 25. \u201cI mainly joined (the dance group) so I can have balls and things to go to in my costumes, but I really got into it. I\u2019ve been surprised how much I enjoy the dancing.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no shortage of grand costumed balls and historical dancing this year, which marks the 250th anniversary of Austen\u2019s birth. This weekend, thousands of fans who call themselves \u201cJaneites\u201d are descending on the city of Bath for a 10-day festival celebrating the beloved author of \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d and \u201cSense and Sensibility.\u201d",
      "The highlight is a Regency costumed promenade on Saturday, where some 2,000 people in their finest bonnets, bows and costumes will parade through the streets of Bath. Organizers say the extravaganza holds the Guinness World Record for the \u201clargest gathering of people dressed in Regency costumes.\u201d",
      "Bonny Wise, from Indiana, is attending her sixth Jane Austen festival in Bath. This time she\u2019s bringing four period dresses she made, and will lead a tour group of 25 Austen enthusiasts from all over the United States.",
      "\u201cI started planning a tour four years ago, when I realized this was a big year for Jane,\u201d said Wise, 69. She credited the 1995 adaptation of \u201cSense and Sensibility\u201d with sparking her obsession.",
      "\u201cThat movie just opened up a whole new world for me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou start with the books, the movies, then you start getting into the hats, the tea, the manners \u2026 one thing just led to another.\u201d",
      "Wise said she loves the wit, humor and social observations in Austen\u2019s books. She also finds the author\u2019s own life story inspiring.",
      "\u201cI admire Jane and what she managed as a woman in that era, her perseverance and her process of becoming an author,\u201d she said.",
      "The Jane Austen Society of North America, the world\u2019s largest organization devoted to the author, says it has seen a recent influx of younger fans, though most of its members \u2014 5,000 to date \u2014 skew older.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re growing all the time because Jane Austen is timeless,\u201d said Mary Mintz, the group\u2019s president. \u201cWe have members from Japan, India. They come from every continent except Antarctica.\u201d",
      "Many festival-goers will be making a pilgrimage to Steventon, the small village in rural Hampshire, southern England, where Austen was born in 1775.",

      "Bath is also the filming location for parts of \u201cBridgerton,\u201d Netflix\u2019s wildly popular modern take on period drama based loosely on the Regency period, the decade when the future King George IV stood in as prince regent because his father was deemed unfit to rule due to mental illness.",
      "Thanks to the show, Austen and Regency style \u2014 think romantic flowing gowns, elegant ballrooms and high society soirees \u2014 have become trendy for a new generation.",

      "In a church hall in Winchester, a few streets away from where Austen was buried, the Hampshire Regency Dancers gather weekly to practice for the many performances they\u2019re staging this year in honor of the author.",
      "The group selects dances that appear in screen adaptations of Austen\u2019s novels, and members go to painstaking detail to ensure their costumes, down to the buttons and stitching, are authentic looking.",
      "\u201cWe go to a lot of trouble to get things as close to the original as possible,\u201d said Chris Oswald, a retired lawyer who now chairs the group. \u201cFor me it\u2019s about getting a better understanding of what life was like then, and in the process of doing that getting a better understanding of Jane Austen herself.\u201d",
      "Oswald is passionate about his group\u2019s showcases in Hampshire, or what he jokingly calls \u201cJane Austen land.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople get quite touched because they are walking where Jane Austen actually walked. They dance in a room that Jane Austen danced in,\u201d he said. \u201cFor people who are very into Jane Austen, that\u2019s extremely special.\u201d",
      "Many \u201cJaneites\u201d say they get huge enjoyment in making Austen's words and imageries come to life in a community of like-minded people.",
      "Lisa Timbs, a pianist who researches the music in Austen\u2019s life and performs it on an antique pianoforte, puts it succinctly: She and her Regency friends are \"stepping back in time together.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an escape for a lot of people,\u201d Timbs added. \u201cPerhaps it's to escape the speed, noise and abrasiveness of the era in which we find ourselves, and a longing to return to the elegance and indulgent pleasures of what was really a very fleeting period in history.\u201d",

      "Democratic lawmakers are questioning whether a Boar's Head deli meat plant at the center of last year's deadly listeria outbreak will be fit to reopen.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro, of Connecticut, sent a letter Monday asking company officials to appear before the Congressional Food Safety Caucus to discuss \u201ca repeated pattern of food safety negligence that jeopardized Americans' public health.\u201d",
      "The letter, signed by nine other Democrats, cited Associated Press reporting that described sanitation problems in recent months at Boar\u2019s Head plants in three states. It requests a response by Sept. 26.",
      "Boar's Head officials have said they planned to reopen their plant in Jarratt, Virginia, in the coming months. The plant was shuttered after listeria-tainted liverwurst killed 10 people, sickened dozens and forced a recall of more than 7 million pounds of deli products. Federal officials said systemic problems at the plant caused the outbreak.",
      "Officials with the U.S. Agriculture Department lifted the plant's suspension in July and said that federal inspectors would assume direct oversight of operations.",
      "Documents obtained by the AP showed problems at plants in Arkansas, Indiana and a different site in Virginia. Inspectors found instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans and staff who failed to follow required hygiene practices.",
      "\u201cIt is appalling that Boar's Head is encountering similar issues at other facilities of theirs,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThis information leaves us less than confident that the facility in Jarratt, Virginia, is prepared to reopen safely.\u201d",
      "Boar's Head officials said they were reviewing the letter.",
      "\u201cIn our more than 120-year history, what happened at our Jarratt facility was the first time that such an event occurred,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe moved quickly, aggressively and decisively in close collaboration with regulators and leading food safety experts to identify the root cause of the problem and implement enhancements to our food manufacturing nationwide to prevent something like this from ever happening again.\u201d",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "NEW YORK -- Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee meets this week, with votes expected on whether to change recommendations on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B and chickenpox.",
      "The exact questions to be voted on Thursday and Friday in Atlanta are unclear. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to questions seeking details to a newly posted agenda, although the department announced five additional appointments to the committee Monday.",
      "Some public health experts are worried that the votes will \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 raise unwarranted new questions about vaccines in the minds of parents.",
      "Perhaps even more consequential would be a vote that restricts a government program from paying for vaccines for low-income families.",
      "\u201cI'm tightening my seat belt,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert.",
      "The panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors have almost always accepted those recommendations, which are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading antivaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices.",
      "Here's a look at the three vaccines being discussed:",
      "Before Kennedy was health secretary, ACIP would typically vote in June to reaffirm recommendations for shots against respiratory viruses that sicken millions of Americans each fall and winter.",
      "This past June, Kennedy's ACIP voted to recommend flu shots for Americans but was silent on COVID-19 shots.",
      "Before that meeting, Kennedy announced he was removing COVID-19 shots from the CDC's recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women. The move was heavily criticized by doctors' groups and public health organizations, and prompted a lawsuit by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups.",
      "Days after Kennedy's announcement, CDC officials said families could still get the 2024-2025 version of COVID-19 shots for their kids in consultation with their doctors. That clarification meant shots would still be covered by the federal government's Vaccines For Children program, which pays for shots for families who lack money or adequate health insurance coverage. It's now responsible for roughly half of childhood vaccinations in the U.S. each year.",
      "As with flu shots, however, there are new COVID-19 formulations each fall, to account for changes in which strains are circulating. The committee has not yet voted on whether to recommend this season's COVID-19 shots or whether those shots should be covered by the VFC program.",
      "Further complicating the picture: When the FDA last month licensed this fall's COVID-19 shots, the agency took the unusual step of narrowing their use for healthy younger adults and children.",
      "If the ACIP simply follows that, and if there is no additional clarifying language from the CDC, then \u201cthat would take away access for roughly half of America\u2019s kids,\u201d said Dr. Sean O'Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "The pediatricians group urges that vaccinations continue for all children ages 6 months to 2 years.",
      "Hepatitis B can cause serious liver infections. In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during use injection-drug use.",
      "But the virus also can be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections.",
      "A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).",
      "Infant vaccinations are stressed for women who have hepatitis B or, crucially, who have not been tested for it. The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.",
      "Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are considered a success, and no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problem with giving kids the shots on their first day of life, Schaffner said.",

      "In 2005, a combination MMRV shot \u2014 measles, mumps, rubella and varicella \u2014 was licensed. The CDC initially recommended that doctors and parents use the combo shot over separate MMR and varicella injections.",

      "She isolated from loved ones after the 2023 disaster while struggling to process the grief, often angry that her family didn't have a permanent place to stay and that so many others were unable to evacuate.",
      "Moving between high schools, she never felt welcome, Palacio said, and the pain only intensified as the months wore on. Finally, near the first anniversary of the fires, Palacio reached out for help.",
      "Hundreds of students like Palacio have struggled mentally since the fires \u2013 and not all have received the help they need.",
      "The Hawaii Department of Education estimates more than a third of Maui students lost a family member, sustained a serious injury or had a parent lose a job after the fires, which killed 102 people and damaged more than 3,300 properties in Lahaina.",

      "AP is collaborating with Honolulu Civil Beat, CalMatters, Blue Ridge Public Radio, and Centro de Periodismo Investigativo in Puerto Rico to examine how school communities are recovering from the disruption of natural disasters.",
      "____",
      "Two years later, many in Lahaina are ready to return to normal. But therapists say students\u2019 mental health challenges continue to mount.",
      "That\u2019s common after a disaster, especially at the two-year mark, when adrenaline wears off and stress remains high, said Christopher Knightsbridge, one of several researchers at the University of Hawaii who has studied the well-being of Lahaina fire survivors. While kids may feel numb immediately following a disaster, after two years, they\u2019re facing the toll of constant uncertainty and change, he said.",
      "It\u2019s a phenomenon seen wherever schooling has been disrupted by natural disasters, reporting by Honolulu Civil Beat, The Associated Press and several other news outlets shows. But a couple years after the disaster, schools are not always prepared with extra mental health supports.",
      "On Maui, the island is dealing with an ongoing shortage of specialists. In the past few years, the number of psychiatrists serving youth has dropped from four to two, even as demand has grown.",
      "\u201cThe crisis isn\u2019t over,\u201d Knightsbridge said.",
      "Palacio made progress with the help of a school counselor and then a local organization that supports teens\u2019 mental health through outdoor activities and adventures.",
      "The senior at Lahainaluna High School said she\u2019s now more comfortable confiding in others and controlling her emotions. She takes pride in mentoring younger students who also have struggled since the fires.",
      "Two years in, many kids still wrestle with depression and anxiety.",
      "DayJahiah Valdivia, a senior at K\u012bhei Charter School, said her stress levels spike when there are strong winds or small brush fires. Valdivia lives in Upcountry Maui, which also faced wildfires that burned over a thousand acres of land on the same day as the 2023 Lahaina fires. Her home was spared, but it took months for her family to return because their property was covered in soot and needed professional cleaning.",
      "She feels less anxious now that her family members have discussed their escape plan for future disasters. But a summer fire near a friend\u2019s home in Central Maui renewed her fears about her loved ones\u2019 safety.",
      "\u201cThe anxiety never really wore off,\u201d she said. On windy days, it was especially difficult to concentrate in class or feel safe.",
      "In a University of Hawaii study of fire survivors conducted in 2024, just over half of children reported symptoms of depression, and 30% were likely facing an anxiety disorder. Nearly half of kids in the study, ages 10 to 17, were experiencing PTSD.",
      "Children in disaster-torn towns across the U.S. can relate.",
      "In Paradise, California, where the 2018 Camp Fire took 85 lives, a protracted period of disillusionment followed what some called the \u201chero phase,\u201d when the community pulled together and vowed to resurrect their town. Both Lahaina and Paradise had housing shortages after their fires, so families had to move away or live with friends to go to school or work in the area. In general, students who don\u2019t have a permanent living arrangement tend to struggle more academically and have more behavioral challenges, research shows.",
      "Many Paradise students still struggle with anxiety and grief, seven years later, making it difficult to fully engage in school. A year after the Camp Fire, 17% of students were homeless, and the suspension rate was 7.4%, compared to 2.5% statewide. The suspension rate remained nearly triple the state average last year, and more than 26% were chronically absent.",
      "Aryah Berkowitz, who lost her home, two dogs and her family\u2019s business in the Paradise blaze, dealt with lingering behavioral challenges following the disaster. For nearly a year afterward, her family of seven, plus a pair of surviving pit bull-Labrador mixes, lived with a friend in nearby Chico, sharing two bedrooms and a bathroom. Berkowitz, then in sixth grade, slept on the couch.",
      "\u201cI was having to help my family a lot and wasn\u2019t able to handle it,\u201d said Berkowitz , once a high-achieving student who was suspended twice after the fire. \u201cI was holding it inside and took it out on other people. Some days I\u2019d just walk out of class.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey just sort of vanished,\u201d Chapin said.",
      "Maui has long dealt with medical workforce challenges. Even before the fires, it faced a shortage of mental health professionals because they struggled with the state\u2019s high cost of living and housing shortage.",
      "The fires brought burnout and greater economic obstacles, only exacerbating the issue. Since then, Hawaii\u2019s education department has tried to bulk up Maui\u2019s mental health staff by bringing in providers from neighbor islands and the mainland and, more recently, using a $2 million federal grant to support students.",
      "But hiring mental health staff has been so difficult that even the federal money hasn\u2019t made much of a dent. In the first nine months of the grant, the state education department primarily used the money to bus displaced students from other parts of the island to Lahaina schools.",
      "The state has used the money to hire five part-time mental health providers working with students and staff, including one specialist who works in the evenings with students living as boarders on Lahainaluna\u2019s campus, said Kimberly Lessard, a Department of Education district specialist.",
      "Two of the six behavioral health specialist positions in Lahaina schools remained unfilled this summer, as they have been for years due to Maui\u2019s housing shortage and high cost of living, Lessard said.",
      "Valdivia, who still struggles with anxiety from the Upcountry Maui fires, has seen the impacts of the provider shortage firsthand. She\u2019s on a two- to three-month waiting list to see a psychiatrist on Maui, and she\u2019s seeing an O\u02bbahu-based therapist via telehealth because there aren\u2019t enough providers who can meet with her in person.",
      "\u201cEven just to get evaluated (by a psychiatrist), it\u2019s literally months,\u201d she said. \u201cI just think that\u2019s crazy.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s common for disaster-torn communities to struggle with shortages of psychological staff, often because of burnout and a lack of resources.",
      "In Puerto Rico, which has suffered from a series of disasters since Hurricane Maria struck in 2017, students have experienced high rates of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Yet despite legislation in 2000 to create more school psychologist positions, it wasn\u2019t until the pandemic that the commonwealth\u2019s Education Department dedicated money to hire them. Today, there are 58 vacancies across the archipelago\u2019s 870 schools.",
      "The school psychologists \u201ccan\u2019t keep up,\u201d said Nellie Zambrana, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Puerto Rico at R\u00edo Piedras. Those who are working are overstretched, according to a study by the university\u2019s Psychological Research Institute. One psychologist, the study said, was assigned to more than 100 students at three schools.",
      "Loren Lapow wasn\u2019t deterred by the storm clouds gathering one June afternoon over D.T. Fleming Beach on Maui. The social worker helped teens carry an inflatable paddleboard to the water\u2019s edge, cheering them on as they swam.",
      "Amid the fun, Lapow directed the teens to reflect on their fears and losses. He asked them how they feel when they smell smoke or think about Lahaina\u2019s famed Front Street, most of which was destroyed in the blaze.",
      "\u201cPlaces are like a friend to us,\u201d Lapow said. \u201cWhen you lose places, it hurts.\u201d",
      "Lapow founded the Maui Hero Project, which his website describes as \u201cadventure-based counseling services.\u201d The eight-week program Lapow started 25 years ago teaches teens basic disaster preparedness skills and immerses them in outdoor activities. It's also a form of mental health support, which Lapow has leaned into since the wildfires.",
      "Lapow\u2019s approach has become a common strategy for nonprofits and therapists trying to reach kids who have balked at discussing their mental health since the fires. But those efforts don't always reach the kids who need the most help.",
      "There\u2019s a strong stigma around seeking mental health services, particularly in Filipino and Latino communities that make up a large portion of Lahaina\u2019s population, said Ruben Juarez, a professor at University of Hawaii who led the research study on fire survivors. Families may see counseling as a sign of weakness, and children may be reluctant to open up to therapists out of fear of being judged or scrutinized, he added.",
      "Yet in the study, Latino teens reported the highest rates of severe depressive and PTSD symptoms. Filipino teens reported some of the highest rates of anxiety.",
      "The state is hoping struggling students will open up to their peers. A new program called YouthLine will train Hawaii teens to respond to crisis calls, said Keli Acquaro, who oversees youth mental health for the state.",
      "Keakealani Cashman, who graduated from Kamehameha Schools Maui in 2024, is hoping to be part of the state\u2019s solution to provide more mental health support to the next generation of children.",
      "After losing her home to the fires, Cashman spent her senior year talking to Native Hawaiian practitioners and researching how cultural values, such as connections to the land and her ancestors, could help her community heal from the trauma of the fires. The project helped her own mental health improve, said Cashman, who regularly met with her school\u2019s behavioral health specialist.",
      "Now, Cashman is entering her second year at Brigham Young University Hawaii and hopes to work as a behavioral health specialist in Hawaiian language immersion schools",
      "\u201cThis horrible, horrible thing happened to me and my family, but I don\u2019t have to let it kill the rest of my life,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cI can really help my family, my community in school, and just make an impact in what I know how to do.\u201d",

The judge later continued, \u201cIt is abundantly clear that the true purpose of issuing the subpoena is to interfere with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' right to protect GAC within its borders, to harass and intimidate BCH to stop providing such care, and to dissuade patients from seeking such care.\u201d",

Bondi said the requests were part of investigations into \u201chealthcare fraud, false statements, and more.\u201d But the requests did not just seek information on policies or billing practices \u2014 they also demanded information about individual patients who had been prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy.",
      "Boston Children's Hospital asked the federal court to quash the subpoena on July 8, saying the Justice Department was seeking practically every document related to the provision of gender-affirming care over the past five and a half years, including highly sensitive and personally identifiable information about young patients.",

      "Every time humans cut into the Amazon rainforest or burn or destroy parts of it, they're making people sick.",
      "It's an idea Indigenous people have lived by for thousands of years. Now a new study in the journal Communications Earth & Environment adds to the scientific evidence supporting it, by finding that instances of several diseases were lowered in areas where forest was set aside for Indigenous peoples who maintained it well.",
      "With the United Nations climate summit set for Brazil in November, the study authors and outside experts said the work highlights the stakes for people around the world as negotiators try to address climate change. Belem, the city hosting the conference, is known as the gateway to the Amazon, and many who will be attending, from activists to delegates, think the role of Indigenous communities in climate action and conservation will be highlighted in a distinct way.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018forest man\u2019 or \u2018man forest,\u2019 according to the Indigenous perspective, has always been linked to the reciprocity between human health and the natural environment where one lives,\u201d said Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez Cayetano, president of the Federation of Ticuna and Yagua Communities of the Lower Amazon, or FECOTYBA, in the Peruvian Amazon. \u201cIf each state does not guarantee the rights and territories of Indigenous peoples, we would inevitably be harming their health, their lives, and the ecosystem itself.\u201d",
      "That harm can look like respiratory diseases such as asthma caused by toxic air pollution after fires, or illnesses that spread from animals to humans such as malaria, said Paula Prist, a senior program coordinator for the Forest and Grasslands Unit at the International Union for Conservation of Nature and one of the study authors.",
      "The researchers compiled and analyzed data on forest quality, legal recognition of Indigenous territory and disease incidence in the countries that border and include the Amazon.",
      "The work was \u201cimpressive\u201d to University of Washington health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi. She said it highlighted the complexity of factors that affect human health, and the importance of understanding the role Indigenous communities play in shaping it. \u201cUsing these methods, others could study other parts of the world,\u201d she said.",
      "The researchers found creative ways to account for other variables that can affect the spread of diseases, like access to health care in a given area, said Magdalena Hurtado, an anthropology and global health professor at Arizona State University and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences who was not involved with the study. But she expressed concern that the findings were presented with a precision that may not be warranted, given that they were based on correlation and use data on observations that can be difficult to measure.",
      "\u201cThey claim that Indigenous territories only protect health when forest cover is above 40%. And so that that feels like, why 40%? Why not 35? Or why not a range?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the study is wrong, but it means that we need to be cautious because the patterns could change if different, more precise methods were used.\u201d",
      "Still, she thinks this is a starting point that could open the door to future research. \u201cThey are actually doing something quite beautiful,\u201d empirically connecting the legal recognition of Indigenous lands to human health outcomes, she said.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, of FECOTYBA, said that's important for the global policymakers who are coming to Brazil.",

      "Health officials say West Nile virus infections are intense this year, with 40% more cases than usual",
      "NEW YORK -- West Nile virus infections are intense so far this year, with case counts running 40% higher than normal, health officials say.",
      "More than 770 cases, including about 490 severe cases, were reported as of early September, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data posted this week. About 550 cases \u2014 350 of them severe \u2014 are usually reported by this time of year.",
      "Health officials are ramping up warnings to the public, because most cases of the mosquito-borne disease are reported in August and September.",
      "\u201cWest Nile virus can be a very serious disease and its presence in mosquitoes remains high right now in Massachusetts,\u201d said the state\u2019s public health commissioner, Dr. Robbie Goldstein, in a statement last week.",
      "People can protect themselves by wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants when possible, and using an EPA-registered insect repellent when spending time outdoors, health officials say.",
      "West Nile virus was first reported in the United States in 1999 in New York, and then gradually spread across the country. It peaked in 2003, when nearly 10,000 cases were reported.",
      "Scientists say many people \u2014 perhaps tens of thousands each year \u2014 are infected but don\u2019t know it because they have no symptoms, or only mild ones such as headaches, body aches, joint pain, vomiting, diarrhea and rashes.",
      "In severe cases, damage to the central nervous system causes inflammation of the brain or spinal cord, and even death.",
      "In the last decade, health officials have fielded reports of 2,000 cases annually on average, including 1,200 life-threatening neurological illnesses and approximately 120 deaths. Deaths are on pace to be higher this year, CDC officials said, but they declined to discuss specifics, saying mortality statistics are too preliminary.",

    "story": [
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is willing to risk a government shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don\u2019t accept Democratic demands on health care",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer weathered backlash from Democrats earlier this year when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. But he\u2019s now willing to risk a shutdown at the end of the month if Republicans don\u2019t accede to Democratic demands.",
      "Schumer says he and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries are united in opposing any legislation that doesn\u2019t include key health care provisions and a commitment not to roll them back. He argues that the country is in a different place than it was in March, when he vigorously argued against a shutdown, and he says he believes Republicans and President Donald Trump will be held responsible if they don\u2019t negotiate a bipartisan deal.",
      "\u201cThings have changed\u201d since the March vote, Schumer said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. He said Republicans have since passed Trump\u2019s massive tax breaks and spending cuts legislation, which trimmed Medicaid and other government programs, and Democrats are now unified \u2014 unlike in March, when he voted with Republicans and Jeffries voted against legislation to fund the government.",
      "A shutdown, Schumer said, wouldn\u2019t necessarily worsen an environment in which Trump is already challenging the authority of Congress. \u201cIt will get worse with or without it, because Trump is lawless,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Schumer\u2019s threat comes as Republicans are considering a short-term stopgap spending measure to avoid a Sept. 30 shutdown and as Democrats face what most see as two tough choices if the parties can\u2019t negotiate a deal \u2014 vote with Republicans to keep the government open or let it close indefinitely with no clear exit plan.",
      "It also comes amid worsening partisan tensions in the Senate, where negotiations between the two parties over the confirmation process broke down for a second time Thursday and Republicans are changing Senate rules to get around Democratic objections. Democrats are also fuming over the Trump administration\u2019s decision to unilaterally claw back $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid just as negotiations over the spending deadline were getting underway in late August.",
      "Republicans have said that Democrats clearly will be to blame if they don\u2019t vote to keep the government open, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has repeatedly said that Schumer needs to come to them with a specific proposal on health care, including an extension of expanded government tax credits for many Americans who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Some Republicans are open to extending those credits before they expire at the end of the year.",

      "Schumer said Democrats also want Republicans to commit that the White House won\u2019t take back money they have negotiated and Congress has approved after Republicans pushed through a $9 billion cut requested by the White House in July and Trump blocked the additional foreign aid money in August. \u201cHow do you pass an appropriations bill and let them undo it down the road?\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Schumer\u2019s move to support the spending legislation in March put him in the rare position of bucking his party\u2019s base. He said then that of two bad options, a partial government shutdown was worse because it would give Trump even more control to shut down agencies and there would be \u201cno off-ramp\u201d to get out of it. \u201cI think people realize it\u2019s a tough choice,\u201d he said.",
      "He faced massive backlash from within the party after the vote, with some activists calling on him to resign. Jeffries temporarily distanced himself from his New York colleague, saying in a statement immediately after Schumer\u2019s vote that House Democrats \u201cwill not be complicit.\u201d The majority of Senate Democrats also voted against the plan.",
      "This time, though, Schumer is in lockstep with Jeffries and in messaging within his caucus. In Democrats\u2019 closed-door lunch Wednesday, he shared polling that he said suggested most Americans would blame Trump, not Democrats, for a shutdown.",
      "\u201cI did what I thought was right\u201d in March, Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different situation now than then.\u201d",

      "The soaring price of gold is fueling a \"mercury boom\" in central Mexico",
      "SAN JOAQUIN, Mexico -- A drill echoes through narrow tunnels deep within the mountain where miner Hugo Flores bores into rock in search of one of Earth\u2019s most toxic elements.",
      "Buried in red stripes of minerals illuminated by his headlamp is mercury.",
      "Here in the pine-covered mountains known as the Sierra Gorda \u2013 one of the most biodiverse stretches of Mexico \u2013 a \u201cmercury boom\u201d is underway.",
      "Soaring international gold prices are driving up the price of mercury, a toxic metal key in illegal gold mining, to all-time highs. While the demand triggers a mining rush in central Mexico, sustaining thousands of miners and their families, it also exposes them and the fragile environment to mercury poisoning. At the same time, this Mexican mercury is fueling illegal gold mining in the Amazon, contaminating large areas and harming both people and the environment.",
      "Global efforts to ban mercury mining have only made mercury from these centuries-old artisanal mines even more sought after.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a way of life here,\u201d Flores said.",
      "In towns like San Joaquin in the north-central state of Queretaro, the price of mercury has skyrocketed more than tenfold over the past 15 years, jumping from $20 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) in 2011 to between $240 and $350.",
      "\u201cFor the first time in their lives, mercury is worth something, and the miners are saying: \u2018It\u2019s worth poisoning myself if I\u2019m going to earn something,\u2019\u201d said Fernando D\u00edaz-Barriga, a medical researcher who has long studied mercury mines in central Mexico.",
      "Miners follow veins of cinnabar \u2013 the ore holding mercury \u2013 like ants through narrow tunnels zig-zagging deep below the mountain. They carve into the rock and lug bags of stones strapped to their backs to the surface.",
      "The rock is shoveled into wood-fired brick ovens where the mercury heats into a gas and separates from other minerals. The gas then cools into droplets of silver liquid that slowly drip down a pipe to be collected in small plastic Coca-Cola bottles, each of which sells for around $1,800. It takes a ton of rock to produce a kilo of mercury.",
      "Mexico is the world\u2019s second-largest mercury producer after China, yielding 200 tons a year, according to estimates by the United Nations.",
      "Buyers come from around the world to scoop up mercury for cheap from artisanal miners.",
      "\u201cThey come and buy mercury for 500 pesos, and then sell it in Peru for 5,000,\u201d said Carlos Mart\u00ednez, a leader of one of San Joaquin\u2019s mines. \u201cThe coyotes, as we call them, they\u2019re the ones that make money at the expense of others.\u201d",
      "Mercury mining in towns dotting Mexico\u2019s Sierra Gorda region dates back centuries. The metal was used in everything from thermometers to cosmetics and legally shipped to South America up until a few years ago, when many countries around the world banned its use. Today, the vast majority of Mexican mercury is trafficked to Colombia, Bolivia and Peru and distributed throughout the Amazon basin.",
      "In the Amazon the metal is used to extract gold from river soil in illegal gold mining operations increasingly controlled by criminal groups. The mining has tainted the rivers that bring life to the region.",
      "In July, Peruvian authorities seized a record-breaking shipment of four tons \u2013 worth about half a million dollars \u2013 of mercury hidden inside bags of gravel headed from Mexico to Bolivia.",
      "A July report by the Environmental Investigation Agency, a nonprofit watchdog that investigates environmental crime, said the Mexican Jalisco New Generation Cartel has entered some mercury mining operations in Mexico. But miners, researchers and local officials say there\u2019s no cartel involvement, and suggesting otherwise has criminalized vulnerable workers.",

      "Around 3,000 people in the region live off the mines or their recycled material, said Izarelly Rosillo, a lawyer and researcher at the Autonomous University of Queretaro. She has spent so much time with miners over the past 12 years that she was diagnosed with mercury poisoning herself.",
      "\u201cMercury has set off a wave of development in the region,\u201d she said. \u201cThough that comes with collateral damages.\u201d",
      "The money from the mine has allowed Flores to send his five kids to school and buy them better clothes, better food and school supplies.",
      "He\u2019s even saved enough money to return to school if his mercury tunnels get shut down, though he said two of his teenagers have started working in the mines.",

      "D\u00edaz-Barriga, the doctor specializing in toxic materials, said that while authorities have not comprehensively studied just how deep the mercury poisoning runs, initial tests done by scientists show dangerously high levels of the chemical in the environment and workers.",
      "Miners eat stew and sip on tequila in the fumes billowing out from the mercury oven. They shovel the excess rock into a nearby riverbed, which flows into the region\u2019s creeks when it rains. After work, they return home to their families with toxic dust on their clothes. In rainy months, miners often cook their own mercury in ovens installed in their homes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a massive contamination in children, women, children, a ton of microorganisms.\u201d D\u00edaz-Barriga said. \u201cIt\u2019s in the sediment, in the trees. Basically, this place is steeped in mercury.\u201d",
      "Researchers said they\u2019ve watched the health of miners and their families deteriorate as they show some of the worst symptoms of mercury intoxication, including tremors, neurological decline, vision and hearing loss, developmental delays in children and more. Rosillo, the lawyer whose blood test came back with levels of mercury 12 times the normal limit, said she suffers from brain inflammation, the loss of hearing in one ear, depression, tremors and more.",
      "Miners suffering from tremors and slurred speech often insist they haven\u2019t felt the negative impacts of long-term exposure. Instead, they attribute the decline they\u2019ve seen in fellow miners to Parkinson\u2019s disease, which numerous studies have linked to mercury exposure.",
      "At 18, Samuel Ledesma, who began working in the mines at age 12, said his whole body started to shake and gradually fell ill. After blood tests, doctors told him he had mercury poisoning. He said that rounds of blood transfusions did little to help, and his body still trembles as he speaks.",

      "It\u2019s considered a hot spot for endangered species, including the jaguar, military macaw, Mexican black bear and hundreds of other species that scientists say could be affected if the mining isn't stopped and cleaned up by authorities.",
      "The area around the mines \"is the most contaminated place in Mexico,\u201d said D\u00edaz Barriga. \u201cThis region isn\u2019t just polluted. It\u2019s poisoned.\u201d",
      "International efforts to stop mining and the international trade of mercury have fueled criticisms that it\u2019s only driven mercury demand in Mexico and put miners in the crosshairs of organized crime.",
      "In 2017, Mexico was among 152 countries that signed a U.N. convention banning mercury mining and making all exports of the mineral illegal. It gave smaller artisanal mines like those in Queretaro until 2032 to shut their doors, thrusting the mines into a sort of legal grey area.",
      "As the world\u2019s biggest mercury mines closed in recent years, miners in the Sierra Gorda say more buyers turned to Mexico as a source.",
      "In 2021, Mexico and the U.N. created a fund to provide workers with resources and training for new industries, but years later miners say they haven\u2019t received any money \u2014 and any alternative job won't match what they earn from mining mercury.",
      "In a written statement, Mexico\u2019s environmental agency said it had conducted basic studies for a program designed to transition miners away from mercury and that it was actively working to \u201ccombat illegal trafficking.\u201d However, it declined to comment on accusations that it had failed to assist miners.",
      "The UN Environment Programme recognized in a statement that a number of challenges including \u201csecurity risks in some mining areas\u201d have \u201ccreated delays and frustrations for affected communities.\u201d But it added that authorities were working to speed up implementation.",
      "As they face economic instability, miners worry the mercury boom will further attract the attention of criminal groups.",

      "Authorities say that social media platforms should not require age verification for all users when a ban on children under 16 having accounts goes into effect in December in Australia",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian authorities said Tuesday that social media platforms should not demand age verification for all account holders starting from December, when a ban on children under 16 having accounts goes into effect in the country.",
      "The government released guidelines on how platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram should apply the world's first ban on children using social media from Dec. 10. It says verifying the ages of all account holders would be unreasonable.",
      "\u201cWe think it would be unreasonable if platforms reverified everyone\u2019s age,\u201d said Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, who drafted the guidelines. Her use of the word \u201creverified\" suggested the platforms usually already had sufficient data to verify a user was older than 16.",
      "She said the platforms have \u201ctargeting technology\u201d to focus on those under 16.",
      "\"They can target us with deadly precision when it comes to advertising. Certainly they can do this around the age of a child,\u201d she added.",
      "Australia\u2019s Parliament enacted the ban last year, giving the platforms a year to work out its implementation. The platforms face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.",
      "Critics of the legislation fear that banning young children from social media will impact the privacy of all users who must establish they are older than 16.",

      "There are more than 1,000 whitewashed stone chapels on the Greek island of Tinos owned and cared for by private families as they have in some cases for centuries",
      "TINOS, Greece -- More than a thousand chapels dot the Greek island of Tinos. In a rare centuries-old tradition, the mostly simple, room-sized stone structures are painstakingly maintained by the ordinary families that own them.",
      "These private whitewashed chapels with miniature bell towers belong to octogenarians and Generation Z, goat farmers and hotel owners, Orthodox Christians and Catholics who worship daily and de facto atheists.",
      "What they have in common is an unwavering dedication to preserving the diminutive churches their ancestors built \u2014 and to throwing a liturgical and community celebration called panigiri around the feast day of the Virgin Mary or saint they honor.",
      "\u201cThis tradition and custom that connect us between members of the family is part of our identity. I\u2019m fully committed to maintaining and passing them down to my children,\u201d said Ioanna Krikelli during the September festival at her family\u2019s church, Agios Sostis, established in the 17th century.",
      "Perched on a rocky promontory on the Aegean Sea facing Mykonos, the chapel with its twin bell towers topped by simple crosses hosted an hourlong evening liturgy. Hundreds of faithful packed the front yard festooned with small Greek flags and string lights.",
      "\u201cWhat you see here is very deep,\u201d Krikelli said, as family members \u2014 including two who had traveled from Iceland and the United Kingdom for the occasion \u2014 served homemade raki liqueur and sweets after the service.",
      "For centuries, European aristocrats built private chapels, usually in their palaces. Today, many homes in predominantly Orthodox Greece have a tiny chapel nearby. Beyond the spiritual, tax breaks for houses of worship can extend to attached buildings.",
      "But in the Cycladic islands, particularly Sifnos and Tinos, there\u2019s more than one chapel per 10 residents. The reasons trace back to past empires, which successively oversaw these strategic islands providing a bridge between Europe and Asia.",
      "The Venetians, who ruled Tinos from the 13th to the early 18th century, granted land rights to Tinos\u2019 farmers as a buffer to the Ottomans. After taking over, the Ottomans allowed the locals to keep and build hundreds of chapels on their farmland, said Maria Vidali, an architect from Tinos who researched the chapels.",
      "Then there are the many chapels built by sailors\u2019 families as vows for their safe passage, those constructed for deceased family members, and those erected in honor of the Virgin Mary, Vidali added. One of Greece\u2019s most important Marian shrines, Panagia Evaggelistria, is in Tinos' main town.",
      "Even though almost all chapels share the iconic Cycladic style \u2014 cubic forms, flat roofs, touches of blue paint on mostly white surfaces \u2014 \u201cevery mason added his own flourish,\u201d said the Rev. Markos Foskolos. The Tinos native has been a Catholic priest on the island for more than 50 years and authored its history.",
      "Most chapels are always open, with a supply of oil for candle wicks as well as candy and bottled water for pilgrims.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s as if they expect visitors,\u201d said Nikos Levantis at Agios Giorgos, a friend\u2019s 200-year-old chapel squeezed among massive granite boulders.",
      "Levantis\u2019 family owns three chapels, and he recalls as a child carrying blankets for sleepovers with a dozen cousins before the morning liturgy. His mother, Eleftheria Levanti, remembers how the festivals were essential social events for islanders decades ago. Young men often proposed by putting a flower alongside meat on their fork and handing it to a girl, she said.",
      "Offering food to pilgrims was a practical need, Foskolos said, when people walked long distances to reach the chapels and did so while fasting before receiving Communion. Feeding poor people was also part of the social contract for those who owned farmland.",
      "\u201cAll this helps to form a sense of community. In these little chapels, one becomes a brother with everyone else,\u201d Foskolos said.",
      "Community gathering remains a crucial part of today\u2019s celebrations, though many are scaled down.",

      "For Levantis, prayer also feels different at the family chapels.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s better here, because you find God closer. You can concentrate more on faith,\u201d he said.",
      "Steeped in family and community, the chapels and their festivals can become tools of evangelization, according to Foskolos.",
      "\u201cBecause people go there \u2026 and there are so many that you can find one every day of the year,\u201d the Catholic priest said.",
      "His sister, Bernadette Foskolos, helped set up at the Agios Sostis festival \u2014 an Orthodox celebration \u2014 and also takes care of her own chapel, Agios Athanasios, near the inland village of Steni. Its walls follow the uneven contours of stones and a touch of blue tops the rounded bell tower.",
      "\u201cWhen they offered me the church, I was just enthusiastic,\u201d she said of being made caretaker of the family chapel, where she decorates the altar with fresh flowers.",
      "In the nearby village of Falatados, Nicoleta Nazou walks daily the short distance from her house to her husband\u2019s family\u2019s marble-covered church, Agia Paraskevi, to make sure there\u2019s oil to keep a candle burning.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility first of all, it goes from generation to generation as an heirloom,\u201d said Nazou, who estimates the chapel dates to the 1600s.",
      "Nondas Chrisochoidis\u2019 chapel only traces back to the mid-1980s, when his father had it built in honor of his namesake, St. Constantine, near Agios Sostis. Chrisochoidis said he\u2019s less observant than his parents, but he\u2019s optimistic that the tradition won\u2019t be lost despite growing secularization across Europe.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a strong tendency, which deviates our children and grandchildren from the traditional path of religion \u2014 visiting churches, honoring the saints and the Virgin Mary and Jesus,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we do everything we can to keep it up and alive, because it\u2019s our life.\u201d",
      "Even though he doesn\u2019t identify as religious and doesn\u2019t live on the island, Giannis Kafantaris shares the sentiment. The 26-year-old\u2019s family shares ownership of Panagia Theoskepasti, perched on a remote mountainside.",
      "He goes often to the chapel because it\u2019s a quiet place to relax with a book. And he has no intention of giving up the site or the festival.",
      "\u201cChristianity has religious aspects but also cultural aspects. It brings a lot of people together,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to keep it going,\u201d",

    "story": [
      "While tensions between Russia and NATO are building up in the Baltic Sea, Europeans are still busy cleaning up the mess World War II left behind in the ocean",
      "BOLTENHAGEN, Germany -- Slowly, Dirk Schoenen dives down to a huge pile of ammunition from World War II at the bottom of the Baltic Sea. He removes some of the top pieces and carefully puts them into a basket, as a team of engineers, divers and seamen watch his every move on monitors streaming live video from a camera attached to his head.",
      "After an hour, the men pull Schoenen back up onto the Baltic Lift, a mobile platform located 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) off the small town of Boltenhagen on the German coast. He has recovered several 12.8cm- shells, some of them still inside a broken wooden box, fragments of smaller grenades, and several 2-centimeter projectiles.",
      "His bounty was fruitful but humble compared to what's left on the sea floor.",
      "Approximately 1.6 million tons of old ammunition are lying on the bottom of the North Sea and Baltic Sea, posing a considerable danger: their casings are slowly rusting and emitting toxic substances such as TNT compounds.",
      "As tensions between Russia and NATO build up on the Baltic Sea, with near daily incidents involving sabotage of undersea cables,NATO fighter planes scrambling to push Russia military planes away, and hostile drones from the East invading western airspace, Europeans are still busy cleaning up the mess that World War II \u2014 and to a smaller extend World War I \u2014 left behind in the ocean.",
      "Most of the ammunition was deliberately sunk in the ocean after the war because the Allies were concerned that Germans would resume hostilities against them again at some point, and ordered that Germany destroy all ordnance. At the time the easiest way to do so seemed to be to simply dump everything into the sea.",
      "Trains from all over Germany were sent to the coasts in 1946, and fishermen were commissioned to take the material to designated disposal areas in the Baltic and North Seas. Often, however, they also threw the ammunition elsewhere into the ocean, and strong currents, especially in the North Sea, have spread the ordnance all over the seafloor.",
      "In an effort to clean up the seabed from the remains of war, the German government has given 100 million euros ($117.4 million) to teams of divers to study how to best recover the ammunition, and to engineers to come up with long-term plans on how to rid the oceans of it.",
      "The current four-week pilot project started last month on the Baltic Lift platform \u2014 a self-propelled crane barge temporarily moored off Boltenhagen because experts had discovered a large field with around 900 tons of old ammunition there.",
      "Two teams of divers are working in 12-hour-shifts around the clock. It's too dangerous to bring the rotting pieces up on the platform, so they are initially sorted and stored in baskets under water until a special ship takes them ashore. Only then are they taken to facilities specializing in disposing old ammunition.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t a routine job,\u201d said Schoenen, 60, who has been diving since 1986 and volunteered for the Baltic Taucher diving team.",
      "\u201cThe challenge, of course, is that you never know what you\u2019re going to get,\u201d he said as he stripped out of his diving gear, including three pairs of gloves to ensure his skin did not come into direct contact with the ammunition. \u201cMost of these things can be handled, but you mustn\u2019t neglect caution and just randomly hit something or throw something away.\u201d",
      "The rotting ammunition isn't just contaminating the water \u2014 it can also explode as the detonators of sea mines and unexploded aerial bombs become increasingly sensitive over time. That is a rare occurrence.",

      "Even worse, the 80-year-old ammunition is also starting to poison the marine environment: decaying fragments of TNT explosives, which are considered carcinogenic, have been discovered in the water close to old ammunition lying on the seabed. Substances derived from the explosives have been found to accumulate in marine life such as mussels and fish, according to the German environment ministry which is spearheading the clean-up efforts.",
      "While the levels of toxic substances detected were well below safety thresholds for drinking water or for marine organisms, in some cases \"concentrations approached critical levels,\u201d the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel said in a study published in February.",
      "The research institute highlighted \"the urgent need for munitions clearance to minimize long-term risks.\u201d",
      "The problem is especially pressing in the Baltic Sea because of the narrow channel connecting it to the nearby North Sea and the Atlantic, which means the polluted water doesn\u2019t circulate out of the area for decades, according to the German environment ministry.",
      "The government project doesn\u2019t just focus on cleaning the sea floor. The long-term goal is to find safe ways to recover and immediately destroy the ammunition, ideally by automated means without the help of human divers, and by burning the toxic material on a floating industrial plant at sea.",
      "The current project and three related government-sponsored projects last year that used underwater robots to screen the seafloor will help determine how such offshore facilities should be designed, said Volker Hesse, a marine engineer coordinating the program.",
      "Hesse stressed that the findings are not just important for Germany but also of great interest to other countries because old ammunition sunk in the sea is a growing problem around the world.",
      "He noted that the Black Sea is also facing the problem of contamination by ammunition from Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely a global problem \u2014 one only has to think of the crises in Vietnam or Cambodia, but also here locally in the neighboring countries, the Baltic Sea, Denmark, Poland,\" he said.",

      "Throughout the halls and grounds of the almost 1,000-year-old castle west of London, hundreds of people are working to make sure King Charles III puts on the best show possible when he welcomes U.S. President Donald Trump for his historic second state visit this week.",
      "The visit, featuring glittering tiaras, brass bands and a sumptuous banquet served on 200-year-old silver, is a display of the pomp and ceremony that Britain does like no one else. But it\u2019s a spectacle with a purpose: to bolster ties with one of the world\u2019s most powerful men at a time when his America First policies are roiling longstanding trade and security relationships.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re buttering up to him,\u201d said Robert Lacey, a royal historian and consultant on the Netflix series \u201cThe Crown.\"",
      "\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t come to Britain if he wouldn\u2019t have the chance to stay at Windsor Castle, probably pay homage to the (late) queen he admires so much, and to meet the king.\"",
      "Three centuries after Britain\u2019s kings and queens gave up political power and settled for the role of ceremonial head of state, the royals remain a robust instrument of \u201csoft power,\u201d which the elected government uses to reward friends and wring concessions out of reluctant allies.",
      "State visits are the monarchy\u2019s ultimate tool, with world leaders vying to get the full royal treatment.",
      "During seven decades on the throne, the late Queen Elizabeth II hosted everyone from Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu to South African President Nelson Mandela.",
      "The royals have also hosted the last four U.S. presidents, though not all were full-scale state visits.",
      "While the impact of soft power is hard to quantify, it contributes to a feeling of friendship that \u201cmay incline another party to be more open to your entreaties,\u201d said Martin Farr, an expert in modern British history at Newcastle University.",
      "Six years ago, Britain sought Trump\u2019s support as it prepared to leave the European Union. This time the U.K. is lobbying for favorable trade terms and help in combating Russian aggression in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cA new Trump presidency, a new prime minister, a different government, but the same sense of panic and the same feeling that the biggest lever we can pull with this president is to flatter him and to try and connect him with something he seems genuinely to be impressed by, which is monarchy, and the fact that his mother of course was born\u201d in Scotland, Farr said.",
      "So Prime Minister Keir Starmer hurried to Washington in February, just five weeks after Trump began his second term, and handed him the king\u2019s invitation for a state visit.",

      "Ghana has become the latest African country to accept third-country nationals deported by the U.S. This controversial practice has raised legal concerns",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Ghana is the latest African country that has received third-country nationals deported by the U.S. or has agreed to receive them, though the legality of the approach is being questioned.",
      "Eswatini, Rwanda and South Sudan have also taken in such deportees, and Uganda has agreed to a deal with the U.S. to take certain deported immigrants, though it hasn't yet received any.",
      "Experts have said some countries may accept the deportees to earn goodwill in negotiations with the Trump administration on policies such as trade, migration and aid.",
      "Ghanaian authorities said Monday that 14 deportees the country received last week have been returned to their home countries. Lawyers for four of the men said they were still detained in the country as of Monday evening, and the different accounts could not immediately be reconciled.",
      "The immigrants the U.S. government deported to Ghana included 13 Nigerians and one Gambian. None of them were originally from Ghana.",
      "It was not immediately clear when they arrived in Ghana. Court documents show they were awoken in the middle of the night on Sept. 5 and not told where they were going until hours into the flight on a U.S. military cargo plane.",
      "Some of the deportees had no ties with the country, nor did they designate it as a potential country of removal, according to the lawsuit they filed in U.S. through their lawyers.",
      "Ghana\u2019s Foreign Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa said his country accepted the deportees \u201cpurely on humanitarian principle\u201d and because they were fellow West Africans.",
      "\u201cWe just could not continue to take the suffering of our fellow West Africans,\u201d Ablakwa said. \u201cSo we thought that since there was a vacuum in West Africa, we should step in as part of our Pan-African credentials to take care of West Africans,\u201d he said, suggesting that Ghana agreed to the request because some other West African nations had rejected the request to receive third-country deportees.",
      "Ghana\u2019s Minister for Government Communications Felix Kwakye Ofosu told the AP on Monday that the 14 migrants \u201chave since left for their home countries,\u201d without providing further details.",
      "As of last week, the arrangement was for a bus to transport the Nigerians back home, a journey that typically takes seven to eight hours, Ghanaian President John Mahama, told reporters at the time.",
      "Nigerian officials said they were not briefed by either Ghana or U.S. about the deportations, and expressed shock that the Nigerians were sent to other countries when some citizens have been deported directly from U.S. to Nigeria.",

      "NEW YORK -- Wall Street rose to more records on Monday at the start of a week that could show whether the U.S. stock market\u2019s big recent rally has been overdone or prescient.",
      "The S&P 500 climbed 0.5% and topped its prior all-time high, which was set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 49 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.9% to its own record.",
      "Tesla helped lead the way and rose 3.6% after Elon Musk bought stock worth roughly $1 billion  through a trust. The electric vehicle company\u2019s stock price came into the day with a slight loss for the year so far, and the purchase could be a signal of Musk\u2019s faith in it.",
      "Alphabet was the single strongest force lifting the S&P 500 after gaining 4.5%, which brought the total value for Google\u2019s parent company above $3 trillion. Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple are the only other companies on Wall Street worth that much.",
      "The market\u2019s main event for the week will arrive on Wednesday. That\u2019s when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision  on interest rates, and the unanimous expectation is for the first cut of the year. Such a move could give a kickstart to the job market, which has been slowing.",
      "Stocks have already run to records on the assumption that a cut is coming on Wednesday, though. Expectations are also high that the Fed will keep lowering rates through the end of this year and into 2026. That creates the possibility for disappointment in the market, which would mean drops for stock prices, if the Fed doesn\u2019t end up slashing rates as aggressively as traders expect.",
      "That\u2019s why more attention will be on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell says in his press conference following the decision than on the decision itself. Fed officials will also release their latest projections for where they see interest rates and the economy heading in upcoming years, which could provide another potential flashpoint.",
      "What\u2019s keeping the Fed on guard is a possible jump in inflation because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. That\u2019s because lower interest rates can give inflation more fuel and send it even higher. And inflation has already proven difficult  to get under the Fed\u2019s 2% target.",
      "Another threat for Wall Street is if the job market slows too much. In that case, a recession could create a downturn in corporate profits that\u2019s steep enough to swamp the benefits that lower interest rates bring in the near term.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, has pushed angrily for cuts to interest rates. He\u2019s often attacked Powell personally, nicknaming him \u201cToo Late,\u201d and is trying to remove one of the Fed\u2019s governors  from its board.",

      "The Getting to Zero Coalition, an alliance of companies, governments and intergovernmental organizations, is asking member states of the International Maritime Organization to support adopting regulations to transition to green shipping, including the fee, when they meet in London next month. The statement was shared exclusively with The Associated Press in advance.",
      "\u201cGiven the significance of the political decision being made, we think it is important that industry voices in favor of this adoption be heard,\u201d Jesse Fahnestock, who leads decarbonization work at the Global Maritime Forum, said Monday. The forum manages the Getting to Zero Coalition.",
      "The Trump administration unequivocally rejects the proposal before the IMO and has threatened to retaliate if nations support it, setting the stage for a fight over the major climate deal. The U.S. considers the proposed regulatory framework \u201ceffectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable U.N. organization,\u201d the U.S. Secretaries of State, Commerce, Energy and Transportation said in a joint statement last month.",
      "U.S.-based shipping companies, however, have endorsed it. The Chamber of Shipping of America wants one global system, not multiple regional systems that could double charge vessels for their emissions depending on the route, said Kathy Metcalf, the chamber's president emeritus.",
      "Shipping emissions have grown over the last decade to about 3% of the global total as vessels have gotten bigger, delivering more cargo per trip and using immense amounts of fossil fuels. The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.",
      "In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of a regulatory framework to impose a minimum fee for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above certain thresholds and set a marine fuel standard to phase in cleaner fuels. The IMO aims for consensus in decision-making but, in this case, had to vote. The United States was notably absent.",
      "Now nations have to decide if the regulations will enter into force in 2027. If agreed upon, the regulations will become mandatory for large oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emit 85% of the total carbon emissions from international shipping, according to the IMO.",
      "If nations don't agree, shipping\u2019s decarbonization will be further delayed and \u201cthe chance of the sector playing a proper and fair part in the fight to keep global heating below dangerous levels will almost certainly be lost,\u201d said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition and Ocean Conservancy shipping program director.",

Abbasov said the deal reached in April was not ambitious enough, but this is an opportunity to launch the sector\u2019s decarbonization and it can be strengthened.",
      "Shipping companies want the regulations because it gives them the certainty needed to confidently make investments in cleaner technologies, such as fuels that are alternatives to fossil fuels and the ships that run on them.

Officials said there were over 100 storm-related deaths in the state.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful for every federal dollar that we have received because it brings us closer to recovery.

      "If Judge Gregory Carro permits the state case to go forward, Mangione\u2019s lawyers have said they want him to dismiss terrorism charges and bar prosecutors from using evidence collected during Mangione\u2019s arrest last December, including a 9 mm handgun and a notebook in which authorities say he described his intent to \u201cwack\u201d an insurance executive.",
      "Prosecutors want the judge to force Mangione\u2019s lawyers to state whether they\u2019ll pursue an insanity defense or introduce psychiatric evidence of any mental disease or defect he may have.",
      "Carro could either rule on those requests on Tuesday, schedule additional hearings or issue written decisions at a later date.",
      "Mangione has pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of murder, including murder as an act of terrorism, in the Dec. 4, 2024, killing. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind as he arrived for an investor conference at the New York Hilton Midtown. Police say \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase commonly used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.",
      "Mangione was arrested five days later after he was spotted eating breakfast at a McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of New York City and whisked to Manhattan by plane and helicopter. Since then, he has been held at the same Brooklyn federal jail where Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs is locked up.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office contends that there are no double jeopardy issues because neither of Mangione\u2019s cases has gone to trial and because the state and federal prosecutions involve different legal theories.",

      "The state charges, which carry a maximum of life in prison, allege that Mangione wanted to \u201cintimidate or coerce a civilian population,\u201d that is, insurance employees and investors. The federal charges allege that Mangione stalked Thompson and do not involve terror allegations.",

      "Rivian Automotive is starting to build a long-delayed electric vehicle plant in Georgia, despite tough challenges in the U.S. market",
      "ATLANTA -- It seems like a terrible time to build an electric vehicle plant in the United States, but Rivian Automotive leaders say they're confident as the company starts long-delayed work on a $5 billion facility in Georgia.",
      "The money-losing California-based company breaks ground Tuesday east of Atlanta despite President Donald Trump\u2019s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.",
      "Rivian Chief Policy Officer Alan Hoffman said the company believes it can sell electric vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because they're superior.",
      "\u201cWe did not build this company based upon federal tax incentives,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to prove that we\u2019re going to be successful in the future.\u201d",
      "The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian\u2019s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S sport utility vehicle in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.",
      "The Illinois plant will begin making smaller R2 SUVs next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. The company has said the Georgia operation will be able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028. It plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.",
      "The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it\u2019s limiting production now in part to launch 2026 models.",
      "\u201cFor Rivian, it\u2019s do-or-die time,\u201d said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. \u201cWe saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can\u2019t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.\u201d",
      "Sales growth is slowing for electric vehicles in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025's first half, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. electric vehicle sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors' slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.",
      "But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful of the startup automakers.",
      "The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But the competition now includes Ford\u2019s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.",
      "After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025\u2019s first half.",
      "At the same time, some automakers\u2019 ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram\u2019s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles at a suburban Detroit plant.",

      "Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can\u2019t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.",
      "Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who has said he wants to make Georgia \u201cthe electric mobility capital of America,\u201d acknowledges Rivian faces bumps, but says he remains confident the company can fulfill its promises.",
      "While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia\u2019s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.",
      "Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden's administration in November agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's hostility toward EVs, Hoffman said Rivian hopes the U.S. Department of Energy will distribute the loan money, arguing it will boost domestic manufacturing.",
      "Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbor to farms and will pollute the groundwater.",
      "\u201cI planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?\u201d asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.",
      "There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Hoffman says Rivian is \u201cin this for the long haul.\u201d",

      "The Federal Reserve is facing economic uncertainty and political pressure as it meets this week to decide whether to cut interest rates",
      "WASHINGTON -- In a sign of how unusual this week's Federal Reserve meeting is, the decision it will make on interest rates \u2014 usually the main event \u2014 is just one of the key unknowns to be resolved when officials gather Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "For now, it's not even clear who will be there. The meeting will likely include Lisa Cook, an embattled governor, unless an appeals court or the Supreme Court rules in favor of an effort by President Donald Trump to remove her from office. And it will probably include Stephen Miran, a top White House economic aide whom Trump has nominated to fill an empty seat on the Fed's board. But those questions may not be resolved until late Monday.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. economy is mired in uncertainty. Hiring has slowed sharply, while inflation remains stubbornly high.",
      "So a key question for the Fed is: Do they worry more about people who are out of work and struggling to find jobs, or do they focus more on the struggles many Americans face in keeping up with rising costs for groceries and other items? The Fed's mandate from Congress requires it to seek both stable prices and full employment.",
      "For now, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed policymakers have signaled the Fed is more concerned about weaker hiring, a key reason investors expect the central bank will reduce its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point on Wednesday to about 4.1%.",
      "Still, stubbornly high inflation may force them to proceed slowly and limit how many reductions they make. The central bank will also release its quarterly economic projections Wednesday, and economists project they will show that policymakers expect one or two additional cuts this year, plus several more next year.",
      "Ellen Meade, an economics professor at Duke University and former senior economist at the Fed, said it's a stark contrast to the early pandemic, when it was clear the Fed had to rapidly reduce rates to boost the economy. And when inflation surged in 2021 and 2022, it was also a straightforward call for the Fed, which moved quickly to raise borrowing costs to combat higher prices.",
      "But now, \u201cit\u2019s a tough time,\u201d Meade said. \u201cIt would be a tough time, even if the politics and the whole thing weren\u2019t going on the way they are, it would be a tough time. Some people would want to cut, some people would not want to cut.\u201d",
      "Amid all the economic uncertainty, Trump is applying unprecedented political pressure on the Fed, demanding sharply lower rates, seeking to fire Cook, and insulting Powell, whom he has called a \u201cnumbskull,\u201d \u201cfool,\u201d and \u201cmoron.\u201d",
      "Loretta Mester, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, said that Fed officials won't let the criticisms sway their decisions on policy. Still, the attacks are unfortunate, she said, because they threaten to undermine the Fed's credibility with the public.",
      "\u201cAdded to their list of the difficulty of making policy because of how the economy is performing, they also have to contend with the fact that there may be some of the public that\u2019s skeptical about how they\u2019ve gone about making their decisions,\u201d she said.",
      "David Andolfatto, an economics professor at the University of Miami and former top economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said that presidents have pressured Fed chairs before, but never as personally or publicly.",

      "There are typically 12 officials who vote on the Fed's policies at each meeting \u2014 the seven members of the Fed's board of governors, as well as five of the 12 regional bank presidents, who vote on a rotating basis.",
      "If a court rules that Cook can be fired, or Miran isn't approved in time, then just 11 officials will vote on Wednesday. Either way, there ought to be enough votes to approve a quarter-point cut, but there could be an unusual amount of division.",
      "Miran, if he is on the board, and Governor Michelle Bowman may dissent in opposition to a quarter-point reduction in favor of a steeper half-point cut.",
      "There could be additional dissenting votes in the other direction, potentially from regional bank presidents who might oppose any cuts at all. Beth Hammack, president of the Fed's Cleveland branch, and Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, have both expressed concern that inflation has topped the Fed's 2% targer for more than four years and is still elevated. If either votes against a cut, it would be the first time there were dissents in both directions from a Fed decision since 2019.",
      "\u201cThis degree of division is unusual, but the circumstances are unusual, too,\" Andolfatto said. \u201cThis is a situation central banks really don\u2019t like: The combination of inflationary pressure and labor market weakness.\u201d",
      "Hiring has slowed in recent months, with employers shedding 13,000 jobs in June and adding just 22,000 in August, the government reported earlier this month. And last week a preliminary report from the Labor Department showed that companies added far fewer jobs in the year ending in March than previously estimated.",
      "At the same time, inflation picked up a bit last month and remains above the Fed's 2% target. According to the consumer price index, core prices \u2014 excluding food and energy \u2014 rose 3.1% in August compared with a year earlier..",
      "With inflation still elevated, the Fed may have to proceed slowly with any further cuts, which would likely further frustrate the Trump White House.",
      "\u201cWhen you get to turning points, people can reasonably disagree about when to go,\u201d Meade said.",

      "The world\u2019s fondness for matcha is about to be tested by steep price increases",
      "The world\u2019s fondness for matcha is about to be tested by steep price increases.",
      "Global demand for the powdered tea has skyrocketed around the world, fueled by consumer interest in its health benefits and by the bright green matcha lattes bubbling up on social media. In the U.S., retail sales of matcha are up 86% from three years ago, according to NIQ, a market research firm.",
      "But the matcha market is troubled. In Japan, one of the biggest matcha producers, poor weather reduced this year\u2019s harvest. Matcha is still plentiful in China, another major producer, but labor shortages and high demand have also raised prices there.",
      "For Americans, there\u2019s the added impact of tariffs. Imports from China are currently subject to a 37.5% tariff, while the U.S. has a 15% tariff on imports from Japan. It\u2019s not clear if tea will be exempted from tariffs because it\u2019s a natural product that\u2019s not grown in significant quantities in the U.S. \u2014 an accommodation that the Trump administration has made for cork from the European Union. The Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative didn\u2019t respond to messages left by The Associated Press.",
      "Aaron Vick, a senior tea buyer with California-based tea importer G.S. Haly, says he paid 75% more for the highest-grade 2025 crop of Japanese matcha, which will arrive in the U.S. later this fall. He expects lower grades of matcha to cost 30% to 50% more. Chinese matcha \u2014 while generally cheaper than Japanese matcha \u2014 is also getting more expensive because of high demand, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople should expect an enormous increase in the price of matcha this year,\u201d Vick said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bit of a tough ride for matcha devotees. They will have to show the depth of their commitment at the cash register.\u201d",
      "Even before this year\u2019s harvest, growing demand was straining matcha supplies. Making matcha is precise and labor intensive. Farmers grow tencha \u2014 a green tea leaf \u2014 in the shade. In the spring, the leaves are harvested, steamed, de-stemmed and de-veined and then stone ground into a fine powder. Tencha can be harvested again in the summer and fall, but the later harvests are generally of lower quality.",
      "There are ways to cut corners, like using a jet mill, which grinds the leaves with high pressure air. But Japan has other issues, including a rapidly aging workforce and limited tencha production. And despite Japanese agricultural ministry trying to coax tea growers to switch to tencha from regular green tea, many are reluctant to do so, concerned that the matcha boom will fade.",
      "That\u2019s giving an opening to China, where matcha originated but fell out of favor in the 14th century. Chinese matcha production has been growing in recent years to meet both domestic and international demand.",
      "Chinese matcha has historically been considered inferior to Japanese matcha and used as a flavoring for things like matcha-flavored KitKat bars instead of as a drinking tea. But the quality is improving, according to Jason Walker, the marketing director at Firsd Tea, the New Jersey-based U.S. subsidiary of Zhejiang Tea Group, China\u2019s largest tea exporter.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing more and more interest in Chinese matcha because of capacity issues and changing perception,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt used to be the idea that it has to be Japanese matcha or nothing. But we have a good product too.\u201d",
      "Starbucks is among the companies using matcha from China for its lattes. The company said it also sources matcha from Japan and South Korea. Dunkin' and Dutch Bros. didn't respond when asked where they source the matcha.",
      "Josh Mordecai, the supply chain director for London-based tea supplier Good & Proper Tea, said he is approached almost daily by Chinese matcha suppliers. For now, he only buys matcha from Japan, but the cost to acquire it has risen 40% so he\u2019ll have to raise prices, he said.",

Millennials and Generation Z customers are more likely to have tried matcha than others, Mills said.",
      "The traditional way of preparing it, whisking the powder together with hot water in a small bowl, also appeals to drinkers who want to slow down and be more intentional, Mills said.",

      "The Trump administration filed a response just ahead of a 3 p.m. Eastern deadline Sunday to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, arguing that Cook\u2019s legal arguments for why she should stay on the job were meritless. Lawyers for Cook argued in a Saturday filing that the Trump administration has not shown sufficient cause to fire her, and stressed the risks to the economy and country if the president were allowed to fire a Fed governor without proper cause.",
      "Sunday\u2019s filing is the latest step in an unprecedented effort by the White House to shape the historically independent Fed. Cook\u2019s firing marks the first time in the central bank\u2019s 112-year history that a president has tried to fire a governor.",
      "\u201cThe public and the executive share an interest in ensuring the integrity of the Federal Reserve,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers argued in Sunday\u2019s filing. \u201cAnd that requires respecting the president\u2019s statutory authority to remove governors \u2018for cause\u2019 when such cause arises.\u201d",
      "Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has accused Cook of signing separate documents in which she allegedly said that both the Atlanta property and a home in Ann Arbor, Michigan, also purchased in June 2021, were both \u201cprimary residences.\u201d Pulte submitted a criminal referral to the Justice Department, which has opened an investigation.",

      "NEW YORK -- In the days following the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous workers have been fired for their comments on his death, among them MSNBC political analyst Matthew Dowd.",
      "Several conservative activists have sought to identify social media users whose posts about Kirk they viewed as offensive or celebratory, targeting everyone from journalists to teachers. Right-wing influencer Laura Loomer said she would try to ruin the professional aspirations of anyone who celebrated Kirk\u2019s death.",
      "It's far from the first time workers have lost their jobs over things they say publicly \u2014 including in social media posts. But the speed at which the firings have been happening raises questions about worker rights versus employer rights.",
      "In the U.S., laws can vary across states, but overall, there\u2019s very little legal protections for employees who are punished for speech made both in and out of private workplaces.",
      "\u201cMost people think they have a right to free speech\u2026but that doesn\u2019t necessarily apply in the workplace,\u201d said Vanessa Matsis-McCready, associate general counsel and vice president of HR Services for Engage PEO. \u201cMost employees in the private sector do not have any protections for that type of speech at work.\u201d",
      "Add to that the prevalence of social media, which has made it increasingly common to track employees\u2019 conduct outside of work and to dox people, or publish information about them online with the intent of harming or harassing them.",
      "Protections for workers vary from one state to the next. For example, in New York, if an employee is participating in a weekend political protest, but not associating themselves with the organization that employs them, their employer cannot fire them for that activity when they return to work.",
      "But if that same employee is at a company event on a weekend and talks about their political viewpoints in a way that makes others feel unsafe or the target of discrimination or harassment, then they could face consequences at work, Matsis-McCready said.",
      "Most of the U.S. defaults to \u201cat-will\u201d employment law \u2014 which essentially means employers can choose to hire and fire as they see fit, including over employees' speech.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment does not apply in private workplaces to protect employees\u2019 speech,\" said Andrew Kragie, an attorney who specializes in employment and labor law at Maynard Nexsen. \"It actually does protect employers\u2019 right to make decisions about employees, based on employees\u2019 speech.\u201d",
      "Kragie said there are \u201cpockets of protection\u201d around the U.S. under various state laws, such as statutes that forbid punishing workers for their political views. But the interpretation of how that gets enforced changes, he notes, making the waters murky.",
      "Steven T. Collis, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin and faculty director of the school\u2019s Bech-Loughlin First Amendment Center, also points to some state laws that say employers can\u2019t fire their workers for \u201clegal off duty conduct.\u201d But there\u2019s often an exception for conduct seen as disruptive to an employer\u2019s business or reputation, which could be grounds to fire someone over public comments or social media posts.",
      "\u201cIn this scenario, if somebody feels like one of their employees has done something that suggests they are glorifying or celebrating a murder, an employer might still be able to fire them even with one of those laws on the books,\u201d Collis said.",
      "For public employees, which can range from school teachers and postal workers to elected officials, the process is a bit different. That\u2019s because the First Amendment plays a unique role when the government is the employer, Collis explains. The Supreme Court has ruled that if an employee is acting in a private capacity but speaking on a matter of public concern, they could be protected. Still, he noted that government employers can discipline a worker if they determine such conduct will interfere with the government\u2019s ability to do its job.",
      "Some in the public sector have already worked to restrict speech in the aftermath of Kirk's death. For instance, leaders at the Pentagon unveiled a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for any posts or comments from troops that make light of or celebrate the killing of Kirk.",
      "The policy, announced by the Pentagon\u2019s top spokesman Sean Parnell on social media Thursday, came hours after numerous conservative military influencers and activists began forwarding posts they considered problematic to Parnell and his boss, defense secretary Pete Hegseth.",

      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize when they\u2019re on social media, it is the town square,\u201d said Amy Dufrane, CEO of the Human Resource Certification Institute. \u201cThey\u2019re not having a private conversation with the neighbor over the fence. They\u2019re really broadcasting their views.\u201d",
      "Political debates are certainly not limited to social media and are increasingly making their way into the workplace as well.",
      "\u201cThe gamification of the way we communicate in the workplace, Slack and Teams, chat and all these things, they\u2019re very similar to how you might interact on Instagram or other social media, so I do think that makes it feel a little less formal and somebody might be more inclined to take to take a step and say, 'Oh, I can\u2019t believe this happened,'\u201d Matsis-McCready said.",
      "In the tense, divided climate of the U.S., many human resource professionals have expressed that they're unprepared to address politically charged discussions in the workplace, according to the Human Resource Certification Institute. But those conversations are going to happen, so employers need to set policies about what is acceptable or unacceptable workplace conduct, Dufrane said.",
      "\u201cHR has got to really drill down and make sure that they\u2019re super clear on their policies and practices and communicating to their employees on what are their responsibilities as an employee of the organization,\u201d Dufrane said.",
      "Many employers are reviewing their policies on political speech and providing training about what appropriate conduct looks like, both inside and outside the organization, she said. And the brutal nature of Kirk's killing may have led some of them to react more strongly in the days that followed his death.",
      "\u201cBecause of the violent nature of what some political discussion is now about, I think there is a real concern from employers that they want to keep the workplace safe and that they\u2019re being extra vigilant about anything that could be viewed as a threat, which is their duty,\u201d Matsis-McCreedy said.",
      "Employees can also be seen as ambassadors of a company\u2019s brand, and their political speech can dilute that brand and hurt its reputation, depending on what is being said and how it is being received. That is leading more companies to act on what employees are saying online, she said.",
      "\u201cSome of the individuals that had posted and their posts went viral, all of a sudden the phone lines of their employers were just nonstop calls complaining,\u201d Matsis-McCready said.",
      "Still, experts like Collis don\u2019t anticipate a significant change in how employers monitor their workers speech \u2014 noting that online activity has come under the spotlight for at least the last 15 years.",
      "\u201cEmployers are already and have been for a very long time, vetting employees based on what they\u2019re posting on social media,\u201d he said.",

That haul marks the biggest domestic opening ever for an anime film, surpassing \u201cPok\u00e9mon: The First Movie,\u201d which opened with $31 million in 1999.",
      "The film extended its meteoric run, scoring the biggest anime opening of all time with a $132.1 million weekend, according to Comscore. Crunchyroll and Sony rolled it out across North America and 49 international markets, pushing the global total to $177.8 million.",
      "\u201cThis performance by this particular film shows the unpredictability of the box office,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIf we were sitting here, let\u2019s say a month or even a couple of weeks ago, would we be thinking, \u2018Wow, a Japanese anime film would be number one at the box office, overperform and bring in $70 million?\u2019 If you predicted that, kudos to you.\u201d",
      "The movie is the first in a three-film trilogy that brings the hit Shonen saga to its climactic showdown. The story follows Tanjiro Kamado, a kind-hearted boy who takes up swordsmanship after his family is slaughtered and his sister, Nezuko, is turned into a demon. Together, they fight a supernatural underworld of monstrous foes while clinging to what\u2019s left of their humanity.",

      "Gov. Newsom championed it as crucial facing Trump\u2019s environmental rollbacks.",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration\u2019s environmental rollbacks.",
      "The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state's cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.",
      "The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.",
      "Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year.",
      "\u201cAfter months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution \u2014 all while fast-tracking California\u2019s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,\u201d Newsom said after striking the deal this week.",
      "The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state's climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to \u201ccap and invest\" to emphasize its funding of climate programs.",
      "The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program's revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state's long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.",
      "The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state\u2019s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state's refining capacity, according to energy regulators.",
      "Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program's future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration's attacks on climate programs, including the state's first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.",
      "Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said the extension balanced the state's ambitious emission-reduction and affordability goals. The Democrat called cap and trade \u201cthe cornerstone of our climate strategy.\u201d",
      "But environmental justice advocates opposing the proposal say it doesn't go far enough and lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.",
      "\u201cThis really continues to allow big oil to reduce their emissions on paper instead of in real life,\u201d said Asha Sharma, state policy manager at the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability.",
      "GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.",

      "Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is asking a U.S. appeals court to reject the Trump administration's latest bid to remove her from her post ahead of the central bank's next vote on interest rates.",
      "In a filing with the court Saturday, attorneys on behalf of Cook asked the court to refuse an emergency request by the Trump administration for a stay of a lower court ruling that would clear the way for President Donald Trump to remove Cook from the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors.",
      "Lawyers for Cook argue that the Trump administration has not shown sufficient cause to fire her, and stressed the risks to the economy and country if the president were allowed to fire a Fed governor without cause.",
      "\u201cA stay by this court would therefore be the first signal from the courts that our system of government is no longer able to guarantee the independence of the Federal Reserve. Nothing would then stop the president from firing other members of the board on similarly flimsy pretexts. The era of Fed independence would be over. The risks to the nation\u2019s economy could be dire,\u201d according to the filing.",
      "The court has given the Trump administration the option to respond to Cook's filing by 3 p.m. Eastern on Sunday.",
      "At stake is whether the Trump administration will succeed in its extraordinary effort to shape the board before the Fed\u2019s interest rate-setting committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday. At the same time, Senate Republicans are pushing to confirm Stephen Miran, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to an open spot on the Fed\u2019s board, which could happen as soon as Monday.",
      "Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud because she appeared to claim two properties as \u201cprimary residences\u201d in July 2021, before she joined the board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home.",

      "If the Trump administration's appeal succeeds, Cook would be removed from the Fed\u2019s board until her case is ultimately resolved in the courts, and she would miss next week\u2019s Fed meeting, when the central bank is set to decide whether to reduce its key interest rate.",

      "Vikings quarterback J",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Trailing by nine and facing third-and-1 deep in their own end early in the fourth quarter, the Vikings put their trust in quarterback J.J. McCarthy. However, his deep pass down the left sideline sailed five yards beyond an open Jalen Nailor\u2019s grasp and the Vikings were forced to punt.",
      "It was one miscue on a night filled with them for McCarthy and the Vikings, who in two games have ridden the highs and lows of having a first-year starter at quarterback.",
      "One week after leading a fourth-quarter comeback in Chicago that earned him NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors, McCarthy struggled mightily in his first game in front of Vikings fans. McCarthy completed 11 of 21 passes for 158 yards, was sacked six times and committed three turnovers in the Vikings\u2019 22-6 loss to the Falcons on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cThis is unfortunate, but I know we have a great ... culture (in the) locker room and that we\u2019re going to respond from this,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to learn and get better and bounce back next week.\u201d",
      "Playing most of the game without two of their starting offensive linemen, the Vikings' offense looked disjointed all night. They rushed for just 78 yards, allowed regular pressure on McCarthy and couldn\u2019t make a big play when it mattered most.",
      "For instance, the only time they got the ball into the red zone came early in the second quarter. McCarthy and Nailor hooked up for 17 yards to get the ball down to the Atlanta 2-yard line. But then a fumble, a delay of game penalty and a sack derailed any hopes of finding the end zone.",
      "\u201cThat right there in a nutshell is what the night kind of was,\u201d Vikings coach Kevin O\u2019Connell said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nobody that\u2019s going to fix those things besides our coaches and players.\u201d",
      "Atlanta led 12-6 through three quarters, but Vikings fans had to be hoping for more fourth-quarter magic from McCarthy when Minnesota took over at midfield with 15 minutes left. But on the first play of the quarter, McCarthy was sacked by Zach Harrison and fumbled the ball. The Falcons recovered, added a field goal to make it a two-score game and never looked back.",
      "McCarthy also threw two interceptions and missed a handful of open receivers in big moments, including the deep shot to Nailor on third-and-1 on the first possession after his fumble. But O\u2019Connell saw more good than bad in McCarthy\u2019s performance.",

      "\u201cYou go from feeling like you\u2019ve just escaped after our errors,\u201d said Bo Nix, who threw three touchdown passes in the first half. \u201cI always hate putting the game in the officials\u2019 hands. We gave them an opportunity, and they called it at the end. Sometimes, it just doesn\u2019t go your way.\u201d",
      "The leverage rule says a player can't use a teammate or opponent to vault himself into the air to try and block a kick.",
      "Regardless of Tillman's intent, that's how the officiating crew saw it.",
      "\u201cAs a defender, you're not allowed to place your hand on an opponent or a teammate and push off to propel yourself into the air to block a kick,\u201d referee Craig Wrolstad told a pool reporter. \u201cIn this case, No. 92 (Tillman) came across the line to the right guard and he puts his hand on the right guard and pushed off him to elevate himself in order to block the kick. You're not allowed to do that.\u201d",
      "There's bound to be plenty of chatter about whether the officials were right to penalize Tillman. But the Broncos certainly had plenty of chances to put away a game that featured only three punts \u2014 all by Denver.",

The 15-yard penalty set up an easy, game-ending 29-yarder.",
      "This time, with the Colts needing a field goal to win, coach Shane Steichen played it conservatively.",

His previous career long was 45 yards, and the franchise record of 58 has stood since 1962.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A barechested Bryce Harper poured a bottle of Champagne over his head, soaking in the Philadelphia Phillies' second consecutive NL East title.",
      "Kyle Schwarber celebrated by chugging beer out of a hose as his teammates fed the contraption in the middle of a darkened visitors' clubhouse after the Phillies rallied for a wild 6-5 victory in 10 innings over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday night.",
      "\u201cYou've got to enjoy this,\u201d Schwarber said later, puffing on a fat cigar. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen all the time.\u201d",
      "The Phillies hope it keeps happening all the way through October as they chase the franchise's third World Series crown and first since 2008.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re playing really good baseball right now and just got to keep going and keep understanding we've got a bigger picture,\u201d Harper said. \u201cWe've got things on our mind that we want to win.\u201d",
      "Philadelphia was already assured its fourth straight National League playoff berth on Sunday, when the San Francisco Giants lost to the Dodgers.",
      "And with the second-place New York Mets idle Monday, the Phillies needed a win to become the first division champion in the majors this season. They blew three one-run leads before finally getting past the NL West-leading Dodgers for their ninth victory in 11 games, opening a 12 1/2-game lead over the Mets in the NL East with 11 to play.",
      "Philadelphia had just one hit \u2014 Schwarber's 53rd homer \u2014 until the seventh inning. But then Weston Wilson and Harper homered as Philly rallied against the defending World Series champions.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re just tough and they\u2019re resilient,\u201d Phillies manager Rob Thomson said about his team. \u201cThey just keep fighting and I\u2019m proud of them. This is a really special group.\u201d",
      "After the Dodgers' Max Muncy grounded out to end it, the Phillies gathered near the mound to celebrate. They posed for a photo on the field as red-clad fans cheered behind their dugout at Dodger Stadium.",
      "Then the party was on.",
      "It was the earliest division clinch in Phillies history, two days sooner than the 2011 team that won the NL East on Sept. 17. This squad got it done in Game 151, second-fastest behind those 2011 Phillies who did it in Game 150.",

      "\u201cI feel like we\u2019ve done such a great job this year,\u201d Schwarber said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of really big injuries happen to us and we just have that next-man-up mentality. I felt like guys came up, they stepped up right away and they got the job done. That\u2019s how you win big baseball games.\u201d",

      "They lost ace right-hander Zack Wheeler when he went on the injured list a month ago with a blood clot in his right shoulder. Wheeler was 10-5 with a 2.71 ERA in 24 starts when he was sidelined, but Philadelphia's pitching depth has allowed the team to absorb such a huge loss.",
      "It certainly helped that the Phillies acquired closer Jhoan Duran and center fielder Harrison Bader from Minnesota at the trade deadline.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a little bit different than we have been in the past,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cWe can do some things. We\u2019re going to slug but we also can play some small ball to win games, too. It\u2019s a good balance.\u201d",
      "All-Star shortstop Trea Turner (right hamstring strain) and third baseman Alec Bohm (left shoulder inflammation) are both on the IL. Thomson said Bohm could return later this week at Arizona, while Turner could be back in time for the final homestand of the regular season.",
      "The victory made Thomson the third manager in franchise history to win consecutive division titles, joining Charlie Manuel (2007-11) and Danny Ozark (1976-78). Thomson is the fourth manager in Major League Baseball history to reach the postseason in each of his first four full seasons. Among the other three is Dodgers skipper Dave Roberts.",
      "\u201cI don't feel 62 right now,\u201d Thomson said. \u201cThe last four years has been the most fun I\u2019ve had in baseball. It's because of the guys. They have a lot of fun.\u201d ___",

      "TOKYO -- Armand \u201cMondo\u201d Duplantis traded handshakes and hugs with the pole vaulters he'd just beaten to capture his third world championship.",
      "He took a leisurely walk toward the stands to talk to his parents, his brother, his fiancee.",
      "Then, like any great performer in a jam-packed stadium, he turned around, walked back onstage and delivered the encore the people had been waiting for.",
      "It was another world record \u2014 the 14th time he's set it \u2014 by clearing the bar at 6.30 meters.",
      "Duplantis cleared it on his third and final attempt Monday night in Tokyo. It came more than a half hour after the racing on Day 3 of the championships was wrapped up for the evening. But nobody in the crowd of 53,000 would dare walk out on Mondo. And Mondo made a point of wringing every drop of drama out of an experience few in that crowd will soon forget.",
      "\u201cTo be able to enjoy this world record with them and give them that is super special,\u201d Duplantis said. \u201cEspecially considering the last time I was in this stadium, we didn\u2019t have any spectators. It was spooky and eerie and super weird, and not very fun, honestly.\u201d",
      "The night of his last performance at Japan National Stadium was during the COVID Olympics, held a year late in 2021 and without any fans. Duplantis settled for \u201conly\u201d the gold medal that time and missed the world record. The difference, he suspects, was the energy missing during those silent Games.",
      "This time, there was noise and fun \u2014 the people clapping in rhythm every time Duplantis lined up \u2014 and like any great artist, Mondo knew how to play to the crowd.",
      "After clearing 6.10, for instance, he imitated Japanese baseball Hall of Famer Ichiro Suzuki's pre-bat sleeve-tugging routine.",
      "\u201cMy brother was in the crowd and he plays baseball, so I was trying to fire him up,\u201d Duplantis said. \u201cAnd the Japanese people, if they understood it, it was just something fun.\u201d",
      "The Louisiana-born phenom who competes for his mother's native Sweden collected $70,000 for the win \u2014 his 49th straight dating to September 2022 \u2014 along with the $100,000 bonus that goes to record breakers at world championships.",
      "The money isn't the main motivation for a champion who has won every major title \u2014 worlds and Olympics \u2014 since the Tokyo Games.",
      "\u201cIt's doing what I know I'm capable of,\u201d Duplantis said. \u201cMotivation-wise, it's not that much of a problem. I know the level I can compete at, and I kind of demand that out of myself.\u201d",
      "It's hard to blame the crowd for expecting it, too. Duplantis started breaking records on Feb. 8, 2020, and has broken them on three continents and, now, in nine counties. This latest feat puts the height at an even 6.30.",
      "\u201cSix-three sounds really nice, really clean, a new barrier for our sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sounds better than 6.29, for sure.\u201d",
      "But maybe not as good as 6.31.",
      "Duplantis has, in fact, wondered if 6.5 might be in his future.",

      "Bubka's final record was 6.14, and after France's Renaud Lavillenie topped that once, Duplantis took over. He has improved the record by one centimeter every time, giving him maximum opportunities to pocket bonuses like the one he'll receive from World Athletics for this one.",

      "NAPA, Calif. -- What was looked upon as a Ryder Cup training camp for the American team turned into a typical week for Scottie Scheffler.",
      "Scheffler wanted to stay sharp ahead of the Sept. 26-28 matches at Bethpage Black. The world's No. 1 player looked every bit of that Sunday in the Procore Championship when he closed with a 5-under 67 for a one-shot victory over Ben Griffin.",
      "It was his sixth PGA Tour title of the year. Scheffler joined Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer as the only players since 1960 to win at least six times in consecutive seasons.",
      "\u201cThis was a week in which I was playing a new golf course, a golf course that was pretty challenging to play for the first time,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cDid a really good job of kind of staying in the tournament the first two days and then the last two I played some really good golf in order to be in this position.\u201d",
      "He made up an eight-shot deficit on Griffin on the weekend with rounds of 64-67 and finished at 19-under 269. The victory pushed his season total to just over $27.6 million.",
      "Silverado had its strongest field and largest gallery since the tournament moved to Napa in 2014. And it got quite a show under a blazing sun when Scheffler and Griffin went down to the wire until Griffin came up one putt short.",
      "Griffin, a two-time winner this year who will make his Ryder Cup debut at Bethpage Black, had a 60-foot eagle putt for the win on the par-5 18th hole. He left that lag about 5 feet short, and the birdie putt to force a playoff caught the left lip. He shot a 70.",
      "\u201cI felt like I just wasn't quite as sharp from short range as I needed to be,\u201d said Griffin, who has finished runner-up to Scheffler twice this year. \u201cBut I\u2019ll get to work this next week and hopefully make every single one of them at the Ryder Cup.\u201d",
      "Scheffler was one of the players who earlier in the year targeted the Procore Championship as a good spot for the Ryder Cup team to play so they could avoid the mistake of two years ago when all but two of them had a month off before the Rome matches.",

      "\u201cWe floated the idea of doing a scouting trip to Bethpage or coming here and playing this event. We felt it would be a little bit more valuable to get all the guys together here this week to play tournament golf in order to stay in shape,\u201d Scheffler said.",

      "Cincinnati Bengals coach Zac Taylor has confirmed that quarterback Joe Burrow will have surgery on his injured left toe",
      "CINCINNATI -- Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow will have surgery on his injured left toe, coach Zac Taylor confirmed Monday.",
      "\u201cWe are working through the details and timelines. We will go through the week and get all the information we can,\u201d Taylor said during an afternoon news conference.",
      "Taylor did not have a timeline for when Burrow will have surgery or how long the franchise quarterback might be out. The turf toe injury is expected to sideline Burrow a minimum of three months.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what a toe rehab looks like,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI know Joe\u2019s gonna give it everything he\u2019s got. He\u2019s gonna do everything he can to get onto the field.\u201d",
      "It is Burrow\u2019s third major injury in his six seasons since being the top overall pick in the 2020 draft and a major blow to Cincinnati, which is off to its first 2-0 start since 2018 and has postseason aspirations after missing the playoffs the past two seasons.",
      "Burrow left the Bengals\u2019 locker room on crutches and wearing a boot on his left foot on Sunday after injuring his toe during the second quarter of Cincinnati\u2019s 31-27 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
      "Burrow was sacked by Jaguars defensive tackle Arik Armstead for a 5-yard loss at the Bengals 35-yard line with 9:02 remaining in the first half. It was the second time Burrow had been sacked in the game.",
      "Burrow went into the sideline medical tent. He came out and walked briefly with a limp before heading to the locker room.",
      "Guard Dalton Risner, who was beaten by Armstead on the sack, took some of the blame for Burrow's injury when he met with reporters on Monday",
      "\u201cThat one play has really been devastating for me because I got beat on the play,\u201d Risner said. \u201cI think he got tackled by two or three guys, but I know my guy was in on the tackle. It just makes your stomach hurt. ... I don\u2019t think I did a good enough job on that play to keep him safe and healthy.\u201d",
      "Burrow led the league last season with 4,918 passing yards and 43 TD passes.",
      "He has been sacked 201 times in six seasons, the second most in the league since 2020. His latest injury again puts the Bengals' front office in the spotlight for electing to give high-value contracts to wide receivers Tee Higgins and Ja'Marr Chase without properly addressing the offensive line.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how a turf toe injury fully happens, if you get hit or stepped on. I know that potentially he could have been clean for 99% of the game, and the one play is where this happens,\u201d Taylor said.",
      "\u201cI get it. I understand where people are going to come from. They're going to be very attacking of us. Our style of play got us to a Super Bowl, two AFC championship games and two division titles, and won a lot of games for us. We\u2019re always evaluating how we can protect our players and put them in the best position possible.\u201d",
      "Burrow\u2019s injury comes at an inopportune time for the Bengals, who play at Minnesota next week to begin a stretch of five straight opponents that made the playoffs last year.",
      "The Vikings also have an injured quarterback. Carson Wentz is expected to start after J.J. McCarthy sprained his right ankle during the second half of Minnesota\u2019s 22-6 loss to Atlanta on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re 2-0 and we\u2019ve got a lot of good energy right now,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThere are plenty of things to clean up. We haven\u2019t put our best foot forward or put together our best football collectively.\u201d",
      "Jake Browning will be the starter in Burrow\u2019s absence. Against the Jaguars, Browning completed 21 of 32 passes for 241 yards with two touchdowns and three interceptions. He also scored the go-ahead touchdown with 18 seconds remaining on a 1-yard leap.",
      "\u201cWe have a ton of confidence in Jake. He proved that (Sunday),\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe're excited for Jake to go there and play. He\u2019s earned the right to be in the spotlight.\u201d",
      "Brett Rypien is likely to be called up from the practice squad when Burrow gets placed on injured reserve, but Taylor said the team would look for another QB to add to the active roster or the practice squad.",

      "Tyler Allgeier added 13 carries for 67 yards with a late touchdown run against a Vikings defense that admirably kept the game close all night while the offense crossed midfield just three times and only once got inside the 20.",
      "\u201cFor us to be balling like that throughout the whole game, it was pretty cool to see,\u201d said Robinson, who helped the Falcons (1-1) keep the pressure off quarterback Michael Penix Jr. and keep the crowd noise from being a factor after the first quarter.",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s selfless. He\u2019ll do whatever it takes to win, which is exactly what he did tonight,\u201d coach Raheem Morris said.",
      "Robinson and Allgeier thrived all night behind a fired-up offensive line, culminating in a 12-play, 83-yard drive that took 6:17 off the clock down the stretch. In an opening loss to Tampa Bay, Robinson had only 24 yards on 12 rushes, though he caught six passes for 100 yards.",
      "McCarthy, the first-time starter taken two picks after Penix in the 2024 draft whose rookie year was lost to a knee injury, overcame an interception return for a score in his debut at Chicago by leading the team to three fourth-quarter touchdowns. There was no late magic for McCarthy or Minnesota this time in his first game as a father.",

      "Instead of playing it safe and heading into halftime, Vikings coach Kevin O\u2019Connell showed his faith in McCarthy by calling a dropback that created a 50-yard pass to Justin Jefferson off a slick double move toward the middle of the field. That set up Wil Reichard\u2019s second field goal with a second left and cut it to 9-6 at the break.",

      "A Democratic candidate for governor of California will be giving TikTok a go, but with a caveat: He'll only post videos in Spanish.",
      "At least for now.",
      "Former Biden administration Health Secretary Xavier Becerra is embracing the popular short-video app to target Spanish-language users. His campaign and surveys note that Hispanic adults use TikTok in much higher numbers than Black and white adults.",
      "Congress last year passed a ban on TikTok, but President Joe Biden, who signed the bill into law and was Becerra's boss at the time, announced before leaving office that he wouldn't enforce it. After the Supreme Court ruled the ban constitutional, President Donald Trump suspended it on his first day in office to give the China-based company ByteDance time to find a new buyer.",
      "Trump, a Republican, had tried to ban dealings with ByteDance during his first term, but he joined the platform last year and has millions of followers. He has repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance to find a buyer and hinted occasionally that there was a deal in place, but without offering details. The White House started its own TikTok account last month.",
      "Becerra's new approach is part of an effort by Democrats to counter the rightward swing that was seen last year both in red states such as Texas and Florida and blue states such as California, New Jersey and New York, where Trump improved his numbers among Latinos.",
      "The idea is to lock in a key user base by pushing out content early on a platform politicians are still largely experimenting with. The effort comes when the Trump administration is phasing out multilingual services as part of the president's push to make English the official language of the United States.",
      "Candidates running in the 2025 elections in New Jersey and Virginia are already adapting their campaigns to appeal to Hispanics, who may have stayed away from the polls or voted for Trump based on his economic promises. But strategists say that it\u2019s still very much up for debate whether the trend will hold.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s critical to communicate in the language and on the platforms where voters spend their time and get their information,\u201d Becerra said in a statement.",
      "A 2024 Pew Research Center survey concluded that while TikTok has seen significant user growth in a short time, the demographics were different depending on race and ethnicity. Nearly half of Hispanic adults reported using it compared with 39% of Black adults and 28% of white adults.",
      "Becerra\u2019s campaign says it will push out a mix of videos with him speaking directly to the camera, policy explainers and behind-the-scenes clips from the campaign trail. It also plans to collaborate with influencers and publish videos created by supporters. All in Spanish.",

In Virginia, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger speaks Spanish in a radio ad about being a mother of three girls who attended public school.",

      "In his introduction video, Becerra says his priority is to make housing more affordable and reduce health care costs.",

      "As Big Tech\u2019s data centers continue to grow threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are considering bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- With the explosive growth of Big Tech's data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.",
      "Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.",
      "Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.",
      "Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.",
      "That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.",
      "Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,\u201d said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. \u201cData center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.\u201d",
      "That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.",
      "Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.",
      "A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.",
      "The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs \u2014 likely for the biggest power users \u2014 to meet growing demand.",
      "The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast \u2014 twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data \u2014 and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.",
      "Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.",
      "\u201cData center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.",
      "Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.",
      "Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.",
      "The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.",

      "That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.",
      "Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.",
      "\u201cThis is particularly concerning given that states within PJM\u2019s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,\u201d the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.",
      "The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.",
      "Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a \u201cbring your own generation\u201d requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.",
      "In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.",
      "Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.",
      "However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.",

      "But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.",
      "\u201cAnd the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?\" Silverman said. \"Or is there a better way to do it?\u201d",

      "Annob\u00f3n's geological formation and volcanic past make the island rich in rocks and expands Malabo's influence in the Gulf of Guinea, which is abundantly rich in oil.

Now, anyone with the Zoox app will be able to request a ride to five designated locations, including Resorts World, the Luxor hotel and the New York-New York hotel. The longest distance the Zoox robotaxis will travel is about three miles (4.8 kilometers) while carrying up to four passengers.",
      "All rides will be provided for free for at least the first few months to help promote the existence of the service in the perennially popular travel destination. Once it begins charging for rides in Las Vegas, Zoox says its prices will be comparable to traditional taxis and ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft.",

      "NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- NASA\u2019s Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "They stressed that in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there by Perseverance \u2014 ideally in labs on Earth \u2014 before reaching any conclusions.",
      "Roaming Mars since 2021, the rover cannot directly detect life. Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth \u2014 an ambitious plan that's on hold as NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options.",
      "Calling it an \u201cexciting discovery,\u201d a pair of scientists who were not involved in the study \u2014 SETI Institute\u2019s Janice Bishop and the University of Massachusetts Amherst\u2019s Mario Parente \u2014 were quick to point out that non-biological processes could be responsible.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason why we can\u2019t go so far as to say, \u2018A-ha, this is proof positive of life,'\u2019\u2019 lead researcher Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University told The Associated Press. \u201cAll we can say is one of the possible explanations is microbial life, but there could be other ways to make this set of features that we see.\u201d",
      "Either way, Hurowitz said it\u2019s the best, most compelling candidate yet in the rover\u2019s search for potential signs of long-ago life. It was the 25th sample gathered; the tally is now up to 30, with six more to go.",
      "\u201cIt would be amazing to be able to demonstrate conclusively that these features were formed by something that was alive on another planet billions of years ago, right?\" Hurowitz said. But even if that's not the case, it's \"a valuable lesson in all of the ways that nature can conspire to fool us.\u201d",
      "Collected last summer, the sample is from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, a river channel that once carried water into Jezero Crater. This outcrop of sedimentary rock, known as the Bright Angel formation, was surveyed by Perseverance\u2019s science instruments before the drill came out.",
      "Along with organic carbon, a building block of life, Hurowitz and his team found minuscule specks, dubbed poppy seeds and leopard spots, that were enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide. On Earth, these chemical compounds are the byproducts when microorganisms chomp down on organic matter.",
      "The findings appeared in the journal Nature.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand court has rejected the latest bid by internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom to halt his deportation to the United States on charges related to his file-sharing website Megaupload.",
      "Dotcom had asked the High Court to review the legality of an official\u2019s August 2024 decision that he should be surrendered to the U.S. to face trial on charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering. It was the latest chapter in a protracted 13-year battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire from New Zealand.",
      "The Megaupload founder had applied for what in New Zealand is called a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official's decision was lawful.",
      "A judge on Wednesday dismissed Dotcom's arguments that the decision to deport him was politically motivated and that he would face grossly disproportionate treatment in the U.S. In a written ruling, Justice Christine Grice also rejected Dotcom's claim that New Zealand's police were wrong to charge his business partners, but not him, under domestic laws \u2014 which likely yielded laxer sentences than if the men had been tried in the U.S.",
      "The latest decision could be challenged in the Court of Appeal, where a deadline for filing is Oct. 8. It wasn't immediately clear if Dotcom would do so.",
      "One of his lawyers, Ron Mansfield, told Radio New Zealand that Dotcom's team had \"much fight left in us as we seek to secure a fair outcome,\u201d but didn't elaborate further. Neither Dotcom nor Mansfield responded to a request for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s government hasn\u2019t disclosed what will happen next in the extradition process or divulged an expected timeline for Dotcom to be surrendered to the United States.",
      "The saga stretches back to the January 2012 arrest by New Zealand authorities of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion along with other company officers at the request of the FBI. U.S. prosecutors said Megaupload raked in at least $175 million, mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies, before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors said the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "He has been free on bail in New Zealand since February 2012.",
      "Dotcom and his business partners fought the FBI's efforts to extradite them for years, including by challenging New Zealand law enforcement's actions during the investigation and arrests. In 2021, however, New Zealand\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be surrendered.",

      "In exchange, U.S. efforts to extradite them were dropped. Part of Dotcom's latest legal bid challenged the police decision not to extend a plea deal under New Zealand laws to him too.",

      "The 59-year-old saw decades of work disappear with the precious soil that the floods stripped from his small-scale farm in the foothills of Mount Mulanje.",
      "He was used to producing a healthy 850 kilograms (1,870 pounds) of corn each season to support his three daughters and two sons. He salvaged just 8 kilograms (17 pounds) from the wreckage of Freddy.",
      "\u201cThis is not a joke,\u201d he said, remembering how his farm in the village of Sazola became a wasteland of sand and rocks.",

      "But not without challenges.",
      "Africa has hundreds of languages for AI tools to learn. Even then, few farmers have smartphones and many can't read. Electricity and internet service are patchy at best in rural areas, and often non-existent.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest challenges to sustainable AI use in African agriculture is accessibility,\u201d said Daniel Mvalo, a Malawian technology specialist. \u201cMany tools fail to account for language diversity, low literacy and poor digital infrastructure.\u201d",
      "The AI tool in Malawi tries to do that. The app is called Ulangizi, which means advisor in the country's Chichewa language. It is WhatsApp-based and works in Chichewa and English. You can type or speak your question, and it replies with an audio or text response, said Richard Chongo, Opportunity International's country director for Malawi.",

      "But to work in Malawi, AI still needs a human touch. For Maere's area, that is the job of 33-year-old Patrick Napanja, a farmer support agent who brings a smartphone with the app for those who have no devices. Chongo calls him the \u201chuman in the loop.\"",
      "\u201cI used to struggle to provide answers to some farming challenges, now I use the app,\" said Napanja.",
      "Farmer support agents like Napanja generally have around 150-200 farmers to help and try to visit them in village groups once a week. But sometimes, most of an hour-long meeting is taken up waiting for responses to load because of the area's poor connectivity, he said. Other times, they have to trudge up nearby hills to get a signal.",

      "Mvalo, the tech specialist, warned that inaccurate AI advice like a chatbot misidentifying crop diseases could lead to action that ruins the crop as well as a struggling farmer's livelihood.",
      "\u201cTrust in AI is fragile,\" he said. \"If it fails even once, many farmers may never try it again.\u201d",
      "The Malawian government has invested in Ulangizi and it is programmed to align with the agriculture ministry's own official farming advice, making it more relevant for Malawians, said Webster Jassi, the agriculture extension methodologies officer at the ministry.",
      "But he said Malawi faces challenges in getting the tool to enough communities to make an extensive difference. Those communities don't just need smartphones, but also to be able to afford internet access.",
      "For Malawi, the potential may be in combining AI with traditional collaboration among communities.",
      "\u201cFarmers who have access to the app are helping fellow farmers,\u201d Jassi said, and that is improving productivity.",

      "Australia has approved a world-first vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- A regulator has approved a world-first vaccine to protect koalas from chlamydia infections, which are causing infertility and death in the iconic native species that is listed as endangered in parts of Australia.",
      "The single-dose vaccine was developed by the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland state after more than a decade of research led by professor of microbiology Peter Timms.",
      "The research showed the vaccine reduced the likelihood of koalas developing symptoms of chlamydia during breeding age and decreased mortality from the disease in wild populations by at least 65%.",
      "The recent approval by Australia\u2019s veterinary medicine regulator means the vaccine can now be used in wildlife hospitals, veterinary clinics and in the field to protect the nation\u2019s most at-risk koalas, Timms said on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe knew a single-dose vaccine \u2014 with no need for a booster \u2014 was the answer to reducing the rapid, devastating spread of this disease, which accounts for as much as half of koala deaths across all wild populations in Australia,\u201d Timms said in a statement.",
      "\u201cSome individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day, particularly in southeast Queensland and New South Wales, where infection rates within populations are often around 50% and in some cases can reach as high as 70%,\u201d\u202fTimms added.",
      "Deborah Tabart, chair of the conservation charity Australian Koala Foundation, said resources being spent on vaccinating koalas should be redirected at saving koala habitat.",
      "\u201cAt the risk of sounding flippant, how can anyone be so delusional as to think that you can vaccinate 100,000 animals? It\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d Tabart said on Friday.",
      "Tabart\u2019s foundation estimates there are fewer than 100,000 koalas in the wild. The government-backed National Koala Monitoring Program estimated last year there were between 224,000 and 524,000 koalas.",
      "\u201cI accept that chlamydia is an issue for koalas, but I also want people to understand that they\u2019re sick because they haven\u2019t got any habitat,\u201d Tabart said.",
      "The Queensland Conservation Council, an umbrella organization for more than 50 environmental groups across the state, welcomed the vaccine. But the council's director, Dave Copeman, echoed Tabart\u2019s focus on preserving koala habitat.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s really good news. Chlamydia is one of the key stresses that has been putting pressure on koala populations,\u201d Copeman said.",
      "\u201cKoalas were at risk before chlamydia outbreaks, and they will remain at risk even if we manage chlamydia perfectly, because we keep on destroying their habitat,\u201d he added.",
      "Koalas are listed as endangered species in the states of Queensland and New South Wales and in the Australian Capital Territory, with habitat loss due to wildfires and urban expansion as the major threats. Chlamydia can cause urinary tract infections, infertility, blindness and death.",
      "Treatment with antibiotics can disrupt an infected koala\u2019s ability to digest eucalyptus leaves \u2014 its sole food source \u2014 leading to starvation, the university said in a statement.",

      "Federal Environment Minister Murray Watt said his government had contributed to the vaccine\u2019s development through a 76 million Australian dollar ($50 million) Saving Koalas Fund.",
      "\u201cWe know that koalas need help to fight diseases like chlamydia. It\u2019s a widespread threat impacting their reproductive health and causing infertility,\u201d Watt said in a statement.",
      "Koalas are iconic Australian marsupials, like wombats and kangaroos. They spend most of their time eating and sleeping in eucalyptus trees, and their paws have two opposing thumbs to help them grasp and climb up tree trunks.",
      "Australia\u2019s wild koala populations have declined steeply in the past two decades.",
      "Facing compounded threats from disease, habitat loss, climate change and road collisions, koalas could become extinct by 2050, according to a 2020 assessment from the New South Wales government.",

      "The end of summer means many of us have a phone full of vacation photos",
      "LONDON -- The summer holidays are over, and all those great times you had on vacation have been memorialized in hundreds of smartphone photos. Now what?",
      "Some highlights \u2014 the prettiest sunset, the best group shots \u2014 have been posted on Instagram or shared in the family chat group. But many more will likely languish in your camera roll.",
      "Because smartphones come with increasingly large amounts of file storage, it\u2019s too easy to take photos just because we can. But it's also real work to go through them all later, so it\u2019s too easy to forget about them.",
      "Here are some quick and easy methods to help deal with the pictures (and videos) overwhelming your phone.",
      "There will some shots that will be the most important \u2014 standout photos that you want to share with others, or know that you\u2019ll look back on years later, or just keep for reference. Star or heart any photos that fall into this category, which puts them into a folder or album for favorites.",
      "After a recent extended family trip to Turkey, I ended up with quite a few photos of restaurant and cafe menus. They were shared in the family WhatsApp group to decide where or what to eat. But we\u2019ll probably never visit those establishments again.",
      "It\u2019s always good practice cull photos that you just don\u2019t need anymore, which could also include screenshots, pictures of receipts or duplicate images. But going through hundreds of trip photos could be a little tedious without some help. Fortunately, there are dozens of photo deletion and cleanup apps available that aim to speed the job up.",
      "Many of them resemble dating apps like Tinder, because they let you swipe left to delete and swipe right to save a photo. Some are free, others need a subscription.",
      "It starts getting more challenging when you have images that are similar but not identical. Which one should you keep? Some apps have a comparison feature to help you decide.",
      "I tried a few of these apps and found that Clever Cleaner\u2019s Similars function works well, helping me whittle down, for example, many of the various nearly identical shots I took of Istanbul\u2019s skyline while crossing the Bosphorus Strait by ferry at dusk. The free app grouped similar pictures together and then suggested the best shot to keep. I found that I generally agreed with its suggestions.",
      "Even if you\u2019ve managed to sort through your camera roll, it will probably still be a jumble of images stretching back in an unbroken stream.",
      "So group photos into albums organized by themes. Android and iPhone users can do this on the Photos apps on their respective operating systems. Select all the photos from a trip and add them to a new album.",

      "If you don\u2019t want to set up a shared album, Android and Google Photos lets users create links so others can just view an album or individual photo. It\u2019s not so easy on iOS, which only lets users export the album\u2019s photos. You can share individual photos with an iCloud link but it expires after 30 days.",

      "Residents of Santiago de Compostela are struggling with overtourism",
      "SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, Spain -- While some Barcelona residents sought to repel a tsunami of tourists with plastic water pistols, a neighborhood association in Santiago de Compostela opted for a friendlier approach: a guide to good manners for visitors to their town, the endpoint of the Catholic world's most famous pilgrimage.",
      "Translated into several languages, the group posted it throughout the northwestern Spanish city and distributed it at its ever-growing number of hostels. It reminded tourists to keep noise down, respect traffic rules and use plastic protectors on hiking poles to avoid damaging the narrow cobblestone streets, among other things.",
      "To little avail, it would seem. Large groups still take over the streets singing hymns, bikes ride in the wrong direction and metal pole tips clatter against the ground. Santiago's social media is awash with photos denouncing a lack of decorum.",
      "Tourists' greater offense, though, stems from their sheer numbers; the old town and squares surrounding the cathedral holding the reputed tomb of Saint James the Apostle \u2014 and that was the center of town life for a millennium \u2014 today are almost exclusively the domain of outsiders, whose influx has served to expel residents. This dynamic has left Santiago emerging as the latest global destination where longtime residents have grown embittered by the overtourism transforming their community.",
      "\u201cWe do not have tourism-phobia. We have always lived in harmony with tourism, but when it gets out of hand, when the pressure goes beyond what is reasonable, that is when rejection arises,\u201d said Roberto Almu\u00ed\u00f1a, president of the neighborhood association in the old town that's a UNESCO World Heritage site.",
      "The \u201cCamino de Santiago,\u201d known in English as the Way of St. James, dates back to the 9th century, with pilgrims following its converging trails for up to hundreds of kilometers on paths originating in Portugal and France. The modern popularity it gained with the 2010 film \u201cThe Way\u201d starring Martin Sheen was turbocharged more recently by social media and experience-driven travel after the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Last year, a record half-million people signed up to trek one of the approved routes to the cathedral \u2014 equal to five times the city\u2019s resident population, and marking a 725-fold increase over the last four decades. Added to those masses are ordinary tourists not arriving by trail.",
      "The proliferation of short-term rentals drove annual rent prices up 44% from 2018 to 2023, according to a study commissioned by the city council to the Fundaci\u00f3n Universidade da Coru\u00f1a. That led municipal authorities in May to request the regional government classify the area as a high-pressure zone, like Barcelona or San Sebastian, which would help to limit rent increases.",
      "Already, last November, Santiago's city council enacted a ban on Airbnb-style tourist accommodations in the historic center, arguing at the time in a statement that it was \u201ca necessity arising from its significant growth, which has clear effects on the number of housing units available for residents and on their price.\u201d",
      "Sihara P\u00e9rez, a researcher at the University of Santiago, described finding anywhere to rent in the city as \u201cmission impossible,\u201d while Antonio Jerem\u00edas, 27, told The Associated Press that he's considering moving back in with his mother, because his salary working full-time at a warehouse isn\u2019t enough to make ends meet.",
      "Andrea Dopazo, 32, tried to move out of her parents\u2019 house in a neighborhood located fully 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the city center. But her desire to continue living in the place where she grew up and community ties are strong proved futile, and she had to take something in a town outside Santiago.",
      "\u201cThe only people who have been able to stay in the neighborhoods are those who have been lucky \u2014 or unlucky \u2014 enough to inherit an apartment from their grandparents, uncles or parents,\u201d said Dopazo, who works in human resources.",

      "In the old town, tourists can stay in small hotels in former homes or huge hostels converted from former seminaries, which aren\u2019t subject to the ban. But in the hustle to cash in, some short-term rentals are apparently flouting the restriction, evidenced by tenants collecting keys from lockboxes hung outside buildings.",
      "\u201cSome follow the rules and others don\u2019t, but this is the model that is really limiting residential housing,\u201d said Montse Vilar, from another neighborhood group, Xuntanza.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Democrats are planning to force two Senate votes on President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs in the coming weeks, keeping pressure on Senate Republicans as many of them have voiced frustration with the policies.",
      "Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine says he will introduce two separate bipartisan resolutions this week that would terminate the national emergencies that Trump declared to justify the tariffs he has imposed on Canada and Brazil. In April, four Republicans voted with Democrats to block Trump\u2019s tariffs on Canada, but the House never took it up.",
      "Kaine said it\u2019s common for Republican senators to express concerns about the tariffs, but he wants to put them on the record as often as he can.",
      "Republicans can \u201cvote with your constituents or vote with President Trump,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cOver time, the instability is creating huge concerns.\u201d",
      "Kaine is introducing the two resolutions with a group of Democrats and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, an outspoken opponent of Trump's tariffs. By introducing the measures, the group is triggering a decades-old law that allows Congress to block a president\u2019s emergency powers and force votes on Trump\u2019s declarations, whether majority Republicans want to hold the votes or not.",
      "The law allows lawmakers to reintroduce the legislation and force new votes every six months \u2014 something Kaine says he will do until the policy is changed.",
      "The votes will come at a time of turmoil for the economy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said last week that Trump\u2019s tariff policy is one of several factors that are expected to increase jobless rates and inflation and lower overall growth this year. Republicans from farm states and beyond, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota, have expressed wariness about some of the sweeping tariffs and concerns about the effects on businesses that depend on Canadian trade.",
      "Still, Republicans have mostly deferred to Trump on his administration\u2019s trade policy, so far declining to block it and arguing that the president needs time to work on deals with individual countries.",
      "\u201cI think everybody kind of knows my views on tariffs, but the fact of the matter is, the president ran on this,\u201d Thune said earlier this year.",

      "The resolution to block the Canadian tariffs would end the emergency declaration that Trump signed in February to implement tariffs on Canada as punishment for not doing enough to halt the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S. The Senate passed the same resolution in April with support from Paul and three other Republicans \u2014 Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Trump called out the four on social media at the time, encouraging them to \u201cget on the Republican bandwagon.\u201d",
      "The second resolution would block Trump\u2019s 50% tariffs on Brazil, ending an emergency that Trump linked to Brazil\u2019s policies and criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "In addition to oil, Brazil sells orange juice, coffee, iron and steel to the U.S., among other products. The U.S. ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus with Brazil last year, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "Democrats hope that more Republicans will vote against the tariffs as effects on the economy become more clear.",
      "Kaine says his hope is that Republicans will support the measure because \u201cnow it\u2019s real,\u201d when the tariffs hadn\u2019t been implemented yet last spring. \u201cIt\u2019s not theoretical,\" he said.",
      "Kaine also forced a separate vote on the broader global tariffs Trump announced in early April, but that was voted down 49-49. The resolution potentially could have passed, though, if Republican Sen. McConnell and Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island had not been absent.",

      "The Trump administration has added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in nearly three decades",
      "MIAMI -- The Trump administration on Monday added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, a stinging rebuke to a traditional U.S. ally that reflects a recent surge in cocaine production and fraying ties between the White House and the country\u2019s leftist president.",
      "Even as it determined that Colombia had failed to comply with its international counternarcotics obligations, the Trump administration issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered major aid cuts, citing vital U.S. national interests.",
      "Nonetheless, it is a major step against one of the United States\u2019 staunchest allies in Latin America, which analysts said could hurt the economy and further hamper efforts to restore security in the countryside.",
      "President Gustavo Petro, who has said on several occasions that whisky kills more people than cocaine, lamented Trump's decision during a televised cabinet meeting Monday, saying Colombia was penalized after sacrificing the lives of \u201cdozens of policemen, soldiers and regular citizens, trying to stop cocaine\u201d from reaching the United States.",
      "\u201cWhat we have been doing is not really relevant to the Colombian people,\u201d he said of the nation\u2019s antidrug efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s to stop North American society from smearing its noses\u201d in cocaine.",
      "The U.S. last added Colombia to the list, through a process known as decertification, in 1997 when the country\u2019s cartels \u2014 through threats of violence and money \u2014 had poisoned much of the nation\u2019s institutions.",
      "\"Decertification is a blunt tool and a huge irritant in bilateral relations that goes well beyond drug issues and makes cooperation far harder in any number of areas,\u201d said Adam Isacson, a security researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so rarely used.\u201d",
      "The president at the time, Ernesto Samper, was facing credible accusations of receiving illicit campaign contributions from the now-defunct Cali cartel and a plane he was set to use for a trip to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly session was found carrying 4 kilograms of heroin.",
      "A remarkable turnaround began once Samper left office. Successive U.S. administrations \u2014 both Republican and Democrats \u2014 sent billions in foreign assistance to Colombia to eradicate illegal coca crops, strengthen its armed forces in the fight against drug-fueled rebels and provide economic alternatives to poor farmers who are on the lowest rungs of the cocaine industry.",
      "That cooperation, a rare U.S. foreign policy success in Latin America, started to unravel following the suspension a decade ago of aerial eradication of coca fields with glyphosate. It followed a Colombia high court ruling that determined the U.S.-funded program was potentially harmful to the environment and farmers.",
      "A 2016 peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the nation\u2019s largest rebel group known as FARC, also committed Colombia to rolling back punitive policies likened to the U.S. spraying of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War in favor of state building, rural development and voluntary crop substitution.",
      "Since then, cocaine production has skyrocketed. The amount of land dedicated to cultivating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has almost tripled in the past decade to a record 253,000 hectares in 2023, according to the latest report available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. That is almost triple the size of New York City.",

      "\u201cThe failure of Colombia to meet its drug control obligations over the past year rests solely with its political leadership,\u201d Trump said in a presidential memo submitted to Congress. \u201cI will consider changing this designation if Colombia\u2019s government takes more aggressive action to eradicate coca and reduce cocaine production and trafficking, as well as hold those producing, trafficking, and benefiting from the production of cocaine responsible, including through improved cooperation with the United States to bring the leaders of Colombian criminal organizations to justice.\u201d",
      "Under U.S. law, the president annually must identify countries that have failed to meet their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months.",
      "In addition to Colombia, the Trump administration listed four other countries \u2014 Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma and Venezuela \u2014 as among 23 major drug transit or drug-production countries that have failed to meet their international obligations. With the exception of Afghanistan, the White House determined that U.S. assistance to those countries was vital to national interests and therefore they would be spared any potential sanctions.",

      "The monthslong renovation, which cost nearly $60 million, adds six new galleries as well as classrooms and interactive experiences, changing a relatively static museum into a dynamic place where people are encouraged to take action supporting civil and human rights, racial justice and the future of democracy, said Jill Savitt, the center's president and CEO.",
      "The center has stayed active ahead of its Nov. 8 reopening through K-12 education programs that include more than 300 online lesson plans; a LGBTQ+ Institute; training in diversity, equity and inclusion; human rights training for law enforcement; and its Truth & Transformation Initiative to spread awareness about forced labor, racial terror and other historic injustices.",

And our desire here is to whet the appetite of kids to see that they can be involved. They can do it.\u201d",
      "This ethos is sharply different from the idea that young people can't handle the truth and must be protected from unpleasant challenges but, Savitt said, \"the history that we tell here is the most inspirational history.\"",
      "\"In fact, I think it\u2019s what makes America great. It is something to be patriotically proud of. The way activists over time have worked together through nonviolence and changed democracy to expand human freedom \u2014 there\u2019s nothing more American and nothing greater than that. That is the lesson that we teach here,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBroken Promises,\u201d opening in December, includes exhibits from the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, cut short when white mobs sought to brutally reverse advances by formerly enslaved people. \u201cWe want to start orienting you in the conversation that we believe we all kind of see, but we don\u2019t say it outright: Progress. Backlash. Progress. Backlash. And that pattern that has been in our country since enslavement,\u201d said its curator, Kama Pierce.",
      "On display will be a Georgia historical marker from the site of the 1918 lynching of Mary Turner, pockmarked repeatedly with bullets, that Turner descendants donated to keep it from being vandalized again.",

      "She isolated from loved ones after the 2023 disaster while struggling to process the grief, often angry that her family didn't have a permanent place to stay and that so many others were unable to evacuate.",
      "Moving between high schools, she never felt welcome, Palacio said, and the pain only intensified as the months wore on. Finally, near the first anniversary of the fires, Palacio reached out for help.",
      "Hundreds of students like Palacio have struggled mentally since the fires \u2013 and not all have received the help they need.",
      "The Hawaii Department of Education estimates more than a third of Maui students lost a family member, sustained a serious injury or had a parent lose a job after the fires, which killed 102 people and damaged more than 3,300 properties in Lahaina.",

      "Two years later, many in Lahaina are ready to return to normal. But therapists say students\u2019 mental health challenges continue to mount.",
      "That\u2019s common after a disaster, especially at the two-year mark, when adrenaline wears off and stress remains high, said Christopher Knightsbridge, one of several researchers at the University of Hawaii who has studied the well-being of Lahaina fire survivors. While kids may feel numb immediately following a disaster, after two years, they\u2019re facing the toll of constant uncertainty and change, he said.",
      "It\u2019s a phenomenon seen wherever schooling has been disrupted by natural disasters, reporting by Honolulu Civil Beat, The Associated Press and several other news outlets shows. But a couple years after the disaster, schools are not always prepared with extra mental health supports.",
      "On Maui, the island is dealing with an ongoing shortage of specialists. In the past few years, the number of psychiatrists serving youth has dropped from four to two, even as demand has grown.",
      "\u201cThe crisis isn\u2019t over,\u201d Knightsbridge said.",
      "Palacio made progress with the help of a school counselor and then a local organization that supports teens\u2019 mental health through outdoor activities and adventures.",

      "Two years in, many kids still wrestle with depression and anxiety.",
      "DayJahiah Valdivia, a senior at K\u012bhei Charter School, said her stress levels spike when there are strong winds or small brush fires. Valdivia lives in Upcountry Maui, which also faced wildfires that burned over a thousand acres of land on the same day as the 2023 Lahaina fires. Her home was spared, but it took months for her family to return because their property was covered in soot and needed professional cleaning.",
      "She feels less anxious now that her family members have discussed their escape plan for future disasters. But a summer fire near a friend\u2019s home in Central Maui renewed her fears about her loved ones\u2019 safety.",
      "\u201cThe anxiety never really wore off,\u201d she said. On windy days, it was especially difficult to concentrate in class or feel safe.",
      "In a University of Hawaii study of fire survivors conducted in 2024, just over half of children reported symptoms of depression, and 30% were likely facing an anxiety disorder. Nearly half of kids in the study, ages 10 to 17, were experiencing PTSD.",
      "Children in disaster-torn towns across the U.S. can relate.",
      "In Paradise, California, where the 2018 Camp Fire took 85 lives, a protracted period of disillusionment followed what some called the \u201chero phase,\u201d when the community pulled together and vowed to resurrect their town. Both Lahaina and Paradise had housing shortages after their fires, so families had to move away or live with friends to go to school or work in the area. In general, students who don\u2019t have a permanent living arrangement tend to struggle more academically and have more behavioral challenges, research shows.",
      "Many Paradise students still struggle with anxiety and grief, seven years later, making it difficult to fully engage in school. A year after the Camp Fire, 17% of students were homeless, and the suspension rate was 7.4%, compared to 2.5% statewide. The suspension rate remained nearly triple the state average last year, and more than 26% were chronically absent.",
      "Aryah Berkowitz, who lost her home, two dogs and her family\u2019s business in the Paradise blaze, dealt with lingering behavioral challenges following the disaster. For nearly a year afterward, her family of seven, plus a pair of surviving pit bull-Labrador mixes, lived with a friend in nearby Chico, sharing two bedrooms and a bathroom. Berkowitz, then in sixth grade, slept on the couch.",
      "\u201cI was having to help my family a lot and wasn\u2019t able to handle it,\u201d said Berkowitz , once a high-achieving student who was suspended twice after the fire. \u201cI was holding it inside and took it out on other people. Some days I\u2019d just walk out of class.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey just sort of vanished,\u201d Chapin said.",
      "Maui has long dealt with medical workforce challenges. Even before the fires, it faced a shortage of mental health professionals because they struggled with the state\u2019s high cost of living and housing shortage.",
      "The fires brought burnout and greater economic obstacles, only exacerbating the issue. Since then, Hawaii\u2019s education department has tried to bulk up Maui\u2019s mental health staff by bringing in providers from neighbor islands and the mainland and, more recently, using a $2 million federal grant to support students.",
      "But hiring mental health staff has been so difficult that even the federal money hasn\u2019t made much of a dent. In the first nine months of the grant, the state education department primarily used the money to bus displaced students from other parts of the island to Lahaina schools.",
      "The state has used the money to hire five part-time mental health providers working with students and staff, including one specialist who works in the evenings with students living as boarders on Lahainaluna\u2019s campus, said Kimberly Lessard, a Department of Education district specialist.",
      "Two of the six behavioral health specialist positions in Lahaina schools remained unfilled this summer, as they have been for years due to Maui\u2019s housing shortage and high cost of living, Lessard said.",
      "Valdivia, who still struggles with anxiety from the Upcountry Maui fires, has seen the impacts of the provider shortage firsthand. She\u2019s on a two- to three-month waiting list to see a psychiatrist on Maui, and she\u2019s seeing an O\u02bbahu-based therapist via telehealth because there aren\u2019t enough providers who can meet with her in person.",
      "\u201cEven just to get evaluated (by a psychiatrist), it\u2019s literally months,\u201d she said. \u201cI just think that\u2019s crazy.\u201d",

      "In Puerto Rico, which has suffered from a series of disasters since Hurricane Maria struck in 2017, students have experienced high rates of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Yet despite legislation in 2000 to create more school psychologist positions, it wasn\u2019t until the pandemic that the commonwealth\u2019s Education Department dedicated money to hire them. Today, there are 58 vacancies across the archipelago\u2019s 870 schools.",
      "The school psychologists \u201ccan\u2019t keep up,\u201d said Nellie Zambrana, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Puerto Rico at R\u00edo Piedras. Those who are working are overstretched, according to a study by the university\u2019s Psychological Research Institute. One psychologist, the study said, was assigned to more than 100 students at three schools.",
      "Loren Lapow wasn\u2019t deterred by the storm clouds gathering one June afternoon over D.T. Fleming Beach on Maui. The social worker helped teens carry an inflatable paddleboard to the water\u2019s edge, cheering them on as they swam.",
      "Amid the fun, Lapow directed the teens to reflect on their fears and losses. He asked them how they feel when they smell smoke or think about Lahaina\u2019s famed Front Street, most of which was destroyed in the blaze.",
      "\u201cPlaces are like a friend to us,\u201d Lapow said. \u201cWhen you lose places, it hurts.\u201d",
      "Lapow founded the Maui Hero Project, which his website describes as \u201cadventure-based counseling services.\u201d The eight-week program Lapow started 25 years ago teaches teens basic disaster preparedness skills and immerses them in outdoor activities. It's also a form of mental health support, which Lapow has leaned into since the wildfires.",
      "Lapow\u2019s approach has become a common strategy for nonprofits and therapists trying to reach kids who have balked at discussing their mental health since the fires. But those efforts don't always reach the kids who need the most help.",
      "There\u2019s a strong stigma around seeking mental health services, particularly in Filipino and Latino communities that make up a large portion of Lahaina\u2019s population, said Ruben Juarez, a professor at University of Hawaii who led the research study on fire survivors. Families may see counseling as a sign of weakness, and children may be reluctant to open up to therapists out of fear of being judged or scrutinized, he added.",
      "Yet in the study, Latino teens reported the highest rates of severe depressive and PTSD symptoms. Filipino teens reported some of the highest rates of anxiety.",
      "The state is hoping struggling students will open up to their peers. A new program called YouthLine will train Hawaii teens to respond to crisis calls, said Keli Acquaro, who oversees youth mental health for the state.",
      "Keakealani Cashman, who graduated from Kamehameha Schools Maui in 2024, is hoping to be part of the state\u2019s solution to provide more mental health support to the next generation of children.",
      "After losing her home to the fires, Cashman spent her senior year talking to Native Hawaiian practitioners and researching how cultural values, such as connections to the land and her ancestors, could help her community heal from the trauma of the fires. The project helped her own mental health improve, said Cashman, who regularly met with her school\u2019s behavioral health specialist.",
      "Now, Cashman is entering her second year at Brigham Young University Hawaii and hopes to work as a behavioral health specialist in Hawaiian language immersion schools",
      "\u201cThis horrible, horrible thing happened to me and my family, but I don\u2019t have to let it kill the rest of my life,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cI can really help my family, my community in school, and just make an impact in what I know how to do.\u201d",

      "The break-ins mirrored a slew of burglaries at the homes of well-known professional athletes across the U.S. in recent months. The players have been targeted because of the high-end products believed to be in their homes and sometimes the thefts happen when they are away with their teams for road games.",

      "A San Francisco supervisor who pushed to turn a 2-mile stretch of highway into a car-free park faces a recall vote in his district",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- During the coronavirus pandemic, the city closed a stretch of a four-lane highway along San Francisco\u2019s Pacific Coast and made it an automobile-free sanctuary where bicyclists and walkers flocked to exercise and socialize under open skies and to the sound of crashing waves.",
      "But with the post-pandemic return to school and work, resentment grew among neighborhood residents who relied on the artery to get around. Some blamed the district city supervisor who helped make the change permanent by placing on a citywide ballot a measure to turn the 2-mile (3.2-kilometer) stretch into a new park.",
      "On Tuesday, district voters will decide whether to recall Supervisor Joel Engardio.",
      "The recall of a local supervisor who represents one-tenth of a city of 800,000 might seem like minor politics. But the election highlights a San Francisco in flux and a still cranky, even emboldened electorate as leaders prepare to make tough decisions about the city\u2019s future.",
      "The recall election will be the city's third in four years. It's fueled by many of the same people who tossed out three liberal school board members in February 2022 followed by the ouster of politically progressive San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin in June of that year.",
      "\u201cThis recall is really about the future of our city,\u201d said Engardio in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cDo we want to be a city that just preserves itself in amber and goes back in time? Or do we want to be a city that innovates, thinks ahead, is forward-looking and welcomes new people?\u201d",
      "Engardio, a crime victims\u2019 advocate, supported the previous recalls. He was among detractors who said Boudin was too lenient on crime and the San Francisco Unified School Board too focused on progressive politics, including renaming 44 school sites.",
      "Later in 2022, he defeated an incumbent to win one of 11 seats on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Engardio represents the Sunset District, a low-key residential neighborhood of single-family homes on the west side with a high Chinese population.",
      "Last year, he was one of five city supervisors who placed a proposal to permanently ban cars from the Great Highway on the November 2024 ballot. Measure K passed citywide, but failed in his district. In May, recall petitioners submitted 10,500 valid signatures to qualify the initiative for Tuesday\u2019s ballot.",
      "On an overcast afternoon last week, people jogged and rode bikes down what had once been called the Great Highway. Moms pushed babies in strollers on a road divided by a median of blowing sand and creeping ice plant succulents, still striped with dotted white lines marking what used to be driving lanes. An older man walked by slowly, using a cane.",
      "The new park dubbed Sunset Dunes is popular with many San Francisco residents \u2014 but not so much with those in its home community.",
      "Backers of the recall say Engardio betrayed his constituents by going back on support for a compromise that would have kept the highway open to vehicles during the week and banned them on weekends. They say he failed to listen to their concerns about quality of life and traffic safety in the district.",

The tech entrepreneurs have contributed a combined $375,000 to support the anti-recall campaign, which has raised more than $800,000 total; the pro-recall campaign has raised about $250,000.",

      "President Donald Trump says the U.S. military again targeted a boat allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela, killing three aboard the vessel",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said the U.S. military on Monday again targeted a boat allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela, killing three aboard the vessel, and hinted that the military targeting of cartels could be further expanded.",
      "\u201cThe Strike occurred while these confirmed narcoterrorists from Venezuela were in International Waters transporting illegal narcotics (A DEADLY WEAPON POISONING AMERICANS!) headed to the U.S.,\u201d Trump said in a Truth Social post announcing the strike. \u201cThese extremely violent drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to U.S. National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests.\u201d",
      "The strike was carried out nearly two weeks after another military strike on what the Trump administration said was a drug-carrying speedboat from Venezuela that killed 11.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office later on Monday, Trump said he had been shown footage of the latest strike by Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",
      "Asked what proof the U.S. has that the vessel was carrying drugs, Trump replied, \u201cWe have proof. All you have to do is look at the cargo that was spattered all over the ocean \u2014 big bags of cocaine and and fentanyl all over the place.\u201d",
      "Trump also suggested that U.S. military strikes targeting alleged drug smugglers at sea could be expanded to land.",
      "He said the U.S. military is seeing fewer vessels in the Caribbean since carrying out the first strike early this month. But he said the cartels are still smuggling drugs by land.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re telling the cartels right now we\u2019re going to be stopping them, too,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen they come by land we\u2019re going to be stopping them the same way we stopped the boats. ... But maybe by talking about it a little bit, it won\u2019t happen. If it doesn\u2019t happen that\u2019s good.\u201d",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth later took to X to warn cartels the U.S. would \u201ctrack them, kill them, and dismantle their networks throughout our hemisphere \u2014 at the times and places of our choosing,\u201d echoing muscular language used by past administrations during the Global War on Terror. The White House also posted a short unclassified video clip on social media of the strike.",
      "The Trump administration has justified the military action as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States.",
      "But several senators, Democrats and some Republicans, have questioned the legality of Trump's action. They view it as a potential overreach of executive authority in part because the military was used for law enforcement purposes.",
      "Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California said he\u2019s drafting a war powers resolution aimed at preventing U.S. troops from engaging in further strikes until formally authorized by Congress.",
      "Schiff said he was concerned \u201cthese lawless killings are just putting us at risk\u201d and could prompt another country to target U.S. forces without proper justification.",
      "\u201cI don't want to see us get into some war with Venezuela because the president is just blowing ships willy-nilly out of the water,\" Schiff said.",
      "Human rights groups have also raised concerns that the strikes flout international law. The White House has offered scant information about how the operations came together or the legal authorities under which they were carried out.",
      "\u201cLet us be clear \u2014 this may be an extrajudicial execution, which is murder,\u201d said Daphne Eviatar, who directs Amnesty International USA\u2019s Security with Human Rights Program. \u201cThere is absolutely no legal justification for this military strike.\u201d",

      "MUSCATINE, Iowa -- Days after an assailant\u2019s bullet tore through two of his limbs, Felipe de Jesus Hernandez Marcelo hobbled out of the hospital on crutches.",
      "Hernandez had nearly died in the early morning of June 21 when, police say, a troubled young man shot him during an attempted robbery in Muscatine, Iowa. A quick emergency response saved his life, but the shooting left the 28-year-old father wounded where a bullet traveled through his arm and leg.",
      "Police had seized the car Hernandez was driving when he was shot and the $462 cash it contained as evidence. A friend took him to the police station to ask for his belongings on June 24 \u2014 not knowing the visit could mark the last time he enjoyed freedom in the United States.",
      "Hernandez is one of a growing number of crime victims and relatives who have been arrested and indefinitely detained pending removal proceedings during the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "In January, Immigration and Customs Enforcement rescinded a policy that had shielded many victims from detention and removal. The number of people applying for visas that allow some victims and their families to remain in the country has plummeted since then. Others are being detained as they go through the lengthy application process. Of those detained, many have been declared ineligible for release under another ICE policy change.",
      "Critics say the outcome is not only cruel to victims and their families but is harming public safety by making those who are in the U.S. illegally unlikely to report crimes and cooperate with police.",
      "\u201cThis type of thing is now the new normal. This scenario is happening every day in every city,\u201d said Dan Kowalski, a retired attorney who has been an expert on immigration law for decades. \u201cAny contact with any level or kind of state or federal law enforcement, civil or criminal, puts you in danger of detention by ICE.\u201d",
      "ICE didn't return messages seeking comment. Its new policy cites an executive order signed by President Donald Trump, titled \u201cProtecting the American People Against Invasion,\u201d which calls for the \u201ctotal and efficient enforcement\" of immigration laws.",
      "A native of Mexico who entered the U.S. illegally, Hernandez has been in federal custody for all of the 2 \u00bd months since he visited his police station. Police arrested him on an old warrant for failing to pay a traffic ticket, and he was turned over to ICE custody within hours.",
      "Hernandez has been apart from his 9-year-old son, unable attend medical appointments critical for recovering from his gunshot wounds, and unable to work the construction job that paid his family's bills.",
      "He was denied medicine for the first five days as he suffered in excruciating pain, he said.",
      "\u201cI was locked in a single cell for several days. It felt like forever,\u201d Hernandez recalled this month in court testimony, before a federal judge ruled that his indefinite federal detention without a bond hearing was illegal.",
      "It was 4 a.m. on June 21 when Hernandez cried out for help in downtown Muscatine, a city of 24,000 along the Mississippi River where he had lived with relatives since he arrived in the U.S. in 2021.",
      "Witnesses saw Hernandez behind the wheel of his Volkswagen Jetta covered in blood as he struggled to convey what happened to them in Spanish. A woman called 911, saying she believed he had been stabbed in the leg.",
      "Officers arrived from the nearby police station in minutes, and found blood pouring out of Hernandez\u2019s inner thigh and pooling on the seat. One wrapped a tourniquet around the wound to try to stop the blooding as Hernandez appeared to close his eyes and drift in and out of consciousness.",
      "Investigators learned that he hadn\u2019t been stabbed, but shot with a bullet that traveled through his left wrist and right thigh before exiting onto the floor of the driver\u2019s seat.",
      "An ambulance took him to a nearby hospital emergency room where doctors concluded he needed to be transported 40 miles away for advanced treatment at the University of Iowa hospital.",
      "There, doctors performed a surgery to remove bullet and bone fragments and gave him blood transfusions. His lawyer says those interventions saved Hernandez\u2019s life, but left him with him with a $27,000 hospital bill.",
      "Friends were stunned by the attack, saying Hernandez was a hard worker who avoided drugs and alcohol. He\u2019d stayed out of trouble during his more than four years in Muscatine with one exception: He\u2019d been pulled over and ticketed a couple times for driving without a license.",
      "When Hernandez arrived at the police station seeking his belongings, investigators were still looking for the suspects involved in his attempted robbery and shooting.",
      "Police told Hernandez that his car and cash were at an impound lot and he couldn't get them. Hernandez said an officer told him to wait while they researched his criminal history. He told them about the tickets.",
      "Police discovered Hernandez had a 7-month-old bench warrant, stemming from his failure to pay a $250 ticket for driving with a suspended license in November 2024. A judge issued the warrant last December after Hernandez didn\u2019t show up for a hearing that he said he didn't know about.",
      "A few months earlier, Muscatine Police Chief Anthony Kies had assured the city where roughly one in five residents is Hispanic that his officers would never inquire about immigration status. He insisted then that \u201cany resident who is a victim or witness of a crime should not be afraid to contact our department,\u201d and promised that officers would only work with federal immigration authorities in cases involving violent criminals.",
      "The chief said in an interview his department had no choice but to arrest Hernandez and take him to the Muscatine County Jail, which is run by the sheriff's office and has long doubled as an ICE holding facility. ICE took custody of Hernandez hours later pending removal proceedings, Kies said.",
      "\u201cIf you are arrested for a local crime and you are illegal, they will make contact with ICE at the jail and that\u2019s how that\u2019s dealt with,\u201d the chief said, adding that he supported the policy.",
      "Hernandez has been held at the jail since, walking with a limp, experiencing frequent pain and a leg wound that keeps reopening.",

That hearing was rescheduled for three weeks later, when an immigration judge agreed with ICE that that he was subject to mandatory detention and ineligible for bond.",
      "Hernandez said his mother is taking care of his 9-year-old son and that he's been only able to talk to the boy twice.",
      "Hernandez's mother, Guadalupe Hernandez Marcelo, said she hasn't visited her son in jail because she's afraid of authorities. She said her grandson is sad because he feels that his father abandoned him. The family has taken out loans to pay its bills.",
      "\u201cI just feel like what's happening to my son is very unfair,\u201d she testified. \"They keep him locked up where we can\u2019t go and visit him. We feel like we have all been separated.\u201d",
      "Hernandez admitted he was not initially truthful about the location and circumstances of the shooting because he didn\u2019t want family to know the embarrassing details, according to police.",
      "Investigators obtained social media messages showing he had been in touch with a 20-year-old woman, Kimber Kallenberger, after she asked for money and food on a community Facebook forum.",
      "Kallenberger later told police she falsely told Hernandez she would have sex with him for cash in a plot to set him up to be robbed by her boyfriend. The plan was for her boyfriend, 18-year-old Justin Bass, to intimidate Hernandez with a gun to get the money but not to shoot him, she said.",
      "After Hernandez pulled up to meet her in an alley in a quiet neighborhood, he refused to give the money to Kallenberger. Bass shot him, police say, and took off running. A wounded Hernandez drove for several blocks before asking witnesses for help.",
      "The two suspects were arrested July 2 after, investigators say, Bass nearly died in a drug overdose.",
      "Kallenberger pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit a forcible felony and prostitution under a plea agreement that could spare her prison time. Bass is awaiting trial on first-degree robbery and other charges.",
      "Hernandez is one of thousands of immigrants who would likely never have been arrested by ICE under other administrations, let alone held without a chance to post bond.",

It protected those carrying so-called U and T visas that allow crime and human trafficking victims and their relatives to remain in the country. The protections extended to those who had applied for such visas and were awaiting decisions, which can take years to process.",
      "Hernandez is seeking to apply for a U visa, and would appear to be eligible as the victim of a felony assault and key witness against the two charged in the attack. But the Muscatine County prosecutor Jim Barry has yet to certify his eligibility, according to Hernandez's attorney. Barry didn't respond to messages.",
      "The Biden-era policy also called on ICE agents to look for signs immigrants had been victimized and to consider that as \u201ca positive discretionary factor\u201d when deciding whether to detain them. The goal was to avoid discouraging immigrant victims from cooperating with police in reporting and solving crimes.",
      "But some conservatives have argued that victimization alone should not allow those in the country illegally to stay.",
      "The new policy allows ICE agents to detain crime victims, including the U and T visa holders, as long as they check with police \u201cto ensure criminal investigative and other enforcement actions will not be compromised.\" Agents aren\u2019t required to look for any evidence of victimization.",
      "The number of applications for U visas dropped by nearly half in the quarter that ended in March, which included the first 2 \u00bd months of the second Trump administration, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.",
      "Immigration lawyer Bethany Hoffmann said victims are rightly concerned that an application could put them on the government's radar. She said one of her clients, whose wife had been a kidnapping victim, was arrested by ICE when he showed up to an appointment to be fingerprinted as part of the U visa application process.",
      "\u201cI have been practicing for 17 years and I have never seen that before,\u201d she said, adding that the man had no criminal history but was subject to a 10-year-old removal order.",
      "Compounding the impact is another new practice in which ICE and immigration judges have required the indefinite detention of anyone who entered the country without permission.",
      "Over the past 30 years, immigration lawyers say many such detainees would have been able to be released pending removal proceedings as long as they were deemed not to be a flight risk or danger to the community. With a steady job, local relatives and a minimal criminal history, Hernandez would be a prime candidate for release.",
      "In a Sept. 5 decision, the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed with ICE's new position that all individuals who crossed the border without permission are ineligible for bond, regardless of how long they have been in the country.",
      "Several federal judges have rejected that argument. U.S. District Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger in Iowa became the latest on Sept. 10, ruling that Hernandez was not subject to mandatory detention. She ordered immigration authorities to provide Hernandez a bond hearing within seven days, saying his detention was causing \u201cirreparable harm.\" A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.",
      "At the end of his testimony on Sept. 5, Hernandez pleaded with the judge to protect his family from retaliation, saying they had done nothing wrong.",
      "Referring to Mexico, he said, \u201cI come from a country where power is abused, and people use power to hurt people. I don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d",

      "Searchers have discovered the wreckage of a schooner that sank during a Lake Michigan storm almost 140 years ago",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- After decades of scouring the bottom of Lake Michigan, searchers have finally found the wreckage of a cargo schooner that sank during a ferocious storm almost 140 years ago off the Wisconsin coastline.",
      "The Wisconsin Historical Society and the Wisconsin Underwater Archeology Association announced Monday that a team led by researcher Brandon Baillod found the wreck of the F.J. King. Baillod said in an email to The Associated Press that the wreckage was discovered on June 28.",
      "According to the announcement, Baillod's team found the ship off Bailey's Harbor, a town of about 280 people on Wisconsin's Door Peninsula, an outcropping of land jutting into Lake Michigan that gives the state its distinctive mitten-thumb shape.",
      "The F. J. King was a 144-foot (43.89 meters), three-masted cargo schooner built in 1867 in Toledo, Ohio, to transport grain and iron ore. According to the historical society and archaeology association's announcement, the ship ran into a gale off the Door Peninsula on Sept. 15, 1886, while moving iron ore from Escanaba, Michigan, to Chicago.",
      "Waves estimated at 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3 meters) ruptured her seams and after several hours of pumping Captain William Griffin ordered his men into the ship's yawl boat. The schooner finally sank bow-first around 2 a.m., with the ship's stern deckhouse blowing away in the storm, sending Griffin's papers 50 feet into the air. A passing schooner picked up the crew and took them to Bailey's Harbor.",
      "Searchers have been trying to find the F.J. King since the 1970s but conflicting accounts of the ship's location when it sank stymied their efforts. Griffin reported that the ship went down about 5 miles (8 kilometers) off Bailey's Harbor but a lighthouse keeper reported seeing a schooner's masts breaking the surface closer to shore. Shipwreck hunters scoured the area but came up empty. Over the years F.J. King developed a reputation among shipwreck hunters as a ghost ship.",

He drew a 2-square-mile (5.17 square-kilometer) grid around the location the lighthouse keeper gave and proceeded to search it. Side-scan radar uncovered an object measuring about 140 feet (42.6 meters) long less than half a mile (0.8 kilometers) from the lighthouse keeper's location. It turned out to be the F.J. King.",

      "He said the hull appears to be intact, surprising searchers who expected to find it in pieces due to the weight of the iron ore the schooner was carrying.",
      "The Wisconsin Underwater Archeology Association has now discovered five wrecks in the last three years. Earlier in 2025, the group found the steamer L.W. Crane in the Fox River at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, as well as tugboat John Evenson and schooner Margaret A. Muir off Algoma, Wisconsin. Baillod discovered the schooner Trinidad off Algoma in 2023.",

      "Partisan politics have resulted in a monthslong legislative stalemate over the state budget that might send Michigan into a government shutdown. Whitmer, who is in her second-to-last year as governor, is expected to call on state lawmakers to break the deadlock in a speech Tuesday focused on Michigan\u2019s economy.",
      "The standoff has high stakes for Whitmer and the state, which is particularly influenced by broader economic trends in the U.S. It's also a glimpse at partisan politics reaching far beyond Washington, D.C., that are grinding a battleground state's Capitol to a halt.",
      "Ahead of her address, Whitmer said tariffs and the uncertainty they have created have hit Michigan's manufacturing sector particularly hard. With a federal shutdown looming as the state also faces down a shutdown deadline, Whitmer says that elected leaders \u201cmust set aside politics.\"",
      "\u201cIn Michigan, that includes passing a balanced, bipartisan budget that lowers costs, invests in education, health care, public safety and roads,\u201d she said last week.",
      "Whitmer has been floated as a potential Democratic nominee for president. But she has taken a less combative approach to her working relationship with President Donald Trump compared to other contenders including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.",
      "At home, her best-known campaign priorities are on the line.",
      "Whitmer's budget package includes what she calls a $3 billion plan creating a sustainable source of funding for roadway and infrastructure repairs. Both of her campaigns for governor were centered on the idea and her catchphrase promise to \u201c fix the damn roads.\"",
      "Previous policy has fallen short in a few key areas, including funding for local roadways.",
      "The Republican House passed its own road plan with key differences. The Democratic-led Senate has not presented a plan for long-term funding in their budget and have held out on doing so as overall negotiations continue.",
      "State officials expect a budget will be passed eventually. The question is when and who will make concessions.",

      "Each year during Hispanic Heritage Month, huge celebrations can be expected across the U",
      "Each year during Hispanic Heritage Month, huge celebrations can be expected across the U.S. to showcase the diversity and culture of Hispanic people.",
      "This year, the Trump administration's immigration crackdowns, a federally led English-only initiative and an anti-diversity, equity and inclusion push have changed the national climate in which these celebrations occur. Organizers across the country, from Massachusetts and North Carolina to California and Washington state, have postponed or canceled heritage month festivals altogether.",
      "Celebrated each year from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, the month is a chance for many in the U.S. to learn about and celebrate the contributions of Hispanic cultures, the country\u2019s fastest-growing racial or ethnic minority, according to the U.S. Census. The group includes people whose ancestors come from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America.",
      "More than 68 million people identify as ethnically Hispanic in the U.S., according to the latest census estimates.",
      "Before there was National Hispanic Heritage Month, there was Hispanic Heritage Week, which was created through legislation sponsored by Mexican American U.S. Rep Edward R. Roybal of Los Angeles and signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson.",
      "The weeklong commemoration was expanded to a month two decades later, with legislation signed into law by President Ronald Reagan.",
      "\u201cIt was clustered around big celebrations for the community,\u201d Alberto Lammers, director of communications at the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute said. \u201cIt became a chance for people to know Hispanic cultures, for Latinos to get to know a community better and for the American public to understand a little better the long history of Latinos in the U.S.\u201d",
      "Sept. 15 was chosen as the starting point to coincide with the anniversary of \u201cEl Grito de Dolores,\u201d or the \u201cCry of Dolores,\u201d which was issued in 1810 from a town in Mexico that launched the country\u2019s war for independence from Spain.",
      "The Central American nations of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica celebrate their independence on Sept. 15 and Mexico marks its national day on Sept. 16, the day after the cry for independence.",
      "Also during National Hispanic Heritage Month, the South American nation of Chile observes its independence day on Sept. 18.",
      "The White House so far has not mentioned any planned events. Last year, President Joe Biden hosted a reception and issued a proclamation for the occasion.",
      "Hispanic was a term coined by the federal government for people descended from Spanish-speaking cultures. But for some, the label has a connotation of political conservatism and emphasizes a connection to Spain. It sometimes gets mistakenly interchanged with \u201cLatino\u201d or \"Latinx.\u201d",
      "For some, Latino reflects their ties to Latin America. So some celebrations are referred to as Latinx or Latin Heritage Month.",
      "Latin Americans are not a monolith. There are several other identifiers for Latin Americans, depending largely on personal preference. Mexican Americans who grew up during the 1960s Civil Rights era may identify as Chicano. Other may go by their family\u2019s nation of origin such as Colombian American or Salvadoran American.",
      "Each culture has unique differences when it comes to music, food, art and other cultural touchstones.",
      "September typically has no shortage of festivities. Events often include traditional Latin foods and entertainment like mariachi bands, folkl\u00f3rico and salsa dance lessons. The intent is to showcase the culture of Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and other Latin countries.",

Another obstacle heritage celebrations face is the perception that they'd violate bans on DEI programming \u2014 something Trump has discouraged across federal agencies. Some companies and universities have followed suit.",
      "Early in September, organizers of a Mexican Independence festival in Chicago announced they would postpone celebrations due to Trump\u2019s promises of an immigration crackdown in the city.",
      "\u201cIt was a painful decision, but holding El Grito Chicago at this time puts the safety of our community at stake \u2014 and that\u2019s a risk we are unwilling to take,\u201d said the organizers of the festival.",
      "A new date has not yet been announced. Though Mexican Independence Day falls on Sept. 16, celebrations in Chicago typically span more than a week and draw hundreds of thousands of participants for lively parades, festivals, street parties and car caravans.",
      "\u201cThe fact that the federal government is sending troops as we start these celebrations is an insult,\u201d Illinois state Sen. Karina Villa, a Democrat, said at a news conference. \u201cIt is a fear tactic. It\u2019s unforgivable.\u201d",
      "Similarly, Sacramento's annual Mexican Independence Day festival was canceled with organizers citing the political climate and safety concerns.",
      "Other events that have been canceled include the Hispanic Heritage Festival of the Carolinas, Hispanic Heritage Fest in Kenner, Louisiana and FIESTA Indianapolis.",
      "Ivan Sandoval-Cervantes, an anthropology professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said when celebrations are canceled from the top down it affects how we see them throughout the country. Used to seeing celebrations in Las Vegas advertised, he has seen very little leading up to this year's heritage month.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s not being celebrated by a specific state that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be celebrated but they might go into the private sphere,\u201d Sandoval-Cervantes said. \u201cWhere it\u2019s safer to embrace the symbols or even speak Spanish.\u201d",
      "In Mexico, the government launched a new appeal to raise awareness among Mexican migrants to take every possible precaution during the holidays because any incident, such as while driving, could lead to a deportation.",

      "Samuel Lee Smithers, 72, is scheduled to die by lethal injection Oct. 14 at Florida State Prison. Smithers would be the 14th person set for execution in Florida in 2025, with DeSantis overseeing more executions in a single year than any other Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.",
      "DeSantis signed the death warrant Friday night, just a few days before the scheduled execution Wednesday of David Joseph Pittman. Another convicted killer, Victor Tony Jones, is set to die on Sept. 30.",
      "In the Smithers case, court records show he met his two victims \u2014 Christy Cowan and Denise Roach \u2014 on different dates at a Tampa motel to pay them for sex. At the time, he was doing landscape maintenance on a 27-acre property that included three ponds in rural Plant City, Florida.",
      "On May 28, 1996, property owner Marion Whitehurst \u2014 who had met Smithers in church where he was a Baptist deacon \u2014 stopped by to find Smithers cleaning an axe in the carport, which he claimed to be using to trim tree limbs.",

      "Almost instantly after Charlie Kirk was assassinated Wednesday at Utah Valley University, the news \u2014 captured on video in grisly detail \u2014 sent shockwaves through classrooms everywhere. Because no matter teens' political opinions, everyone knew Kirk.",
      "In high school classes in Spanish Fork, Utah, chatter spread fast Wednesday, as students learned of the shooting and began to wonder if Kirk would live or die. A cellphone ban meant many students didn\u2019t learn of Kirk\u2019s fate until the final bell \u2014 pushing tough conversations in class to the next day.",
      "\u201cBy the end of the day, I was worn out,\u201d said English teacher Andrew Apsley. He discussed the shooting with each of his four classes Thursday at Landmark High School, about 15 miles south of UVU.",
      "In the current political climate and with new cellphone bans, schools have tried to push social media and controversial topics to the sidelines, saying classes should focus on basic academics. Kirk\u2019s shooting upended all that.",
      "Graphic footage of Kirk\u2019s shooting on the Utah college campus was available almost immediately online, captured by cellphones from several angles. The videos, in slow motion and real-time speed, show a direct view of Kirk being shot, his body recoiling and blood gushing from his neck. The videos were easy to find on X, TikTok and Instagram.",
      "Many teens say they feel traumatized by what they saw. They couldn\u2019t escape the videos popping up on their social media feeds or being passed to them by friends and classmates. Some teens posted warnings that urged people not to click on the Kirk videos, saying they wished the visuals had come with trigger warnings.",
      "Apsley's 19-year-old child received a gruesome video of Kirk's death in a message from a friend. His child has autism and has difficulty processing emotions, so the video was \u201cpretty traumatic,\u201d Apsley said. That incident became a teaching moment for Apsley's students.",
      "\u201cI know we want to be first. I know we want to be the one to share the information that other people rely on,\u201d Apsley recalled telling his classes. \u201cBut at the same time, not everyone is well-equipped to handle something as graphic and violent as that.\u201d",

      "In Canada, Aidan Groves was in a college writing class when he saw a headline on Reddit that Kirk had been shot. He had not shared Kirk's political views, yet \u201cmy heart sank, and I was immediately on edge,\u201d said Groves, a student at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology in Calgary. He quickly swiped through comments, feeling overcome by horror and dread. Even so, he left his classroom to watch the video.",
      "Groves, 19, grew up watching his dad play video games with violent imagery, but he was struck by the video\u2019s immediacy and the crowd\u2019s frantic reaction. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anybody die, and immediately everybody in this crowd had just witnessed that,\u201d he said.",

      "After Koreans detained in a historic raid on a Georgia Hyundai plant were sent home, lawyers and social workers say the nearly 200 non-Korean workers ensnared in the crackdown remain in legal limbo",
      "Ever since a massive immigration raid on a Hyundai manufacturing site swept up nearly 500 workers in southeast Georgia, Rosie Harrison said her organization\u2019s phones have been ringing nonstop with panicked families in need of help.",
      "\u201cWe have individuals returning calls every day, but the list doesn\u2019t end,\u201d Harrison said. She runs an apolitical non-profit called Grow Initiative that connects low-income families \u2014 immigrant and non-immigrant alike \u2014 with food, housing and educational resources.",
      "Since the raid, Harrison said, \u201cfamilies are experiencing a new level of crisis.\u201d",
      "A majority of the 475 people who were detained in the workplace raid \u2014 which U.S. officials have called the largest in two decades \u2014 were Korean and have returned to South Korea. But lawyers and social workers say many of the non-Korean immigrants ensnared in the crackdown remain in legal limbo or are otherwise unaccounted for.",
      "As the raid began the morning of Sept. 4, workers almost immediately started calling Migrant Equity Southeast, a local nonprofit that connects immigrants with legal and financial resources. The small organization of approximately 15 employees fielded calls regarding people from Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and Venezuela, spokesperson Vanessa Contreras said.",
      "Throughout the day, people described federal agents taking cellphones from workers and putting them in long lines, Contreras said. Some workers hid for hours to avoid capture, in air ducts or remote areas of the sprawling property. The Department of Justice said some hid in a nearby sewage pond.",
      "People off-site called the organization frantically seeking the whereabouts of loved ones who worked at the plant and were suddenly unreachable.",
      "Like many of the Koreans who were working at the plant, advocates and lawyers representing the non-Korean workers caught up in the raid say that some who were detained had legal authorization to work in the United States.",
      "Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to emailed requests for comment Friday. It is not clear how many people detained during the raid remain in custody.",
      "Atlanta-based attorney Charles Kuck, who represents both Korean and non-Korean workers who were detained, said two of his clients were legally working under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was created by former President Barack Obama. One had been released and \u201cshould have never been arrested,\u201d he said, while the other was still being held because he was recently charged with driving under the influence.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say how they chose who they were going to release and who they were going to take into custody,\u201d Palacios said, adding that some who were arrested didn\u2019t have an alien identification number and were still unaccounted for.",

      "The financial impact of the raid at the construction site for a battery factory that will be operated by HL-GA Battery Co. was compounded by the fact that another massive employer in the area \u2014 International Paper Co. \u2014 is closing at the end of the month, laying off another 800 workers, Harrison said.",
      "Growth Initiative doesn\u2019t check immigration status, Harrison said, but almost all families who have reached out to her have said that their detained loved ones had legal authorization to work in the United States, leaving many confused about why their relative was taken into custody in the first place.",

      "Some would-be international students are not showing up on American campuses this fall despite offers of admission because of logjams with visa applications, which the Trump administration slowed this summer while it rolled out additional vetting. Others have had second thoughts because of the administration's wider immigration crackdown and the abrupt termination of some students' legal status.",
      "But none face bigger obstacles than the students hit with travel bans. Last year, the State Department issued more than 5,700 F-1 and J-1 visas \u2014 which are used by foreign students and researchers \u2014 to people in the 19 travel ban-affected countries between May and September. Citizens of Iran and Myanmar were issued more than half of the approved visas.",
      "Pouya Karami, a 17-year-old student from Shiraz, Iran, focused his college search entirely on the U.S. No other country offers the same research opportunities in science, he said. He was planning to study polymer chemistry this fall at Pittsburg State University in Kansas, but he had to shelve those plans because of the travel ban.",
      "Karami deferred admission until next year and is holding out hope. He is still preparing for his embassy interview and reaching out to U.S. politicians to reconsider the travel ban's restrictions on students.",
      "\u201cI'm doing everything I can about it,\u201d he said.",
      "The full travel ban affects citizens from 12 countries spanning Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the Caribbean. It blocks most people from obtaining new visas, although some citizens from the banned countries are exempt, such as green card holders, dual citizens and some athletes. Seven other countries have tighter restrictions that also apply to student visas.",
      "When Trump announced the travel ban in June, he cited high visa overstay rates and national security threats from unstable or adversarial foreign governments as reasons for putting countries on the list. He has called some of the countries\u2019 screening processes \u201cdeficient\u201d and said he plans to keep the ban in place until \u201cidentified inadequacies\u201d are addressed.",
      "In Myanmar, the family of one 18-year-old student made his education their top priority, saving paychecks for him to go abroad for college. They risked their stability so he could have the chance to live a better life, said the student, who asked to be identified by only his nickname, Gu Gu, because he is worried about being targeted by the Myanmar or U.S. government for expressing criticism.",
      "When he shared a screenshot of his acceptance letter to the University of South Florida in a family group chat, it exploded with celebratory emojis, Gu Gu said. He had been waiting for visa appointments to be announced when one night, his mother woke him to ask about news of a U.S. travel ban. In an instant, his plans to study at USF this fall were ruined.",
      "Many students his age in Myanmar have been drafted into the military or joined resistance groups since the military ousted the elected civilian government in 2021. While a civil war rages, he had been looking forward to simple freedoms in the U.S. like walking to school by himself or playing sports again.",

      "Saudi Arabia will host the Riyadh Comedy Festival, which organizers say will be the \"world's largest comedy festival,\" from Sept. 26 to Oct. 9. Some of North America's most popular comedians, along with comics from Europe and elsewhere, are featured on the bill, including Dave Chapelle, Kevin Hart and Bill Burr.",
      "The festival will be the latest in a series of sports and cultural events hosted by Saudi Arabia's government that critics say amount to an effort to obscure the country's reputation for rampant human rights abuses.",
      "\"The Saudi government has invested billions into high profile entertainment events like these in a deliberate effort to whitewash the country's human rights record and deflect from the egregious abuses that continue to happen inside of the country,\" Human Rights Watch researcher Joey Shea told CBS News. \"These investments are a part of the broader strategy to... have people thinking about a comedy event, for example, rather than the soaring number of executions that are happening inside of the country.\"",
      "HRW noted specifically the state execution of journalist Turki Al-Jasser, who was killed in June following seven years of detention after reportedly being identified as the author of several anonymous tweets criticizing the Saudi royal family.",
      "Al-Jasser had been convicted of terrorism and high treason on the basis of posts he was accused of authoring, according to UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay. Reporters Without Borders, an organization that works to protect journalists, branded the charges against him as \"false.\"",
      "\"This execution of a journalist went forward to very little international criticism and this is clearly a result of these billions that had been invested in the country's whitewashing strategy,\" Shea said.",
      "When asked whether they believed the comedians would be able to freely tell jokes at the festival, the HRW researcher predicted there would be clear red lines drawn by organizers to prevent any criticism of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, who has already taken over as ruler of the highly conservative Islamic kingdom, as well as his policies and the broader royal family.",
      "Shea called on the high-profile entertainers attending the event \u2014 funding for which comes from the Saudi government's General Entertainment Authority \u2014   to mitigate the positive effect that their presence might have on the country's reputation for human rights abuses, including by \"speaking out about the abuses.\"",
      "Tim Dillon, one of the comedians scheduled to perform at the Riyadh festival, claimed on his podcast that he's being paid $315,000 for a single show, and that some of his more famous colleagues would receive around $1.6 million for their appearances.",
      "CBS News has contacted the publicists representing billed attendees Bill Burr, Mark Normand, Kevin Hart, Sebastian Maniscalco, Dave Chapelle, Louis C.K., Whitney Cummings, Tom Segura, Andrew Schulz and Jim Jeffries, but has received no comment from any of them regarding their expected appearances in Saudi Arabia.",
      "CBS News asked Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment on HRW's assertions, but has not received a response.",

    "published": "Sun, 14 Sep 2025 10:18:50 -0400",
    "summary": "Now showing at Chicago's Art Institute, an exhibition of works by Gustave Caillebotte offers a fresh perspective on a French painter ripe for rediscovery.",
    "story": [
      "Monet \u2026 Degas \u2026 Renoir. When we think of French Impressionism, it's the usual suspects who spring to mind. But one lesser-known artist is ripe for rediscovery.",
      "\"Gustave Caillebotte is probably the least-known of the Impressionist painters,\" said Gloria Groom, co-curator of a new exhibition of the works of Caillebotte, now on display at the Art Institute of Chicago. \"I think he's still not completely integrated into that story. He's still kind of the outsider.\"",
      "The museum has long been home to the artist's most recognizable painting, \"Paris Street - Rainy Day.\"",
      "\"People, they may not know Gustave Caillebotte's name, but if you say the painting with the umbrellas, they all know it,\" said Groom. \"And so you start thinking, okay, it's all about this bourgeois couple walking down the street. But it's not, because there's a painter with a ladder, the charwoman who's opening her umbrella, all these different types of people.\"",
      "\"Paris Street - Rainy Day\" played a supporting role in the beloved movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\". While it was out on loan, museum-goers were bereft. \"We got letters,\" said Groom. \"But you can't be part of an exhibition to be a partner if you don't lend the major work for the exhibition. So, we made that sacrifice. And now we're celebrating its return.\"",
      "The exhibition looks at Caillebotte's work from a new perspective. While his peers were painting ballerinas and landscapes, Caillebotte's canvases focused on men to a degree unusual for the time.",
      "Groom said, \"He's looking at the men in his life, he's looking at the relationships. But he's not just doing, you know, macho masculinity. He's doing men in interiors, men on sofas, men looking out a window, kind of turning the tables in many ways.\"",
      "Some of the paintings scandalized the French art establishment. \"The Floor Scrapers\" was rejected from a prestigious art exhibition.",
      "And, at another exhibition, a painting featuring a nude man was relegated to a small, inaccessible room. \"It's a male nude, but not an Adonis,\" said Groom. \"It's shocking even today. It's a beautiful, beautiful painting, and it's sensuous. Let's face it, it's sensuous!\"",
      "When this exhibition opened in Paris last year with the title \"Painting Men,\" some critics condemned what they considered the show's insinuation of Caillebotte's homosexuality. The artist never married, but shared the last decade or so of his life with a female companion.",
      "But the show moved on to Chicago with a new title \u2013 \"Painting His World\" \u2013 which has others saying the changed title minimizes the artist's focus on the same sex.",
      "Gloria Groom says, quite simply, the paintings speak for themselves: \"The paintings are the paintings, and that's what we're interested in. We try to open it up to all kinds of interpretations, and people will see what they want to see.\"",
      "Gustave Caillebotte died in 1894. He was just 45. All these decades later, people are still seeing what they want to in his beguiling artistry.",

    "published": "Sun, 14 Sep 2025 10:16:52 -0400",
    "summary": "The actor-comedian talks about his new horror film \"Him,\" in which he plays an aging football superstar tempting a rookie quarterback with an evil bargain, and how he learned to turn personal loss into dramatic power.",
    "story": [
      "Just a stone's throw from the concert halls of New York's Lincoln Center is another place where creative dreams come true: LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, a launching pad for the most talented teens in New York. Liza Minnelli studied here; so did Billy Dee Williams, Jennifer Aniston, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, and Adrien Brody. \"A two-time Oscar-winner, look at that!\" said Brody's former classmate, Marlon Wayans, Class of 1990. \"Makes me so proud. We used to give him wedgies!\"",
      "As an actor, writer and producer, Wayans is behind some of the best-loved projects in recent memory, like the \"Scary Movie\" franchise, a comic satire of horror films. There have been five \"Scary\" movies (some without the Wayans brothers), but they're back at the helm for the upcoming #6 next year.",
      "And when he's not making movies, Marlon Wayans tours on the live stand-up comedy circuit. He also turns out streaming comedy specials like clockwork. \"Probably a year that I had a day off,\" he said. \"Probably three years since I had a vacation.\"",
      "I asked, \"What are you chasing?\"",
      "\"I don't know if I'm chasing, or if I'm running from something!\" he laughed. And for his latest role, he had to do both.",
      "In the new psychological horror film \"Him,\" a rookie quarterback (played by Tyriq Withers) wants to be the greatest. Marlon Wayans is an aging football superstar who's going to help him. At first he's a likeable coach, but he morphs into a something evil.",
      "Is he the Devil in this film? \"No, I think I'm just one of the people that the Devil uses to entice the people who sell their soul,\" Wayans said.",
      "To watch a trailer for the film \"Him,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The notion of trading your soul for athletic immortality is one of the all-time great storylines. You might recall \"Damn Yankees,\" with a hopeful fan striking a deal with the Devil. And as the Devil's advocate in \"Him,\" Wayans' character puts the rookie quarterback through hell. \"The movie seems like, 'Oh, you're selling your soul to the Devil.' The Devil exists every day, everywhere,\" Wayans said. \"At least 20 times a day you are gonna be faced with God or the Devil. So, it's a choice. Everything you do is a choice.\"",
      "It's a big change for someone raised on comedy. Marlon Wayans is the youngest of 10 siblings, in the comedy dynasty known as the Wayans family. He often worked with his brothers, like when he teamed up with Shawn as an undercover FBI agent in the 2004 cult favorite \"White Chicks.\"",
      "Family is still the bedrock of Wayans' life, and the passing of some close relatives and friends over the past few years hit especially hard, as he described in his 2024 special \"Good Grief\":",
      "\"I've been dodging depression for the last three years. I lost my momma three years ago. And let me tell you y'all something, ain't no pain, ain't no nothing like losing your momma.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you think losing all these people in such a short span of time, that pain, informs your acting?\"",
      "\"Yes, because I used to have to manufacture tears,\" Marlon said. \"My mother died ... it's all I gotta think about. It's right there. It's right behind my eyes. I don't need 20 minutes to go think about stuff no more.\"",
      "Wayans has learned how to turn personal loss into dramatic power. He was told he was the only one considered for his role in \"Him,\" a sign that his time may have finally come.",
      "He said, \"It took me doing the work for 53 years to feel special.\"",
      "\"You didn't feel special?\" I asked.",
      "\"I felt like I was working towards something.\"",
      "\"And now you feel like that something is here?\"",
      "\"I feel like it's never there, but it's getting closer,\" he replied.",
      "To date, Marlon Wayans' movies alone are said to have grossed nearly $2 billion, and there are more on the way. But he says he'll never forget LaGuardia, the unique school where it all started. \"I'll always love this city, and I'll always love this school. This is my baby for life. I hope these kids know how good they got it.\"",
      "He almost didn't get to go. His father didn't want him to attend. \"Nah, my dad, he was super-religious, and he was kind of a homophobe; he didn't want me wearing tights! 'Cause you have to wear tights when you come to this school.\"",
      "The late LaGuardia drama teacher Peter Treitler gave him permission to wear sweatpants instead, a little thing that changed Marlon's life forever.",
      "Mr. Treitler's words are still alive in Marlon's heart: \"He said, 'I'll make a deal with you: If you go to this school, you work harder than anybody else here, and you be special.' Young people need people that believe in them and see they're great. But young people gotta do the work so they can see they're great.\"",
      "\"Well, that's the thing, is you took that and ran with it,\" I said.",
      "Wayans replied, \"I'm still running with it.\"",

    "story": [
      "In the bustling heart of Manhattan, the women behind the luxury fashion label Veronica Beard are running a brand that has become synonymous with modern American style. And in a twist of fate, they share more than just their company; they share a name.",
      "Veronica Swanson Beard and Veronica Miele Beard first met at a wedding, where they were seated next to each other. That day, Swanson Beard made two important connections.",
      "\"I met my husband and my work wife all at that wedding,\" she told CBS Saturday Morning with a laugh.",
      "Their their lives began on opposite coasts: Miele Beard grew up in North Caldwell, New Jersey, raised by a single mother, while Swanson Beard was raised in California as an heir to the Swanson frozen-food fortune. The two became sisters-in-law when they married brothers. As their families grew, so did their careers. Swanson Beard pursued fashion, while Miele Beard thrived in finance. What the women shared was a passion for style.",
      "\"Since I was four years old, that's been my dream,\" said Swanson Beard. \"Fashion was the greatest expression of yourself. You could wake up and be whoever you wanted to be.\"",
      "For Miele Beard, even on Wall Street, what she wore was a statement of confidence and authority in a male-dominated environment.",
      "But when it came to dressing for work, both women noticed something missing: a staple piece that could anchor a modern woman's wardrobe. Their answer was inspired by history. In the 1840s, detachable shirtfronts known as \"dickeys\" gave men the appearance of a full shirt beneath their waistcoat without the bulk. Reimagining that idea, the duo designed a tailored blazer with an interchangeable insert.",
      "In 2010, their namesake label, Veronica Beard, was born, along with its now-iconic Dickey Jacket. The early days were anything but glamorous. Swanson Beard set up a makeshift showroom in her apartment, juggling young children and a dog, while Miele Beard announced mid-launch that she was pregnant with her fifth child. Between the two, they had eight children and a fledgling business.",
      "Their breakthrough came with Saks Fifth Avenue, which gave the brand its first major retail platform. From there, Veronica Beard rapidly grew, and today boasts 42 stores worldwide, including a flagship location on Madison Avenue in New York City.",
      "\"It was the most thrilling moment of our career,\" Swanson Beard said of the store opening. \"It was the physical manifestation of all of our hopes and dreams.\"",
      "Fifteen years later, the brand has evolved into a full lifestyle label, offering ready-to-wear, denim, shoes, and handbags, while still promoting the power of a great blazer.",
      "\"We love the idea of the uniform being your blazer with jeans,\" said Miele Beard. \"Get your best pair of jeans, throw on a white tank and a jacket, and you're done. You've just elevated your style.\"",
      "The Dickey Jacket remains the brand's signature piece. When Gwyneth Paltrow featured it on Goop, the Beards knew they had made it.",
      "\"For us, that was like being on Oprah's list,\" Swanson Beard said.",
      "Beyond fashion, the duo is committed to giving back. Their philanthropic initiative, Veronica Beard Gives Back, supports causes including Feeding America, the American Heart Association, and the Council of Fashion Designers of America.",
      "Their mission resonates with the women who choose their clothes. Recently, Katherine, Princess of Wales wore a Veronica Beard dress to announce she had completed her cancer treatment.",
      "\"She could have chosen a power suit to say, 'I'm strong,'\" said Swanson Beard. \"Instead, she chose something feminine and earthy. I was so emotional about it.\"",
      "At its heart, Veronica Beard is more than a label; it's a mantra.",
      "\"We always say our battle cry is 'make it happen,'\" Swanson Beard explained. \"For us, being the clothes on a woman's back when she's making it happen is the greatest thing in the world.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Sep 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "With the U.S. economy facing headwinds, the Federal Reserve faces pressure to trim interest rates this week for the first time since December 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's rate decision on Wednesday is shaping up to be its most consequential of the year, with most economists predicting the first cut of 2025. The real suspense is over how deep the reduction could be \u2014 and whether the Fed might signal a broader pivot that could set the course for the rest of the year.",
      "So far, the Fed has resisted calls from President Trump to cut its benchmark interest rate, which helps determine borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Mr. Trump has pointed to the fact that inflation has remained\u00a0relatively muted, so far this year, as evidence the central bank has been too late in lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Apart from Mr. Trump's push for a cut, the Federal Reserve is facing growing economic uncertainty ahead of its Sept. 17 meeting, raising the stakes for a rate decision.",
      "On the one hand, the labor market is showing signs of distress, with hiring slowing to a standstill, which would argue for a cut. But inflation is also creeping higher under the weight of the Trump administration's tariffs, an issue that the Fed has pointed to as its reason for keeping the benchmark rate unchanged so far this year.",
      "Adding to the complications is Mr. Trump's pressure on the Fed to reduce rates. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has responded by stressing the independence of the Federal Reserve, pointing out that the Federal Open Market Committee, its 12-member rate-setting group, relies on economic data to make its policy decisions, rather than political pressure.",
      "\"The committee tries to get a complete picture of the biggest downside risks for the economy, and then at the end of the meeting, there needs to be some sort of weighting \u2014 it's an art as much as science,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, an economics professor at Villanova University.",
      "When will the Fed announce its rate decision?",
      "The Fed will announce its next rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Sept. 17.",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point cut stands at 96%, according to CME FedWatch, which relies on 30-day Fed Funds futures prices to determine the likelihood. There's only a 4% probability of a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, the tracker says.",
      "Economists will also be listening for whether the Fed provides guidance on whether it expects additional rate cuts at its next two meetings in 2025, set for Oct. 29 and Dec. 10.",
      "What data will determine the Fed's decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep inflation low while also ensuring full employment.",
      "But those two goals can be in conflict with each other because rising inflation requires the Fed to boost interest rates, which tamps down spending by making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow. The Fed's best weapon for fighting high unemployment, however, is to cut rates, as that makes it cheaper for businesses to expand and hire more workers.",
      "Fed officials will be closely scrutinizing inflation and jobs data as they determine which side of the dual mandate needs more attention.",
      "While the inflation rate has receded from its 2022 peak, it's still far above the Fed's goal for a 2% annual rate, and has inched up in recent months as the Trump administration's tariffs ripple through the economy, pushing some prices higher.",
      "Meanwhile, the labor market is showing signs of distress, with many sectors \u2014 including manufacturing, which Mr. Trump has vowed to revive \u2014 shedding jobs in August. The result is a marked slowdown in hiring, with employers adding an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus about 106,000 workers each month in 2024.",
      "\"It's going to be very difficult, but it will be weighing these two conflicting objectives,\" Kersting noted.",
      "How does the Fed compare with other central banks?",
      "Mr. Trump's has criticized the Fed's decision to hold off on cutting this year by pointing to decisions by other central banks, such as the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, to reduce their borrowing costs.",
      "\"Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had ZERO. No inflation, great economy \u2014 We should be at least two to three points lower,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media in June.",
      "Yet the U.S. is facing an issue that isn't as pressing for other nations: Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "Because the tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. businesses directly to the federal government, the cost is largely borne by American companies and consumers \u2014 not other nations. The White House has said exporters abroad bear the brunt of tariffs, while Trump administration officials make the case that more balanced trade with U.S. economic partners over the longer term will create jobs, energize the manufacturing sector and generate federal revenue.",
      "Fed Chair Powell has pointed to the tariffs as a reason the Fed has wanted to keep its powder dry, given that many economists believe the import duties will reignite inflation in the U.S.",
      "The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a closed watched inflation gauge, rose at annual rate of 2.9% in August, the sharpest pickup since January. Heavily imported goods, such as coffee, audio equipment and household furniture, saw some of the steepest price hikes last month, CPI data shows.",
      "How are American consumers holding up?",
      "Many Americans are souring on the economy, feeling pressured by higher costs for everything from housing to groceries.",
      "A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that two-thirds of Americans said prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise, and about the same share said they expect that to continue. More than half of consumers said the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only about one-quarter said they believe it's improving.",
      "The CPI has steadily risen since April, when it fell to an annual rate of 2.3%, or just above the Fed's 2% target.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has pointed to mortgage rates that were close to 7% for much of 2025 as a reason for a faltering housing market.",
      "\"Could somebody please inform Jerome 'Too Late' Powell that he is hurting the Housing Industry, very badly? People can't get a Mortgage because of him. There is no Inflation, and every sign is pointing to a major Rate Cut,\" the president wrote\u00a0in an Aug.19 post on social media.",
      "But mortgage rates are determined by several factors beyond the Fed's benchmark rate, including the strength of the U.S. economy and the 10-year Treasury note. Already, rates have declined in recent weeks, dipping to 6.35% for the week of Sept. 11, in anticipation of the Fed's cut and weaker economic data.",
      "Even so, a rate cut could help some consumers by lowering their borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"A declining interest rate environment will provide some relief for borrowers,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"Whether it's a homeowner with a 7% mortgage or a recent graduate hoping to refinance student loans and credit card debt, lower rates can ease the burden on many indebted households by opening opportunities to refinance or consolidate.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Senate on Monday confirmed economist and Trump adviser Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, giving President Trump more influence over the Fed just one day before central bank officials will meet to decide whether to cut interest rates.",
      "Miran was confirmed 48-47 for a term that runs until January, filling a vacancy created last month when Biden appointee Adriana Kugler stepped down before the end of her term. Miran currently chairs the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. In an unusual move, he's said he will take an unpaid leave of absence from that job while serving on the Fed board instead of resigning altogether, citing \"the short duration of the appointment.\"",
      "Miran is arriving at the central bank in time for a crucial Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, during which 12 top Fed officials \u2014 including Miran \u2014 will discuss monetary policy and decide whether to change the Fed's target interest rate. The committee is widely expected to vote for a rate cut, after leaving rates stable so far this year.",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Fed officials for not cutting interest rates sooner, nicknaming Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" \u2014 pressuring a central bank that typically operates independently. The president favors a rate cut because it could boost economic growth and slash borrowing costs for American consumers, but the move could risk causing inflation to heat up.",
      "The Senate Banking Committee advanced Miran's nomination in a party-line vote last week, after lawmakers grilled him on whether he would preserve the Fed's independence.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the committee's top Democrat, alleged last week Miran's nomination was part of a gambit by Mr. Trump to \"seize personal control of the Fed,\" citing his decision not to fully resign from his White House role.",
      "\"He will have zero credibility with markets, zero credibility with businesses, and zero credibility with the public if he is confirmed to the Board under these circumstances,\" Warren said.",
      "But Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who chairs the committee, lauded Miran, saying he \"brings deep experience, proven leadership and a clear commitment to ensuring that the American economy remains strong and competitive.\"",
      "Miran said in a hearing earlier this month he believes the \"independence of monetary policy is a critical element for [the Fed's] success,\" and \"I intend to preserve that independence.\"",
      "Miran also said he would \"absolutely resign\" from the Council of Economic Advisers if he is confirmed to a longer term on the Fed board after his four-month appointment runs out.",
      "In a written questionnaire for senators, Miran didn't rule out attending meetings for the White House's Council of Economic Advisers and consulting with CEA staff, but \"only in my capacity as a member of the Fed and to the extent appropriate for a member of the Fed in the normal course of business.\" He also said he will not have access to his CEA email while at the Fed.",
      "The Miran nomination is just one move by Mr. Trump that could reshape the central bank.",
      "The president moved to fire Fed board member Lisa Cook last month, accusing her of making false statements on mortgage documents. Cook argued the firing was unlawful, and a judge ruled last week that Cook can remain on the board while a lawsuit plays out. The Trump administration asked an appeals court to halt that ruling before this week's interest rate meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump will also have an opportunity to pick a new Fed chair when Powell's term ends in May. The president has floated firing Powell before then, but the idea is legally untested.",
      "Two other Fed board members \u2014 Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 were confirmed during Mr. Trump's first term. If the president succeeds in firing Cook and replacing Powell and Kugler, five of the Fed Board of Governor's seven members will be Trump nominees.",

      "Bessent said the agreement is \"between two private parties\" and that \"the commercial terms have been agreed upon.\" He said the talks in Spain centered around the future of the app.",

      "Last year, Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed a bill that essentially gave TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, an ultimatum: either divest from TikTok or face a ban in the United States. The Supreme Court upheld the law in a unanimous 9-0 decision. But Mr. Trump has issued a series of orders unilaterally delaying its enforcement. The latest came in June, when he pushed back the deadline for enforcing the measure until Sept. 17.",
      "The president's orders have directed the Justice Department\u00a0not to take action or impose penalties against tech companies like Apple and Google for failing to comply with the law by allowing TikTok on their platforms.",
      "Mr. Trump's extensions have come as the U.S. tries to negotiate an agreement that would separate the hugely popular video-sharing app from ByteDance. The Trump administration appeared close to a deal in the spring, which would have spun TikTok's U.S.-based operations into a new company owned and operated by a majority of American investors, and allowed ByteDance to maintain a minority stake. But Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports scuttled the proposed deal.",
      "ByteDance, however, refuted then that an agreement had been reached because there were still key issues unresolved. TikTok's parent company said any deal regarding the app's future would be subject to approval by the Chinese government.",
      "Under the law, passed with bipartisan support by Congress in April 2024, TikTok had until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 16:10:43 -0400",
    "summary": "Experts say Americans shouldn't expect a further decline in mortgage rates immediately after the Fed's September meeting.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower its benchmark interest rate this week for the first time since December of 2024. A rate cut would give Americans a sliver of relief on a wide range of loans, but would it bring down mortgage rates?",
      "Average rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.35%\u00a0this week, its lowest level in nearly a year, as financial markets have preemptively priced in a Fed cut when policymakers meet Sept. 16-17.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages \u2014 popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans \u2014 also fell. The average rate slipped to 5.5% from 5.6% last week. A year ago, it was 5.27%.",
      "With that in mind, experts say homeowners should not expect an immediate drop in mortgage costs should the central bank officially cut its rate on Thursday.",
      "Here's what to know about how monetary policy affects mortgage rates.",
      "What influence does the Fed have on mortgage rates?",
      "The Federal Reserve does not directly impact mortgage rates. Instead, it sets what is known as the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for overnight loans.",
      "\"The Fed is setting short-term interest rates,\" Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Things like the mortgage rates are longer-term interest rates.\"",
      "While Fed rate cuts directly affect short-term interest rates, such as on certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts, they also impact the broader lending environment, experts note.",
      "Adjustable-rate mortgages, for instance, are more sensitive to changes in the federal funds rate because they are tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), a short-term market index.",
      "Fixed-rate mortgages, meanwhile, tend to move in the same direction as the bond market, particularly the 10-year Treasury note, because they are both long-term instruments with relatively stable risk,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Brookings Institute, a nonprofit public policy organization.",
      "\"They're maybe not pressed up against one another, but they're sort of moving in the same direction,\" said Krimmel.",
      "The upshot is that conventional mortgage loans have terms of 15 to 30 years (adjustable-rate loans have shorter terms), so investors are more focused on the longer-term economic conditions reflected in Treasury rates than in the Fed's short-term lending horizon.",
      "Yields on the 10-year Treasury note bounced around this year due to concerns over tariffs and what the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would mean for the economy, Stephen Kates, an analyst at personal finance website Bankrate, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders use the yield on 10-year Treasurys as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4% Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"Investor sentiments, how bonds are being bought and sold, expectations of inflation are all going to impact those longer-term rates,\" Kates said.",
      "What impact could a Fed cut have on mortgage rates?",
      "Experts say lenders have already been lowering their rates ahead of a likely rate cut by the Fed. The average rate on both 30-year mortgages and 15-year mortgages have inched down at the same time that several fed governors and Fed Chair Jerome Powell have signaled support for slashing interest rates, Krimmel pointed out.",
      "Kates agreed. \"A lot of the decrease that we've seen in the last four to six weeks has been in anticipation by some of this cut,\" he said.",
      "Banks and other enders often lower their rates in anticipation of a Fed cut. In September 2024, for example, mortgage rates declined to a two-year low ahead of what turned out to be an unusually large 0.50 percentage point reduction by Fed officials. This is why the rate offers you see now, at the start of the month, may not look much different from those you see later in September, once the cut is official.",
      "Fed interest rate policy is just one of the factors that can affect the cost of home loans, note experts. A range of other factors can also play a role, including the rate of inflation, job growth, consumer spending and housing demand, as well as global events and other government policies.",
      "Because financial markets are forward-looking, any statements made by Powell on the direction of monetary policy could have more of an impact on the housing market than a rate cut itself, according to Krimmel.",
      "\"That might be where there is actually some action with the bond markets or with mortgage rates, because he might give some hints about where the Fed is headed in the future,\" he said.",

      "Facebook users are receiving a portion of the $725 million after administrative costs and lawyers' fees are paid out.",
      "The payments are based on how many people filed claims, as well as how long each claimant was using Facebook during the 15-year period covered by the settlement.",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:09:58 -0400",
    "summary": "CBS News looked at the cost of producing coal, gas, nuclear, wind and solar energy to determine which is the cheapest.",
    "story": [
      "The emergence of renewable energy like wind and solar as a viable alternative to oil, gas and other fossil fuels has raised critical questions about which form of power offers the best value today \u2014 a debate made all the more urgent by the ravages of climate change.",
      "In the U.S., where energy policy has been shaped by politics for more than a century, the battle continues to play out at the highest levels of government. Former President Biden delivered one of the biggest endorsements of renewable energy in the form of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offered tax credits and rebates to businesses, organizations and households that invest in solar, wind and geothermal technologies.",
      "By contrast, President Trump has been a staunch supporter of the oil and gas industry. During his inauguration speech in January, he reaffirmed his commitment to fossil fuel production, saying, \"We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet. That will help to do it.\"",
      "Within six months of taking office, Mr. Trump signed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" into law, which phases out clean energy tax incentives while simultaneously expanding tax breaks for the oil and gas industries. Separately, his administration has pared back offshore wind leasing and made it more difficult for clean energy projects to qualify for federal dollars.",
      "On the global trade front, Mr. Trump has issued a flurry of tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, which experts say will translate into higher costs for energy projects that rely on imports. The White House is pushing these policies amid concerns over rising U.S. energy prices, with average electricity costs up 5.5% from a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "To get to the bottom of which form of energy is the cheapest, CBS News analyzed the cost to produce coal, gas, nuclear, wind and solar energy, including the impact of tax incentives, tariffs and other factors.",
      "Determining the cheapest form of energy",
      "Multiple criteria come into play in trying to assess the cheapest form of energy. These include consumers' monthly costs; the cost to produce energy; and the potential social cost energy production can have on a community's health and the environment. External factors like tax incentives and fluctuations in the economy also can affect the price it costs to heat and cool our homes.",
      "CBS News set out to answer the question using what's called the Levelized Cost of Energy, or LCOE, a commonly cited benchmark for wholesale energy costs. LCOE is the price that a power-generating facility must receive for its electricity to cover all its expenses \u2014 including capital, equipment, maintenance and other financing costs \u2014 over the lifespan of a project.",
      "A 2025 LCOE report from investment bank Lazard shows the cost to produce energy without any government subsidies and how that changes when you layer in other factors, such as tax subsidies provided under the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Yet while LCOE calculations are widely used, they don't offer a full picture when it comes to evaluating the cost and value of energy, experts told CBS News. Other factors, such as interest rates and federal regulations, can also have a major impact on the cost of building and operating energy infrastructure.",
      "LCOE also doesn't account for the value a given form of energy delivers. For example, because solar and wind are affected by the weather, they tend to be less consistent than oil and gas, meaning a backup source of energy may be necessary.",
      "\"You have to talk about, what is the additional cost of balancing that production from a resource that doesn't produce all the time?\" Severin Borenstein, faculty director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, told CBS News.",
      "How tax subsidies factor in",
      "The U.S. government has a long history of using tax subsidies to encourage energy production. Oil and gas companies have benefited from such support for more than a century. By comparison, only in recent decades have renewable energy projects drawn a larger share of federal dollars.",
      "Lazard's report shows how the LCOE for renewable energy fluctuates when you account for certain provisions of the IRA aimed at lowering the cost of developing clean energy projects. Those include the investment tax credit (ITC), production tax credit (PTC) and energy community bonus, which increases the value of the ITC and PTC by 10% for projects in certain areas.",
      "Lazard's calculations assume these credits will be in place for 10 years. Notably, however, the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law by Mr. Trump this summer is slated to phase out those credits over the next two years.",
      "Although Lazard examines how the IRA affects renewable energy prices, it doesn't factor in any government subsidies flowing to the oil and gas industry, which vary widely and can be difficult to assess.",
      "The Environmental and Energy Study Institute, a bipartisan nonprofit research group,\u00a0estimates that direct U.S. subsidies to the fossil fuel industry amount to at least $20 billion per year. However, the FracTracker Alliance, a nonprofit focused on the impact of fossil fuels,\u00a0says the industry receives an estimated $760 billion annually in government subsidies and tax breaks.",
      "More benefits will go to the oil and gas industries under the \"big, beautiful bill.\" A June report from the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the legislation will funnel nearly $18 billion in tax incentives to the oil and gas industry over the next 10 years.",
      "Oil and gas companies have lauded the new law as a win for the industry. Sunil Mathew, chief financial officer of Occidental Petroleum, said during a recent company earnings call that the measure \"will provide significant cash tax benefits to Oxy.\" He expects the law will save Occidental $700 million to $800 million in \"cash taxes\" by the end of next year.",
      "How do tariffs factor into energy production costs?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are also projected to alter the cost it takes to fund energy projects in the U.S. To gauge the impact of tariffs on energy costs, CBS News turned to a model created by global data and analytics company Wood Mackenzie.",
      "In the following chart, dark green indicates a scenario in which the U.S. hasn't applied any country-level tariffs, but still maintains levies on copper, steel and aluminum imports; the medium shade of green represents current baseline tariffs imposed by the U.S. since Mr. Trump resumed office in January through August 7; and the light green indicates if trade relations with a U.S. economic partner is likely to worsen or deteriorate.",
      "As depicted, U.S. tariffs are projected to hit battery storage production the hardest. Chris Seiple, vice chairman of the power and renewables group at Wood Mackenzie, noted that while some energy equipment is produced domestically, other tech, such as battery cells, mostly comes from abroad, making them more susceptible to tariffs.",
      "\"The vast majority of our battery cells come from China,\" he said. \"And so the cost of a battery project is going to go up by a certain percentage.\"",
      "This could lead to what Seiple described as a \"whack-a-mole\" effect, in which over time companies move their manufacturing to non-tariffed countries to avoid an additional financial burden.",
      "What is the cheapest form of energy?",
      "Given these multiple and interconnected factors, what ends up being the cheapest form of energy to produce?",
      "According to Lazard, renewables remain the most cost-competitive form of generating and distributing energy. Onshore wind, which runs from $37 to $86 per megawatt-hour ($/MWh), is the most affordable on a baseline level and when tax subsidies are included.",
      "Utility scale solar \u2014 what most people think of when they hear about solar energy \u2014 is the next most cost-effective approach, with costs ranging from $38 to $78 per megawatt-hour.",
      "Fossil fuel and nuclear energy sources are more expensive to generate. Coal costs $71 to $173 per megawatt-hour; gas costs $48 to $109; and U.S. nuclear costs $141 to $220, Lazard found.",
      "The main reasons for these differences in cost? Experts told CBS News that while the capital cost for renewable projects is steep, the expense of operating and maintaining such facilities tends to be lower than that associated with fossil fuel production.",
      "\"Wind and solar you basically do all the investment up front, and then it operates \u2014 not quite for free \u2014 but at extremely low operating costs per kilowatt hour,\" Borenstein said.",
      "With fossil fuels, the cost of oil, gas and coal \u2014 which can be volatile \u2014 is another key factor.",
      "\"For a natural gas-fired power plant, you have to buy the natural gas,\" he explained. \"And likewise, a coal-fired power plant, you have to buy the coal. And so the price\u2026 is going to fluctuate.\"",
      "Experts who spoke with CBS News agreed that renewable energy ends up being the most competitive when it comes to costs. Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a Washington, D.C. consulting firm, concurred that solar and wind are the cheapest to run. Natural gas is the most affordable source of backup energy, which is necessary to make sure power is available around the clock, he said.",
      "Seiple said if you need a small amount of inexpensive electricity, solar is the way to go. It's \"low cost to build, it can be deployed quickly and modularly, the fuel is free and not volatile in price, and the ongoing maintenance costs are minimal,\" he said. \"And if the U.S. didn't penalize it with tariffs, it would be even lower cost.\"",
      "Despite such advantages for renewable energy, experts say the U.S. shouldn't put all of its eggs in one basket. Multiple sources told CBS News that what's needed is a diversity of energy options that can meet the country's\u00a0rising demand for electricity. Taking certain forms of energy out of the mix would compromise the system as a whole, they note.",
      "\"There is no one cheapest form that you can run the whole system on, and in fact, it depends on combining them in ways to [get] the cheapest possible cost,\" Borenstein said.",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:55:02 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says getting rid of a quarterly reporting requirement for public companies would lower costs and help businesses.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump says he wants to ditch a staple of U.S. financial markets: quarterly earnings reports.",
      "If Mr. Trump's push is successful, the change would eliminate a requirement that's been in place for 55 years, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, mandating quarterly reports\u00a0since 1970.",
      "Instead, the president said he wants to replace quarterly reporting with a new SEC rule requiring that companies disclose their financial data every six months. Providing companies with a longer ramp for issuing their reports would \"save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday in his social media post.",
      "\"Did you ever hear the statement that, 'China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis???' Not good!!!\" he added.",
      "The idea is far from new, with academic and business experts suggesting such a change in years past, for similar reasons as those cited by Mr. Trump. During his first term, Mr. Trump had asked the SEC to examine the three- versus six-month reporting requirement, although no change was made.",
      "But Mr. Trump's renewed push could make such a corporate overhaul more likely today, TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a Monday research report.",
      "\"We start with a 60% probability that the SEC switches to semi-annual from quarterly reporting, though the fact that this is an easy win for [SEC Chairman Paul] Atkins to deliver to Trump causes our bias to be that the prospects for action are more likely to rise than to fall,\" Seiberg noted.",
      "Here's what to know about the idea.",
      "Why is Mr. Trump proposing this now?",
      "There are some new pushes from the corporate sector.",
      "The Long Term Stock Exchange \u2014 a national securities exchange \u2014 said last week that it plans to petition the SEC to do away with the quarterly requirement. The San Francisco-based exchange lists companies focused on long-term goals, with its founder Eric Ries criticizing the financial markets for pushing businesses to prioritize short-term wins.",
      "The proposed change also aligns with the Trump administration's goal to ease regulatory burdens on companies, which it has said would help unlock economic growth by reducing businesses' costs.",
      "What's the benefit?",
      "Supporters of the change say quarterly reporting is too costly and time-consuming and discourages companies from wanting to go public. They also say company executives focus too much on hitting quarterly earnings targets and not enough on long-term planning.",
      "Is there a downside?",
      "Those who favor quarterly earnings say the reports provide investors with valuable financial updates and make them aware of any new risks the company is facing. Six-month reviews would deprive investors of those important insights, they argue.",
      "\"This might be great for long-term company builders, but terrible for public market investors who need timely data,\" noted one executive, Sam Kampner, the founder of analysis firm SalesCraft AI, on social media on Monday. \"[H]aving less information means you'd be making less-informed investment decisions.\"",
      "What does the data show?",
      "A 2018 study published in the Harvard Business Review looked at a similar change in the U.K., which stopped requiring quarterly reporting in 2014. The results were \"nuanced and falls somewhere between the two extreme narratives,\" Shivaram Rajgopal, a professor at Columbia Business School, wrote in the Harvard report.",
      "\"Moving away from quarterly reporting did not end corporate short-termism and earnings management, but nor did it destroy all transparency, leaving investors in the dark,\" he added.",
      "What's the timeframe for making a change?",
      "At least half a year, with TD Cowen's Seiberg noting that he believes it will take the SEC six months to create a proposal based on economic data.",
      "\"Key indicators of the issue gaining momentum will be if Atkins discusses the issue in his public speeches in the coming months and if it ends up on the agenda for the SEC's Investor Advisory Committee,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration wants an appeals court to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before an interest rate meeting next week.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration asked a federal appeals court Thursday to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in time for a crucial meeting next week when Fed officials will decide whether to lower interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook from the Federal Reserve's powerful Board of Governors last month, accusing her of falsely claiming two different homes as her principal residence in mortgage documents. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb blocked the firing on Tuesday, concluding that the president \"has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal.\" Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be removed \"for cause.\"",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to stay that ruling while the government appeals it. The Justice Department argued that the president has broad discretion to remove federal officials, including to decide whether \"cause\" exists, and courts have \u2014 at most \u2014 extremely narrow authority to review those decisions.",
      "\"Here, the evidence\u2014which Cook has yet to offer contrary explanation for\u2014was that she applied for two loans for her personal benefit, and was able to obtain favorable interest rates by misrepresenting where she lived,\" the government argued Thursday. \"Regardless of whether that misconduct occurred before or during office, it indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy for the whole Nation.\"",
      "Those allegations surfaced in a letter from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee who cited mortgage papers for homes that Cook bought in Georgia and Michigan in 2021. Abbe Lowell, an attorney representing Cook, called the government's accusations \"unsubstantiated and vague.\"",
      "The government requested that the appeals court act by the end of the day on Monday, noting that the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Cook's attorneys asked the appellate court to deny the Trump administration's request, calling it \"wholly unwarranted.\"",
      "\"An administrative stay would threaten Governor Cook's participation in next week's meeting and potentially plunge the FOMC's vote into turmoil,\" Cook's attorneys wrote in court papers. \"In addition, it has the real potential of impacting domestic and foreign markets. The Government has provided no justification for such a grave disruption of the status quo.\"",
      "The appeals court directed the government to reply to Cook's filing by Sunday at 3 p.m., making a ruling before then unlikely.",
      "Why does the Fed committee matter?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 which includes Cook, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and 10 other top central bank officials \u2014 is responsible for setting the Fed's interest rate targets, which have a major impact on economic growth, inflation and borrowing costs. The panel typically acts independently, with little input from elected officials.",
      "The committee has voted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, but investors and economists widely expect it to reduce rates at next week's meeting. Rate cuts could lead to stronger economic growth, but at the risk of causing inflation to heat up.",
      "Mr. Trump has tangled with the Fed for months over its decision to keep rates steady, nicknaming Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" and arguing the rate-setting committee should overrule him. Powell's term ends in May.",
      "Amid that pressure, Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in late August. A Biden appointee, Cook's term on the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors is set to end in 2038. The allegations against Cook are not related to Mr. Trump's push against the Fed, but if she is removed from the board, the president could pick her replacement, giving him more influence over the central bank.",

    "summary": "Consumer sentiment dropped in September. Here's why Americans are down on the economy.",
    "story": [
      "Consumer sentiment continued to slide in September, falling to its lowest point since May, as\u00a0tariffs seep into product prices\u00a0and Americans start to spend more cautiously.",
      "The University of Michigan's preliminary September sentiment index, released Friday, declined 4.8% to 55.4 from 58.2 in August.",
      "\"Consumers continue to note multiple vulnerabilities in the economy, with rising risks to business conditions, labor markets, and inflation. Likewise, consumers perceive risks to their pocketbooks as well,\" Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at U. of Michigan,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "Tariff policies are top of mind for many Americans, too, she said, noting that about 60% of consumers raised the topic in interviews.",
      "Inflation expectations for the year remained steady at 4.8%. Consumers' long-run inflation expectations, however, rose for a second straight month to 3.9% in September, according to the survey, as consumers become aware of \"what tariffs mean for them,\" High Frequency Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "A separate U. of Michigan report on trade policy and consumer spending found that most U.S. adults plan to spend less on goods that are subject to tariff-related price hikes. Just 24% of consumers surveyed said they expected to spend as usual on items that have large price increases, according to the August report.",
      "\"The corrosive uncertainty surrounding tariffs, other economic policies and immigration, continues to weigh on consumer sentiment, High Frequency Economics analysts said in a research note. \"Rising consumer prices and the reality of the consequences of tariffs are just starting to be felt by consumers. They are saying, 'Ouch!'\"",
      "Sentiment declined most among low-income households, who are most vulnerable to the effects of tariffs, which are a regressive tax. Such households \"won't benefit from recent equity gains and will feel the sticker shock of tariffs most acutely,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note. \"We expect tariffs and fiscal policy changes will widen the bifurcation of American consumers.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Sep 2025 12:01:15 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration's tariffs are slowly rippling through the economy and starting to push up prices for some products, government data shows.",
    "story": [
      "For much of 2025, the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs defied forecasts\u00a0that the import duties would drive up inflation. But that reprieve appears to be over, with economic data this week showing the tariffs are now pushing prices higher.",
      "The Consumer Price Index in August rose at a rate of 2.9% from a year ago, accelerating from the previous month as President Trump's tariffs filtered through the economy. Heavily imported goods saw some of the steepest price hikes last month, the data show. The increase represents the fastest rate of inflation since January, when Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his second term.",
      "Although the tariffs were first announced in April on what Mr. Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" their implementation was largely delayed as the administration negotiated new trade deals with multiple nations over the ensuing months. That gave U.S. companies time to prepare for the new import duties, which are paid by U.S. businesses directly to the federal government.",
      "Facing the prospect of sharply higher tariffs, some American companies scrambled to stock up on the imported goods and parts they use in their business, postponing the need to raise customer prices. Others absorbed the levies instead of passing them along to consumers.",
      "But many companies are now pulling back from those strategies, economic data shows. According to the Federal Reserve's latest \"Beige Book\" survey, which includes responses from businesses, economists and other sources, tariff-related price hikes were visible across the U.S. in August.",
      "Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland,\u00a0recently told CBS News that some companies facing a hit to their profit margins have no choice but to start passing on tariff-related costs to consumers.",
      "Among the companies to say they are raising prices for some goods as tariffs take effect are\u00a0home improvement giant Home Depot, retailer Macy's and camera maker Nikon.",
      "\"The pass-through from tariffs is gradual because some businesses may have held on to a greater share of the costs and may have shared a greater burden of tariffs,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"But there is a limit to how long and how much of that they can do \u2014 so there may be more of a push to pass those costs onto consumers.\"",
      "The White House said inflation remains low and that Mr. Trump's policies are boosting the economy.",
      "\"Since President Trump took office, CPI is tracking at a 2.3% annualized rate, consistent with low and stable inflation,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Leavitt also noted that data on producer prices out this week point to a decline in wholesale inflation. \"As the Trump economic agenda continues to take effect, the trillions of dollars in private sector and foreign investments, historic tax cuts, massive deregulation and energy dominance that the president is spearheading will fuel an economic boom,\" she added.",
      "Tariff-fueled price hikes",
      "Many types of goods that rely heavily on imports saw significant price hikes last month, the latest CPI report shows.",
      "Coffee, for instance, is largely imported because there are only a handful of places in the U.S. where the beans can be grown, such as Hawaii and Puerto Rico. About 80% of unroasted coffee imports are sourced from Latin America, primarily from Brazil, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Products from Brazil that are shipped to the U.S. now face a 50% tariff, according to the White House. Once those import taxes kicked in, U.S. consumers in August shelled out 21% more for beans than a year earlier, according to CPI data.",
      "Other products that are heavily imported and that, as of August, are seeing large price increases compared with a year ago include:",
      "Audio equipment: +12%\u00a0Household furniture: +10%\u00a0Bananas: +6.6%Women's dresses: +6.2%Watches: +5.6%Motor vehicle parts: +3.4%",

      "Women's dresses: +6.2%",
      "Watches: +5.6%",
      "Motor vehicle parts: +3.4%",
      "Strain on consumers",
      "Prices are edging higher as worker wages are growing more slowly, straining lower-income households.",
      "\"It's troubling that so many basic necessities now cost more. Food, gas, clothing and shelter all had big cost jumps in August,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email.\u00a0 \"And this is only the beginning of the price hikes. The situation will worsen in the coming months as more costs are passed along to American consumers.\"",
      "Clara Moore, 44, a public-sector researcher who lives in Newark, New Jersey, told CBS MoneyWatch she is seeing prices \"rising all over the place.\" Her grocery bill has risen to about $250 per haul, from roughly $175 one year ago, she said.",
      "Some economists think tariffs are likely to continue pushing inflation higher throughout the rest of the year, putting more financial pressure on families. As a result, many consumers will spend with more restraint, according to Daco.",
      "\"They are more cautious when it comes to their outlays. They haven't stopped spending, but they'll be more judicious from one month to the next. They'll adjust their spending according to what they need and what's affordable,\" he said.",
      "Moore said she's had to cut back her spending on discretionary goods in order to afford the basics.",
      "\"I'm in the process of cutting out all of my streaming. I stopped ordering anything from Amazon \u2014 any impulse buying I have cut out,\" she said.",
      "Ryan Sweet, Oxford Economics' chief U.S. economist, said consumers should expect to pick up about two-thirds of the cost of new U.S. tariffs on foreign goods.",
      "\"You'll have a few of these increases spread out with each passing month, and you'll see more of the tariffs passed on to consumers,\" he said.",

      "The inquiry comes after OpenAI said it plans to make changes to ChatGPT safeguards for vulnerable people, including adding extra protections for those under 18 years old, after the parents of a teen boy who died by suicide in April sued, alleging the artificial intelligence chatbot led their teen to take his own life.",
      "More children are now using AI chatbots for everything \u2014 from homework help to personal advice, emotional support and everyday decision-making. That's despite research on the harms of chatbots, which have been shown to give kids dangerous advice about topics such as drugs, alcohol and eating disorders.",
      "\"As AI technologies evolve, it is important to consider the effects chatbots can have on children, while also ensuring that the United States maintains its role as a global leader in this new and exciting industry,\" said FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson in a statement.",

      "In a statement to CBS News, Character.AI said it is looking forward to \"collaborating with the FTC on this inquiry and providing insight on the consumer AI industry and the space's rapidly evolving technology.\"",
      "Meta declined to comment on the FTC inquiry. The company has been working on making sure its AI chatbots are safe and age appropriate for children, a spokesperson said.",
      "OpenAI said that it's prioritizing \"making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved. We recognize the FTC has open questions and concerns, and we're committed to engaging constructively and responding to them directly.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News, Snap said, \"We share the FTC's focus on ensuring the thoughtful development of generative AI, and look forward to working with the Commission on AI policy that bolsters U.S. innovation while protecting our community.\"",
      "Alphabet and xAI did not immediately respond to messages for comment.",
      "AI changes",
      "OpenAI and Meta earlier this month announced changes to how their chatbots respond to teenagers asking questions about suicide or showing signs of mental and emotional distress. OpenAI said it is rolling out new controls enabling parents to link their accounts to their teen's account.",
      "Parents can choose which features to disable and \"receive notifications when the system detects their teen is in a moment of acute distress,\" according to a company blog post that says the changes will go into effect this fall.",
      "Regardless of a user's age, the company says its chatbots will attempt to redirect the most distressing conversations to more capable AI models that can provide a better response.",
      "Meta also said it is now blocking its chatbots from talking with teens about self-harm, suicide, disordered eating and inappropriate romantic conversations, and instead directs them to expert resources. Meta already offers parental controls on teen accounts.",

      "The cost-of-living adjustment has averaged 2.6% over the last 20 years, according to the Senior Citizens League. A COLA of 2.7% would be higher than this year's adjustment of 2.5%, but below the 3.2% boost seniors received in 2024.",

    "summary": "Today's CPI report marks the last major piece of economic data before the Federal Reserve's Sept. 17 rate decision meeting.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index rose 2.9% in August from a year earlier, matching economists' forecasts that prices would pick up slightly as President Trump's tariffs filtered through the economy.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 2.9% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in prices on everyday items such as food and apparel over time. So far this year, inflation has stayed at 3% or lower, with July's CPI reading at 2.7%.",
      "Despite that, inflation has been creeping higher in recent months, edging away from the Federal Reserve's\u00a02% annual target.\u00a0That's causing some Americans to feel more sour about the economy, with a recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0finding that two-thirds of consumers said prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise.",
      "What economists say",
      "Some economists point to the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs as pushing prices higher. That's because U.S. businesses pay the import duties to the federal government and then pass on some of those costs to consumers in the form of costlier goods.",
      "So far in 2025, the Federal Reserve has held off on cutting rates due to the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation. Because rate reductions make it cheaper to borrow, they can spur businesses and consumers to open their wallets, adding to inflationary pressures.",
      "Yet with the labor market showing signs of strain, Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month signaled that the door may be open for a rate cut at the central bank's Sept. 17 meeting. Cutting rates can spur hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow, and therefore easier to expand and add employees.",
      "Under the Fed's so-called \"dual mandate,\" the central bank is required to promote full employment while keeping inflation in check.",
      "Despite the rise in inflation, the Fed is likely still on track for a rate cut next week, said Seema Shah, Chief Global Strategist at Principal Asset Management, noting that the weaker jobs data will likely outweigh concerns about higher prices.",
      "\"While the CPI report is a tad hotter than expected, it will not give the Fed a moment of hesitation when they announce a rate cut next week,\" she said in an email.",
      "What's getting pricier",
      "Some items getting more expensive are products that are largely imported, such as coffee, which soared 21.7% from a year ago, and furniture, which rose 4.7%. Imports are subject to U.S. tariffs based on country of origin, with the Trump administration adding new duties that start at 10% and scale higher.",
      "\"There were once again some signs of tariff effects putting upward pressure on goods prices,\" noted Capital Economics in a research note, pointing to higher costs for appliances and other home products.",
      "Day-to-day costs also increased at a faster pace, with food prices rising by 3.2% from a year ago, largely driven by higher restaurant prices, the data showed.",
      "Those pressures are being felt by many consumers, with some telling CBS News that their expenses have only increased in the past year. Some say that they're cutting back on discretionary spending to cope with a rise in household costs.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence is poised to change how businesses and consumers interact in virtually every industry, including travel, which is ripe for disruption by AI.",
      "When the first online trip planning sites emerged in the mid-1990s, they let consumers act as their own travel agents. Decades later, artificial intelligence tools are able to take over that role, and plan and book trips on behalf of travelers, saving them time and even money.",
      "\"It takes a lot of research and clicking around. It takes an average of 30 days between when you start planning a trip and when it's fully finished,\" Skylar Erickson, co-founder of Gondola AI, which helps consumers maximize their loyalty points, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You have 40 tabs open on your browser, so it takes a lot of work to get to that right answer.\"",
      "Also, because airfares and hotel room rates fluctuate constantly based on demand, shoppers could save a lot of time using a chatbot or other AI-powered tool to track and compare prices rather than manually refreshing their browsers.",
      "\"You log into a site, and you're trying to find the right price based on what other airlines are charging \u2014 that's the ultimate goal,\" Ram Reddy, an AI expert and chief technology officer at Nagarro, a consulting firm, said. \"AI tools that know you well can get you to the right place at the right time, when prices, which aren't static, are changing every minute.\"",
      "Consumers booking trips are already seeing AI's value: 41% of more than 2,000 consumers\u00a0surveyed\u00a0by Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, said they had recently used AI tools for travel inspiration or itinerary planning.",
      "From inspiration to booking",
      "There are a range of AI-powered apps and bots at consumers' fingertips that can help plan a trip \u2014 from inception to booking. AI-powered bots can help travelers dream up trip ideas, turn visual inspiration into ready-to-go itineraries, and complete bookings and payments while maximizing the consumer's own loyalty points and other rewards so that they save money. In other words, AI provides the services in which travel agents at brick-and-mortar travel agencies once specialized.",
      "Ways AI can assist travel planning",
      "Did you see a social media post of a trip you'd like to be on? Send it to Expedia to book your own version through a feature called Trip Matching, which can turn social media reels into bookable trip itineraries.",
      "Don't know what to plan for the kids while on a family vacation? ChatGPT can generate a list of free activities in any locale.",
      "Not sure how many loyalty points or rewards you've accrued, or what they're worth? A company called Gondola AI can figure that out, helping users maximize their loyalty points so their dollars take them further.",
      "Trip planning and booking is prime territory for AI agents to test their skills, and hopefully, make the process easier for consumers, according to AI leaders.",
      "\"These days, it's easier to identify where AI is not being used to help travelers. It is everywhere, from planning to booking,\" Melanie Fish, head of global PR for Expedia Brands, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Jennifer Yellin, travel expert at Points Path, a browser extension that helps consumers compare flight deals, said the more she utilizes AI for trip planning, the better the technology gets to know her, and the more useful it becomes.",
      "\"The more you use it, it starts to recognize your patterns and preferences. It gets to know you as a traveler,\" she said of a Gondola AI, one of her favorite new tools. \"If you've been booking stays at Ritz Carltons, it won't suggest a Marriott Residence Inn as a first option; it will suggest a stay of a similar caliber.\"",
      "\"I used it dozens of times\"",
      "Other travel industry pros say they see more value in AI's ability to help them navigate locales once they've arrived.",
      "\"ChatGPT totally revolutionized how we were able to get along in China \u2014 I used it to scan menus and translate them into English,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I used it dozens of times a day.\"",
      "As far as trip planning goes, Keyes said that while he's generally an AI optimist, \"the use case has not yet proven itself to me.\"",
      "Which tools are the most helpful? These are some popular trip planning tools. Here's how they can help, and where they fall short.",
      "AI travel planning tools",
      "ChatGPT:\u00a0The AI chatbot can suggest places to stay or things to do anywhere in the world. Tell it you're visiting New York City around Christmastime with young children and you're not sure what neighborhood to stay in. It can suggest parts of town and outline their pros and cons.",
      "Google Flight Deals: Enter a destination and desired dates, or describe the type of trip you'd like to take, such as \"beach escape,\" or \"Paris in the fall.\" Let the AI-powered search engine \u2014 designed for travelers who want to save money \u2014 try to find you the best deal based on such parameters. The tool is not an AI agent though, and can't book tickets for you.",
      "Expedia Trip Matching:\u00a0The AI tool lets you send a public Instagram travel reel, or video, to Expedia, which will create an itinerary based on the visual inspiration you provide. The reel must be publicly available on Instagram, and the AI tool can only suggest trips in the U.S. market.",
      "Gondola AI: Give the tool access to your email, and it will cull your loyalty points and rewards from airlines, hotels and credit card companies to let you know what they are worth. It will compare prices in cash versus combinations of points, and can save you hundreds of dollars. It comes into play after you've decided where you want to go and stay. \"We are about finding you money, earning you money and redeeming at the highest possible value,\" Erickson said.",

      "McBlais' concerns and struggles come as the pace of inflation continues to creep higher, remaining well above the Federal Reserve's goal of driving it down to an annual 2% rate. The situation is leaving some consumers feeling frustrated by stubbornly high prices on everything from groceries to housing,\u00a0souring their views\u00a0about the health of the U.S. economy.",

      "In July 2024, when Mr. Trump pledged to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" the CPI rate stood at 2.9%, or the same pace that economists forecast for tomorrow's report.",
      "\"The president would like people to stop paying attention to inflation now because it's not helping it,\" Kersting noted. \"In the past he wanted people to pay attention to it, because back then it did help him win the election.\"",
      "Asked for comment on forecasts the CPI will show an uptick in inflation, the White House said the president is delivering on his promises.",
      "\"Joe Biden unleashed the worst inflation crisis in nearly four years \u2014 President Trump ended it. Despite the media's false narrative, core inflation has run at a 2.4% average pace since President Trump took office which is the lowest 6-month pace since March 2021. The so-called 'experts' have been wrong month after month: tariffs have not hiked prices and President Trump is delivering on his promise to make America affordable again,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve's complicated decision",
      "A hotter CPI report would complicate the Federal Reserve's task of deciding its next interest rate move on Sept. 17, given that the labor market has stalled out this summer. The Fed's so-called \"dual mandate\" requires it to promote full employment while keeping inflation in check.",
      "So far in 2025, the Fed has held its benchmark rate steady, with Chair Jerome Powell saying he wanted to keep the central bank's powder dry in case tariffs caused inflation to reignite. Because rate reductions make it cheaper to borrow, they can spur businesses and consumers to open their wallets, adding to inflationary pressures.",
      "But two consecutive disappointing jobs reports signal that the labor market is stalling out, putting pressure on the Fed to cut rates, which can help bolster hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow and add more workers. Powell last month signaled the Fed may be open to a cut, pointing to the labor market's risks.",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut is pegged at 90% by CME FedWatch, which bases its forecast on 30-day Fed Funds futures prices. There's a slimmer 10% likelihood that the Fed could usher in a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, its data shows.",
      "A rate cut could help some consumers by lowering their borrowing costs, with interest fees on credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans likely to drop after a reduction. But households are still continuing to face higher prices at the grocery store and for household bills, experts note.",
      "\"Budget pressure has never fully let up for many households, even as inflation subsided during 2024 and early 2025,\" Stephen Kates, a certified financial planner and Bankrate financial analyst, said in an email. \"Current and future inflation expectations feel like a slow, painful walk down memory lane.\"",

    "story": [
      "Technology company Oracle is among a consortium of firms that would enable TikTok to continue operations in the U.S. if a framework deal between the United States and China is finalized, sources with knowledge of the negotiations tell CBS News.",
      "The precise structure of the final deal was unclear Monday night, but will include multiple companies, the sources said. It's not clear what level of involvement Chinese firms \u2014 including TikTok's current parent company ByteDance \u2014 will have in the deal, and who will control TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm. Presidents Trump and Xi are expected to talk on Friday.",
      "Attempts to reach Oracle executives and a White House spokesperson were unsuccessful. A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "\"The commercial terms have been agreed upon,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday in Madrid after meetings with Chinese officials on a range of issues, including TikTok.",
      "Li Chenggang, a Chinese vice minister of commerce, also said after the meetings, \"China will firmly safeguard the national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, and carry out technology export approval in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.",
      "Oracle \u2014 the enterprise tech company co-founded by billionaire Larry Ellison \u2014 has long been seen as a possible suitor if the U.S. government forced a TikTok sale. Mr. Trump has\u00a0described Ellison\u00a0as a friend.",
      "In 2020, Mr. Trump\u00a0endorsed a deal\u00a0that would see Oracle and Walmart taking a 20% stake in a U.S.-based entity called\u00a0TikTok Global. And in recent years, as TikTok has sought to regain trust with American users and regulators, it has\u00a0partnered with Oracle\u00a0to route U.S. TikTok users' activity through the Texas-based company's servers.",
      "Mr. Trump was circumspect about a deal with reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. \"We may let it die, or we may, I don't know, it depends. Up to China. It doesn't matter too much. I'd like to do it for the kids. They like it.\"",
      "Last year, Congress passed and then-President Joe Biden signed a bill that essentially gave TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, an ultimatum: either divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the law in a unanimous 9-0 decision. But Mr. Trump has issued a series of orders unilaterally delaying its enforcement. The latest came in June, when he pushed back the deadline for enforcing the measure until this Wednesday.",
      "The president's orders have directed the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against tech companies like Apple and Google for failing to comply with the law by allowing TikTok on their platforms.",
      "The TikTok divestiture law was passed in 2024 after years of bipartisan concern over possible national security risks posed by the ultra-popular video app. Those include worries that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to divulge information on U.S.-based users or manipulate the platform's algorithm to control what Americans see. TikTok has long denied that Chinese officials exert any influence on the platform.",
      "The concerns stretch back to Mr. Trump's first term. The president signed an executive order to ban TikTok in the U.S. in 2020 on national security and data privacy grounds, but the move was blocked by a judge. Four years later, Mr. Trump changed course and\u00a0expressed support for the app, which he has credited for his improved performance among younger voters in last year's election.",

    "summary": "\"It was me,\" a Discord account belonging to accused Charlie Kirk shooter Tyler Robinson appeared to state just hours before he was taken into custody, according to a company spokesperson.",
    "story": [
      "Just hours before Tyler Robinson was arrested for allegedly killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the 22-year-old appeared to take responsibility for the shooting in a message to friends on the chat platform Discord, a company spokesperson confirmed to CBS News on Monday.",
      "\"Hey guys, I have bad news for you all,\" read a message from an account that allegedly belonged to Robinson, according to the spokesperson and a law enforcement source. \"It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this.\"",
      "The messages were first reported by The Washington Post.",
      "The messages came toward the end of a nearly two-day-long manhunt after Kirk was fatally shot during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Robinson confessed to his father. Robinson was taken into custody late Thursday night, FBI Director Kash Patel said Friday.",
      "Over the preceding day, Patel ordered the release of half a dozen surveillance photos of the suspected shooter and asked the public for help solving the case, which drew nationwide attention and sparked new worries about the specter of political violence.",
      "While the FBI looked for leads, according to two law enforcement sources, Robinson and his friends bantered about the shooting in a more than 20-person group on Discord. The platform is popular among gamers. The Discord spokesperson said an internal investigation by the company found \"no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord.\"",
      "At least three friends asked Robinson if he was the shooter, saying the photos released by the FBI looked like him, the law enforcement sources said. He did not seem to refute it.",
      "In one exchange, the sources said a friend appeared to tease Robinson by quipping that he should avoid McDonald's \u2014 where accused UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione was caught with a manifesto, a gun and a fake ID late last year.",
      "\"Whatever you do don't go to a mcdonalds anytime soon,\" the friend wrote, according to the law enforcement sources.",
      "The account appearing to belong to Robinson responded: \"Better also get rid of this manifesto and exact copy rifle I have lying around.\"",
      "Before the arrest, messages from the account belonging to Robinson appeared to suggest he planned to turn himself in to authorities, the Discord spokesperson confirmed.",
      "One message read, \"im surrendering through a sheriff friend in a few moments, thanks for all the good times and laughs, you've all been so amazing, thank you all for everything.\"",
      "Robinson was later taken into custody on aggravated murder, obstruction and firearm charges.\u00a0 Cox says the state will seek the death penalty. Robinson could make his first court appearance Tuesday afternoon, after officials file formal charges, Christopher Ballard, chief of staff for the Utah County Attorney's Office, has said.",
      "Law enforcement sources told CBS News that he was arrested after Robinson's father saw the FBI's images and confronted his son. Robinson admitted to being the person in the photos, but when his father encouraged him to turn himself in, Robinson said he would rather die by suicide, the sources said. His father then called a youth pastor to help calm Robinson down \u2014 but the pastor, a court security officer, also called the U.S. Marshals Service.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-designates-colombia-failing-cooperate-drug-war/",
    "published": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 22:39:58 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in nearly three decades.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, a stinging rebuke to a traditional U.S. ally that reflects a recent surge in cocaine production and fraying ties between the White House and the country's leftist president.",
      "Even as it determined that Colombia had failed to comply with its international counternarcotics obligations, the Trump administration issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered major aid cuts, citing vital U.S. national interests.",
      "Nonetheless, it is a major step against one of the United States' staunchest allies in Latin America, and it could further hamper efforts to restore security in the countryside, according to Adam Isacson, a security researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he regretted the decision, which overlooked decades of bloodshed by Colombian security forces and civilians all in the name of a U.S.-led drug war.",
      "\"Everything we do has nothing to do with the Colombian people,\" Petro said during a televised address Monday night. \"It is to prevent the American society from smearing its noses in order to work, work and work, because this drug is a stimulant.\"",
      "The U.S. last added Colombia to the list, through a process known as decertification, in 1997 when the country's cartels \u2014 through threats of violence and money \u2014 had poisoned much of the nation's institutions.",
      "It \"is a blunt tool and a huge irritant in bilateral relations that goes well beyond drug issues and makes cooperation far harder in any number of areas,\" Isacson said. \"That's why it's so rarely used.\"",
      "The president at the time, Ernesto Samper, was facing credible accusations of receiving illicit campaign contributions from the now-defunct Cali cartel, and a plane he was set to use for a trip to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly session was found carrying 4 kilograms of heroin.",
      "A remarkable turnaround began once Samper left office. Successive U.S. administrations \u2014 both Republican and Democrats \u2014 sent billions in foreign assistance to Colombia to eradicate illegal coca crops, strengthen its armed forces in the fight against drug-fueled rebels and provide economic alternatives to poor farmers who are on the lowest rungs of the cocaine industry.",
      "That cooperation started to unravel following the suspension a decade ago of aerial eradication of coca fields with glyphosate. It followed a Colombian high court ruling that determined the U.S.-funded program was potentially harmful to the environment and farmers.",
      "A 2016 peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the nation's largest rebel group known as FARC, also committed Colombia to rolling back punitive policies likened to the U.S. spraying of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War in favor of state building, rural development and voluntary crop substitution.",
      "Since then, cocaine production has skyrocketed. The amount of land dedicated to cultivating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has almost tripled in the past decade to a record 253,000 hectares in 2023, according to the latest report available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. That is almost triple the size of New York City.",
      "Along with production, drug seizures have also soared to 654 metric tons so far this year. Colombia seized a record 884 metric tons last year.",
      "But unlike past governments, manual eradication of coca crops under Petro's leadership has slowed, to barely 5,048 hectares this year \u2014 far less than the 68,000 hectares uprooted in the final year of his conservative predecessor's term and well below the government's own goal of 30,000 hectares.",
      "Petro, a former rebel himself, also has angered senior U.S. officials by denying American extradition requests, as well as criticizing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and its efforts to combat drug trafficking in neighboring Venezuela.",
      "\"Under my administration, Colombia does not collaborate in assassinations,\" Petro said on Sept. 5 after the U.S. military carried out a deadly strike on a small Venezuelan vessel in the Caribbean that the Trump administration said was transporting cocaine bound for the U.S.",
      "\"The failure of Colombia to meet its drug control obligations over the past year rests solely with its political leadership,\" Trump said in a presidential memo submitted to Congress. \"I will consider changing this designation if Colombia's government takes more aggressive action to eradicate coca and reduce cocaine production and trafficking, as well as hold those producing, trafficking, and benefiting from the production of cocaine responsible, including through improved cooperation with the United States to bring the leaders of Colombian criminal organizations to justice.\"",
      "Under U.S. law, the president annually must identify countries that have failed to meet their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months.",
      "In addition to Colombia, the Trump administration listed four other countries \u2014 Afghanistan, Bolivia, Myanmar and Venezuela \u2014 as among 23 major drug transit or drug-production countries that have failed to meet their international obligations. With the exception of Afghanistan, the White House determined that U.S. assistance to those countries was vital to national interests and therefore they would be spared any potential sanctions.",
      "The redesignation of Venezuela as a country that has failed to adequately fight narcotics smuggled from neighboring Colombia comes against the backdrop of a major U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean that has already led to two deadly strikes on small Venezuelan vessels that the Trump administration said were transporting cocaine bound for the U.S.",
      "\"In Venezuela, the criminal regime of indicted drug trafficker Nicol\u00e1s Maduro leads one of the largest cocaine trafficking networks in the world, and the United States will continue to seek to bring Maduro and other members of his complicit regime to justice for their crimes,\" Trump's designation said. \"We will also target Venezuelan foreign terrorist organizations such as Tren de Aragua and purge them from our country.\"",

    "story": [
      "Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Wednesday as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate. Officials described it as a \"targeted attack,\" and it drew\u00a0condemnation from both sides of the political aisle as authorities launched a massive search for the suspect.",
      "On Friday, officials announced they have a person in custody for the fatal shooting. They identified him as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who resides in southern Utah. Robinson was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, according to an inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff's Office.",
      "Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray is reviewing the evidence to determine the appropriate charges and plans to file them on Tuesday, Christopher Ballard, chief of staff for the Utah County Attorney's Office, confirmed to CBS News on Saturday. Robinson could make his first court appearance Tuesday afternoon, Ballard said.",
      "Kirk, who co-founded the right-wing advocacy group Turning Point USA, was 31. He is survived by his wife, Erika, and two young children.",
      "Turning Point USA announced Saturday that a public funeral for Kirk will be held on Sunday, Sept. 21, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.",
      "Here is what we know so far about the assassination and ongoing investigation.",
      "Who is the suspect?",
      "More details about Robinson and what happened before and after the attack are emerging.",
      "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Robinson is not a student at Utah Valley University, where the attack took place, and has been living with his family in Washington County, located in the southwestern corner of the state. Family members said Robinson had \"become more political\" in recent years, the governor said.",
      "Utah State University said Robinson briefly attended the school for one semester in 2021. According to the Utah System of Higher Education, Robinson was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St. George, Utah.",
      "Robinson's father owns a business installing kitchen countertops and cabinets and his mother is a licensed social worker, according to public records and their social media accounts. Robinson is the oldest of three brothers.",
      "\"They are very supportive parents who loved their boys and are involved in the community,\" a neighbor who said she knew the Robinson family well but had not seen Robinson in a few years told CBS News. She also said the parents were supportive of the country and of President Trump.",
      "State records show that Robinson registered to vote as unaffiliated. He is listed as an inactive voter in state records, meaning he didn't vote in the last two elections. He was not old enough to vote in 2020.",
      "Robinson had no prior felony or misdemeanor convictions and no prior violent offenses, according to a Public Safety Assessment Report filed in Utah state court.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said Robinson was taken into custody at 10 p.m. local time Thursday night, though Utah officials said it was in the early hours of Friday. Records from the Utah County Sheriff's Office Corrections Division show he was booked into jail at 7:58 a.m. local time (9:58 a.m. ET).",
      "Mr. Trump first broke the news on \"Fox and Friends\" that someone had been taken into custody.",
      "\"With a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody. Everyone did a great job,\" the president said.",
      "Cox said messages on Discord, an instant messaging and social media platform, that were reviewed by investigators referenced a rifle wrapped in a towel that was left in the woods and engravings on bullets. The messages came from a person named \"Tyler\" and were shared with an unidentified individual, Cox said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for Discord said it had removed an account associated with Robinson for violating the company's \"off-platform behavior policy,\" which prohibits users from engaging in various forms of violence, and will continue to coordinate closely with law enforcement. The spokesperson also said Discord \"found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence\" on the platform itself.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by this tragedy and extend our condolences to the Kirk family and everyone affected,\" Discord's statement said. \"The messages referenced in recent reporting about planning details do not appear to be Discord messages. These were communications between the suspect's roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.\"",
      "A Discord spokesperson also confirmed the company provided law enforcement with copies of chat messages in which the 22-year-old suspect appeared to confess to the killing to a group of friends.",
      "According to the spokesperson, an account appearing to belong to Robinson claimed responsibility for the shooting in a message to a group of online friends on Thursday night, about two hours before officials said Robinson was taken into custody.",
      "\"Hey guys, I have bad news for you all,\" read the message from the account allegedly belonging to Robinson. \"It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this,\" Robinson wrote, according to a Discord spokesperson and a law enforcement source.",
      "The spokesperson also confirmed additional messages from an account allegedly belonging to Robinson that suggested he planned to turn himself in to authorities, including one that read, \"im surrendering through a sheriff friend in a few moments, thanks for all the good times and laughs, you've all been so amazing, thank you all for everything.\"",
      "The Washington Post was first to report on the content of the messages.",
      "The governor said authorities believe Robinson acted alone and said there is currently no information that would lead to additional arrests. He told reporters Friday morning he can't answer questions about the possible motive of the suspect.",
      "Robinson is currently on \"special watch\" at the Utah County Jail while he is being evaluated to determine if he is a risk to himself or others, Utah County Sheriff's Spokesperson Sgt. Raymond Ormond told CBS News. The Utah County Sheriff said in a statement on Sunday that he had not been made aware of any suicide concerns or comments involving Robinson, but noted that the suspect would \"remain on a special watch status until cleared by mental health, which may take several days.\"",
      "Individuals are held in a special housing unit while on special watch.",
      "\"Tyler Robinson is being housed in our special housing unit so that we can keep a close eye on him,\" the sheriff's statement said. \"This is done for various reasons ranging from: the types of crimes you're booked on, behavioral issues, violent behavior, and/or suicidal comments made during the arrest.\"",
      "Ormond said everyone is given an initial screening after booking, but some are put on the more intensive special watch until they're screened.",
      "How the suspect was captured",
      "Cox said Robinson's father recognized his son as the subject of photos that were released by law enforcement and urged him to turn himself in.",
      "Robinson admitted to his father that he was the person in the photos, two federal law enforcement sources told CBS News. Robinson said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, the federal law enforcement sources said.",
      "Robinson's father called a youth pastor who knows the 22-year-old and is close to the family, and he and the pastor tried to calm Robinson down. The sources said the pastor, who also serves as a court security officer, called the U.S. Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies. Marshals  then detained Robinson and kept him secure while waiting for the FBI. The FBI later took him into custody.",
      "Investigators reviewed video footage and said they identified Robinson arriving on Utah Valley University's campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at around 8:29 a.m. local time Wednesday, the day of the shooting, according to the governor. Robinson was wearing a plain maroon T-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo and light-colored shoes, Cox said.",
      "He is believed to have changed clothing on the roof, where the shot was fired from, before changing back into what he was originally wearing. When investigators encountered Robinson, he was wearing clothing consistent with that outfit, the governor said.",
      "Tracking the suspect",
      "On Thursday, Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason described the suspect they were seeking as a male who \"blended in\" with the college community and appeared to be college age.",
      "The public safety department and the Salt Lake City FBI office posted images of someone they called a \"person of interest,\" showing an individual appearing to wear a dark long-sleeve shirt, a hat and sunglasses. More photos posted later on Thursday showed the person wearing a backpack.",
      "Mason said investigators were able to track the shooter's movements before and after the assassination.",
      "According to a probable cause statement filed by investigators after Robinson's arrest, investigators were able to track his movements on campus starting at approximately 11:50 a.m. local time on Wednesday. He was observed entering a building called the Losee Center near where Kirk's event was taking place, which was the shooting location, and going up to the roof, according to the statement.",
      "Mason said the shooter moved to the other side of the building after firing a single shot, then jumped off and fled into a neighborhood off campus. Investigators contacted homeowners with cameras and witnesses to identify leads, he said.",
      "In a news briefing Thursday evening in Orem, Utah, with Patel in attendance, officials released security video that showed a man \u2014 who Mason called a suspect \u2014 running across the roof and then climbing down the side of the building immediately after the shooting.",
      "As he climbed off the edge of the building and dropped down, he \"left some palm impressions, some smudges, some places we're looking to collect DNA,\" along with a shoe print that indicated he was wearing Converse tennis shoes, Mason told reporters while showing the video.",
      "\"It's important to note his black t-shirt, his black pants, and there appears to be some white on the soles of those Converse tennis shoes,\" Mason said. \"Those are all identifiable items that we're looking for.\"",
      "After dropping off the building, the video showed the man moving across a grassy area before entering traffic. Mason said he crossed the street into a wooded area, where the firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was later found.",
      "The FBI said it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads law enforcement to identify and arrest the person or people involved in Kirk's assassination. Patel said authorities had received more than 11,000 leads as of Friday morning.",
      "Gun and bullet casings recovered",
      "FBI special-agent-in-charge Robert Bohls said Thursday that investigators recovered a \"high-powered, bolt-action rifle,\" which they believe was the weapon used in the assassination. It was found in a wooded area where the shooter fled and was wrapped in a towel, according to Bohls. The rifle was determined to be a Mauser .30-06-caliber bolt-action rifle, according to the probable cause statement.",
      "Patel suggested on Monday that investigators found DNA linking Robinson to the scene of the shooting on some of the items they recovered, including a screwdriver and a towel.",
      "\"The DNA hits from the towel that was wrapped around the firearm, and the DNA on the screwdriver, are positively processed for the suspect in custody,\"\u00a0Patel said on \"Fox & Friends.\"",
      "Cox said that there were inscriptions on the casings of the bullet that was fired, as well as on the casings of three bullets that were not fired.",
      "According to the probable cause statement, the fired bullet casing contained the inscription, \"Notices Buldge OWO what's this?\" An unfired bullet casing read, \"hey fascist! CATCH!\" followed by an up arrow symbol, a right arrow symbol and three down arrow symbols. And a second unfired casing read, \"O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!\" A third unfired casing said, \"If you read This, you are GAY Lmao.\"",
      "Cox didn't speculate on the meaning of the inscriptions.",
      "Investigators also have a footwear impression, palm print and forearm imprints that will be analyzed, the FBI official said.",
      "Timeline of \"targeted attack\"",
      "The event where Kirk was speaking was scheduled to begin in the UVU courtyard at noon.",
      "A CBS News review of livestream footage and video metadata indicates Kirk was shot around 12:23 p.m., which is also when the FBI's Patel said Kirk was shot. He was struck in the neck by a single gunshot.",
      "A map produced by CBS News' Confirmed team shows where Kirk was when he was shot \u2014 in the central courtyard of Utah Valley University, which is surrounded by campus buildings.",
      "A university spokeswoman said Wednesday that they believed the shot was fired from the Losee Center. A law enforcement source told CBS News that the gunman appeared to have fired from the building's roof.",
      "The FBI released a video\u00a0\u2014 timestamped at 12:23 p.m. local time \u2014 that appears to show a person climbing off a roof at Utah Valley University and fleeing the scene. Dispatch audio reviewed by CBS News described a person on the roof of a nearby building wearing black clothing and carrying a long rifle.",
      "Video captured at 2:37 p.m. shows officers searching an area around a quarter mile north of the campus.",
      "At 2:40, more than two hours after the shooting, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Kirk had died.",
      "While authorities have not specified a potential motive for the shooting, Mason said they believe it was a \"targeted attack toward one individual.\" Only one shot was fired, and Kirk was the only victim, the commissioner said.",
      "Cox called the shooting \"a political assassination,\" while Mr. Trump, in a video posted to Truth Social, blamed it on \"radical left political violence,\" which he said \"has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.\"",
      "Charlie Kirk's influence in politics",
      "Kirk was shot while he was speaking at a \"Prove Me Wrong\" debate, a trademark event for Kirk's Turning Point USA, which is a conservative organization focused on young people. He would hold political debates with a group that usually consisted of left-leaning attendees.",
      "Kirk had visited the Utah university as part of a nationwide tour of college campuses that was scheduled to continue for the next two months. About 3,000 people attended the outdoor event where he was assassinated, the Utah Department of Public Safety said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump called Kirk legendary, saying, \"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.\"",
      "Kirk was a close Trump ally and was credited with galvanizing younger voters during his campaign. He made it his mission to engage more young people in politics and register them to vote. Kirk was also a close friend of the president's son, Donald Trump Jr.",
      "Kirk was the host of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" a daily conservative talk radio show and amassed millions of followers on social media.",
      "Kirk's politics, however, weren't without controversy. He pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",

    "summary": "President Trump blamed Biden's immigration policies after a man accused of beheading a Dallas motel manager was found to have remained in the U.S. despite prior arrests.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump linked the beheading of a Dallas motel manager to immigration policies, blaming the Biden administration for allowing the Cuban national accused in the killing to remain in the U.S. despite prior arrests.",
      "Chandra Nagamallaiah died last week, and Dallas police identified Yordanis Cobos-Martinez as the suspect. Cobos-Martinez is being held in the Dallas County Jail for capital murder and has an immigration hold, jail records show.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed it has lodged a detainer with the Dallas County Jail for Cobos-Martinez's federal arrest and removal. In a statement, ICE said he is a Cuban national and in the U.S. illegally.",
      "In a\u00a0post on his Truth Social account\u00a0Sunday evening, Mr. Trump said, \"I am aware of the terrible reports regarding the murder of Chandra Nagamallaiah, a well respected person in Dallas, Texas, who was brutally beheaded, in front of his wife and son, by an ILLEGAL ALIEN from Cuba who should have never been in our Country. This individual was previously arrested for terrible crimes, including child sex abuse, grand theft auto, and false imprisonment, but was released back into our Homeland under incompetent Joe Biden because Cuba did not want such an evil person in their Country.\"",
      "While Cobos-Martinez has an extensive arrest history, he was not convicted in every case. Court records show the child indecency case against Cobos-Martinez was dropped due to insufficient evidence, and Cobos-Martinez was acquitted of grand theft auto after a trial in California.",
      "According to ICE, Cobos-Martinez was under a final order to be deported but Cuba would not take him back due to his criminal record. He was released from the Bluebonnet Detention Center in the final days of the Biden administration under an order of supervision, ICE said.",
      "In response to a request for comment from CBS News Texas, a former Biden administration official said, \"The Order of Supervision was issued seven days before President Biden left office and therefore managed by the Trump administration. If the Order of Supervision was not upheld for 8 months and they somehow lost track of the individual allegedly responsible for this heinous crime, then the Trump administration should answer to this.\"",
      "Since taking office, the Trump administration has implemented a new policy to deport nationals from countries without deportation agreements to third countries that are willing to accept them. Those countries include Guatemala, South Sudan, Eswatini and Rwanda.",
      "\"Rest assured, the time for being soft on these Illegal Immigrant Criminals is OVER under my watch! Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Border Czar Tom Homan, and many others in my Administration, are doing an incredible job in, MAKING AMERICA SAFE AGAIN,\" Mr. Trump's post said.",
      "Grisly attack, beheading at Dallas motel",
      "On Sept. 10, Dallas police responded to the Downtown Suites motel on Samuell Boulevard in Old East Dallas. According to an arrest affidavit, Cobos-Martinez became upset with Nagamallaiah, pulled out a machete and started attacking.",
      "Nagamallaiah's wife and son, who were in the motel office, tried to intervene several times, police said, but Cobos-Martinez pushed them away and continued the attack. Cobos-Martinez then took Nagamallaiah's cell phone and key card from his pockets before again resuming the attack until Nagamallaiah's head \"was removed from his body,\" police said.",
      "Mr. Trump said Cobos-Martinez would be charged with murder in the first degree, which is not a charge in Texas. The equivalent charge is capital murder, which carries a mandatory life sentence with the possibility of the death sentence.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit declined to grant the Trump administration emergency relief and clear the way for Mr. Trump to remove Cook from her position.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Monday rejected a bid from President Trump's administration to allow the president to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, leaving intact a lower court order that reinstated her to the post.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit divided 2-1 in declining to grant the Trump administration emergency relief and clear the way for Mr. Trump to remove Cook from her position. The Trump administration is likely to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. But absent an 11th-hour order from the high court, the decision all but ensures Cook will remain a governor on the seven-member Fed board through a two-day meeting of its interest rate-setting committee, which Cook sits on and is set to begin Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to oust Cook from the Fed's Board of Governors last month over allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook denies any wrongdoing.",
      "Judge Bradley Garcia wrote in a concurring opinion joined by Judge Michelle Childs that Cook is likely to succeed in arguing that Mr. Trump's attempt to remove her violated her due process rights. Judge Gregory Katsas dissented.",
      "\"Given that Cook has a property interest in her position, she is entitled to 'some kind' of process before removal,\" Garcia wrote. \"Before this court, the government does not dispute that it provided Cook no meaningful notice or opportunity to respond to the allegations against her. The government argues only that Cook 'does not explain what difference a hearing would have made.' Even accepting that premise, Cook's entitlement to process stands apart from whether she would succeed in securing a different outcome.\"",
      "Garcia added that since Cook has continued to serve in her role despite her purported termination by Mr. Trump, granting the administration's request for emergency relief would \"upend\" the status quo.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said the agency \"does not comment on current or prospective litigation including matters that may be an investigation.\"",
      "The Trump administration asked the D.C. Circuit for emergency relief after U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that Cook's firing likely violated the Federal Reserve Act and her due process rights.",
      "The Federal Reserve Act specifies that the president can only remove a Fed governor \"for cause.\" While the term is not defined in the law, Cobb found \"for cause\" refers to in-office conduct. Because Cook's alleged misrepresentations on mortgage documents predate her tenure as a Fed governor, Cobb ruled that Mr. Trump lacked \"cause\" to remove Cook.",
      "The judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Fed to allow Cook to remain a member of its Board of Governors during the litigation.",
      "\"President Trump's stated cause refers only to allegations regarding Cook's conduct before she began serving on the Federal Reserve Board,\" the judge wrote in her decision, adding that \"such allegations are not a legally permissible cause.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized the Fed for moving too slowly in cutting interest rates, though economists expect the central bank will announce a rate cut this week. If Cook's firing is ultimately allowed \u2014 a decision that will likely be made by the Supreme Court \u2014 and the president appoints a successor, it would mean he will have appointed the majority of the seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Mr. Trump announced on social media last month that he was firing Cook, appointed by former President Joe Biden, from the Fed Board of Governors and had \"sufficient cause\" to oust her. Cook's 14-year-term on the Fed is set to end in January 2038.",
      "The president cited as grounds for her removal claims made by Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that Cook made false statements on mortgage documents.",
      "Pulte alleged in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that Cook claimed two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence on mortgage documents from 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Pulte, who was appointed to lead the FHFA by Mr. Trump, has continued to make accusations against Cook related to mortgage documents.",
      "Cook has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Her lawyers said in court papers that she may have \"erred\" in filling out a form for a private mortgage, but said the events took place before she assumed office as a Fed governor and in her capacity as a private citizen.",
      "\"Governor Cook did not ever commit mortgage fraud,\" they wrote.",
      "Reuters reported Friday that a loan estimate for the property in Atlanta, dated May 28, 2021, showed that Cook declared that residence as a \"vacation home.\"",
      "Cook filed a lawsuit challenging Mr. Trump's effort to fire her, alleging that the move violated the Federal Reserve Act.",
      "While the law does not define \"cause,\" Cook's lawyers argued \"cause\" constitutes what is set out in other laws shielding officials at independent agencies from being fired at-will: instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "They said Mr. Trump relied on \"thinly-veiled pretext\" in an effort to oust Cook because she has not supported lowering the benchmark interest rate.",
      "\"[T]hose unsubstantiated allegations cannot camouflage the President's real reason for attempting to remove Governor Cook: he disagrees with her policy decisions,\" Cook's legal team wrote.",
      "The Fed said it is not taking a position on whether Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook is lawful and said it will follow any court orders.",
      "In defending Mr. Trump's move, Justice Department lawyers have said that Congress gave the president broad discretion to remove a Fed governor for \"cause\" through the Federal Reserve Act and argued that making \"contradictory statements\" on financial filings is sufficient ground for removing her.",
      "\"When Governors by misconduct or gross neglect erode the foundations of such confidence, the President acts properly and lawfully by removing them,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "They argued that the president's power of for-cause removal is discretionary, and the exercise of that authority is unreviewable by the courts. Justice Department lawyers also rejected the district court's conclusion that the public interest in the Fed's independence weighed in favor of Cook's reinstatement to her role on the Board of Governors.",
      "\"Even with the Federal Reserve's unique structure and history, its Governors are subject to removal for cause, and the President's actions to remove Cook based on her misconduct should strengthen, not diminish, the Federal Reserve's integrity,\" they wrote.",
      "Cook is one of several Democratic appointees at independent agencies who have been fired by Mr. Trump since he returned to the White House in January.\u00a0 But her removal is unprecedented, as no president has fired a member of the Fed board in the central bank's 112-year-history.",
      "Critics of the move have warned that Mr. Trump's attempt to terminate Cook threatens the independence of the Fed and, if allowed, the stability of markets and the U.S. economy.",
      "Among the other officials Mr. Trump has fired are members of the Federal Trade Commission, Merit Systems Protection Board, National Labor Relations Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission, who have all sued to challenge their firings.",
      "The Supreme Court has allowed the president to oust members of the NLRB, MSPB and CPSC while their cases move forward, but it has drawn a line around the Fed. In a May decision, the high court said the central bank is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Senate on Monday confirmed economist and Trump adviser Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, giving President Trump more influence over the Fed just one day before central bank officials will meet to decide whether to cut interest rates.",
      "Miran was confirmed 48-47 for a term that runs until January, filling a vacancy created last month when Biden appointee Adriana Kugler stepped down before the end of her term. Miran currently chairs the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. In an unusual move, he's said he will take an unpaid leave of absence from that job while serving on the Fed board instead of resigning altogether, citing \"the short duration of the appointment.\"",
      "Miran is arriving at the central bank in time for a crucial Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, during which 12 top Fed officials \u2014 including Miran \u2014 will discuss monetary policy and decide whether to change the Fed's target interest rate. The committee is widely expected to vote for a rate cut, after leaving rates stable so far this year.",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Fed officials for not cutting interest rates sooner, nicknaming Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" \u2014 pressuring a central bank that typically operates independently. The president favors a rate cut because it could boost economic growth and slash borrowing costs for American consumers, but the move could risk causing inflation to heat up.",
      "The Senate Banking Committee advanced Miran's nomination in a party-line vote last week, after lawmakers grilled him on whether he would preserve the Fed's independence.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the committee's top Democrat, alleged last week Miran's nomination was part of a gambit by Mr. Trump to \"seize personal control of the Fed,\" citing his decision not to fully resign from his White House role.",
      "\"He will have zero credibility with markets, zero credibility with businesses, and zero credibility with the public if he is confirmed to the Board under these circumstances,\" Warren said.",
      "But Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who chairs the committee, lauded Miran, saying he \"brings deep experience, proven leadership and a clear commitment to ensuring that the American economy remains strong and competitive.\"",
      "Miran said in a hearing earlier this month he believes the \"independence of monetary policy is a critical element for [the Fed's] success,\" and \"I intend to preserve that independence.\"",
      "Miran also said he would \"absolutely resign\" from the Council of Economic Advisers if he is confirmed to a longer term on the Fed board after his four-month appointment runs out.",
      "In a written questionnaire for senators, Miran didn't rule out attending meetings for the White House's Council of Economic Advisers and consulting with CEA staff, but \"only in my capacity as a member of the Fed and to the extent appropriate for a member of the Fed in the normal course of business.\" He also said he will not have access to his CEA email while at the Fed.",
      "The Miran nomination is just one move by Mr. Trump that could reshape the central bank.",
      "The president moved to fire Fed board member Lisa Cook last month, accusing her of making false statements on mortgage documents. Cook argued the firing was unlawful, and a judge ruled last week that Cook can remain on the board while a lawsuit plays out. The Trump administration asked an appeals court to halt that ruling before this week's interest rate meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump will also have an opportunity to pick a new Fed chair when Powell's term ends in May. The president has floated firing Powell before then, but the idea is legally untested.",
      "Two other Fed board members \u2014 Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 were confirmed during Mr. Trump's first term. If the president succeeds in firing Cook and replacing Powell and Kugler, five of the Fed Board of Governor's seven members will be Trump nominees.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed a presidential memorandum Monday mobilizing federal law enforcement agents to Memphis, Tennessee, as a part of a task force that will include the Tennessee National Guard, the latest planned Guard deployment in his effort to combat crime in U.S. cities.",
      "\"The effort will include the National Guard as well as the FBI, ATF, DEA, ICE, Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S, Marshals,\" the president said Monday, adding that the task force will be a \"replica\" of the efforts in Washington, D.C.",
      "Mr. Trump said he went ahead with the memo \"at the request\" of Tennessee's Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who was in the Oval Office for the signing. Specifically, the memo directs the defense secretary to ask the governor to make the Tennessee National Guard available to help federal law enforcement.",
      "\"They're a volunteer state,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday. \"We're not going to have any problems with the Tennessee National Guard.\"",
      "The move makes Memphis the third city to see National Guard troops on its streets under Mr. Trump's presidency, following deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., earlier this year.",
      "\"We're going to be doing Chicago probably next,\" the president said Monday, adding that \"we're going to wait a little while\" before going into the country's third-largest city.",
      "The president said St. Louis may also be a city that will see a federal law enforcement presence.",
      "\"We have to save St. Louis. We have to save Chicago,\" he said in the Oval Office on Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump has said authorities will \"straighten out\" Memphis, which has one of the nation's highest violent crime rates. The president said a person is four times more likely to be killed in Memphis than Mexico City.",
      "On Sunday, the president wrote on Truth Social that federal law enforcement has been on the ground in Memphis for the last five months, but \"the real work by us has barely begun.\"",
      "\"The only reason crime is somewhat down in Memphis is because the FBI, and others in the Federal Government, at my direction, have been working there for 5 months - on the absolutely terrible Crime numbers,\" he wrote. \"Likewise, in Chicago and Los Angeles! But the real work by us has barely begun. That happens after we make the official announcement that WE'RE COMING, and when we do that, as we did in now VERY SAFE WASHINGTON, D.C., the no crime 'miracle' begins. ONLY I CAN SAVE THEM!!!\"",
      "While some governors have shunned the idea of the National Guard posting up in their cities, Lee has been open to the idea of the National Guard deploying in his state. Lee said he's been in \"constant communication\" with the Trump administration for months on an anti-crime plan, and the \"next phase will include a comprehensive mission with the Tennessee National Guard, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tennessee Highway Patrol, Memphis Police Department, and other law enforcement agencies.\"",
      "Democratic Memphis Mayor Paul Young said in a press conference that he didn't ask for the National Guard to come, but he'll work with them to \"strategize on how they engage in this community.\"",
      "The president's decision to send more than 2,000 National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area this spring prompted an ongoing legal fight. A federal judge ruled earlier this month that the deployment violated a federal law that prohibits the use of the military for law enforcement actions on U.S. soil.",
      "In Washington, hundreds of National Guard troops have been patrolling streets and cleaning up the city in \"beautification\" efforts since Mr. Trump ordered their deployment over the summer. The troops are not engaged in law enforcement functions, but their presence coincided with the president federalizing the local police force and surging federal agents into the capital to crack down on crime.",
      "The president has floated other cities that could be the next target of his campaign against urban crime, including Chicago, New York and San Francisco. But he has also said he wants governors and residents of cities to support the presence of troops and law enforcement.",
      "Illinois officials have made it clear they don't want the National Guard there.",
      "\"We don't need or want you here, Donald,\" said Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson recently wrote in the New York Times that \"[s]ending in the National Guard is the wrong solution to a real problem.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Monday he would have ordered flags to be lowered in honor of the Minnesota state lawmaker who was assassinated this summer at her home if he had been asked.",
      "The White House has paid tribute in numerous ways to slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a close ally of Mr. Trump, ordering flags to be flown at half-staff after Kirk was fatally shot during an event on a Utah college campus. The moves have prompted criticism about why the president did not take similar actions after the fatal shooting of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, and her husband in June.",
      "\"Had the governor of Minnesota asked me to do that, I would have done that gladly,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News' chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes while taking questions from reporters in the Oval Office.",
      "In June, Mr. Trump was asked aboard Air Force One whether he had called Walz after the Minnesota assassination. Another state lawmaker was also targeted in the attack, and he and his wife sustained serious injuries.",
      "\"The guy doesn't have a clue. He's a mess. So, you know, I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?\" Mr. Trump said of Walz.",
      "On Monday, Cordes also asked Mr. Trump why he has made the case that political violence is only coming from one side of the political spectrum.",
      "\"I didn't say it was on one side,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But I say the radical left causes tremendous violence, and they seem to do it in a bigger way. But the radical left really has caused a lot of problems for this country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has blamed Kirk's shooting on \"radical left political violence.\" In a video shared after Kirk's death, Mr. Trump listed off several other instances of violence, including last year's assassination attempt against him in Pennsylvania, the 2017 shooting of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana and the December killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO.",
      "Investigators have not revealed a suspected motive behind the Kirk shooting.",
      "Absent from Mr. Trump's examples were recent acts of political violence that targeted Democrats, including Hortman's death, an attack on Rep. Nancy Pelosi's husband in their California home and an arson attack on Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's residence.",
      "Mr. Trump posted about Hortman's death at the time, calling it a \"terrible shooting\" that \"appears to be a targeted attack,\" and writing: \"Such horrific violence will not be tolerated.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 19:33:30 -0400",
    "summary": "Kash Patel and his deputy Dan Bongino are challenging the FBI's fierce allegiance to message control.",
    "story": [
      "Toward the end of his remarks about the killing of Charlie Kirk last Friday, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox warned about the ills of America's increasingly vitriolic online culture.",
      "\"Social media is a cancer on our society right now,\" he said, imploring citizens to \"log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member and go out and do good in your community.\" Standing next to him was a stony-faced FBI Director Kash Patel, a heavy social media user who posts far more frequently than his predecessors in the job, Christopher Wray and James Comey.",
      "The juxtaposition did not go unnoticed by bureau veterans.",
      "\"You can be a social media influencer, or you can be FBI director,\" one recently retired special agent told CBS News. \"But you can't be both.\"",
      "But Patel is both, upending the agency's cautious communication culture with a steady flow of online observations and updates.",
      "That clash in cultures has never been more clear than it was last week, when the FBI chief faced intense scrutiny for his handling of the high-profile case. Repeatedly, he turned to social media to tout major developments in the case \u2014 in some cases prematurely. Hours after the shooting, he posted to his nearly 2 million followers on X at 6:21 p.m. ET, \"The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody.\" Then, less than two hours later, at 7:59 p.m., he had to backtrack, posting, \"The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement.\" Patel sought to address the quick \u2014 and misleading \u2014 initial post during a Fox News interview Monday.",
      "\"I was being transparent with working with the public on our findings, as I had them,\" he said on \"Fox and Friends.\"",
      "\"I stated in that message that we had a subject and that we were going to interview him, and we did and he was released,\" Patel told Fox News. \"Could I have worded it a little better in the heat of the moment? Sure. But do I regret putting it out? Absolutely not.\"",
      "Asked for comment, the FBI referred CBS News to Patel's interview on Fox News.",
      "FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino also defended Patel's and his own efforts to publish FBI developments as soon as something new to share.",
      "\"We are clinging to transparency,\" Bongino said on Fox News' \"America's Newsroom\" Monday. \"The era of Cronkite and Jennings generation is over. New media now is media and we want to be sure we can do everything in our power to share what we can when we can while still balancing the needs of the investigation.\"",
      "Dribbling out information in real time about a highly complex, sensitive and fast-moving investigation is a startling departure from past FBI directors, whose public messaging traditionally has been spare and buttoned-up.",
      "J. Edgar Hoover's vaunted publicity machine occupied a whole wing of the bureau dedicated to writing articles, issuing press releases, tending to Hollywood directors and TV producers \u2014 all in an effort to buff the reputation of the FBI and its legendary G-man. But according to Yale historian Beverly Gage, Hoover was particularly cautious about publicizing active investigations.",
      "\"Hoover himself was contained and buttoned-down,\" said Gage, author of the Pulitzer Prize winning biography \"G-Man: J. Edgar Hoover and the Making of the American Century.\" \"He did everything through elaborate bureaucratic procedure, so it's very hard to imagine him being unfiltered enough to be on social media in quite this way.\"",
      "Patel is a departure from previous FBI directors. He eschews the standard-issue uniform of past FBI chiefs \u2014 conservative suits and spit-polished shoes \u2014 in favor of bold ties and European-cut suits. A close friend says he sees himself as a \"disruptor\" intent on radically changing enforcement priorities \u2014 \"let cops be cops\" is one of his favorite slogans \u2014 while shaking up the bureau's staid culture.",
      "A former colleague who worked with Patel during the first Trump term says he has a \"bias for action,\" which may explain his exuberance on social media. \"He wants to get s*** done,\" this source said.",
      "Those harboring a less charitable view argue that Patel is an attention seeker who thrives on the spotlight. One former FBI agent pointed to an earlier episode that he said echoes Patel's rush to post details of the Kirk investigation on social media.",
      "During his confirmation hearing to be FBI director, a whistleblower told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee that when Patel was working for the National Security Council in 2020, he violated government protocols by leaking to a newspaper the details of a hostage deal involving American citizens being held in Yemen. FBI officials were furious at the time, accusing Patel of jeopardizing the lives of the hostages so he could claim credit with the media. At the time, the White House and a source close to Patel denied the allegation.",
      "Last week, Patel's social media activity renewed similar concerns.",
      "\"In a sensitive investigation you don't want to tip your hand to things the public doesn't already know so that active evidence that is vital to the court process not get or disclosed unnecessarily to hinder the investigation,\" said Stephen Laycock, a former executive assistant director at the FBI who retired in 2021.",
      "Or as a former special agent said, \"Being the first to get 'likes' or clicks is not beneficial to the investigative process.\"",
      "The eventual arrest of a suspect in the Kirk shooting has staunched some of the initial chatter about Patel's comments. Still, on Tuesday he is expected to face a grilling from the Senate Judiciary Committee. A Senate source told CBS News that Democrats are preparing to go on the attack. And they believe they'll have plenty to work with.",
      "Even before Kirk's killing, the FBI was reeling from an unprecedented purge of some of the most experienced FBI executives and line agents, depleting the agency of decades of experience, critics say. Mehtab Syed, the highly regarded head of the FBI's Salt Lake City field office, was among the agents forced out at the end of July. Robert Bohls, the new head of the office that was on the front lines of the shooting investigation, started his job on Sept. 2, days before the Kirk shooting, a source familiar with the Salt Lake City FBI office confirmed.",
      "Three elite former agents filed a lawsuit last week accusing Patel of summarily firing them at the direction of the White House. The lawsuit highlighted Patel's focus on social media, arguing the agents' dismissals came in response to criticism on social media from right-wing influencers. At the same time, according to the complaint, Patel has urged FBI field agents to be more active on social media to tout \"FBI wins.\"",
      "One of the fired agents, former Washington field office Assistant Director Steven Jensen, expressed concern about Bongino's \"intense focus on increasing online engagement.\" Jensen alleged that the \"emphasis Bongino was placing on creating content for his social media feed could risk outweighing more deliberate analyses of investigations.\"",
      "It's a concern that has been circulating quietly among longtime bureau veterans.",
      "\"You aren't doing your job or leading an organization for the social media glory,\" said Laycock.",
      "Some officials who have interacted in person with Patel, say the director is misunderstood. As one law enforcement official described it to CBS News, Patel's brash online personality stands in contrast to a low-key, friendly demeanor that he exhibits in meetings.",
      "\"He's highly personable and even earnest,\" one law enforcement official said of his multiple meetings with Patel.",
      "Perhaps the most important person evaluating the director's performance over the past week, however, appeared to approve of it. President Trump made clear he is backing his FBI director.",
      "\"I am very proud of the FBI,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview with Fox News Digital on Saturday. \"Kash \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 they have done a great job.\"",

      "Vance announced Sunday in a post on X that he had the \"honor of hosting the Charlie Kirk Show\" to \"pay tribute to my friend.\" Speaking from his office in the White House complex Monday, Vance said he was \"filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for\" as he kicked off the show.",
      "\"But I'm going to try to do my best,\" Vance said.",
      "Kirk, a conservative activist, was assassinated last week during a Utah Valley University event hosted by his organization, Turning Point USA, in Orem, Utah. The 31-year-old was close to Vance, along with President Trump and his family.",
      "After his death, Kirk's body was flown on the vice president's plane, Air Force Two, to Kirk's home state of Arizona. Vance canceled a planned trip to New York to mark 24 years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attack to fly to Utah to retrieve Kirk's body. Vance said Monday that he was honored to be able to \"take Charlie's remains from Utah to Arizona.\"",
      "Vance has described his longtime friendship with Kirk, who was also a key ally in his political rise. Vance said in a post on X after Kirk's death that the slain conservative activist was one of the first people he called when he considered running for Senate in 2021, and he said Kirk advocated for him to become the vice-presidential nominee \"both in public and private.\"",
      "The vice president described Kirk as a \"true friend.\" On Monday, Vance called Kirk \"the smartest political operative I ever met,\" saying \"I owe so much to Charlie.\"",
      "Kirk's youth turnout operation has also been credited with helping Mr. Trump's 2024 election bid, while Kirk himself was known to have influenced some of the Trump administration's personnel decisions. Vance said much of \"the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,\" adding that Kirk \"didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.\"",
      "The president announced last week that he would\u00a0award Kirk\u00a0the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously.",
      "Andrew Kolvet, the executive producer of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" said on CNN Monday that Vance's hosting of the show \"came about because he asked if he could do it.\"",
      "\"Charlie and JD were friends. They were actual friends,\" Kolvet said, adding that \"a lot of the people that are running the federal government are personal friends of Charlie's and they were in the trenches together, the campaign, and they've known each other for years.\"",
      "During the show Monday, Vance urged that \"we have to make sure that the killer is brought to justice,\" previewing discussions of what he called the \"incredibly destructive movement of left-wing extremism that has grown up over the last few years, and I believe, is part of the reason why Charlie was killed by an assassin's bullet.\"",
      "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who was among the guests on the show, echoed the sentiment, saying \"we are going to channel all of the anger that we have over the organized campaign that led to this assassination, to uproot and dismantle these terrorist networks.\"",
      "\"We are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people, it will happen, and we will do it in Charlie's name,\" Miller pledged.",
      "Vance said he has heard \"many calls in the last few days for unity, and for healing\" in the wake of Kirk's assassination, saying \"you have no idea how desperately I want that.\" But he added that \"first, we must tell the truth.\"",
      "\"I really do believe that we can come together in this country, I believe, we must,\" Vance said. \"But unity, real unity can be found only after climbing the mountain of truth.\"",
      "The vice president claimed people on the left are more likely to celebrate and defend political violence, saying \"this is not a both sides problem.\"",
      "\"If both sides have a problem, one side has a much bigger and malignant problem, and that is the truth we must be told,\" he added.",
      "Also among the guests was White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.",
      "Vance said \"it's up to all of us\" to \"keep on the legacy of Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "\"We've got to carry on the mantle, we've got to carry on the torch,\" the vice president said. \"That's why I'm doing this show today is I just wanted to, you know, send a signal that we're not going to let Charlie's mantle be discarded. We're going to keep on carrying it.\"",
      "Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, said in her first public remarks since his death that \"the movement my husband built will not die,\" noting that \"the radio and podcast show that he was so proud of will go on.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's extensions have come as the U.S. tries to negotiate an agreement that would separate the hugely popular video-sharing app from ByteDance. The Trump administration appeared close to a deal in the spring, which would have spun TikTok's U.S.-based operations into a new company owned and operated by a majority of American investors, and allowed ByteDance to maintain a minority stake.

    "story": [
      "New York City is overwhelmingly described by its voters as unaffordable, and voters' desire for a mayor they believe can bring change outpaces their desire for one with experience.",
      "Against that backdrop, Zohran Mamdani leads, and by an especially wide gap among those whose top issue is the cost of living.",
      "In this nationally watched contest, President Trump also looms as a factor, with many voters \u2014 Mamdani's in particular \u2014wanting a mayor who would oppose Donald Trump, rather than work with him.",
      "Unlike their views on the city's affordability, voters are relatively more mixed in their assessments of crime. Many feel it's either held the same or decreased in recent years.",
      "For those who do say crime has increased, the contest is more competitive for former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and he fares far better than Mamdani among the group that ranks crime as its top issue.",
      "(More think the subway, in general, has gotten worse rather than gotten better.)",
      "But right now, economics outweighs other factors.",
      "In either case, Mayor Eric Adams trails and is well back in the field, as so many New York voters describe things in the city going badly and give him negative job approval ratings.",
      "In terms of approach, the bulk of New York voters want the next mayor to focus on policies that make things easier for both businesses and the middle and working classes to be in the city. To most, that isn't mutually exclusive.",
      "But they especially want things to be easier for the middle and working classes.",
      "The candidates",
      "Mamdani does well with voters who say they want a candidate who will \"fight for people like them\" and \"bring needed change\" \u2014 reflecting that overall negative view about affordability and the city's direction \u2014 and with those prioritizing a candidate who is honest and trustworthy.",
      "Cuomo has an edge with voters who say \"the right experience\" is very important, perhaps reflecting his having served as governor, but that desire for experience is much lower than for bringing change.",
      "And Cuomo still trails Mamdani among those who want someone to \"get things done,\" though not by as large a gap.",
      "Cuomo is the top second choice among Adams voters. But with Adams' support in single digits, Mamdani's current lead in the contest does not narrow much if voters backing Adams were reallocated to their second choices.",
      "The Trump factor",
      "In a contest that has drawn national attention, Mr. Trump is also a factor here for some voters.",
      "By a factor of almost 2 to 1, New York voters would prefer the next mayor to generally oppose Mr. Trump than to work with him.",
      "That accrues to Mamdani's benefit, as he draws two-thirds of those voters who want someone who would oppose Mr. Trump.",
      "There are differences on this approach among candidates' backers too.",
      "Mamdani's current backers overwhelmingly want a candidate who opposes Mr. Trump, but Cuomo's backers are more mixed between opposing and being neutral toward Mr. Trump.",
      "Six in 10 voters would want the next mayor to oppose having National Guard troops in the city if Mr. Trump decided to send them.",
      "And related to this, if voters felt Mr. Trump were supporting a mayoral candidate, that would be a net negative for that candidate. It would make more voters less likely to pick that candidate than back them.",

      "Voters divide over the best policy to reduce crime if asked to pick between tougher sentences for criminals or more social programs and community outreach.",

      "Mamdani leads with younger voters and those with college degrees, drawing outright majorities among these groups. The race is much tighter among older voters and those without college degrees, with Cuomo's support roughly matching Mamdani's among those groups.",
      "Newer residents \u2014 those who have moved to the city within the last 10 years \u2014 and renters are likelier to pick Mamdani than people who've lived in New York for longer and who are home owners.",

The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, and NYC borough, based on the voter file and U.S. Census data, as well as to 2024 presidential vote and 2025 primary vote among voters whose turnout was validated against the voter file.

    "summary": "Earlier this month, the U.S. deported a group of non-Ghanaian nationals to Ghana, including deportees from Gambia and Nigeria.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Saturday accused the Trump administration of trying to do an \"end-run\" around legal obligations that the U.S. has to protect people fleeing persecution and torture following the deportation of a group of African migrants to Ghana, some of whom are now slated to be returned to their home countries.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan ordered the U.S. government to explain, by 9 p.m. EST on Saturday, what steps it was taking to prevent the deportees \"from being removed to their countries of origin or other countries where they fear persecution or torture.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the U.S. deported more than a dozen non-Ghanaian nationals to Ghana, including deportees from Gambia and Nigeria, making Ghana the latest country to accept these so-called third country deportations at the request of the Trump administration. Ghana's government confirmed the deportations.",
      "Attorneys have alleged in a lawsuit that the deportees have been held in \"squalid conditions and surrounded by armed military guards in an open-air detention facility\" in Ghana.",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, told Chutkan during a hearing Saturday that four of the deportees have been told that Ghana will return them to their native nations as early as Monday, despite the fact that they have orders from U.S. immigration judges that bar their deportation to their home countries due to concerns they could be persecuted or tortured there. One man from Gambia, who attorneys say is bisexual, has already been returned to Gambia, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The deportees' legal protections \u2014 which are rooted in the United Nations Convention Against Torture and a provision of U.S. immigration law known as withholding of removal \u2014 prohibit the U.S. from sending foreigners to countries where they would face persecution or torture. But unlike asylum, they still allow the U.S. to send them to other, third-party countries.",
      "The Justice Department lawyer representing the U.S. government during the hearing did not dispute that Ghana plans to return the deportees to their native countries and conceded that the Ghanaian government appears to be violating diplomatic assurances that it allegedly made vowing not to send these migrants to places where they could be harmed.",
      "But the Justice Department attorney said the U.S. could not tell Ghana what to do at this point.",
      "Chutkan appeared frustrated by that position, suggesting it was \"disingenuous.\" She grilled the Justice Department attorney about whether the U.S. knew this could happen and suggested the deportations seemed to be an \"end-run\" to bypass the legal protections the deportees have. She suggested the U.S. can retrieve the deportees and return them to the U.S. or transfer them to another country where they would be safe. Or, she added, it could tell Ghana it is violating its agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"How's this not a violation of your obligation?\" she asked the Justice Department attorney.",
      "But Chutkan acknowledged her \"hands may be tied\" since the deportees are not on American soil nor in U.S. custody. She also implied that the Supreme Court would almost certainly pause any order that required the American government to act to stop the returns.",
      "In a statement Monday, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin rejected claims that the deportations to Ghana violate U.S. immigration law, citing a Supreme Court order earlier this year that lifted restrictions on third country removals.",
      "\"All of these illegal aliens deported to Ghana received due process and had a final order of removal from an immigration judge,\" McLaughlin added. \"Many of these were heinous criminals with rap sheets that included injury to a child, robbery, aggravated assault, and fraud.\"",
      "Gelernt, the ACLU attorney representing the African deportees, hailed Chutkan's mandate.",
      "\"The Court properly recognized that the United States government, with full knowledge that these individuals are going to be sent to danger, cannot simply wash their hands of the matter,\" Gelernt told CBS News.",
      "As part of its mass deportation campaign, the Trump administration has sought to convince countries around the globe to receive deportees who are not their citizens, brokering agreements with nations including El Salvador, Kosovo, Panama and South Sudan.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Maurene Comey, a former federal prosecutor in New York who handled criminal cases against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, is suing the Trump administration over her firing in July, saying that her ouster was unlawful and unconstitutional.",
      "\"Ms. Comey's termination \u2014 without cause, without advance notice, and without any opportunity to contest it \u2014 was unlawful and unconstitutional,\" Comey's attorneys wrote in a complaint filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. They wrote that their client was \"an exemplary, dedicated, and highly decorated public servant\" who was \"repeatedly promoted\" for her work on major cases.",
      "Comey is also the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, who has publicly clashed with President Trump for years. In 2017, Mr. Trump terminated James Comey as FBI director, amid the department's investigation into any ties between Mr. Trump's associates and Russia. James Comey is currently under a Justice Department investigation after he provoked an outcry from the Trump administration in May when he briefly posted a photo to Instagram that federal officials alleged was a call for violence against Mr. Trump. James Comey denied encouraging violence and deleted the post.",
      "Before her firing in July, Maurene Comey was an assistant U.S. attorney in the high-profile U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan, where she had worked since 2015. Her lawyers wrote that she was fired one day after she had \"been asked to take the lead on a major public corruption case.\" Just months before, she had received an \"outstanding\" review from supervisors, the complaint said.",
      "\"Defendants have not provided any explanation whatsoever for terminating Ms. Comey. In truth, there is no legitimate explanation. Rather, Defendants fired Ms. Comey solely or substantially because her father is former FBI Director James B. Comey, or because of her perceived political affiliation and beliefs, or both,\" Comey's attorneys wrote, labeling her termination \"politically motivated\" and an overreach of presidential authority.",
      "The complaint said Comey learned of her firing in a memo sent over email from a Justice Department official on July 16. The memo said: \"Pursuant to Article II of the United States Constitution and the laws of the United States, your employment with the Department of Justice is hereby terminated, and you are removed from federal service effective immediately.\"",
      "Comey's attorneys said she asked Jay Clayton, the interim U.S. attorney, for an explanation of her firing. \"All I can say is it came from Washington. I can't tell you anything else,\" he replied, according to the complaint. Her lawyers said she received no other justification for her ouster.",
      "Comey's attorneys asked the court to order her reinstatement to the Southern District of New York's prosecutor's office and to block any adverse action against her without proper due process.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the suit.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast. Rosen has been a producer for several CBS News podcasts, including \"The Takeout,\" \"The Debrief\" and \"Agent of Betrayal: The Double Life of Robert Hanssen.\""

      "Claiming a home as a \"primary residence\" can result in better down payment and mortgage terms than if one of the homes is classified as a vacation home.",

      "This year, the Trump administration's immigration crackdowns, a federally led English-only initiative and an anti-diversity, equity and inclusion push have changed the national climate in which these celebrations occur. Organizers across the country, from Massachusetts and North Carolina to California and Washington state, have postponed or canceled heritage month festivals altogether.",
      "Celebrated each year from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, the month is a chance for many in the U.S. to learn about and celebrate the contributions of Hispanic cultures, the country's fastest-growing racial or ethnic minority, according to the U.S. Census. The group includes people whose ancestors come from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America.",
      "More than 68 million people identify as ethnically Hispanic in the U.S., according to the latest census estimates.",
      "Before there was National Hispanic Heritage Month, there was Hispanic Heritage Week, which was created through legislation sponsored by Mexican American U.S. Rep Edward R. Roybal of Los Angeles and signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson.",
      "The weeklong commemoration was expanded to a month two decades later, with legislation signed into law by President Ronald Reagan.",
      "\"It was clustered around big celebrations for the community,\" Alberto Lammers, director of communications at the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute said. \"It became a chance for people to know Hispanic cultures, for Latinos to get to know a community better and for the American public to understand a little better the long history of Latinos in the U.S.\"",
      "Sept. 15 was chosen as the starting point to coincide with the anniversary of \"El Grito de Dolores,\" or the \"Cry of Dolores,\" which was issued in 1810 from a town in Mexico that launched the country's war for independence from Spain.",
      "The Central American nations of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica celebrate their independence on Sept. 15 and Mexico marks its national day on Sept. 16, the day after the cry for independence.",

      "The White House so far has not mentioned any planned events. Last year, President Joe Biden hosted a reception and issued a proclamation for the occasion.",
      "Hispanic was a term coined by the federal government for people descended from Spanish-speaking cultures. But for some, the label has a connotation of political conservatism and emphasizes a connection to Spain. It sometimes gets mistakenly interchanged with \"Latino\" or \"Latinx.\"",
      "For some, Latino reflects their ties to Latin America. So some celebrations are referred to as Latinx or Latin Heritage Month.",
      "Latin Americans are not a monolith. There are several other identifiers for Latin Americans, depending largely on personal preference. Mexican Americans who grew up during the 1960s Civil Rights era may identify as Chicano. Other may go by their family's nation of origin such as Colombian American or Salvadoran American.",
      "Each culture has unique differences when it comes to music, food, art and other cultural touchstones.",
      "September typically has no shortage of festivities. Events often include traditional Latin foods and entertainment like mariachi bands, folkl\u00f3rico and salsa dance lessons. The intent is to showcase the culture of Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and other Latin countries.",
      "Masked ICE agents carrying out President Trump's policies via workplace raids at farms, manufacturing plants and elsewhere - which has included detaining legal residents - led some to fear large gatherings would become additional targets for raids. Another obstacle heritage celebrations face is the perception that they'd violate bans on DEI programming - something Mr. Trump has discouraged across federal agencies. Some companies and universities have followed suit.",
      "Early in September, organizers of a Mexican Independence festival in Chicago announced they would postpone celebrations due to Trump's promises of an immigration crackdown in the city.",
      "\"It was a painful decision, but holding El Grito Chicago at this time puts the safety of our community at stake - and that's a risk we are unwilling to take,\" said the organizers of the festival.",
      "A new date has not yet been announced. Though Mexican Independence Day falls on Sept. 16, celebrations in Chicago typically span more than a week and draw hundreds of thousands of participants for lively parades, festivals, street parties and car caravans.",
      "\"The fact that the federal government is sending troops as we start these celebrations is an insult,\" Illinois state Sen. Karina Villa, a Democrat, said at a news conference. \"It is a fear tactic. It's unforgivable.\"",
      "Similarly, Sacramento's annual Mexican Independence Day festival was canceled with organizers citing the political climate and safety concerns.",
      "Other events that have been canceled include the Hispanic Heritage Festival of the Carolinas, Hispanic Heritage Fest in Kenner, Louisiana and FIESTA Indianapolis.",
      "Ivan Sandoval-Cervantes, an anthropology professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said when celebrations are canceled from the top down it affects how we see them throughout the country.

      "\"If it's not being celebrated by a specific state that doesn't mean they won't be celebrated but they might go into the private sphere,\" Sandoval-Cervantes said. \"Where it's safer to embrace the symbols or even speak Spanish.\"",
      "In Mexico, the government launched a new appeal to raise awareness among Mexican migrants to take every possible precaution during the holidays because any incident, such as while driving, could lead to a deportation.",
      "\"Rather than not celebrating, be cautious\" and gather at the consulates, President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday.",

      "Atlanta \u2014 A popular museum in Atlanta is expanding at a critical moment in the United States \u2014 and unlike the Smithsonian Institution, the National Center for Civil and Human Rights is privately funded, putting it beyond the immediate reach of Trump administration efforts to control what Americans learn about their history.",
      "The months-long renovation, which cost nearly $60 million, adds six new galleries as well as classrooms and interactive experiences, changing a relatively static museum into a dynamic place where people are encouraged to take action supporting civil and human rights, racial justice and the future of democracy, said Jill Savitt, the center's president and CEO.",
      "The center has stayed active ahead of its Nov. 8 reopening through K-12 education programs that include more than 300 online lesson plans; a LGBTQ+ Institute; training in diversity, equity and inclusion; human rights training for law enforcement; and its Truth & Transformation Initiative to spread awareness about forced labor, racial terror and other historic injustices.",
      "These are the same aspects of American history, culture and society that the Trump administration is seeking to dismantle.",
      "Dreamed up by civil rights icons Evelyn Lowery and Andrew Young, the center opened in 2014 on land donated by the Coca-Cola Company, next to the Georgia Aquarium and The World of Coca-Cola, and became a major tourist attraction. But ticket sales declined after the pandemic.",
      "Now the center hopes to attract more repeat visitors with immersive experiences like \"Change Agent Adventure,\" aimed at children under 12. These \"change agents\" will be asked to pledge to something \u2014 no matter how small \u2014 that \"reflects the responsibility of each of us to play a role in the world: To have empathy. To call for justice. To be fair, be kind. And that's the ethos of this gallery,\" Savitt said. It opens next April.",
      "\"I think advocacy and change-making is kind of addictive. It's contagious,\" Savitt explained. \"When you do something, you see the success of it, you really want to do more. And our desire here is to whet the appetite of kids to see that they can be involved. They can do it.\"",
      "This ethos is sharply different from the idea that young people can't handle the truth and must be protected from unpleasant challenges but, Savitt said, \"the history that we tell here is the most inspirational history.\"",
      "\"In fact, I think it's what makes America great. It is something to be patriotically proud of. The way activists over time have worked together through nonviolence and changed democracy to expand human freedom \u2014 there's nothing more American and nothing greater than that. That is the lesson that we teach here,\" she said.",
      "\"Broken Promises,\" opening in December, includes exhibits from the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, cut short when white mobs sought to brutally reverse advances by formerly enslaved people. \"We want to start orienting you in the conversation that we believe we all kind of see, but we don't say it outright: Progress. Backlash. Progress. Backlash. And that pattern that has been in our country since enslavement,\" said its curator, Kama Pierce.",
      "On display will be a Georgia historical marker from the site of the 1918 lynching of Mary Turner, pockmarked repeatedly with bullets, that Turner descendants donated to keep it from being vandalized again.",
      "\"There are 11 bullet holes and 11 grandchildren living,\" and the family's words will be incorporated into the exhibit to show their resilience, Pierce said.",
      "Items from the Morehouse College Martin Luther King Jr. collection will have a much more prominent place, in a room that recreates King's home office, with family photos contributed by the center's first guest curator: his daughter, the Rev. Bernice King. \"We wanted to lift up King's role as a man, as a human being, not just as an icon,\" Savitt explained.",
      "Gone are the huge images of the world's most genocidal leaders \u2014 Hitler, Stalin and Mao among others \u2014 with explanatory text about the millions of people killed under their orders. In their place will be examples of human rights victories by groups working around the world.",
      "\"The research says that if you tell people things are really bad and how awful they are, you motivate people for a minute, and then apathy sets in because it's too hard to do anything,\" Savitt said. \"But if you give people something to hope for that's positive, that they can see themselves doing, you're more likely to cultivate a sense of agency in people.\"",
      "And doubling in capacity is an experience many can't forget: Joining a 1960s sit-in against segregation. Wearing headphones as they take a lunch-counter stool, visitors can both hear and feel an angry, segregationist mob shouting they don't belong. Because this is \"heavy content,\" Savitt says, a new \"reflection area\" will enable people to pause afterward on a couch, with tissues if they need them, to consider what they've just been through.",

    "summary": "Over 300 lawsuits challenging many of Trump's second-term plans have been winding through federal courts, and a handful may be poised for Supreme Court review.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 More than 300 lawsuits challenging many of President Trump's second-term plans and his administration's actions have been winding through the federal courts over the past few months. But a handful now may be poised for review by the Supreme Court, or are getting close to it.",
      "The cases involve major policies enacted by Mr. Trump in the months since he returned to the White House, and several of them have already been before the high court, though during earlier stages in the proceedings.",
      "In those instances, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to grant it emergency relief, allowing it to enforce its immigration policies, in some instances, or terminate officials at independent agencies, in others.",
      "In the wake of those interim decisions, lower courts have continued to hold proceedings and issue rulings addressing the merits of the Trump administration's actions. If the Supreme Court agrees to step into these disputes, they will present the initial opportunities for the justices to address the legality of Mr. Trump's plans.",
      "\"I'm expecting this to be the term of Trump,\" Dan Epps, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said of the new Supreme Court term set to begin Oct. 6.",
      "The justices are already set to hear blockbuster cases on redistricting, campaign finance and state laws barring transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "Many of the disputes involving Mr. Trump's actions test the limits of the president's power, and rulings could have massive implications for his policies on the economy and immigration, as well as his reshaping of the executive branch.",
      "The Trump administration has sought emergency intervention from the Supreme Court roughly two dozen times so far, and it has fared well in its bids to continue enforcing its plans while legal challenges continue.",
      "But whether the president will prevail when the Supreme Court examines the lawfulness of his actions remains to be seen. Still, in some instances \u2014 like his efforts to fire certain executive officers \u2014 the Supreme Court has signaled that Mr. Trump may have the power to terminate members of certain independent agencies.",
      "\"What's at stake is the country's commitment to the rule of law,\" Epps said. He added that the new term could also bring a \"huge sweeping victory\" for executive power, particularly if the Supreme Court finds that courts should give broad deference to the president on matters like immigration.",
      "Tariffs",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed on nearly every U.S. trading partner will be the first in which the Supreme Court will decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's key policies.",
      "The high court said Tuesday that it is taking up two cases involving the global tariffs, which question whether Mr. Trump has the power to impose the sweeping duties under a federal emergency powers law. The justices will hear arguments in early November, a rapid timeline for the court.",
      "The Justice Department had asked the Supreme Court to step into the legal battle after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled late last month that many of Mr. Trump's tariffs issued under the emergency powers law are illegal.",
      "The Federal Circuit divided 7-4 in finding that the law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, did not authorize the president's global tariffs. But the duties remain in place for now, as the Federal Circuit wiped away a permanent injunction granted by a lower court that blocked the Trump administration from imposing the levies.",
      "The dispute tests a major centerpiece of the president's economic agenda, and the Justice Department has warned that a ruling against the government would put the frameworks of trade deals negotiated with half a dozen countries at risk.",
      "Termination of temporary legal protections for Venezuelan migrants",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump took office, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem took steps to end legal protections that had been granted to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants by the Biden administration through a program known as Temporary Protected Status.",
      "In response to a lawsuit filed by the National TPS Alliance and seven individuals who were shielded from threat of deportation, a federal judge granted preliminary relief and postponed the date Noem's plan was set to take effect.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined to put that decision on hold while proceedings moved forward, but the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration emergency relief, allowing Noem to end the legal protections for now.",
      "Meanwhile, the 9th Circuit heard arguments in July on the Trump administration's effort to terminate the TPS designation for Venezuela, and late last month, a three-judge panel sided with the plaintiffs.",
      "The judges found that the TPS holders were likely to succeed in their argument that Noem lacked the authority to set aside an earlier extension of the program for Venezuelan migrants.",
      "The impact of that decision, however, is limited because the interim relief granted by the Supreme Court at an earlier stage in the case is still in place.",
      "Alien Enemies Act removals",
      "Mr. Trump issued a proclamation in March that invoked the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport Venezuelan migrants who are suspected of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants it claims are gang members under the wartime law, which gives the president the authority to remove citizens of a \"hostile nation\" if it is engaged in an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
      "A \"60 Minutes\" investigation found that many migrants deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act didn't have criminal records.",
      "The proclamation immediately sparked litigation, including two court fights that have already been up to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket. In the first case, brought in federal district court in Washington, D.C., the high court said any challenges to removals under the Alien Enemies Act must be brought in the judicial district where a migrant is being held.",
      "But the Supreme Court also said that migrants at risk of deportation under the 1798 law must receive notice that they are subject to removal and the opportunity to challenge it.",
      "In the wake of that decision, judges in Texas, Colorado, New York and California have blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants being held in their regions.",
      "The second case to reach the Supreme Court arose when Venezuelan migrants detained by immigration officials at a facility in the Northern District of Texas sued to challenge their removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The high court temporarily blocked the migrants' deportations in April and later\u00a0sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit for further review after finding the Trump administration had not provided the migrants with enough notice \u2014 24 hours \u2014 of their impending deportations.",
      "The Supreme Court did not address the lawfulness of the removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "After holding additional proceedings, a divided three-judge panel on the 5th Circuit rejected Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove Venezuelan migrants in the Northern District of Texas. The court said in its 2-1 decision that there was no predatory incursion or invasion by Tren de Aragua \u2014 preconditions to invoking the law.",
      "The 5th Circuit is the first appeals court to address whether Mr. Trump properly invoked the 18th century-law.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson suggested the Trump administration will appeal, saying the 5th Circuit's decision \"will not be the final say on the matter.\"",
      "Firings of members of independent agencies",
      "Mr. Trump has spent his months back in the White House pushing the bounds of executive power, including by firing officials at independent agencies appointed by former President Joe Biden.",
      "Mr. Trump's attempts to remove members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Trade Commission, to name a few, have all led to legal challenges by the ousted officials.",
      "In cases brought by Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, members of the NLRB and MSPB, respectively, a lower court ordered them to be reinstated to their roles. Federal judges in Washington, D.C., ruled their firings violated federal laws that shielded them from being terminated without cause and cited a 1935 Supreme Court decision that said Congress could enact removal protections for members of multi-member boards that met certain criteria.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court for emergency relief allowing it to fire Wilcox and Harris while their cases proceed, and the court gave the president the green-light to remove the officials for now.",
      "Meanwhile, the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., heard oral arguments on Mr. Trump's bid to fire Wilcox and Harris in May but has not yet issued a decision.",
      "But in a different case, involving Mr. Trump's attempt to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the removal protections for members of the trade commission violate the separation of powers. The administration wants the high court to take up the dispute over Slaughter's removal before the appeals court has ruled.",
      "At least one justice, Brett Kavanaugh, believes it's time for the Supreme Court to address the legality of removal restrictions for members of independent agencies. In a concurring opinion in a case involving Mr. Trump's firing of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Kavanaugh said there is a \"at least a fair prospect\" that the Supreme Court will either narrow or overrule Humphrey's Executor v. United States, that 1935 decision that upheld removal protections for certain executive officers.",
      "\"[W]hen the question is whether to narrow or overrule one of this Court's precedents rather than how to resolve an open or disputed question of federal law, further percolation in the lower courts is not particularly useful because lower courts cannot alter or overrule this Court's precedent,\" he wrote.",
      "Birthright citizenship",
      "The president's plan to end birthright citizenship has already been before the Supreme Court, but the justices did not address the constitutionality of his executive order. Instead, the dispute involved whether federal judges have the ability to issue nationwide injunctions, or orders that universally block enforcement of a policy beyond the plaintiffs in a case.",
      "The high court said judges are limited in their ability to grant that sweeping relief, but left open other avenues like class-action lawsuits or challenges to an agency rule brought under the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law governing the agency rule-making process.",
      "Following that June decision, several groups of plaintiffs amended their initial lawsuits and asked district courts to certify as classes children covered by Mr. Trump's executive order and would be denied birthright citizenship.",
      "In one of those cases, brought by a group of four states \u2014 Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon \u2014 a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled 2-1 in July that Mr. Trump's executive order is unconstitutional.",
      "The White House said in response to the decision that it looks forward to \"being vindicated on appeal.\"",
      "The ruling from the 9th Circuit was the first from an appeals court to address the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's executive order.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-fda-expert-reviews-of-new-drugs/",
    "published": "Fri, 12 Sep 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Advisory committee meetings help FDA scientists make decisions and increase public understanding of drug regulation, and abandoning them doesn't make sense, former officials said.",
    "story": [
      "FDA leaders under President Trump are moving to abandon a decades-old policy of asking outside experts to review drug applications, a move critics say would shield the agency's decisions from public scrutiny.",
      "The agency \"would like to get away\" from assembling panels of experts to examine and vote on individual drugs, because \"I don't think they're needed,\" said George Tidmarsh, head of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. He relayed the message Tuesday at a meeting of health care product makers and Wednesday to an FDA advocacy group.",
      "In addition to being redundant, Tidmarsh said, advisory meetings on specific drugs were \"a tremendous amount of work for the company and for the FDA. We want to use that work and our time to focus on the big questions.\"",
      "The FDA's advisory committees were created in their current form by a 1972 law aimed at expanding and regulating the government's use of experts in technical decisions. They're periodically summoned for advice, including to review evidence and vote on whether the FDA should approve drugs, vaccines, and medical devices, often when FDA officials face a difficult decision.",
      "FDA actions have traditionally aligned with committee votes. A departure can provoke controversy and public debate, as was the case with the split 2021 decision on whether to approve the Biogen drug Aduhelm to treat Alzheimer's disease.",
      "The FDA approved the drug despite a \"no\" vote from its advisory committee, whose members felt the medicine did little to treat the disease. The conflict over Aduhelm laid bare the FDA's struggle to reconcile pressure from industry and desperate patients with its rigorous evaluation of drug risks and benefits.",
      "Tidmarsh said the committees would still be consulted on general issues like how to regulate different classes of drugs. But meetings on specific drugs, in which experts plow through piles of studies and hours of testimony from FDA and company officials, were mainly useful, he said, because they allowed the public to see how the FDA worked.",
      "This month the FDA began publishing the \"complete response letters\" it sends to companies when it declines to approve their products. Releasing the letters, which previously required filing requests under the federal Freedom of Information Act, promotes a level of transparency akin to the advisory meetings', Tidmarsh said.",
      "Advisory committee meetings on individual drugs \"are redundant when you have the complete review letters,\" he told KFF Health News in a brief interview after appearing at the health care products conference.",
      "Former FDA officials and academics who study the agency disagree. The meetings help FDA scientists make decisions and increase public understanding of drug regulation, and abandoning them doesn't make sense, they said.",
      "Tidmarsh's reasoning is \"hard to follow,\" former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told KFF Health News. \"It's extremely useful for people inside FDA to find out what other experts think before they make their final decisions. And it's important to do that in a way that enables the public to understand the points of view.\"",
      "\"Experts might ask questions of the company or FDA that neither of them thought of on their own,\" said Holly Fernandez Lynch, an associate professor of bioethics and law at the University of Pennsylvania. \"The public has few other opportunities to comment about FDA decisions.\"",
      "Spokespeople for FDA and the Health and Human Services Department did not respond to repeated requests for elaboration on Tidmarsh's comments.",
      "Califf at times disagreed with advisory committees as commissioner of the agency and once floated the idea that it might be better if they deliberated but did not vote on products. Still, while \"maybe someone can come up with a better one, I always thought it was an amazing system,\" he said.",
      "The FDA is not obliged to ask the outside experts to review drugs and usually hasn't. It calls on them mainly for important new types of medications or when a decision is especially tricky because of high demand for a product that may have limited value, Aduhelm being a classic example.",
      "The advisory committees are \"an important resource\" for the FDA, said Sarah Ryan, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. \"They can play an important part of the rigorous human drug review process we have in the U.S.\"",
      "The committees are often asked to help settle disagreements within the FDA about how to move forward on a regulatory decision, said Reshma Ramachandran, a health services researcher and clinician at the Yale School of Medicine.",
      "She and other researchers and former FDA officials praised FDA Commissioner Marty Makary's decision to publish the complete response letters.",
      "But the letters don't obviate the need for committee meetings, said Peter Lurie, a former associate FDA commissioner who heads the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "\"A disclosed complete response letter tells the public that a company's application was rejected and why,\" Lurie said. \"An advisory committee meeting says to outside experts and the public, 'Here's what we're thinking of doing and we'd love your input before we decide.' Plainly, those are not equivalent.\"",
      "The changes Tidmarsh described are already playing out on the ground. The FDA has held only seven advisory committee meetings since Mr. Trump reentered the White House, compared with 22 over the same time frame last year. Officials say they will now release complete response letters as they are sent, and published a batch of 89 earlier in September.",
      "Makary has to some extent replaced the advisory committees, whose members have traditionally been vetted for expertise and biases and which are required to deliberate in public, with panels of handpicked scientists who support his views on subjects such as hormone replacement therapy and antidepressants.",
      "Diana Zuckerman, a critic of the drug industry, attended the July hormone replacement therapy panel that considered the FDA's black-box warning listing dangers of the treatment. Makary had wanted the warning removed and packed the panel with like-minded experts.",
      "The event was hastily called with no opportunity for the public to review discussion materials or comment on them, she said.",
      "\"All that was transparent was that they didn't want to hear from anyone who disagreed with them,\" said Zuckerman, who leads the National Center for Health Research.",
      "Before becoming commissioner, Makary pushed for more advisory committee meetings. In early 2022, he blasted the FDA's decision to approve COVID boosters for children ages 12 to 15 without consulting its Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Makary posted on the social platform X at the time, \"It is a slap in the face to science for @US_FDA to circumvent the standard convening of the expert advisory board.\"",
      "But Tidmarsh seems to disagree.",
      "Instead of asking an advisory committee to vote in favor of or against a Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, for example, he said the FDA would be better served by a committee studying the best way to evaluate such drugs, such as which outcomes, or end points, to measure. \"Is this end point correct for Duchenne muscular dystrophy? That's an important question that cuts across many different companies,\" he told KFF Health News.",
      "FDA official Vinay Prasad canceled a planned July advisory committee meeting to discuss a Duchenne drug made by the biotech company Capricor Therapeutics. The FDA later published its rejection, or \"complete response letter,\" to Capricor, which then published its own letter of response to the FDA. Prasad was later pushed out and rehired with fewer powers.",
      "An advisory committee meeting could have worked through the drug's risks and benefits in a calmer, public, less politicized atmosphere, Ramachandran said.",
      "The FDA usually agrees with the votes of its several dozen advisory committees. A 2023 study found that the FDA agreed with 97% of \"yes\" votes and 67% of \"no\" votes.",
      "That's why Tidmarsh's comments \"come as a complete surprise,\" said Genevieve Kanter, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Southern California, who wrote commentary accompanying the study. The FDA has postponed a lot of meetings this year, but \"everyone thought it was temporary, with the transition and all the firings.\"",
      "\"Another theory is that this decision is strategic,\" she said, \"in terms of consolidating power in the agencies so that you are no longer accountable to outside experts or the public.\"",

    "summary": "Some ancient societies in Asia appear to have smoke-dried their dead, effectively mummifying them thousands of years earlier than their Egyptian counterparts, new research has found.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have discovered what's thought to be the oldest known mummies in the world in southeastern Asia dating back up to 12,000 years.",
      "Mummification prevents decay by preserving dead bodies. The process can happen naturally in places like the sands of Chile's Atacama Desert or the bogs of Ireland where conditions can fend off decomposition. Humans across various cultures also mummified their ancestors through embalming to honor them or send their souls to the afterlife.",
      "Egypt's mummies may be the most well-known, but until now some of the oldest mummies were prepared by a fishing people called the Chinchorro about 7,000 years ago in what's now Peru and Chile.",
      "A new study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences pushes that timeline back.",
      "Researchers found human remains that were buried in crouched or squatted positions with some cuts and burn marks in various archaeological sites across China and Vietnam and to a lesser extent, from the Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.",
      "Studying the bones further, scientists discovered the bodies were likely exposed to heat. That suggested the bodies had been smoke-dried over a fire and mummified by hunter-gatherer communities in the area.",
      "The practice \"allowed people to sustain physical and spiritual connections with their ancestors, bridging time and memory,\" study author Hirofumi Matsumura with Sapporo Medical University in Japan said in an email.",
      "The results were \"a great surprise,\" said Hsiao-chun Hung, senior research fellow at Australian National University.",
      "\"The bones are so ancient, and it is remarkable to discover that this tradition is so old, connecting the practices of ancient peoples with those still found in some communities today,\" Hung said.",
      "The process allowed relatives to maintain contact with the deceased, and in some cases was believed to allow the spirit to roam freely during the day and return to a body at night.",
      "\"I believe this reflects something deeply human \u2014 the timeless wish that our loved ones might never leave us, but remain by our side forever,\" Hung told Agence France-Presse.",
      "The researchers theorize that the practice may have been common in ancient Asian civilizations.",
      "\"This tradition may have been known among hunter-gatherer societies across a vast region, for many millennia,\" they wrote in the study,",
      "Dating methods used on the mummies could have been more robust and it's not yet clear that mummies were consistently smoke-dried across all these locations in southeastern Asia, said human evolution expert Rita Peyroteo Stjerna with Uppsala University in Sweden, who was not involved with the research.",
      "The findings offer \"an important contribution to the study of prehistoric funerary practices,\" she said in an email.",
      "Mummies are far from a thing of the past. Even today, Indigenous communities in Australia and Papua New Guinea smoke-dry and mummify their dead, scientists said.",

    "story": [
      "NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "They stressed that in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there by Perseverance \u2014 ideally in labs on Earth \u2014 before reaching any conclusions.",
      "\"Today we are really showing you how we are kind of one step closer to answering ... are we truly alone in the universe,\" Associate NASA Administrator Nicky Fox said during a briefing on the findings Wednesday morning.",
      "Roaming Mars since 2021, the rover cannot directly detect life. Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth \u2014 an ambitious plan that's on hold as NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options.",
      "Calling it an \"exciting discovery,\" a pair of scientists who were not involved in the study \u2014 SETI Institute's Janice Bishop and the University of Massachusetts Amherst's Mario Parente \u2014 were quick to point out that non-biological processes could be responsible.",
      "\"That's part of the reason why we can't go so far as to say, 'A-ha, this is proof positive of life,''' lead researcher Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University told The Associated Press. \"All we can say is one of the possible explanations is microbial life, but there could be other ways to make this set of features that we see.\"",
      "Either way, Hurowitz said it's the best, most compelling candidate yet in the rover's search for potential signs of long-ago life. It was the 25th sample gathered; the tally is now up to 30, with six more to go.",
      "\"It would be amazing to be able to demonstrate conclusively that these features were formed by something that was alive on another planet billions of years ago, right?\" Hurowitz said. But even if that's not the case, it's \"a valuable lesson in all of the ways that nature can conspire to fool us.\"",
      "Collected last summer, the sample is from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, a river channel that once carried water into Jezero Crater. This outcrop of sedimentary rock, known as the Bright Angel formation, was surveyed by Perseverance's science instruments before the drill came out.",
      "Along with organic carbon, a building block of life, Hurowitz and his team found minuscule specks, dubbed poppy seeds and leopard spots, that were enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide. On Earth, these chemical compounds are the byproducts when microorganisms chomp down on organic matter.",
      "The findings appeared in the journal Nature.",
      "Ten of the titanium sample tubes were placed on the Martian surface a few years ago as a backup to the rest aboard the rover, the main target in NASA's still fuzzy return mission.",
      "When Perseverance launched in 2020, NASA expected the samples back on Earth by the early 2030s. But that date slipped into the 2040s as costs swelled to $11 billion, stalling the retrieval effort.",
      "Until the samples are transported off of Mars by robotic spacecraft or astronauts, scientists will have to rely on Earthly stand-ins and lab experiments to evaluate the feasibility of ancient Martian life, according to Hurowitz.",
      "On Earth, microorganisms commonly interact with minerals in Antarctic lakes.",
      "\"There is no evidence of microbes on Mars today, but if any had been present on ancient Mars, they too might have reduced sulfate minerals to form sulfides in such a lake at Jezero Crater,\" Bishop and Parente wrote in an accompanying editorial.",

    "story": [
      "NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "They stressed that in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there by Perseverance \u2014 ideally in labs on Earth \u2014 before reaching any conclusions.",
      "\"Today we are really showing you how we are kind of one step closer to answering ... are we truly alone in the universe,\" Associate NASA Administrator Nicky Fox said during a briefing on the findings Wednesday morning.",
      "Roaming Mars since 2021, the rover cannot directly detect life. Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth \u2014 an ambitious plan that's on hold as NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options.",
      "Calling it an \"exciting discovery,\" a pair of scientists who were not involved in the study \u2014 SETI Institute's Janice Bishop and the University of Massachusetts Amherst's Mario Parente \u2014 were quick to point out that non-biological processes could be responsible.",
      "\"That's part of the reason why we can't go so far as to say, 'A-ha, this is proof positive of life,''' lead researcher Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University told The Associated Press. \"All we can say is one of the possible explanations is microbial life, but there could be other ways to make this set of features that we see.\"",
      "Either way, Hurowitz said it's the best, most compelling candidate yet in the rover's search for potential signs of long-ago life. It was the 25th sample gathered; the tally is now up to 30, with six more to go.",
      "\"It would be amazing to be able to demonstrate conclusively that these features were formed by something that was alive on another planet billions of years ago, right?\" Hurowitz said. But even if that's not the case, it's \"a valuable lesson in all of the ways that nature can conspire to fool us.\"",
      "Collected last summer, the sample is from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, a river channel that once carried water into Jezero Crater. This outcrop of sedimentary rock, known as the Bright Angel formation, was surveyed by Perseverance's science instruments before the drill came out.",
      "Along with organic carbon, a building block of life, Hurowitz and his team found minuscule specks, dubbed poppy seeds and leopard spots, that were enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide. On Earth, these chemical compounds are the byproducts when microorganisms chomp down on organic matter.",
      "The findings appeared in the journal Nature.",
      "Ten of the titanium sample tubes were placed on the Martian surface a few years ago as a backup to the rest aboard the rover, the main target in NASA's still fuzzy return mission.",
      "When Perseverance launched in 2020, NASA expected the samples back on Earth by the early 2030s. But that date slipped into the 2040s as costs swelled to $11 billion, stalling the retrieval effort.",
      "Until the samples are transported off of Mars by robotic spacecraft or astronauts, scientists will have to rely on Earthly stand-ins and lab experiments to evaluate the feasibility of ancient Martian life, according to Hurowitz.",
      "On Earth, microorganisms commonly interact with minerals in Antarctic lakes.",
      "\"There is no evidence of microbes on Mars today, but if any had been present on ancient Mars, they too might have reduced sulfate minerals to form sulfides in such a lake at Jezero Crater,\" Bishop and Parente wrote in an accompanying editorial.",

It's not clear what level of involvement Chinese firms \u2014 including TikTok's current parent company ByteDance \u2014 will have in the deal, and who will control TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm. Presidents Trump and Xi are expected to talk on Friday.",
      "Attempts to reach Oracle executives and a White House spokesperson were unsuccessful. A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "\"The commercial terms have been agreed upon,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday in Madrid after meetings with Chinese officials on a range of issues, including TikTok.",
      "Li Chenggang, a Chinese vice minister of commerce, also said after the meetings, \"China will firmly safeguard the national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, and carry out technology export approval in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.",
      "Oracle \u2014 the enterprise tech company co-founded by billionaire Larry Ellison \u2014 has long been seen as a possible suitor if the U.S. government forced a TikTok sale. Mr. Trump has\u00a0described Ellison\u00a0as a friend.",
      "In 2020, Mr. Trump\u00a0endorsed a deal\u00a0that would see Oracle and Walmart taking a 20% stake in a U.S.-based entity called\u00a0TikTok Global. And in recent years, as TikTok has sought to regain trust with American users and regulators, it has\u00a0partnered with Oracle\u00a0to route U.S. TikTok users' activity through the Texas-based company's servers.",
      "Mr. Trump was circumspect about a deal with reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. \"We may let it die, or we may, I don't know, it depends. Up to China. It doesn't matter too much. I'd like to do it for the kids. They like it.\"",
      "Last year, Congress passed and then-President Joe Biden signed a bill that essentially gave TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, an ultimatum: either divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the law in a unanimous 9-0 decision. But Mr. Trump has issued a series of orders unilaterally delaying its enforcement. The latest came in June, when he pushed back the deadline for enforcing the measure until this Wednesday.",
      "The president's orders have directed the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against tech companies like Apple and Google for failing to comply with the law by allowing TikTok on their platforms.",
      "The TikTok divestiture law was passed in 2024 after years of bipartisan concern over possible national security risks posed by the ultra-popular video app. Those include worries that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to divulge information on U.S.-based users or manipulate the platform's algorithm to control what Americans see. TikTok has long denied that Chinese officials exert any influence on the platform.",
      "The concerns stretch back to Mr. Trump's first term. The president signed an executive order to ban TikTok in the U.S. in 2020 on national security and data privacy grounds, but the move was blocked by a judge. Four years later, Mr. Trump changed course and\u00a0expressed support for the app, which he has credited for his improved performance among younger voters in last year's election.",

      "Scientists have identified the origins of the blue color in one of Jackson Pollock's paintings with a little help from chemistry, confirming for the first time that the abstract expressionist used a vibrant, synthetic pigment known as manganese blue.",
      "\"Number 1A, 1948,\" showcases Pollock's classic style: paint has been dripped and splattered across the canvas, creating a vivid, multicolored work. Pollock even gave the piece a personal touch, adding his handprints near the top.",
      "The painting, currently on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, is almost 9 feet wide. Scientists had previously characterized the reds and yellows splattered across the canvas, but the source of the rich turquoise blue proved elusive.",
      "In a new study, researchers took scrapings of the blue paint and used lasers to scatter light and measure how the paint's molecules vibrated. That gave them a unique chemical fingerprint for the color, which they pinpointed as manganese blue.",
      "The analysis, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first confirmed evidence of Pollock using this specific blue.",
      "\"It's really interesting to understand where some striking color comes from on a molecular level,\" said study co-author Edward Solomon with Stanford University.",
      "The pigment manganese blue was once used by artists, as well as to color the cement for swimming pools. It was phased out by the 1990s because of environmental concerns.",
      "Previous research had suggested that the turquoise from the painting could indeed be this color, but the new study confirms it using samples from the canvas, said Rutgers University's Gene Hall, who has studied Pollock's paintings and was not involved with the discovery.",
      "\"I'm pretty convinced that it could be manganese blue,\" Hall said.",
      "The researchers also went one step further, inspecting the pigment's chemical structure to understand how it produces such a vibrant shade.",
      "Scientists study the chemical makeup of art supplies to conserve old paintings and catch counterfeits. They can take more specific samples from Pollock's paintings since he often poured directly onto the canvas instead of mixing paints on a palette beforehand.",
      "To solve this artistic mystery, researchers explored the paint using various scientific tools - similarly to how Pollock would alternate his own methods, dripping paint using a stick or using it straight from the can.",
      "In the study, researchers call the artwork \"a quintessential example of his action painting technique where ropes of color, drips of black, and pools of white coalesce into the layered dynamism that defines his style.\"\u00a0 While the artist's work may seem chaotic, Pollock rejected that interpretation. He saw his work as methodical, said study co-author Abed Haddad, an assistant conservation scientist at the Museum of Modern Art.",
      "\"I actually see a lot of similarities between the way that we worked and the way that Jackson Pollock worked on the painting,\" Haddad said.",
      "Artwork by Pollock, who became a sensation on the New York art scene in the 1940s, has popped up in unusual places over the years.",
      "In 2023, authorities in Bulgaria said a painting seized by police during a raid was likely a little-known work by the artist.",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Sep 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "With the U.S. economy facing headwinds, the Federal Reserve faces pressure to trim interest rates this week for the first time since December 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's rate decision on Wednesday is shaping up to be its most consequential of the year, with most economists predicting the first cut of 2025. The real suspense is over how deep the reduction could be \u2014 and whether the Fed might signal a broader pivot that could set the course for the rest of the year.",
      "So far, the Fed has resisted calls from President Trump to cut its benchmark interest rate, which helps determine borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Mr. Trump has pointed to the fact that inflation has remained\u00a0relatively muted, so far this year, as evidence the central bank has been too late in lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Apart from Mr. Trump's push for a cut, the Federal Reserve is facing growing economic uncertainty ahead of its Sept. 17 meeting, raising the stakes for a rate decision.",
      "On the one hand, the labor market is showing signs of distress, with hiring slowing to a standstill, which would argue for a cut. But inflation is also creeping higher under the weight of the Trump administration's tariffs, an issue that the Fed has pointed to as its reason for keeping the benchmark rate unchanged so far this year.",
      "Adding to the complications is Mr. Trump's pressure on the Fed to reduce rates. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has responded by stressing the independence of the Federal Reserve, pointing out that the Federal Open Market Committee, its 12-member rate-setting group, relies on economic data to make its policy decisions, rather than political pressure.",
      "\"The committee tries to get a complete picture of the biggest downside risks for the economy, and then at the end of the meeting, there needs to be some sort of weighting \u2014 it's an art as much as science,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, an economics professor at Villanova University.",
      "When will the Fed announce its rate decision?",
      "The Fed will announce its next rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Sept. 17.",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point cut stands at 96%, according to CME FedWatch, which relies on 30-day Fed Funds futures prices to determine the likelihood. There's only a 4% probability of a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, the tracker says.",
      "Economists will also be listening for whether the Fed provides guidance on whether it expects additional rate cuts at its next two meetings in 2025, set for Oct. 29 and Dec. 10.",
      "What data will determine the Fed's decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep inflation low while also ensuring full employment.",
      "But those two goals can be in conflict with each other because rising inflation requires the Fed to boost interest rates, which tamps down spending by making it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow. The Fed's best weapon for fighting high unemployment, however, is to cut rates, as that makes it cheaper for businesses to expand and hire more workers.",
      "Fed officials will be closely scrutinizing inflation and jobs data as they determine which side of the dual mandate needs more attention.",
      "While the inflation rate has receded from its 2022 peak, it's still far above the Fed's goal for a 2% annual rate, and has inched up in recent months as the Trump administration's tariffs ripple through the economy, pushing some prices higher.",
      "Meanwhile, the labor market is showing signs of distress, with many sectors \u2014 including manufacturing, which Mr. Trump has vowed to revive \u2014 shedding jobs in August. The result is a marked slowdown in hiring, with employers adding an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus about 106,000 workers each month in 2024.",
      "\"It's going to be very difficult, but it will be weighing these two conflicting objectives,\" Kersting noted.",
      "How does the Fed compare with other central banks?",
      "Mr. Trump's has criticized the Fed's decision to hold off on cutting this year by pointing to decisions by other central banks, such as the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, to reduce their borrowing costs.",
      "\"Europe has had 10 cuts, we have had ZERO. No inflation, great economy \u2014 We should be at least two to three points lower,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media in June.",
      "Yet the U.S. is facing an issue that isn't as pressing for other nations: Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "Because the tariffs are import taxes paid by U.S. businesses directly to the federal government, the cost is largely borne by American companies and consumers \u2014 not other nations. The White House has said exporters abroad bear the brunt of tariffs, while Trump administration officials make the case that more balanced trade with U.S. economic partners over the longer term will create jobs, energize the manufacturing sector and generate federal revenue.",
      "Fed Chair Powell has pointed to the tariffs as a reason the Fed has wanted to keep its powder dry, given that many economists believe the import duties will reignite inflation in the U.S.",
      "The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a closed watched inflation gauge, rose at annual rate of 2.9% in August, the sharpest pickup since January. Heavily imported goods, such as coffee, audio equipment and household furniture, saw some of the steepest price hikes last month, CPI data shows.",
      "How are American consumers holding up?",
      "Many Americans are souring on the economy, feeling pressured by higher costs for everything from housing to groceries.",
      "A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that two-thirds of Americans said prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise, and about the same share said they expect that to continue. More than half of consumers said the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only about one-quarter said they believe it's improving.",
      "The CPI has steadily risen since April, when it fell to an annual rate of 2.3%, or just above the Fed's 2% target.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has pointed to mortgage rates that were close to 7% for much of 2025 as a reason for a faltering housing market.",
      "\"Could somebody please inform Jerome 'Too Late' Powell that he is hurting the Housing Industry, very badly? People can't get a Mortgage because of him. There is no Inflation, and every sign is pointing to a major Rate Cut,\" the president wrote\u00a0in an Aug.19 post on social media.",
      "But mortgage rates are determined by several factors beyond the Fed's benchmark rate, including the strength of the U.S. economy and the 10-year Treasury note. Already, rates have declined in recent weeks, dipping to 6.35% for the week of Sept. 11, in anticipation of the Fed's cut and weaker economic data.",
      "Even so, a rate cut could help some consumers by lowering their borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"A declining interest rate environment will provide some relief for borrowers,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"Whether it's a homeowner with a 7% mortgage or a recent graduate hoping to refinance student loans and credit card debt, lower rates can ease the burden on many indebted households by opening opportunities to refinance or consolidate.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 21:56:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed on Wednesday while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University.",
    "story": [
      "Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Wednesday as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate. Officials described it as a \"targeted attack,\" and it drew\u00a0condemnation from both sides of the political aisle as authorities launched a massive search for the suspect.",
      "On Friday, officials announced they have a person in custody for the fatal shooting. They identified him as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who resides in southern Utah. Robinson was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, according to an inmate booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff's Office.",
      "Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray is reviewing the evidence to determine the appropriate charges and plans to file them on Tuesday, Christopher Ballard, chief of staff for the Utah County Attorney's Office, confirmed to CBS News on Saturday. Robinson could make his first court appearance Tuesday afternoon, Ballard said.",
      "Kirk, who co-founded the right-wing advocacy group Turning Point USA, was 31. He is survived by his wife, Erika, and two young children.",
      "Turning Point USA announced Saturday that a public funeral for Kirk will be held on Sunday, Sept. 21, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.",
      "Here is what we know so far about the assassination and ongoing investigation.",
      "Who is the suspect?",
      "More details about Robinson and what happened before and after the attack are emerging.",
      "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Robinson is not a student at Utah Valley University, where the attack took place, and has been living with his family in Washington County, located in the southwestern corner of the state. Family members said Robinson had \"become more political\" in recent years, the governor said.",
      "Utah State University said Robinson briefly attended the school for one semester in 2021. According to the Utah System of Higher Education, Robinson was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St. George, Utah.",
      "Robinson's father owns a business installing kitchen countertops and cabinets and his mother is a licensed social worker, according to public records and their social media accounts. Robinson is the oldest of three brothers.",
      "\"They are very supportive parents who loved their boys and are involved in the community,\" a neighbor who said she knew the Robinson family well but had not seen Robinson in a few years told CBS News. She also said the parents were supportive of the country and of President Trump.",
      "State records show that Robinson registered to vote as unaffiliated. He is listed as an inactive voter in state records, meaning he didn't vote in the last two elections. He was not old enough to vote in 2020.",
      "Robinson had no prior felony or misdemeanor convictions and no prior violent offenses, according to a Public Safety Assessment Report filed in Utah state court.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said Robinson was taken into custody at 10 p.m. local time Thursday night, though Utah officials said it was in the early hours of Friday. Records from the Utah County Sheriff's Office Corrections Division show he was booked into jail at 7:58 a.m. local time (9:58 a.m. ET).",
      "Mr. Trump first broke the news on \"Fox and Friends\" that someone had been taken into custody.",
      "\"With a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody. Everyone did a great job,\" the president said.",
      "Cox said messages on Discord, an instant messaging and social media platform, that were reviewed by investigators referenced a rifle wrapped in a towel that was left in the woods and engravings on bullets. The messages came from a person named \"Tyler\" and were shared with an unidentified individual, Cox said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for Discord said it had removed an account associated with Robinson for violating the company's \"off-platform behavior policy,\" which prohibits users from engaging in various forms of violence, and will continue to coordinate closely with law enforcement. The spokesperson also said Discord \"found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence\" on the platform itself.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by this tragedy and extend our condolences to the Kirk family and everyone affected,\" Discord's statement said. \"The messages referenced in recent reporting about planning details do not appear to be Discord messages. These were communications between the suspect's roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.\"",
      "A Discord spokesperson also confirmed the company provided law enforcement with copies of chat messages in which the 22-year-old suspect appeared to confess to the killing to a group of friends.",
      "According to the spokesperson, an account appearing to belong to Robinson claimed responsibility for the shooting in a message to a group of online friends on Thursday night, about two hours before officials said Robinson was taken into custody.",
      "\"Hey guys, I have bad news for you all,\" read the message from the account allegedly belonging to Robinson. \"It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this,\" Robinson wrote, according to a Discord spokesperson and a law enforcement source.",
      "The spokesperson also confirmed additional messages from an account allegedly belonging to Robinson that suggested he planned to turn himself in to authorities, including one that read, \"im surrendering through a sheriff friend in a few moments, thanks for all the good times and laughs, you've all been so amazing, thank you all for everything.\"",
      "The Washington Post was first to report on the content of the messages.",
      "The governor said authorities believe Robinson acted alone and said there is currently no information that would lead to additional arrests. He told reporters Friday morning he can't answer questions about the possible motive of the suspect.",
      "Robinson is currently on \"special watch\" at the Utah County Jail while he is being evaluated to determine if he is a risk to himself or others, Utah County Sheriff's Spokesperson Sgt. Raymond Ormond told CBS News. The Utah County Sheriff said in a statement on Sunday that he had not been made aware of any suicide concerns or comments involving Robinson, but noted that the suspect would \"remain on a special watch status until cleared by mental health, which may take several days.\"",
      "Individuals are held in a special housing unit while on special watch.",
      "\"Tyler Robinson is being housed in our special housing unit so that we can keep a close eye on him,\" the sheriff's statement said. \"This is done for various reasons ranging from: the types of crimes you're booked on, behavioral issues, violent behavior, and/or suicidal comments made during the arrest.\"",
      "Ormond said everyone is given an initial screening after booking, but some are put on the more intensive special watch until they're screened.",
      "How the suspect was captured",
      "Cox said Robinson's father recognized his son as the subject of photos that were released by law enforcement and urged him to turn himself in.",
      "Robinson admitted to his father that he was the person in the photos, two federal law enforcement sources told CBS News. Robinson said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, the federal law enforcement sources said.",
      "Robinson's father called a youth pastor who knows the 22-year-old and is close to the family, and he and the pastor tried to calm Robinson down. The sources said the pastor, who also serves as a court security officer, called the U.S. Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies. Marshals  then detained Robinson and kept him secure while waiting for the FBI. The FBI later took him into custody.",
      "Investigators reviewed video footage and said they identified Robinson arriving on Utah Valley University's campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at around 8:29 a.m. local time Wednesday, the day of the shooting, according to the governor. Robinson was wearing a plain maroon T-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo and light-colored shoes, Cox said.",
      "He is believed to have changed clothing on the roof, where the shot was fired from, before changing back into what he was originally wearing. When investigators encountered Robinson, he was wearing clothing consistent with that outfit, the governor said.",
      "Tracking the suspect",
      "On Thursday, Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason described the suspect they were seeking as a male who \"blended in\" with the college community and appeared to be college age.",
      "The public safety department and the Salt Lake City FBI office posted images of someone they called a \"person of interest,\" showing an individual appearing to wear a dark long-sleeve shirt, a hat and sunglasses. More photos posted later on Thursday showed the person wearing a backpack.",
      "Mason said investigators were able to track the shooter's movements before and after the assassination.",
      "According to a probable cause statement filed by investigators after Robinson's arrest, investigators were able to track his movements on campus starting at approximately 11:50 a.m. local time on Wednesday. He was observed entering a building called the Losee Center near where Kirk's event was taking place, which was the shooting location, and going up to the roof, according to the statement.",
      "Mason said the shooter moved to the other side of the building after firing a single shot, then jumped off and fled into a neighborhood off campus. Investigators contacted homeowners with cameras and witnesses to identify leads, he said.",
      "In a news briefing Thursday evening in Orem, Utah, with Patel in attendance, officials released security video that showed a man \u2014 who Mason called a suspect \u2014 running across the roof and then climbing down the side of the building immediately after the shooting.",
      "As he climbed off the edge of the building and dropped down, he \"left some palm impressions, some smudges, some places we're looking to collect DNA,\" along with a shoe print that indicated he was wearing Converse tennis shoes, Mason told reporters while showing the video.",
      "\"It's important to note his black t-shirt, his black pants, and there appears to be some white on the soles of those Converse tennis shoes,\" Mason said. \"Those are all identifiable items that we're looking for.\"",
      "After dropping off the building, the video showed the man moving across a grassy area before entering traffic. Mason said he crossed the street into a wooded area, where the firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was later found.",
      "The FBI said it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads law enforcement to identify and arrest the person or people involved in Kirk's assassination. Patel said authorities had received more than 11,000 leads as of Friday morning.",
      "Gun and bullet casings recovered",
      "FBI special-agent-in-charge Robert Bohls said Thursday that investigators recovered a \"high-powered, bolt-action rifle,\" which they believe was the weapon used in the assassination. It was found in a wooded area where the shooter fled and was wrapped in a towel, according to Bohls. The rifle was determined to be a Mauser .30-06-caliber bolt-action rifle, according to the probable cause statement.",
      "Patel suggested on Monday that investigators found DNA linking Robinson to the scene of the shooting on some of the items they recovered, including a screwdriver and a towel.",
      "\"The DNA hits from the towel that was wrapped around the firearm, and the DNA on the screwdriver, are positively processed for the suspect in custody,\"\u00a0Patel said on \"Fox & Friends.\"",
      "Cox said that there were inscriptions on the casings of the bullet that was fired, as well as on the casings of three bullets that were not fired.",
      "According to the probable cause statement, the fired bullet casing contained the inscription, \"Notices Buldge OWO what's this?\" An unfired bullet casing read, \"hey fascist! CATCH!\" followed by an up arrow symbol, a right arrow symbol and three down arrow symbols. And a second unfired casing read, \"O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!\" A third unfired casing said, \"If you read This, you are GAY Lmao.\"",
      "Cox didn't speculate on the meaning of the inscriptions.",
      "Investigators also have a footwear impression, palm print and forearm imprints that will be analyzed, the FBI official said.",
      "Timeline of \"targeted attack\"",
      "The event where Kirk was speaking was scheduled to begin in the UVU courtyard at noon.",
      "A CBS News review of livestream footage and video metadata indicates Kirk was shot around 12:23 p.m., which is also when the FBI's Patel said Kirk was shot. He was struck in the neck by a single gunshot.",
      "A map produced by CBS News' Confirmed team shows where Kirk was when he was shot \u2014 in the central courtyard of Utah Valley University, which is surrounded by campus buildings.",
      "A university spokeswoman said Wednesday that they believed the shot was fired from the Losee Center. A law enforcement source told CBS News that the gunman appeared to have fired from the building's roof.",
      "The FBI released a video\u00a0\u2014 timestamped at 12:23 p.m. local time \u2014 that appears to show a person climbing off a roof at Utah Valley University and fleeing the scene. Dispatch audio reviewed by CBS News described a person on the roof of a nearby building wearing black clothing and carrying a long rifle.",
      "Video captured at 2:37 p.m. shows officers searching an area around a quarter mile north of the campus.",
      "At 2:40, more than two hours after the shooting, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that Kirk had died.",
      "While authorities have not specified a potential motive for the shooting, Mason said they believe it was a \"targeted attack toward one individual.\" Only one shot was fired, and Kirk was the only victim, the commissioner said.",
      "Cox called the shooting \"a political assassination,\" while Mr. Trump, in a video posted to Truth Social, blamed it on \"radical left political violence,\" which he said \"has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.\"",
      "Charlie Kirk's influence in politics",
      "Kirk was shot while he was speaking at a \"Prove Me Wrong\" debate, a trademark event for Kirk's Turning Point USA, which is a conservative organization focused on young people. He would hold political debates with a group that usually consisted of left-leaning attendees.",
      "Kirk had visited the Utah university as part of a nationwide tour of college campuses that was scheduled to continue for the next two months. About 3,000 people attended the outdoor event where he was assassinated, the Utah Department of Public Safety said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump called Kirk legendary, saying, \"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.\"",
      "Kirk was a close Trump ally and was credited with galvanizing younger voters during his campaign. He made it his mission to engage more young people in politics and register them to vote. Kirk was also a close friend of the president's son, Donald Trump Jr.",
      "Kirk was the host of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" a daily conservative talk radio show and amassed millions of followers on social media.",
      "Kirk's politics, however, weren't without controversy. He pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",
      "He was a friend of JD Vance, who said Kirk advocated \"in public and private\" for Mr. Trump to pick him as his running mate last year.",
      "\"So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,\" Vance said after Kirk was killed. \"He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.\"",

    "summary": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit declined to grant the Trump administration emergency relief and clear the way for Mr. Trump to remove Cook from her position.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Monday rejected a bid from President Trump's administration to allow the president to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, leaving intact a lower court order that reinstated her to the post.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit divided 2-1 in declining to grant the Trump administration emergency relief and clear the way for Mr. Trump to remove Cook from her position. The Trump administration is likely to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. But absent an 11th-hour order from the high court, the decision all but ensures Cook will remain a governor on the seven-member Fed board through a two-day meeting of its interest rate-setting committee, which Cook sits on and is set to begin Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to oust Cook from the Fed's Board of Governors last month over allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook denies any wrongdoing.",
      "Judge Bradley Garcia wrote in a concurring opinion joined by Judge Michelle Childs that Cook is likely to succeed in arguing that Mr. Trump's attempt to remove her violated her due process rights. Judge Gregory Katsas dissented.",
      "\"Given that Cook has a property interest in her position, she is entitled to 'some kind' of process before removal,\" Garcia wrote. \"Before this court, the government does not dispute that it provided Cook no meaningful notice or opportunity to respond to the allegations against her. The government argues only that Cook 'does not explain what difference a hearing would have made.' Even accepting that premise, Cook's entitlement to process stands apart from whether she would succeed in securing a different outcome.\"",
      "Garcia added that since Cook has continued to serve in her role despite her purported termination by Mr. Trump, granting the administration's request for emergency relief would \"upend\" the status quo.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said the agency \"does not comment on current or prospective litigation including matters that may be an investigation.\"",
      "The Trump administration asked the D.C. Circuit for emergency relief after U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that Cook's firing likely violated the Federal Reserve Act and her due process rights.",
      "The Federal Reserve Act specifies that the president can only remove a Fed governor \"for cause.\" While the term is not defined in the law, Cobb found \"for cause\" refers to in-office conduct. Because Cook's alleged misrepresentations on mortgage documents predate her tenure as a Fed governor, Cobb ruled that Mr. Trump lacked \"cause\" to remove Cook.",
      "The judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Fed to allow Cook to remain a member of its Board of Governors during the litigation.",
      "\"President Trump's stated cause refers only to allegations regarding Cook's conduct before she began serving on the Federal Reserve Board,\" the judge wrote in her decision, adding that \"such allegations are not a legally permissible cause.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized the Fed for moving too slowly in cutting interest rates, though economists expect the central bank will announce a rate cut this week. If Cook's firing is ultimately allowed \u2014 a decision that will likely be made by the Supreme Court \u2014 and the president appoints a successor, it would mean he will have appointed the majority of the seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Mr. Trump announced on social media last month that he was firing Cook, appointed by former President Joe Biden, from the Fed Board of Governors and had \"sufficient cause\" to oust her. Cook's 14-year-term on the Fed is set to end in January 2038.",
      "The president cited as grounds for her removal claims made by Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that Cook made false statements on mortgage documents.",
      "Pulte alleged in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that Cook claimed two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence on mortgage documents from 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Pulte, who was appointed to lead the FHFA by Mr. Trump, has continued to make accusations against Cook related to mortgage documents.",
      "Cook has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Her lawyers said in court papers that she may have \"erred\" in filling out a form for a private mortgage, but said the events took place before she assumed office as a Fed governor and in her capacity as a private citizen.",
      "\"Governor Cook did not ever commit mortgage fraud,\" they wrote.",
      "Reuters reported Friday that a loan estimate for the property in Atlanta, dated May 28, 2021, showed that Cook declared that residence as a \"vacation home.\"",
      "Cook filed a lawsuit challenging Mr. Trump's effort to fire her, alleging that the move violated the Federal Reserve Act.",
      "While the law does not define \"cause,\" Cook's lawyers argued \"cause\" constitutes what is set out in other laws shielding officials at independent agencies from being fired at-will: instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "They said Mr. Trump relied on \"thinly-veiled pretext\" in an effort to oust Cook because she has not supported lowering the benchmark interest rate.",
      "\"[T]hose unsubstantiated allegations cannot camouflage the President's real reason for attempting to remove Governor Cook: he disagrees with her policy decisions,\" Cook's legal team wrote.",
      "The Fed said it is not taking a position on whether Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook is lawful and said it will follow any court orders.",
      "In defending Mr. Trump's move, Justice Department lawyers have said that Congress gave the president broad discretion to remove a Fed governor for \"cause\" through the Federal Reserve Act and argued that making \"contradictory statements\" on financial filings is sufficient ground for removing her.",
      "\"When Governors by misconduct or gross neglect erode the foundations of such confidence, the President acts properly and lawfully by removing them,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "They argued that the president's power of for-cause removal is discretionary, and the exercise of that authority is unreviewable by the courts. Justice Department lawyers also rejected the district court's conclusion that the public interest in the Fed's independence weighed in favor of Cook's reinstatement to her role on the Board of Governors.",
      "\"Even with the Federal Reserve's unique structure and history, its Governors are subject to removal for cause, and the President's actions to remove Cook based on her misconduct should strengthen, not diminish, the Federal Reserve's integrity,\" they wrote.",
      "Cook is one of several Democratic appointees at independent agencies who have been fired by Mr. Trump since he returned to the White House in January.\u00a0 But her removal is unprecedented, as no president has fired a member of the Fed board in the central bank's 112-year-history.",
      "Critics of the move have warned that Mr. Trump's attempt to terminate Cook threatens the independence of the Fed and, if allowed, the stability of markets and the U.S. economy.",
      "Among the other officials Mr. Trump has fired are members of the Federal Trade Commission, Merit Systems Protection Board, National Labor Relations Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission, who have all sued to challenge their firings.",
      "The Supreme Court has allowed the president to oust members of the NLRB, MSPB and CPSC while their cases move forward, but it has drawn a line around the Fed. In a May decision, the high court said the central bank is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed a presidential memorandum Monday mobilizing federal law enforcement agents to Memphis, Tennessee, as a part of a task force that will include the Tennessee National Guard, the latest planned Guard deployment in his effort to combat crime in U.S. cities.",
      "\"The effort will include the National Guard as well as the FBI, ATF, DEA, ICE, Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S, Marshals,\" the president said Monday, adding that the task force will be a \"replica\" of the efforts in Washington, D.C.",
      "Mr. Trump said he went ahead with the memo \"at the request\" of Tennessee's Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who was in the Oval Office for the signing. Specifically, the memo directs the defense secretary to ask the governor to make the Tennessee National Guard available to help federal law enforcement.",
      "\"They're a volunteer state,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday. \"We're not going to have any problems with the Tennessee National Guard.\"",
      "The move makes Memphis the third city to see National Guard troops on its streets under Mr. Trump's presidency, following deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., earlier this year.",
      "\"We're going to be doing Chicago probably next,\" the president said Monday, adding that \"we're going to wait a little while\" before going into the country's third-largest city.",
      "The president said St. Louis may also be a city that will see a federal law enforcement presence.",
      "\"We have to save St. Louis. We have to save Chicago,\" he said in the Oval Office on Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump has said authorities will \"straighten out\" Memphis, which has one of the nation's highest violent crime rates. The president said a person is four times more likely to be killed in Memphis than Mexico City.",
      "On Sunday, the president wrote on Truth Social that federal law enforcement has been on the ground in Memphis for the last five months, but \"the real work by us has barely begun.\"",
      "\"The only reason crime is somewhat down in Memphis is because the FBI, and others in the Federal Government, at my direction, have been working there for 5 months - on the absolutely terrible Crime numbers,\" he wrote. \"Likewise, in Chicago and Los Angeles! But the real work by us has barely begun. That happens after we make the official announcement that WE'RE COMING, and when we do that, as we did in now VERY SAFE WASHINGTON, D.C., the no crime 'miracle' begins. ONLY I CAN SAVE THEM!!!\"",
      "While some governors have shunned the idea of the National Guard posting up in their cities, Lee has been open to the idea of the National Guard deploying in his state. Lee said he's been in \"constant communication\" with the Trump administration for months on an anti-crime plan, and the \"next phase will include a comprehensive mission with the Tennessee National Guard, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tennessee Highway Patrol, Memphis Police Department, and other law enforcement agencies.\"",
      "Democratic Memphis Mayor Paul Young said in a press conference that he didn't ask for the National Guard to come, but he'll work with them to \"strategize on how they engage in this community.\"",
      "The president's decision to send more than 2,000 National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area this spring prompted an ongoing legal fight. A federal judge ruled earlier this month that the deployment violated a federal law that prohibits the use of the military for law enforcement actions on U.S. soil.",
      "In Washington, hundreds of National Guard troops have been patrolling streets and cleaning up the city in \"beautification\" efforts since Mr. Trump ordered their deployment over the summer. The troops are not engaged in law enforcement functions, but their presence coincided with the president federalizing the local police force and surging federal agents into the capital to crack down on crime.",
      "The president has floated other cities that could be the next target of his campaign against urban crime, including Chicago, New York and San Francisco. But he has also said he wants governors and residents of cities to support the presence of troops and law enforcement.",
      "Illinois officials have made it clear they don't want the National Guard there.",
      "\"We don't need or want you here, Donald,\" said Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson recently wrote in the New York Times that \"[s]ending in the National Guard is the wrong solution to a real problem.\"",

Steve Scalise of Louisiana and the December killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO.",

    "story": [
      "Toward the end of his remarks about the killing of Charlie Kirk last Friday, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox warned about the ills of America's increasingly vitriolic online culture.",
      "\"Social media is a cancer on our society right now,\" he said, imploring citizens to \"log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member and go out and do good in your community.\" Standing next to him was a stony-faced FBI Director Kash Patel, a heavy social media user who posts far more frequently than his predecessors in the job, Christopher Wray and James Comey.",
      "The juxtaposition did not go unnoticed by bureau veterans.",
      "\"You can be a social media influencer, or you can be FBI director,\" one recently retired special agent told CBS News. \"But you can't be both.\"",
      "But Patel is both, upending the agency's cautious communication culture with a steady flow of online observations and updates.",
      "That clash in cultures has never been more clear than it was last week, when the FBI chief faced intense scrutiny for his handling of the high-profile case. Repeatedly, he turned to social media to tout major developments in the case \u2014 in some cases prematurely. Hours after the shooting, he posted to his nearly 2 million followers on X at 6:21 p.m. ET, \"The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody.\" Then, less than two hours later, at 7:59 p.m., he had to backtrack, posting, \"The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement.\" Patel sought to address the quick \u2014 and misleading \u2014 initial post during a Fox News interview Monday.",
      "\"I was being transparent with working with the public on our findings, as I had them,\" he said on \"Fox and Friends.\"",
      "\"I stated in that message that we had a subject and that we were going to interview him, and we did and he was released,\" Patel told Fox News. \"Could I have worded it a little better in the heat of the moment? Sure. But do I regret putting it out? Absolutely not.\"",
      "Asked for comment, the FBI referred CBS News to Patel's interview on Fox News.",
      "FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino also defended Patel's and his own efforts to publish FBI developments as soon as something new to share.",
      "\"We are clinging to transparency,\" Bongino said on Fox News' \"America's Newsroom\" Monday. \"The era of Cronkite and Jennings generation is over. New media now is media and we want to be sure we can do everything in our power to share what we can when we can while still balancing the needs of the investigation.\"",
      "Dribbling out information in real time about a highly complex, sensitive and fast-moving investigation is a startling departure from past FBI directors, whose public messaging traditionally has been spare and buttoned-up.",
      "J. Edgar Hoover's vaunted publicity machine occupied a whole wing of the bureau dedicated to writing articles, issuing press releases, tending to Hollywood directors and TV producers \u2014 all in an effort to buff the reputation of the FBI and its legendary G-man. But according to Yale historian Beverly Gage, Hoover was particularly cautious about publicizing active investigations.",
      "\"Hoover himself was contained and buttoned-down,\" said Gage, author of the Pulitzer Prize winning biography \"G-Man: J. Edgar Hoover and the Making of the American Century.\" \"He did everything through elaborate bureaucratic procedure, so it's very hard to imagine him being unfiltered enough to be on social media in quite this way.\"",
      "Patel is a departure from previous FBI directors. He eschews the standard-issue uniform of past FBI chiefs \u2014 conservative suits and spit-polished shoes \u2014 in favor of bold ties and European-cut suits. A close friend says he sees himself as a \"disruptor\" intent on radically changing enforcement priorities \u2014 \"let cops be cops\" is one of his favorite slogans \u2014 while shaking up the bureau's staid culture.",
      "A former colleague who worked with Patel during the first Trump term says he has a \"bias for action,\" which may explain his exuberance on social media. \"He wants to get s*** done,\" this source said.",
      "Those harboring a less charitable view argue that Patel is an attention seeker who thrives on the spotlight. One former FBI agent pointed to an earlier episode that he said echoes Patel's rush to post details of the Kirk investigation on social media.",
      "During his confirmation hearing to be FBI director, a whistleblower told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee that when Patel was working for the National Security Council in 2020, he violated government protocols by leaking to a newspaper the details of a hostage deal involving American citizens being held in Yemen. FBI officials were furious at the time, accusing Patel of jeopardizing the lives of the hostages so he could claim credit with the media. At the time, the White House and a source close to Patel denied the allegation.",
      "Last week, Patel's social media activity renewed similar concerns.",
      "\"In a sensitive investigation you don't want to tip your hand to things the public doesn't already know so that active evidence that is vital to the court process not get or disclosed unnecessarily to hinder the investigation,\" said Stephen Laycock, a former executive assistant director at the FBI who retired in 2021.",
      "Or as a former special agent said, \"Being the first to get 'likes' or clicks is not beneficial to the investigative process.\"",
      "The eventual arrest of a suspect in the Kirk shooting has staunched some of the initial chatter about Patel's comments. Still, on Tuesday he is expected to face a grilling from the Senate Judiciary Committee. A Senate source told CBS News that Democrats are preparing to go on the attack. And they believe they'll have plenty to work with.",
      "Even before Kirk's killing, the FBI was reeling from an unprecedented purge of some of the most experienced FBI executives and line agents, depleting the agency of decades of experience, critics say. Mehtab Syed, the highly regarded head of the FBI's Salt Lake City field office, was among the agents forced out at the end of July. Robert Bohls, the new head of the office that was on the front lines of the shooting investigation, started his job on Sept. 2, days before the Kirk shooting, a source familiar with the Salt Lake City FBI office confirmed.",
      "Three elite former agents filed a lawsuit last week accusing Patel of summarily firing them at the direction of the White House. The lawsuit highlighted Patel's focus on social media, arguing the agents' dismissals came in response to criticism on social media from right-wing influencers. At the same time, according to the complaint, Patel has urged FBI field agents to be more active on social media to tout \"FBI wins.\"",
      "One of the fired agents, former Washington field office Assistant Director Steven Jensen, expressed concern about Bongino's \"intense focus on increasing online engagement.\" Jensen alleged that the \"emphasis Bongino was placing on creating content for his social media feed could risk outweighing more deliberate analyses of investigations.\"",
      "It's a concern that has been circulating quietly among longtime bureau veterans.",
      "\"You aren't doing your job or leading an organization for the social media glory,\" said Laycock.",
      "Some officials who have interacted in person with Patel, say the director is misunderstood. As one law enforcement official described it to CBS News, Patel's brash online personality stands in contrast to a low-key, friendly demeanor that he exhibits in meetings.",
      "\"He's highly personable and even earnest,\" one law enforcement official said of his multiple meetings with Patel.",
      "Perhaps the most important person evaluating the director's performance over the past week, however, appeared to approve of it. President Trump made clear he is backing his FBI director.",

      "Vance announced Sunday in a post on X that he had the \"honor of hosting the Charlie Kirk Show\" to \"pay tribute to my friend.\" Speaking from his office in the White House complex Monday, Vance said he was \"filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for\" as he kicked off the show.",
      "\"But I'm going to try to do my best,\" Vance said.",
      "Kirk, a conservative activist, was assassinated last week during a Utah Valley University event hosted by his organization, Turning Point USA, in Orem, Utah. The 31-year-old was close to Vance, along with President Trump and his family.",
      "After his death, Kirk's body was flown on the vice president's plane, Air Force Two, to Kirk's home state of Arizona. Vance canceled a planned trip to New York to mark 24 years since the Sept. 11, 2001, attack to fly to Utah to retrieve Kirk's body. Vance said Monday that he was honored to be able to \"take Charlie's remains from Utah to Arizona.\"",
      "Vance has described his longtime friendship with Kirk, who was also a key ally in his political rise. Vance said in a post on X after Kirk's death that the slain conservative activist was one of the first people he called when he considered running for Senate in 2021, and he said Kirk advocated for him to become the vice-presidential nominee \"both in public and private.\"",
      "The vice president described Kirk as a \"true friend.\" On Monday, Vance called Kirk \"the smartest political operative I ever met,\" saying \"I owe so much to Charlie.\"",
      "Kirk's youth turnout operation has also been credited with helping Mr. Trump's 2024 election bid, while Kirk himself was known to have influenced some of the Trump administration's personnel decisions. Vance said much of \"the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene,\" adding that Kirk \"didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.\"",
      "The president announced last week that he would\u00a0award Kirk\u00a0the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously.",
      "Andrew Kolvet, the executive producer of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" said on CNN Monday that Vance's hosting of the show \"came about because he asked if he could do it.\"",
      "\"Charlie and JD were friends. They were actual friends,\" Kolvet said, adding that \"a lot of the people that are running the federal government are personal friends of Charlie's and they were in the trenches together, the campaign, and they've known each other for years.\"",
      "During the show Monday, Vance urged that \"we have to make sure that the killer is brought to justice,\" previewing discussions of what he called the \"incredibly destructive movement of left-wing extremism that has grown up over the last few years, and I believe, is part of the reason why Charlie was killed by an assassin's bullet.\"",
      "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who was among the guests on the show, echoed the sentiment, saying \"we are going to channel all of the anger that we have over the organized campaign that led to this assassination, to uproot and dismantle these terrorist networks.\"",
      "\"We are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people, it will happen, and we will do it in Charlie's name,\" Miller pledged.",
      "Vance said he has heard \"many calls in the last few days for unity, and for healing\" in the wake of Kirk's assassination, saying \"you have no idea how desperately I want that.\" But he added that \"first, we must tell the truth.\"",
      "\"I really do believe that we can come together in this country, I believe, we must,\" Vance said. \"But unity, real unity can be found only after climbing the mountain of truth.\"",
      "The vice president claimed people on the left are more likely to celebrate and defend political violence, saying \"this is not a both sides problem.\"",
      "\"If both sides have a problem, one side has a much bigger and malignant problem, and that is the truth we must be told,\" he added.",
      "Also among the guests was White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.",
      "Vance said \"it's up to all of us\" to \"keep on the legacy of Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "\"We've got to carry on the mantle, we've got to carry on the torch,\" the vice president said. \"That's why I'm doing this show today is I just wanted to, you know, send a signal that we're not going to let Charlie's mantle be discarded. We're going to keep on carrying it.\"",
      "Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, said in her first public remarks since his death that \"the movement my husband built will not die,\" noting that \"the radio and podcast show that he was so proud of will go on.\"",
      "\"If you thought that my husband's mission was powerful before, you have no idea,\" she said.",

      "Washington \u2014 U.S. and Chinese negotiators have agreed to the outlines of a deal to resolve the dispute over ownership of TikTok, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday, adding that President Trump is set to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping later this week.",
      "\"We have a framework for a TikTok deal,\" Bessent said after talks with Chinese officials in Spain. \"The two leaders, President Trump and Party Chair Xi, will speak on Friday to complete the deal. But we do have a framework for a deal with TikTok.\"",
      "Bessent said the agreement is \"between two private parties\" and that \"the commercial terms have been agreed upon.\" He said the talks in Spain centered around the future of the app.",
      "Mr. Trump hinted at the agreement in a post on Truth Social earlier Monday morning.",
      "\"The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China,  has gone VERY WELL! It will be concluding shortly,\" the president wrote. \"A deal was also reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!!\"",
      "Later Monday, Mr. Trump was asked by reporters whether China would have a stake in the company.",
      "\"We haven't decided that,\" he said.",
      "A spokesperson to Vice President JD Vance said the deal means hundreds of millions of Americans will be able to continue using the app.",
      "\"President Trump and Vice President Vance provided the leadership and foresight necessary to produce a framework deal that fulfills another campaign promise and saves TikTok,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In a briefing after Monday's trade talks, a Chinese official said China \"will firmly safeguard the national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, and carry out technology export approval in accordance with relevant laws and regulations,\" according to Xinhua, China's state-run news agency.",
      "The outlet said Chinese trade representative Li Chenggang conveyed that \"China has always opposed politicization, instrumentalization and weaponization of technology and economic-trade matters and will never seek to reach any agreement at the expense of principles, interests of companies, or international fairness and justice.\"",
      "Last year, Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed a bill that essentially gave TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, an ultimatum: either divest from TikTok or face a ban in the United States. The Supreme Court upheld the law in a unanimous 9-0 decision. But Mr. Trump has issued a series of orders unilaterally delaying its enforcement. The latest came in June, when he pushed back the deadline for enforcing the measure until Sept. 17.",
      "The president's orders have directed the Justice Department\u00a0not to take action or impose penalties against tech companies like Apple and Google for failing to comply with the law by allowing TikTok on their platforms.",
      "Mr. Trump's extensions have come as the U.S. tries to negotiate an agreement that would separate the hugely popular video-sharing app from ByteDance. The Trump administration appeared close to a deal in the spring, which would have spun TikTok's U.S.-based operations into a new company owned and operated by a majority of American investors, and allowed ByteDance to maintain a minority stake. But Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports scuttled the proposed deal.",
      "ByteDance, however, refuted then that an agreement had been reached because there were still key issues unresolved. TikTok's parent company said any deal regarding the app's future would be subject to approval by the Chinese government.",
      "Under the law, passed with bipartisan support by Congress in April 2024, TikTok had until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "While TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down ahead of the January deadline, it reinstated access to users in the U.S. after Mr. Trump vowed his administration would not enforce the ban.",
      "While Congress has for years warned that TikTok raises national security concerns and allows China to collect sweeping amounts of data on Americans, the president has repeatedly expressed his affinity for TikTok because of its popularity with young people.",

    "story": [
      "Once again, an endangered orca in Washington state has been seen carrying her dead newborn calf in what appears to be an effort to revive it.",
      "Researchers with the Center for Whale Research, Sea Doc Society and San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance said they received reports on Friday that the whale \u2014 identified as J36 \u2014 was pushing the dead calf in Rosario Strait, part of the Salish Sea in the San Juan Islands. They were able to confirm that the female calf, which still had its umbilical cord attached, was deceased.",
      "\"Based on the size of the calf, we estimate that the calf was either full term or near full term,\" the Center for Whale Research said in a social media post. \"We will share more when we can, and work with the other research teams to piece together what information we can about this calf and J36's status.\"",
      "After conducting initial documentation and measurement, researchers said it wasn't clear if J36's calf had been born alive. Based on prior observations of the whale, the calf would have been no more than three days old when it was spotted dead on Friday.",
      "Calf mortality is always high among orcas, but the endangered population of killer whales that frequent the marine waters between Washington state and Canada has especially struggled in recent decades due to\u00a0a lack of their preferred prey, Chinook salmon, as well as pollution and vessel noise that interferes with their hunting. There are 73 whales remaining in the so-called Southern Resident population.",
      "Early this year, another Southern Resident orca \u2014 known as Tahlequah, or J35 \u2014 was observed carrying the body of a deceased newborn. Tahlequah\u00a0gave birth\u00a0to another calf in 2020. Experts at the time described it as big news, because up to 70% of orca pregnancies end with either a miscarriage or a calf that dies shortly after birth. Tahlequah made global headlines in 2018 for carrying a dead calf for more than 1,000 miles over 17 days.",
      "It's not known why some orcas like Tahlequah and J36 carry their dead young, but we do know that killer whales \"are wired for all of the complicated emotions that come alongside close-knit group living,\" Monika Wieland Shields, the director of Orca Behavior Institute, wrote in a blog post in January.",

    "summary": "New poll on New York mayor's race finds Trump is a factor. Voters say next mayor should oppose sending National Guard to New York City.",
    "story": [
      "New York City is overwhelmingly described by its voters as unaffordable, and voters' desire for a mayor they believe can bring change outpaces their desire for one with experience.",
      "Against that backdrop, Zohran Mamdani leads, and by an especially wide gap among those whose top issue is the cost of living.",
      "In this nationally watched contest, President Trump also looms as a factor, with many voters \u2014 Mamdani's in particular \u2014wanting a mayor who would oppose Donald Trump, rather than work with him.",
      "Unlike their views on the city's affordability, voters are relatively more mixed in their assessments of crime. Many feel it's either held the same or decreased in recent years.",
      "For those who do say crime has increased, the contest is more competitive for former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and he fares far better than Mamdani among the group that ranks crime as its top issue.",
      "(More think the subway, in general, has gotten worse rather than gotten better.)",
      "But right now, economics outweighs other factors.",
      "In either case, Mayor Eric Adams trails and is well back in the field, as so many New York voters describe things in the city going badly and give him negative job approval ratings.",
      "In terms of approach, the bulk of New York voters want the next mayor to focus on policies that make things easier for both businesses and the middle and working classes to be in the city. To most, that isn't mutually exclusive.",
      "But they especially want things to be easier for the middle and working classes.",
      "The candidates",
      "Mamdani does well with voters who say they want a candidate who will \"fight for people like them\" and \"bring needed change\" \u2014 reflecting that overall negative view about affordability and the city's direction \u2014 and with those prioritizing a candidate who is honest and trustworthy.",
      "Cuomo has an edge with voters who say \"the right experience\" is very important, perhaps reflecting his having served as governor, but that desire for experience is much lower than for bringing change.",
      "And Cuomo still trails Mamdani among those who want someone to \"get things done,\" though not by as large a gap.",
      "Cuomo is the top second choice among Adams voters. But with Adams' support in single digits, Mamdani's current lead in the contest does not narrow much if voters backing Adams were reallocated to their second choices.",
      "The Trump factor",
      "In a contest that has drawn national attention, Mr. Trump is also a factor here for some voters.",
      "By a factor of almost 2 to 1, New York voters would prefer the next mayor to generally oppose Mr. Trump than to work with him.",
      "That accrues to Mamdani's benefit, as he draws two-thirds of those voters who want someone who would oppose Mr. Trump.",
      "There are differences on this approach among candidates' backers too.",
      "Mamdani's current backers overwhelmingly want a candidate who opposes Mr. Trump, but Cuomo's backers are more mixed between opposing and being neutral toward Mr. Trump.",
      "Six in 10 voters would want the next mayor to oppose having National Guard troops in the city if Mr. Trump decided to send them.",
      "And related to this, if voters felt Mr. Trump were supporting a mayoral candidate, that would be a net negative for that candidate. It would make more voters less likely to pick that candidate than back them.",
      "Approach to crime",
      "Voters divide over the best policy to reduce crime if asked to pick between tougher sentences for criminals or more social programs and community outreach.",
      "Those who favor tougher sentences are voting for Cuomo or Republican mayoral nominee Curtis Sliwa, while those favoring more social programs and community outreach overwhelmingly favor Mamdani.",
      "Demographics of who is backing whom",
      "Mamdani leads with younger voters and those with college degrees, drawing outright majorities among these groups. The race is much tighter among older voters and those without college degrees, with Cuomo's support roughly matching Mamdani's among those groups.",
      "Newer residents \u2014 those who have moved to the city within the last 10 years \u2014 and renters are likelier to pick Mamdani than people who've lived in New York for longer and who are home owners.",
      "Mamdani's backing expands to an outright majority among voters who report using social media a lot to follow the race, a disproportionately young group backing him by 36 points over Cuomo.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a representative sample of 1,903 registered voters in New York City interviewed between September 7-13, 2025: 1,338 were recruited from the voter file via SMS messages, with 565 from YouGov's panel.

When people filed their claims in 2023, they were asked at the time how they preferred to receive the funds, such as by a payment app, pre-paid Mastercard or direct deposit to their bank accounts.",

      "How much will I get?",
      "A Sept. 5 court filing discloses that the average payment amount is approximately $29.43, with the maximum payout rising to $38.36.",
      "Facebook users are receiving a portion of the $725 million after administrative costs and lawyers' fees are paid out.",
      "The payments are based on how many people filed claims, as well as how long each claimant was using Facebook during the 15-year period covered by the settlement.",
      "Each claimant receives one \"allocation point\" for each month they had an \"activated\" Facebook account between May 24, 2007, and December 22, 2022. The settlement administrator adds up all the points assigned to all eligible claimants and then divides the net settlement amount by that number.",
      "Because the payments are based on the number of points assigned to each claimant, people who were on Facebook for shorter periods of time are likely to receive a lower settlement amount. The maximum payment of $38.36 would be given to people who were on Facebook for the entire 15-year period covered by the settlement, the Sept. 5 document notes.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 More than 300 lawsuits challenging many of President Trump's second-term plans and his administration's actions have been winding through the federal courts over the past few months. But a handful now may be poised for review by the Supreme Court, or are getting close to it.",
      "The cases involve major policies enacted by Mr. Trump in the months since he returned to the White House, and several of them have already been before the high court, though during earlier stages in the proceedings.",
      "In those instances, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to grant it emergency relief, allowing it to enforce its immigration policies, in some instances, or terminate officials at independent agencies, in others.",
      "In the wake of those interim decisions, lower courts have continued to hold proceedings and issue rulings addressing the merits of the Trump administration's actions. If the Supreme Court agrees to step into these disputes, they will present the initial opportunities for the justices to address the legality of Mr. Trump's plans.",
      "\"I'm expecting this to be the term of Trump,\" Dan Epps, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said of the new Supreme Court term set to begin Oct. 6.",
      "The justices are already set to hear blockbuster cases on redistricting, campaign finance and state laws barring transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "Many of the disputes involving Mr. Trump's actions test the limits of the president's power, and rulings could have massive implications for his policies on the economy and immigration, as well as his reshaping of the executive branch.",
      "The Trump administration has sought emergency intervention from the Supreme Court roughly two dozen times so far, and it has fared well in its bids to continue enforcing its plans while legal challenges continue.",
      "But whether the president will prevail when the Supreme Court examines the lawfulness of his actions remains to be seen. Still, in some instances \u2014 like his efforts to fire certain executive officers \u2014 the Supreme Court has signaled that Mr. Trump may have the power to terminate members of certain independent agencies.",
      "\"What's at stake is the country's commitment to the rule of law,\" Epps said. He added that the new term could also bring a \"huge sweeping victory\" for executive power, particularly if the Supreme Court finds that courts should give broad deference to the president on matters like immigration.",
      "Tariffs",
      "The dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed on nearly every U.S. trading partner will be the first in which the Supreme Court will decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's key policies.",
      "The high court said Tuesday that it is taking up two cases involving the global tariffs, which question whether Mr. Trump has the power to impose the sweeping duties under a federal emergency powers law. The justices will hear arguments in early November, a rapid timeline for the court.",
      "The Justice Department had asked the Supreme Court to step into the legal battle after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled late last month that many of Mr. Trump's tariffs issued under the emergency powers law are illegal.",
      "The Federal Circuit divided 7-4 in finding that the law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, did not authorize the president's global tariffs. But the duties remain in place for now, as the Federal Circuit wiped away a permanent injunction granted by a lower court that blocked the Trump administration from imposing the levies.",
      "The dispute tests a major centerpiece of the president's economic agenda, and the Justice Department has warned that a ruling against the government would put the frameworks of trade deals negotiated with half a dozen countries at risk.",
      "Termination of temporary legal protections for Venezuelan migrants",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump took office, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem took steps to end legal protections that had been granted to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants by the Biden administration through a program known as Temporary Protected Status.",
      "In response to a lawsuit filed by the National TPS Alliance and seven individuals who were shielded from threat of deportation, a federal judge granted preliminary relief and postponed the date Noem's plan was set to take effect.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined to put that decision on hold while proceedings moved forward, but the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration emergency relief, allowing Noem to end the legal protections for now.",
      "Meanwhile, the 9th Circuit heard arguments in July on the Trump administration's effort to terminate the TPS designation for Venezuela, and late last month, a three-judge panel sided with the plaintiffs.",
      "The judges found that the TPS holders were likely to succeed in their argument that Noem lacked the authority to set aside an earlier extension of the program for Venezuelan migrants.",
      "The impact of that decision, however, is limited because the interim relief granted by the Supreme Court at an earlier stage in the case is still in place.",
      "Alien Enemies Act removals",
      "Mr. Trump issued a proclamation in March that invoked the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport Venezuelan migrants who are suspected of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants it claims are gang members under the wartime law, which gives the president the authority to remove citizens of a \"hostile nation\" if it is engaged in an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" of the U.S.",
      "A \"60 Minutes\" investigation found that many migrants deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act didn't have criminal records.",
      "The proclamation immediately sparked litigation, including two court fights that have already been up to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket. In the first case, brought in federal district court in Washington, D.C., the high court said any challenges to removals under the Alien Enemies Act must be brought in the judicial district where a migrant is being held.",
      "But the Supreme Court also said that migrants at risk of deportation under the 1798 law must receive notice that they are subject to removal and the opportunity to challenge it.",
      "In the wake of that decision, judges in Texas, Colorado, New York and California have blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants being held in their regions.",
      "The second case to reach the Supreme Court arose when Venezuelan migrants detained by immigration officials at a facility in the Northern District of Texas sued to challenge their removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The high court temporarily blocked the migrants' deportations in April and later\u00a0sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit for further review after finding the Trump administration had not provided the migrants with enough notice \u2014 24 hours \u2014 of their impending deportations.",
      "The Supreme Court did not address the lawfulness of the removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "After holding additional proceedings, a divided three-judge panel on the 5th Circuit rejected Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove Venezuelan migrants in the Northern District of Texas. The court said in its 2-1 decision that there was no predatory incursion or invasion by Tren de Aragua \u2014 preconditions to invoking the law.",
      "The 5th Circuit is the first appeals court to address whether Mr. Trump properly invoked the 18th century-law.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson suggested the Trump administration will appeal, saying the 5th Circuit's decision \"will not be the final say on the matter.\"",
      "Firings of members of independent agencies",
      "Mr. Trump has spent his months back in the White House pushing the bounds of executive power, including by firing officials at independent agencies appointed by former President Joe Biden.",
      "Mr. Trump's attempts to remove members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Trade Commission, to name a few, have all led to legal challenges by the ousted officials.",
      "In cases brought by Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, members of the NLRB and MSPB, respectively, a lower court ordered them to be reinstated to their roles. Federal judges in Washington, D.C., ruled their firings violated federal laws that shielded them from being terminated without cause and cited a 1935 Supreme Court decision that said Congress could enact removal protections for members of multi-member boards that met certain criteria.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court for emergency relief allowing it to fire Wilcox and Harris while their cases proceed, and the court gave the president the green-light to remove the officials for now.",
      "Meanwhile, the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., heard oral arguments on Mr. Trump's bid to fire Wilcox and Harris in May but has not yet issued a decision.",
      "But in a different case, involving Mr. Trump's attempt to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the removal protections for members of the trade commission violate the separation of powers. The administration wants the high court to take up the dispute over Slaughter's removal before the appeals court has ruled.",
      "At least one justice, Brett Kavanaugh, believes it's time for the Supreme Court to address the legality of removal restrictions for members of independent agencies. In a concurring opinion in a case involving Mr. Trump's firing of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Kavanaugh said there is a \"at least a fair prospect\" that the Supreme Court will either narrow or overrule Humphrey's Executor v. United States, that 1935 decision that upheld removal protections for certain executive officers.",
      "\"[W]hen the question is whether to narrow or overrule one of this Court's precedents rather than how to resolve an open or disputed question of federal law, further percolation in the lower courts is not particularly useful because lower courts cannot alter or overrule this Court's precedent,\" he wrote.",
      "Birthright citizenship",
      "The president's plan to end birthright citizenship has already been before the Supreme Court, but the justices did not address the constitutionality of his executive order. Instead, the dispute involved whether federal judges have the ability to issue nationwide injunctions, or orders that universally block enforcement of a policy beyond the plaintiffs in a case.",
      "The high court said judges are limited in their ability to grant that sweeping relief, but left open other avenues like class-action lawsuits or challenges to an agency rule brought under the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law governing the agency rule-making process.",
      "Following that June decision, several groups of plaintiffs amended their initial lawsuits and asked district courts to certify as classes children covered by Mr. Trump's executive order and would be denied birthright citizenship.",
      "In one of those cases, brought by a group of four states \u2014 Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon \u2014 a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled 2-1 in July that Mr. Trump's executive order is unconstitutional.",
      "The White House said in response to the decision that it looks forward to \"being vindicated on appeal.\"",
      "The ruling from the 9th Circuit was the first from an appeals court to address the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's executive order.",

    "story": [
      "More than 300 South Korean nationals detained by federal agents in a massive immigration raid last week on a Hyundai plant in Georgia for alleged visa violations were released from a detention center early Thursday and boarded a charter flight back to their country.",
      "The flight, which departed Atlanta, is expected to land in South Korea on Friday afternoon, according to The Associated Press.",
      "The South Korean workers were among some 475 people detained on Sept. 4 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at a still-under construction joint Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery facility near Savannah. ICE said they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Earlier Thursday, CBS News photographer Darrall Johnson watched as the Koreans boarded eight buses that then left for the airport, where a Korean Air charter flight was waiting to fly them home. Johnson said a cart full of documents was loaded onto one of the buses.",
      "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, in an address delivered Thursday in Seoul, said 316 South Koreans would be on the flight, including 10 women. He said one South Korean had decided to remain in the U.S. as they have family members in the country.   The Foreign Ministry said there were also 14 non-Korean nationals boarding the plane, three Japanese, 10 Chinese and one Indonesian.",
      "The ministry had said the flight was expected to take off on Wednesday, but that it was delayed due to unspecified circumstances in the U.S. On Thursday, President Lee said the delay was caused by discussion that was ongoing Wednesday over the details of the transport arrangements for the South Korean nationals between the ICE detention facility and the Atlanta airport.",
      "The detention of hundreds of South Koreans in an ICE facility tested U.S.-South Korea ties that are important politically, militarily and economically. South Korea is the biggest foreign direct investor in the U.S. and the sixth biggest trading partner overall.",
      "President Lee Jae Myung, visiting the White House in July, pledged $350 billion in new U.S. investment to sweeten a trade-and-tariff deal with President Trump.",
      "\"The sentiment is obviously very, very negative,\" James Kim, Chairman and CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, told CBS News. \"In my office, I usually have my TV turned on to the news \u2014 and this is obviously covered from morning to evening constantly. But everyone who I speak to, they view America as its number-one partner here from South Korea. Yes, we're going to have some challenging times.\"",
      "South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun, was peppered with demands from angry lawmakers during a parliamentary session in Seoul on Sept. 8, before he departed for meetings with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other U.S. officials.",
      "Lawmaker Kim Joon Hyun demanded that Cho respond to the ICE raid by launching investigations into every U.S. national teaching English in South Korea who could be working illegally on a tourist visa.",
      "\"Are we giving our money, technology, and investment to the United States only to be treated like this?,\" Kim asked.",
      "Cho replied by saying he would try to negotiate with Rubio to increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled Korean nationals to work in specialty occupations in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the ICE raid was the biggest single-site enforcement action in the agency's history. ICE alleges that the South Korean workers either overstayed their visa waiver permits, known as ESTAs, which allow business visits of up to 90 days, or were holding visas that did not permit them to perform manual labor, called B-1 business visas.",
      "Kim, at the American Chamber in Seoul, called it a \"blip\" in U.S.-Korea ties and said he was \"very, very optimistic about a much brighter future between the two\" countries.",
      "South Korea's president, however, took a more critical tone.",
      "\"As the president who is in charge of national safety, I feel a great responsibility,\" Lee said Tuesday. \"I hope that the unfair infringement of our people and corporate activities for the joint development of both Korea and the United States will not happen again.\"",
      "A poll conducted in South Korea found that almost 60% of respondents said they were disappointed by the U.S. crackdown and called the measures \"excessive,\" while about 31% said the ICE action was \"inevitable\" and that they could understand the reasoning.",
      "President Trump, in a Sunday post on his Truth Social platform, addressed all foreign companies operating in the U.S., saying \"your investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people.\"",
      "Kim at the chamber of commerce urged companies to heed the advice.",
      "\"My key message is listen to what President Trump said today. He wants to encourage more foreign companies to invest in America. Bring your people, bring your resources into America, but do it legally,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"An opportunity to really fix some things\" with a key U.S. ally",
      "Industry experts caution, however, that it may be difficult to maintain investment levels under those guidelines, as securing visas can take years, while many projects face strict deadlines and delays can drive up costs. There is a shortage of highly skilled workers in the U.S., meanwhile, for battery manufacturing, semiconductor and modern shipbuilding industries \u2014 all arenas in which South Korea has been investing heavily for years.",
      "Such jobs can require years of experience, not just a few months of on-the-job training.",
      "A spokesperson for South Korea's Foreign Ministry told CBS News that since Mr. Trump's second term began, it had already reached out 52 times on the matter of securing more visas for highly-skilled workers.",
      "Kim, the U.S. chamber of commerce leader, said the current upset in relations represented \"an opportunity to really fix some things that could be in the grey area, make it a lot more clear, so that they can have an even better relationship.\"",
      "He said that, given Seoul's importance as an investor in the U.S., it may be a good time for Washington to consider adopting a new policy that allows South Koreans to more easily come and work in the U.S.",
      "\"I think that in the past, Korea may not have been a significant investor in the United States, but now they are,\" he said. \"So I think it's worthy and deserving of that kind of a new status.\"",
      "Mr. Trump gave a nod in his Truth Social post to the notion that the U.S. does need foreign expertise, saying foreign companies should bring people over to help train American workers \u2014 and then hire them to do the work themselves.",

      "Rubio and Cho discussed advancing U.S.-South Korean ties \"through a forward-looking agenda\" that \"revitalizes American manufacturing through ROK investment in shipbuilding and other strategic sectors, and promotes a fair and reciprocal trade partnership,\" the State Department said.",
      "According to South Korea's Foreign Ministry, \"Cho expressed deep concern over the public disclosure of the detention of Korean workers who came to the United States to share technology and know-how and contribute to the Trump administration's efforts to revitalize American manufacturing, which has deeply hurt and shocked all Koreans.\"",

    "summary": "Some ancient societies in Asia appear to have smoke-dried their dead, effectively mummifying them thousands of years earlier than their Egyptian counterparts, new research has found.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have discovered what's thought to be the oldest known mummies in the world in southeastern Asia dating back up to 12,000 years.",
      "Mummification prevents decay by preserving dead bodies. The process can happen naturally in places like the sands of Chile's Atacama Desert or the bogs of Ireland where conditions can fend off decomposition. Humans across various cultures also mummified their ancestors through embalming to honor them or send their souls to the afterlife.",
      "Egypt's mummies may be the most well-known, but until now some of the oldest mummies were prepared by a fishing people called the Chinchorro about 7,000 years ago in what's now Peru and Chile.",
      "A new study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences pushes that timeline back.",
      "Researchers found human remains that were buried in crouched or squatted positions with some cuts and burn marks in various archaeological sites across China and Vietnam and to a lesser extent, from the Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.",
      "Studying the bones further, scientists discovered the bodies were likely exposed to heat. That suggested the bodies had been smoke-dried over a fire and mummified by hunter-gatherer communities in the area.",
      "The practice \"allowed people to sustain physical and spiritual connections with their ancestors, bridging time and memory,\" study author Hirofumi Matsumura with Sapporo Medical University in Japan said in an email.",
      "The results were \"a great surprise,\" said Hsiao-chun Hung, senior research fellow at Australian National University.",
      "\"The bones are so ancient, and it is remarkable to discover that this tradition is so old, connecting the practices of ancient peoples with those still found in some communities today,\" Hung said.",
      "The process allowed relatives to maintain contact with the deceased, and in some cases was believed to allow the spirit to roam freely during the day and return to a body at night.",
      "\"I believe this reflects something deeply human \u2014 the timeless wish that our loved ones might never leave us, but remain by our side forever,\" Hung told Agence France-Presse.",
      "The researchers theorize that the practice may have been common in ancient Asian civilizations.",
      "\"This tradition may have been known among hunter-gatherer societies across a vast region, for many millennia,\" they wrote in the study,",
      "Dating methods used on the mummies could have been more robust and it's not yet clear that mummies were consistently smoke-dried across all these locations in southeastern Asia, said human evolution expert Rita Peyroteo Stjerna with Uppsala University in Sweden, who was not involved with the research.",
      "The findings offer \"an important contribution to the study of prehistoric funerary practices,\" she said in an email.",
      "Mummies are far from a thing of the past. Even today, Indigenous communities in Australia and Papua New Guinea smoke-dry and mummify their dead, scientists said.",

Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adree announced the expansion of Israel's operation in a post on X, renewing a warning for Gaza City's famine-stricken residents to evacuate.",
      "Many Palestinians \u2014 tens of thousands of whom had sought shelter in Gaza City after fleeing areas further north amid Israel's offensive against Hamas \u2014 have said they're unable to evacuate due to overcrowding in southern Gaza and the high price of transport.",

      "After weeks of threatening an expansion of the Israeli military operation in Gaza City, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz also signaled on Tuesday that it had begun.",

We will not relent and we will not go back \u2014 until the completion of the mission.\"",
      "The United Nations estimated on Monday that over 220,000 Palestinians have fled northern Gaza over the past month, after the Israeli military warned that all residents should leave Gaza City ahead of the operation.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-designates-colombia-failing-cooperate-drug-war/",
    "published": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 22:39:58 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in nearly three decades.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, a stinging rebuke to a traditional U.S. ally that reflects a recent surge in cocaine production and fraying ties between the White House and the country's leftist president.",
      "Even as it determined that Colombia had failed to comply with its international counternarcotics obligations, the Trump administration issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered major aid cuts, citing vital U.S. national interests.",
      "Nonetheless, it is a major step against one of the United States' staunchest allies in Latin America, and it could further hamper efforts to restore security in the countryside, according to Adam Isacson, a security researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he regretted the decision, which overlooked decades of bloodshed by Colombian security forces and civilians all in the name of a U.S.-led drug war.",
      "\"Everything we do has nothing to do with the Colombian people,\" Petro said during a televised address Monday night. \"It is to prevent the American society from smearing its noses in order to work, work and work, because this drug is a stimulant.\"",
      "The U.S. last added Colombia to the list, through a process known as decertification, in 1997 when the country's cartels \u2014 through threats of violence and money \u2014 had poisoned much of the nation's institutions.",
      "It \"is a blunt tool and a huge irritant in bilateral relations that goes well beyond drug issues and makes cooperation far harder in any number of areas,\" Isacson said. \"That's why it's so rarely used.\"",
      "The president at the time, Ernesto Samper, was facing credible accusations of receiving illicit campaign contributions from the now-defunct Cali cartel, and a plane he was set to use for a trip to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly session was found carrying 4 kilograms of heroin.",
      "A remarkable turnaround began once Samper left office. Successive U.S. administrations \u2014 both Republican and Democrats \u2014 sent billions in foreign assistance to Colombia to eradicate illegal coca crops, strengthen its armed forces in the fight against drug-fueled rebels and provide economic alternatives to poor farmers who are on the lowest rungs of the cocaine industry.",
      "That cooperation started to unravel following the suspension a decade ago of aerial eradication of coca fields with glyphosate. It followed a Colombian high court ruling that determined the U.S.-funded program was potentially harmful to the environment and farmers.",
      "A 2016 peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the nation's largest rebel group known as FARC, also committed Colombia to rolling back punitive policies likened to the U.S. spraying of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War in favor of state building, rural development and voluntary crop substitution.",
      "Since then, cocaine production has skyrocketed. The amount of land dedicated to cultivating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has almost tripled in the past decade to a record 253,000 hectares in 2023, according to the latest report available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. That is almost triple the size of New York City.",
      "Along with production, drug seizures have also soared to 654 metric tons so far this year. Colombia seized a record 884 metric tons last year.",
      "But unlike past governments, manual eradication of coca crops under Petro's leadership has slowed, to barely 5,048 hectares this year \u2014 far less than the 68,000 hectares uprooted in the final year of his conservative predecessor's term and well below the government's own goal of 30,000 hectares.",
      "Petro, a former rebel himself, also has angered senior U.S. officials by denying American extradition requests, as well as criticizing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and its efforts to combat drug trafficking in neighboring Venezuela.",
      "\"Under my administration, Colombia does not collaborate in assassinations,\" Petro said on Sept. 5 after the U.S. military carried out a deadly strike on a small Venezuelan vessel in the Caribbean that the Trump administration said was transporting cocaine bound for the U.S.",
      "\"The failure of Colombia to meet its drug control obligations over the past year rests solely with its political leadership,\" Trump said in a presidential memo submitted to Congress. \"I will consider changing this designation if Colombia's government takes more aggressive action to eradicate coca and reduce cocaine production and trafficking, as well as hold those producing, trafficking, and benefiting from the production of cocaine responsible, including through improved cooperation with the United States to bring the leaders of Colombian criminal organizations to justice.\"",
      "Under U.S. law, the president annually must identify countries that have failed to meet their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months.",
      "In addition to Colombia, the Trump administration listed four other countries \u2014 Afghanistan, Bolivia, Myanmar and Venezuela \u2014 as among 23 major drug transit or drug-production countries that have failed to meet their international obligations. With the exception of Afghanistan, the White House determined that U.S. assistance to those countries was vital to national interests and therefore they would be spared any potential sanctions.",
      "The redesignation of Venezuela as a country that has failed to adequately fight narcotics smuggled from neighboring Colombia comes against the backdrop of a major U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean that has already led to two deadly strikes on small Venezuelan vessels that the Trump administration said were transporting cocaine bound for the U.S.",
      "\"In Venezuela, the criminal regime of indicted drug trafficker Nicol\u00e1s Maduro leads one of the largest cocaine trafficking networks in the world, and the United States will continue to seek to bring Maduro and other members of his complicit regime to justice for their crimes,\" Trump's designation said. \"We will also target Venezuelan foreign terrorist organizations such as Tren de Aragua and purge them from our country.\"",

      "\"Your presence here today sends a clear message that America stands with Israel,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "The Israeli leader has vigorously defended last week's strike in Doha, saying Israeli fighter jets targeted senior Hamas leaders responsible for the Hamas-led, Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that killed some 1,200 people and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza.",
      "Hamas has said that five of its members were killed, but that Israel failed to kill its intended targets \u2014 senior members of the group's political negotiating team, who have long been based in Doha, with the knowledge and backing of both Israel and the U.S.",

      "\"What's happened has happened. Obviously, we were not happy about it. The president was not happy with it,\" Rubio said, referring to the strike in Doha. \"Now we need to move forward and figure out what comes next. Because at the end of the day, when all is said and done, there is still a group called Hamas, which is an evil group that still has weapons and is terrorizing.\"",

      "Israel has vehemently denied multiple accusations that its war in Gaza amounts to a genocide against Palestinians, arguing that its military campaign is solely against Hamas militants whom it accuses of putting civilians in harms way by using them as human shields.",

      "Israel's war has killed more than 64,000 Palestinians in the nearly two years since it began, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel rejects that figure but has not offered its own estimate and does not permit foreign journalists to enter Gaza and operate independently.",
      "The United Nations considers the tally from the Gazan health ministry the most reliable information available on the war's death toll.",
      "Last month, Israel declared Gaza City, the Palestinian Territory's biggest population center, a \"dangerous combat zone\" and a Hamas stronghold.

      "Responders found the other four-person sailboat crew safe when they arrived at the site of that attack off the Bay of Cascais. They helped transport the boat to a port close to Lisbon, the Maritime Authority said.",

    "summary": "Earlier this month, the U.S. deported a group of non-Ghanaian nationals to Ghana, including deportees from Gambia and Nigeria.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Saturday accused the Trump administration of trying to do an \"end-run\" around legal obligations that the U.S. has to protect people fleeing persecution and torture following the deportation of a group of African migrants to Ghana, some of whom are now slated to be returned to their home countries.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan ordered the U.S. government to explain, by 9 p.m. EST on Saturday, what steps it was taking to prevent the deportees \"from being removed to their countries of origin or other countries where they fear persecution or torture.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the U.S. deported more than a dozen non-Ghanaian nationals to Ghana, including deportees from Gambia and Nigeria, making Ghana the latest country to accept these so-called third country deportations at the request of the Trump administration. Ghana's government confirmed the deportations.",
      "Attorneys have alleged in a lawsuit that the deportees have been held in \"squalid conditions and surrounded by armed military guards in an open-air detention facility\" in Ghana.",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, told Chutkan during a hearing Saturday that four of the deportees have been told that Ghana will return them to their native nations as early as Monday, despite the fact that they have orders from U.S. immigration judges that bar their deportation to their home countries due to concerns they could be persecuted or tortured there. One man from Gambia, who attorneys say is bisexual, has already been returned to Gambia, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The deportees' legal protections \u2014 which are rooted in the United Nations Convention Against Torture and a provision of U.S. immigration law known as withholding of removal \u2014 prohibit the U.S. from sending foreigners to countries where they would face persecution or torture. But unlike asylum, they still allow the U.S. to send them to other, third-party countries.",
      "The Justice Department lawyer representing the U.S. government during the hearing did not dispute that Ghana plans to return the deportees to their native countries and conceded that the Ghanaian government appears to be violating diplomatic assurances that it allegedly made vowing not to send these migrants to places where they could be harmed.",
      "But the Justice Department attorney said the U.S. could not tell Ghana what to do at this point.",
      "Chutkan appeared frustrated by that position, suggesting it was \"disingenuous.\" She grilled the Justice Department attorney about whether the U.S. knew this could happen and suggested the deportations seemed to be an \"end-run\" to bypass the legal protections the deportees have. She suggested the U.S. can retrieve the deportees and return them to the U.S. or transfer them to another country where they would be safe. Or, she added, it could tell Ghana it is violating its agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"How's this not a violation of your obligation?\" she asked the Justice Department attorney.",
      "But Chutkan acknowledged her \"hands may be tied\" since the deportees are not on American soil nor in U.S. custody. She also implied that the Supreme Court would almost certainly pause any order that required the American government to act to stop the returns.",
      "In a statement Monday, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin rejected claims that the deportations to Ghana violate U.S. immigration law, citing a Supreme Court order earlier this year that lifted restrictions on third country removals.",
      "\"All of these illegal aliens deported to Ghana received due process and had a final order of removal from an immigration judge,\" McLaughlin added. \"Many of these were heinous criminals with rap sheets that included injury to a child, robbery, aggravated assault, and fraud.\"",
      "Gelernt, the ACLU attorney representing the African deportees, hailed Chutkan's mandate.",
      "\"The Court properly recognized that the United States government, with full knowledge that these individuals are going to be sent to danger, cannot simply wash their hands of the matter,\" Gelernt told CBS News.",
      "As part of its mass deportation campaign, the Trump administration has sought to convince countries around the globe to receive deportees who are not their citizens, brokering agreements with nations including El Salvador, Kosovo, Panama and South Sudan.",

    "story": [
      "Berlin \u2014\u00a0Christian Brueckner, the convicted sex offender named by German authorities as the prime suspect in the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann almost two decades ago, has refused to be interviewed by U.K. police just days before his expected release from prison.",
      "The 49-year-old German national is due to walk free by Wednesday after serving a seven-year sentence for a separate crime, the rape of a 72-year-old American woman in the same region of Portugal from which McCann vanished during a vacation with her family.",
      "While Brueckner remains under formal investigation over McCann's 2007 disappearance, he has never been charged in connection with the case and he continues to deny any involvement.",
      "His decision to decline the London Metropolitan Police's formal request for an interview is being seen as a setback in the long running search for answers in the case that has frustrated investigators in Britain, Portugal and Germany for years.",
      "British Investigators hoped to question Brueckner to clarify key details about his movements in Praia da Luz, the resort town in Portugal's southern Algarve region from which McCann, then three, disappeared. She vanished from her family's rental apartment while her parents had dinner nearby.",
      "For many connected to the case, Brueckner's looming release represents both a pivotal moment and an obstacle. Authorities have been weighing how much oversight they can reasonably maintain over the convicted sex offender once he is no longer behind bars.",
      "Prosecutors in the city of Braunschweig have petitioned the regional court in Hildesheim for what's known as supervisory oversight, a form of monitoring similar to parole that could allow them to impose strict conditions on Brueckner after his release, possibly including an ankle tracking tag.",
      "Brueckner could also be required to declare a fixed place of residence, inform authorities of any change in address or workplace, and face restrictions on where he is permitted to travel. Such restrictions could include barring him from areas linked to his past crimes. He could also be prohibited from leaving Germany without requesting explicit approval from authorities.",
      "Brueckner's attorney Friedrich Fuelscher declined to comment when asked by CBS News about the possibility of his client being subjected to supervisory oversight measures.",
      "A regional court will ultimately decide what measures, if any, to implement following Brueckner's release.",
      "Even if supervisory oversight measures are granted, they are unlikely to satisfy critics who believe the circumstantial evidence linking Brueckner to the McCann case should dictate more close cooperation with British investigators.",
      "His refusal to answer U.K. detectives' questions means they won't get a chance to push him about inconsistencies in his alibis or to confront him directly with witness statements they have gathered over the last 18 years.",
      "The McCann case remains one of the world's most high-profile missing persons investigations.",
      "Brueckner has been at the center of the inquiry since German prosecutors publicly identified him as a suspect in 2020, citing phone records and his history of violent crimes in Portugal's Algarve region. But no charges have ever been brought against him in the McCann case, as the circumstantial evidence has been deemed insufficient to move forward with charges under German law.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said he believes the more than three-year war in Ukraine would end if all NATO countries stopped buying oil from Russia and placed tariffs on China for its purchases of Russian petroleum. The announcement came as Romania became the second NATO country to report a Russian drone incursion.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday a letter purportedly sent to NATO in which he said he is \"ready to do major Sanctions on Russia\" on the condition that all NATO countries stop buying Russian oil. The president said the military alliance's commitment to winning the war in Ukraine \"has been far less than 100%\" and the purchase of Russian oil by some members is \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It greatly weakens your negotiation position, and bargaining power, over Russia,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Since 2023, NATO member Turkey has been the third largest buyer of Russian oil, after China and India, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Other members of the 32-state alliance involved in purchasing Russian oil include Hungary and Slovakia.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter comes at a tense moment in the conflict for NATO after the recent incursion by\u00a0multiple Russian drones into the airspace of alliance member Poland. It's being seen as an escalatory move by Russia and Poland shot down several of the drones.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump appeared to play down the significance of the incident, saying the incursion may not have been deliberate",
      "\"It could have been a mistake,\" he told journalists late Thursday. A day earlier, Mr. Trump issued a brief reaction on his Truth Social platform: \"What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!\"",
      "The White House did not offer any clarification of Mr. Trump's remarks and Poland's most senior officials dismissed his suggestion\u00a0that it had been a mistake on Friday.",
      "On Saturday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that NATO responded to the drones \"appropriately\" and that the U.S. believes it was an \"unacceptable and unfortunate and dangerous development.\"",
      "\"There's no doubt about the drones were intentionally launched,\" he said. \"The question is whether the drones were targeted to go into Poland specifically. If that's the case, that if the evidence leads us there, then, obviously, that'll be a highly explanatory move.\"",
      "Polish and allied aircraft were deployed in a \"preventive\" operation in Poland's airspace on Saturday because of a threat of drone strikes in neighboring areas of Ukraine, and the airport in the eastern Polish city of Lublin was closed, authorities said. The alert lasted around two hours.",
      "The Polish military's operational command posted on X on Saturday afternoon that ground-based air defense and reconnaissance systems were on high alert. It stressed that \"these actions are preventive in nature,\" and were aimed at securing Poland's airspace and protecting the country's citizens. It cited a threat of drone strikes in regions of Ukraine bordering Poland, but didn't give further details.",
      "Separately, Romania said it deployed two F-16 jets to intercept a drone that briefly entered its airspace on Saturday afternoon.",
      "\"The drone did not fly over inhabited areas and did not represent an imminent danger to the security of the population,\" the NATO member's defense ministry said in a statement.",
      "The ministry said that teams of specialists would conduct searches for potential debris. Romanian authorities didn't specify where they thought the drone originated from.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump promised to end the war quickly. Some lawmakers in Congress are trying to persuade Mr. Trump to support a bill that toughens sanctions, after the president hosted Putin in Alaska for talks that failed to deliver on progress toward peace.",
      "The president in his post said a NATO ban on Russian oil plus tariffs on China would \"also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said NATO members should impose 50% to 100% tariffs on China and withdraw them if the war that was launched with Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine ends.",
      "\"China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia,\" he posted, and powerful tariffs \"will break that grip.\"",
      "The U.S. president has already placed an additional 25% import tax on goods from India, which he has said is to punish it for buying Russian energy products.",
      "In his post, Mr. Trump said responsibility for the war fell on his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As in past statements on the issue, he did not include in that list Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched the invasion.",
      "Mr. Trump's post builds on a call Friday with finance ministers from the Group of Seven, a forum of industrialized democracies. During the call, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called on their counterparts to have a \"unified front\" to cut off \"the revenues funding Putin's war machine,\" according to Greer's office.",

      "More than 300 South Korean nationals detained by federal agents in a massive immigration raid last week on a Hyundai plant in Georgia for alleged visa violations were released from a detention center early Thursday and boarded a charter flight back to their country.",
      "The flight, which departed Atlanta, is expected to land in South Korea on Friday afternoon, according to The Associated Press.",
      "The South Korean workers were among some 475 people detained on Sept. 4 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at a still-under construction joint Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery facility near Savannah. ICE said they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Earlier Thursday, CBS News photographer Darrall Johnson watched as the Koreans boarded eight buses that then left for the airport, where a Korean Air charter flight was waiting to fly them home. Johnson said a cart full of documents was loaded onto one of the buses.",
      "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, in an address delivered Thursday in Seoul, said 316 South Koreans would be on the flight, including 10 women. He said one South Korean had decided to remain in the U.S. as they have family members in the country.   The Foreign Ministry said there were also 14 non-Korean nationals boarding the plane, three Japanese, 10 Chinese and one Indonesian.",
      "The ministry had said the flight was expected to take off on Wednesday, but that it was delayed due to unspecified circumstances in the U.S. On Thursday, President Lee said the delay was caused by discussion that was ongoing Wednesday over the details of the transport arrangements for the South Korean nationals between the ICE detention facility and the Atlanta airport.",
      "The detention of hundreds of South Koreans in an ICE facility tested U.S.-South Korea ties that are important politically, militarily and economically. South Korea is the biggest foreign direct investor in the U.S. and the sixth biggest trading partner overall.",
      "President Lee Jae Myung, visiting the White House in July, pledged $350 billion in new U.S. investment to sweeten a trade-and-tariff deal with President Trump.",
      "\"The sentiment is obviously very, very negative,\" James Kim, Chairman and CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, told CBS News. \"In my office, I usually have my TV turned on to the news \u2014 and this is obviously covered from morning to evening constantly. But everyone who I speak to, they view America as its number-one partner here from South Korea. Yes, we're going to have some challenging times.\"",
      "South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun, was peppered with demands from angry lawmakers during a parliamentary session in Seoul on Sept. 8, before he departed for meetings with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other U.S. officials.",
      "Lawmaker Kim Joon Hyun demanded that Cho respond to the ICE raid by launching investigations into every U.S. national teaching English in South Korea who could be working illegally on a tourist visa.",
      "\"Are we giving our money, technology, and investment to the United States only to be treated like this?,\" Kim asked.",
      "Cho replied by saying he would try to negotiate with Rubio to increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled Korean nationals to work in specialty occupations in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the ICE raid was the biggest single-site enforcement action in the agency's history. ICE alleges that the South Korean workers either overstayed their visa waiver permits, known as ESTAs, which allow business visits of up to 90 days, or were holding visas that did not permit them to perform manual labor, called B-1 business visas.",
      "Kim, at the American Chamber in Seoul, called it a \"blip\" in U.S.-Korea ties and said he was \"very, very optimistic about a much brighter future between the two\" countries.",
      "South Korea's president, however, took a more critical tone.",
      "\"As the president who is in charge of national safety, I feel a great responsibility,\" Lee said Tuesday. \"I hope that the unfair infringement of our people and corporate activities for the joint development of both Korea and the United States will not happen again.\"",
      "A poll conducted in South Korea found that almost 60% of respondents said they were disappointed by the U.S. crackdown and called the measures \"excessive,\" while about 31% said the ICE action was \"inevitable\" and that they could understand the reasoning.",
      "President Trump, in a Sunday post on his Truth Social platform, addressed all foreign companies operating in the U.S., saying \"your investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people.\"",
      "Kim at the chamber of commerce urged companies to heed the advice.",
      "\"My key message is listen to what President Trump said today. He wants to encourage more foreign companies to invest in America. Bring your people, bring your resources into America, but do it legally,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"An opportunity to really fix some things\" with a key U.S. ally",
      "Industry experts caution, however, that it may be difficult to maintain investment levels under those guidelines, as securing visas can take years, while many projects face strict deadlines and delays can drive up costs. There is a shortage of highly skilled workers in the U.S., meanwhile, for battery manufacturing, semiconductor and modern shipbuilding industries \u2014 all arenas in which South Korea has been investing heavily for years.",
      "Such jobs can require years of experience, not just a few months of on-the-job training.",
      "A spokesperson for South Korea's Foreign Ministry told CBS News that since Mr. Trump's second term began, it had already reached out 52 times on the matter of securing more visas for highly-skilled workers.",
      "Kim, the U.S. chamber of commerce leader, said the current upset in relations represented \"an opportunity to really fix some things that could be in the grey area, make it a lot more clear, so that they can have an even better relationship.\"",
      "He said that, given Seoul's importance as an investor in the U.S., it may be a good time for Washington to consider adopting a new policy that allows South Koreans to more easily come and work in the U.S.",
      "\"I think that in the past, Korea may not have been a significant investor in the United States, but now they are,\" he said. \"So I think it's worthy and deserving of that kind of a new status.\"",
      "Mr. Trump gave a nod in his Truth Social post to the notion that the U.S. does need foreign expertise, saying foreign companies should bring people over to help train American workers \u2014 and then hire them to do the work themselves.",
      "Rubio, during his meeting Wednesday in Washington with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho, \"said the United States welcomes ROK (South Korea) investment into the United States and stated his interest in deepening cooperation on this front,\" according to a readout shared by the State Department, which did not mention the ICE raid in Georgia.",
      "Rubio and Cho discussed advancing U.S.-South Korean ties \"through a forward-looking agenda\" that \"revitalizes American manufacturing through ROK investment in shipbuilding and other strategic sectors, and promotes a fair and reciprocal trade partnership,\" the State Department said.",
      "According to South Korea's Foreign Ministry, \"Cho expressed deep concern over the public disclosure of the detention of Korean workers who came to the United States to share technology and know-how and contribute to the Trump administration's efforts to revitalize American manufacturing, which has deeply hurt and shocked all Koreans.\"",
      "The ministry's statement said Cho had \"strongly requested the U.S. administration's special attention and support to ensure that these workers, who are not criminals, can quickly depart the US without physical restraint, such as handcuffs, and that they will not face any disadvantages in future visits to the U.S. He also proposed the establishment of a working group between the U.S. and South Korea to discuss various measures, including the creation of new visa categories, to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\"",

      "Australia will spend $1.1 billion on building dozens of locally developed underwater attack drones, Defense Minister Richard Marles said on Wednesday.",
      "The first of the stealthy, long-range \"Ghost Sharks\" will be delivered to the Australian navy in January next year under a five-year contract with Sydney-based Anduril Australia, Marles said.",
      "\"Australia is leading the world in terms of autonomous, underwater military capabilities,\" Marles told reporters in Sydney.",
      "The large, autonomous underwater vehicles would significantly boost Australia's undersea warfare capabilities, complementing a fleet of submarines powered with U.S. nuclear technology, Marles said.",
      "The first of those submarines provided under the AUKUS partnership with the United States and Britain won't be delivered to Australia until 2032.",
      "Marles would not say precisely how many Ghost Sharks would be built. But he said the Australian navy would be provided with \"dozens\" over the next five years.",
      "He also wouldn't comment on the Ghost Sharks' range other than to describe it as \"very long range.\"",
      "As an island continent and a trading nation, Australia sees the possibility of its sea routes being blocked by an enemy as a major strategic threat.",
      "A Chinese navy flotilla conducted a live-fire exercise in the sea between Australia and New Zealand in February in what was widely regarded as a demonstration of China's growing military reach.",
      "The flotilla almost completely circumnavigated Australia. The Chinese navy rarely travels so far south.",
      "California-based Anduril Industries was contracted in 2022 to produce three Ghost Shark prototypes for the Australian navy.",
      "The Ghost Shark is designed to perform intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance roles as well as strike operations, a government statement said.",
      "Chief of Navy Vice Adm. Mark Hammond said the drones could be launched from the shore and from surface ships.",
      "Hammond said he expected the \"undersea battlespace\" will become increasingly congested and contested.",
      "\"I believe our allies and partners will continue to enjoy a capability advantage in that space provided we invest in capabilities like Ghost Shark and others as well as our crewed systems for years to come,\" Hammond said.",
      "Last year, the partnership announced that\u00a0Japan would work with AUKUS\u00a0on maritime autonomy and, according to the official, there are also conversations with Canada, South Korea, and New Zealand about potential projects on emerging capabilities.",
      "Last month, Australia said it would also upgrade its navy with 11 Mogami-class frigates built by Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, first entering service by 2030.",
      "Billed as one of Japan's biggest defence export deals since World War II, Australia has agreed to pay US$6 billion over the next 10 years to acquire the fleet of stealth frigates.",
      "Mogami-class warships \u2014 advanced stealth frigates equipped with a potent array of weapons \u2014 are to replace Australia's ageing fleet of Anzac-class vessels.",

      "One of the many highlights of the state visit is the glamorous state banquet, which will take place Wednesday evening. Around 150 guests are usually invited based on their cultural, diplomatic or economic links to the country being hosted.",

      "Darren McGrady, who was a personal chef to the late queen, Princess Diana and her sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, told Fox News Digital there is zero room for error when it comes to the menu. He served as a royal chef for 15 years and cooked for five U.S. presidents.",

      "\"You are preparing the food that the king or the queen really enjoys,\" he said. \"I know that when I was the chef, the kitchen would send up to four different menus for the queen, and she would choose the one she liked the best. But, before that, there are lots and lots of meetings between the foreign office and the monarch\u2019s office to find out if there are any allergens or any foods they don\u2019t like. The goal is to make the visiting guest feel welcomed, just like you would want any guest coming over to feel.\"",
      "When French President Macron had his state visit in July, the king brought in a French chef. It\u2019s unknown if an American chef will be invited to collaborate on the menu for Trump's visit. Guests can expect to savor plenty of the king and queen\u2019s favorite dishes, those that exemplify the best of the U.K., based on foolproof recipes.",
      "This will be the first time that President Trump will be making a state visit with Charles as king. (Chris Jackson/WPA Pool/Getty Images)",
      "\"The queen was a fan of chocolate \u2014 the darker, the better,\" he said. \"So, there was always chocolate on the menu. King Charles is not a fan of chocolate. He loves cheese, and he loves organic produce. I can see wild mushrooms on the menu. I see lamb. \u2026 Certainly, it was important for the chefs to showcase indigenous produce, like salmon from the Balmoral estate in Scotland or venison from Sandringham. It\u2019s typically any food that was grown on the estate. It\u2019s the best of British produce and recipes.",

But she loved it whenever beef was served. She liked it well done, which is something the chefs in the kitchen had to accept. If we were doing a prime rib roast, the queen would have a slice from both ends, the well-done pieces.\"",
      "While the guest list is kept secret, Seward said celebrities are expected to make an appearance. When former President Obama attended the state banquet in 2011, Tom Hanks was invited, for example.",

They have, for so many years, had a lot of state visits, which, frankly, to them, are quite dull. It\u2019s all beautiful, of course, but [sometimes] the person they\u2019re entertaining is not as entertaining as Trump. So I think they\u2019re really looking forward to that.\"",

      "This may feel like slow walking or warming up, although everyone\u2019s experience will be slightly different. A good way to measure it without any gadgets is to see if you can talk easily and your breathing stays relaxed.",

      "GLP-1s help insulin move the glucose (sugar) out of the bloodstream and into the body\u2019s cells, where it can be used for energy or stored, the doctor said. The drugs also help to prevent the inflammation and damage sugar can cause in the blood vessels, nerves and organs.",

      "\"It is also important to note that the authentic Wegovy\u00a0injectable pen is designed as a single-use pen, the dose is already set, and should not be altered or tampered with, and the pen must be disposed after one use.\"",
      "\"Ozempic\u00a0is a multi-use pen with one pen and multiple needles,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Accessing GLP-1s",

      "APPLE WINS BLOOD OXYGEN BATTLE FOR WATCH OWNERS",
      "Apple Watch Series 11 now includes FDA-cleared hypertension notification. (Apple)",
      "Apple Watch hypertension alerts explained",
      "Hypertension is often called the \"silent killer\" because it can strike without symptoms. Left unchecked, it increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and kidney disease. By adding passive blood pressure monitoring, Apple Watch aims to help millions detect early warning signs.",
      "Using its optical heart sensor, the watch reviews how your blood vessels respond to heartbeats over 30-day periods. If it detects consistent patterns of hypertension, you'll get a notification. Apple expects the feature could alert more than 1 million people with undiagnosed hypertension in its first year alone.",
      "Apple Watch sends users a \"Possible Hypertension\" alert when heart data shows consistent signs of elevated blood pressure. Paired with the iPhone, users can log blood pressure and follow up with doctors. (Apple)",
      "Clinical validation of Apple Watch hypertension feature",
      "Apple built the new hypertension notification feature on a foundation of years of health research. Since the launch of Apple Watch, heart health tools like ECG, AFib History and irregular rhythm notifications have helped users catch issues early. The hypertension notification now extends that mission by addressing one of the most common and dangerous silent conditions.",
      "The feature works in the background during waking hours, analyzing photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, changes in blood volume under the skin, to detect patterns that suggest chronic high blood pressure. You do not need to calibrate the feature or take direct blood pressure readings with the watch. Instead, the device tracks signals over 30 days and sends a notification if consistent signs of hypertension appear.",
      "CAN YOUR APPLE WATCH DETECT PREGNANCY?",
      "Study results confirm accuracy of hypertension alerts",
      "Apple developed the algorithm using data from more than 100,000 study participants across diverse ages, races, body types, and health statuses. The company then validated its accuracy through a pivotal clinical study with over 2,000 participants, who wore Apple Watch alongside an at-home cuff to compare results.",
      "The validation study showed the feature achieved a specificity rate above 92%, meaning it minimized false positives. Sensitivity rates were especially strong for Stage 2 hypertension, the more severe form of the condition, where the feature identified more than half of users at risk. That accuracy could help prevent strokes, heart attacks and kidney disease in those who may not otherwise know they have hypertension.",
      "Importantly, the study confirmed that the feature performed consistently across age groups, genders, races and skin tones, making it reliable for Apple's global user base. Apple also ran usability testing to fine-tune onboarding and notification language so people understand the alerts and what actions to take next.",
      "By passively monitoring and flagging possible signs of hypertension, Apple Watch helps fill a dangerous gap in diagnosis. Hypertension often goes unnoticed for years, but now, you can be alerted within just one month of wearing the watch.",
      "Apple CEO Tim Cook holds up the new Apple Watch Series 11 during a launch event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on Sept. 9, 2025. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)",

      "Cardiologist and scientist Dr. Harlan Krumholz of Yale University and Yale New Haven Hospital told CyberGuy,",
      "\"I\u2019m glad to see Apple turning attention toward hypertension\u2014the number one preventable cause of heart attack and stroke. Their approach automatically flags signals that suggest you may have high blood pressure and encourages you to check it out. That\u2019s especially important because so many people remain undiagnosed. The feature also provides a way to archive blood pressures, so if people are measuring at home, they can bring that information to their doctor. This isn\u2019t a one-stop solution, but it has the potential to help consumers take charge of their health and identify hypertension earlier. The caveat is that people shouldn\u2019t rely on it exclusively\u2014regular care remains essential.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "What if your old bottle of cooking oil could help save the planet and your smartphone? That's the big idea behind a groundbreaking discovery by researchers in Finland.",
      "Scientists from the University of Helsinki and the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 have found that you can recover silver from electronic waste using common kitchen ingredients like vegetable oil and hydrogen peroxide. This sustainable, scalable method published in the Chemical Engineering Journal could change how we mine precious metals from our growing piles of electronic junk.",

      "OLD SMARTPHONES ARE BEING TURNED INTO TINY DATA CENTERS",
      "Scientists have discovered a new method of silver extraction from electronics by using cooking oil. (Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How cooking oil recovers silver from electronic waste",
      "Here's how it works. Fatty acids found in oils like sunflower or olive oil are mixed with hydrogen peroxide. When heated slightly, this combo safely dissolves silver from old circuit boards, wires or keyboard connectors. Then, using ethyl acetate, a far less toxic alternative to industrial solvents, researchers pull out the silver in a solid form. Unlike traditional methods that rely on harsh acids or cyanide-based solutions, this technique avoids toxic runoff and air pollution. Think of it as salad dressing meets science lab, without the environmental mess.",
      "Why recycling silver from e-waste is urgently needed",
      "Silver powers the devices you use every day, such as phones, solar panels, electric vehicles and even medical tech. But less than 20% of it gets recycled. As demand rises and natural resources shrink, finding clean ways to reclaim silver isn't just smart, it's necessary. Silver prices have surged sixfold in the last 25 years. At the same time, supply has lagged. That makes e-waste a goldmine, literally, for anyone who can unlock its hidden metals without poisoning the environment.",

      "Fatty acids found in cooking oil can stabilize silver ions for easier extraction. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)",
      "How scientists extract silver using fatty acids and light",
      "To figure out exactly how this all works, researchers used advanced computer models to study how fatty acids interact with silver ions. The process not only stabilizes the silver but also allows for easy recovery using light and simple solvents. Better still, the ingredients can be reused, and there's no chemical waste or massive cost. And it's highly selective. The method targets silver while leaving other metals behind, a major step forward in urban mining. In testing, even silver-coated keyboard connectors were cleanly processed into pure elemental silver powder using this system.",
      "Indian laborers sift through a heap of pre-owned mobile phones in an electronic waste workshop Dec. 5, 2023, in New Delhi, India.\u00a0 (Yawar Nazir/Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "This research brings us closer to safe, at-home or small-scale recycling kits that could recover silver from old gadgets. Recyclers and manufacturers could adopt this method to reduce chemical waste and operating costs, while protecting workers and the environment. This method supports a future where nothing goes to waste. It keeps valuable materials in use, cutting down the need for mining and pollution. Silver is vital for making many of the tech items we use every day. Reusing it responsibly means cleaner energy at a lower cost and less reliance on mined resources.",

Instead of acting as an assistant, Claude became an active operator scanning networks, crafting malware and even analyzing stolen data. AI lowers the barrier to entry. In the past, such operations required years of training. Now, a single hacker with limited skills can launch attacks that once took a full criminal team.

      "Here's how to defend against hackers now using AI tools to their advantage:",
      "Hackers who break into one account often attempt to use the same password across your other logins. This tactic becomes even more dangerous when AI is involved because a chatbot can quickly test stolen credentials across hundreds of sites. The best defense is to create long, unique passwords for every account you have. Treat your passwords like digital keys and never reuse the same one in more than one lock.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "The hacker who abused Claude didn't just steal files; they organized and analyzed them to find the most damaging details. That illustrates the value of your personal information in the wrong hands. The less data criminals can find about you online, the safer you are. Review your digital footprint, lock down privacy settings, and reduce what's available on public databases and broker sites.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Even if a hacker obtains your password,\u00a02FA\u00a0can stop them in their tracks. AI tools now help criminals generate highly realistic phishing attempts designed to trick you into handing over logins. By enabling\u00a02FA, you add an extra layer of protection that they cannot easily bypass. Choose app-based codes or a physical key whenever possible, as these are more secure than text messages, which are easier for attackers to intercept.",
      "AI-driven attacks often exploit the most basic weaknesses, such as outdated software. Once a hacker knows which companies or individuals are running old systems, they can use automated scripts to break in within minutes. Regular updates close those gaps before they can be targeted. Setting your devices and apps to update automatically removes one of the easiest entry points that criminals rely on.",
      "One of the most alarming details in the Anthropic report was how the hacker used AI to craft convincing extortion notes. The same tactics are being applied to phishing emails and texts sent to everyday users. If you receive a message demanding immediate action, such as clicking a link, transferring money or downloading a file, treat it with suspicion. Stop, check the source and verify before you act.",
      "The hacker in this case built custom malware with the help of AI. That means malicious software is getting smarter, faster and harder to detect. Strong antivirus software that constantly scans for suspicious activity provides a critical safety net. It can identify phishing emails and detect ransomware before it spreads, which is vital now that AI tools make these attacks more adaptive and persistent.",

      "The attack relies on ClickFix tactics, where victims searching for Mac troubleshooting help are lured to fake websites or GitHub repositories. These spoofed sites trick users into copying and pasting a one-line command in Terminal, supposedly to fix an error. Instead, the command silently downloads Shamos, bypasses macOS Gatekeeper protections, and installs the malware.",

The design uses recycled aluminum, glass and titanium to reduce weight while staying durable. Engineers reinforced the frame and applied new drop-test algorithms to make sure it holds up in daily use.",
      "The Air debuts silicon anode battery technology, which allows Apple to shrink the device without cutting power. During the presentation, Apple promised \"all-day battery life,\" but never gave an exact hour count. That vague description raised questions. Moments later, Apple introduced a new low-profile MagSafe battery accessory. When paired with the iPhone 17 Air, Apple says the combo delivers up to 40 hours of video playback. The timing of that announcement made it clear that battery life could still be a concern.",

      "Apple unveiled the third-generation AirPods Pro, priced at $249, and available starting Sept. 19. The design keeps the iconic stem but introduces foam-infused ear tips that come in five sizes. Apple said it studied 100,000 ear shapes to make them fit more securely.",
      "The new AirPods Pro 3 extend listening time, offering up to eight hours on a single charge, compared with six hours in the previous generation. With the charging case, total listening time stretches to 10 hours with hearing-AI features enabled.",
      "One of the standout additions is heart rate sensing, which turns the AirPods into another health-tracking accessory in Apple's ecosystem. The earbuds also use AI-driven hearing enhancements to improve clarity in noisy environments. Apple said the AirPods Pro 3 now deliver up to four times stronger active noise cancellation (ANC) than the originals, making them far more effective in crowded or loud spaces.",
      "For workouts, users can also track over 50 activity types with the Fitness app on iPhone while wearing them. Perhaps most notably, Apple added live translation. When two people wear AirPods Pro 3 paired with iPhones, conversations can be translated in real time, breaking language barriers in a way that once seemed impossible.",
      "Apple Watch Series 11 expands the company\u2019s push into advanced health technology. (Apple)",
      "The Apple Watch Series 11 continues Apple's push into health technology. It runs on watchOS 26 and introduces monitoring for possible hypertension and sleep apnea, with alerts designed to prompt users to seek medical care. Apple noted that FDA clearance is still pending for hypertension notifications, but the company clearly sees the watch as a serious medical tool.",
      "The watch also includes Sleep Score, which breaks down sleep stages such as core, deep and awake to give users a clearer picture of rest quality. Battery life reaches up to 24 hours, and the watch remains efficient even with 5G connectivity.",
      "Apple built the Series 11 with 100% recycled aluminum and titanium cases, expanding its sustainability pledge. Color options bring a refreshed look, while pricing\u00a0starts around $399, depending on configuration.",

      "It also delivers sleep apnea notifications, a feature previously limited to more expensive models. Charging is now up to two times faster, ensuring the watch is ready to go with less downtime. Apple added more health and convenience tools, including wrist temperature sensing for deeper insights in the Vitals app, retrospective ovulation estimates and an Always-On display. It also supports double-tap and wrist flick gestures, plus on-device Siri. Available in two colors, the SE 3 carries forward Apple's strategy of making core health features more accessible.",

      "Apple used the event to highlight a series of accessories that show how the company expects people to use its new iPhones. The most talked about was the\u00a0low-profile MagSafe battery pack, created to address the iPhone 17 Air's biggest weakness: vague \"all-day\" battery claims. When attached, the Air can stretch to 40 hours of video playback, turning what could have been a limitation into a selling point for Apple's ecosystem.",
      "To complement the Air's slim profile, Apple also revealed a\u00a0new translucent case and a\u00a0lightweight bumper. The translucent case keeps the 5.6mm design visible while still protecting it, while the bumper adds shock resistance around the edges without adding bulk. Both aim to reassure buyers who worry that the thinnest iPhone yet might be more fragile.",
      "For the Pro and Pro Max models, Apple introduced\u00a0TechWoven cases made from a durable fabric blend. What stood out was the addition of an\u00a0optional cross-body strap, giving users a hands-free way to carry their phones. Apple leaned into the idea of the iPhone as not just a device but also a lifestyle accessory that blends technology with personal style.",
      "Together, the MagSafe battery, translucent Air case, protective bumper and fashion-forward TechWoven cases with cross-body straps showed Apple's strategy clearly. Accessories are no longer secondary; they are central to how Apple expects customers to protect, power and personalize their iPhones.",

However, most of Icon's multi-story designs rely on a hybrid approach, with 3D printing for the ground floor and timber or steel frames for the upper levels.",
      "That's what makes the Tapping project stand out. Contec printed the structural walls for both stories in just 18 hours of active printing time, something not yet widely seen in the U.S. This could signal the next step for American 3D printing: scaling beyond single-story housing into more complex multi-story designs.",

He also said that his service experience, along with Murray\u2019s, worked in this type of environment where they were able to find people with the right skills and put them where they\u2019d be most useful.",
      "When he was in the military, Zielinski said he experienced a lot of bilateral training in which he did not always speak the same language as his counterparts. He said his experience working through language barriers has helped in his interactions with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which coordinates with GHF.",

      "\"They are amazing because the amount of people that are seeking food and seeking aid can be overwhelming at times. I have never once seen any of us overreact to what would be, I think, to anybody, a very scary situation,\" Weimer said of Zielinski and his team.",

Zielinski told Fox News Digital that he has seen changes to the secure distribution sites (SDS) over time due to the threats that exist in the area.",
      "\"We've had pistols seen before, there's been AKs seen before. There's grenades that went off,\" Zielinski told Fox News Digital.",
      "He also said that his team looks for patterns, records them and then turns into security officials information or materials that can be used to catch bad actors.",
      "\"We'll see down the line that, okay, \u2018Hey, we've seen this person before, he looked very suspicious,\u2019 and next thing you know, this is a guy that has a pistol on him,\" Zielinski said.",

      "Weimer told Fox News Digital that the media depictions of GHF upset him because they\u2019re \"so far askew.\" He said he has called home to tell his family that they should not \"believe the hype.\"",
      "\"I guess that's what I would tell the American people is, you know, these people that are here, these military veterans that lived a long honorable life, we would never be a part of something [like] what I've seen in the media,\" Weimer said. \"It really actually sickens me, it's just so far askew.\"",

      "Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, a United Nations commission said Tuesday, calling on the international community to end the campaign and punish the top officials it found responsible for inciting it.",
      "Israel rejected the accusations as \u201cdistorted and false,\u201d labeling them \"scandalous.\"",
      "A team of independent experts called a commission of inquiry detailed their assessment in a new report, joining a growing chorus of rights advocates and scholars to level the accusation against the U.S. ally.",
      "The findings were published as Israel launched its long-anticipated ground offensive on Gaza City, a widely condemned assault on a famine-stricken area where hundreds of thousands of people were living.",
      "Follow live coverage from NBC News",
      "\u201cThe Commission finds that Israel is responsible for the commission of genocide in Gaza,\u201d said Navi Pillay, the commission chair and former U.N. human rights chief. \u201cIt is clear that there is an intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza through acts that meet the criteria set forth in the Genocide Convention.\u201d",
      "The three-member team said in its 72-page report that Israel has committed four of the five \u201cgenocidal acts\u201d defined under the 1948 Genocide Convention: Killing members of a group, causing serious bodily and mental harm, deliberately inflicting conditions calculated to destroy the group, and preventing births.",
      "To count as genocide, at least one of five acts must have occurred. The commission found no evidence in relation to the fifth category, forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.",
      "The inquiry's conclusion is the strongest U.N. finding to date but the body is independent and does not officially speak for the U.N. The team was commissioned by the Human Rights Council, the U.N.\u2019s top human rights body.",
      "It said Israel has attacked \u201cprotected objects\u201d such as civilian homes and healthcare facilities, while targeting \u201ccivilians and other protected persons.\u201d It also accused Israel of severely mistreating detainees, carrying out forced displacement and environmental destruction, and blocking essential aid, water and supplies.",
      "The report cited an attack on Gaza\u2019s largest fertility clinic, which reportedly destroyed 4,000 embryos and 1,000 sperm samples and fertilized eggs, as a measure intended to prevent births.",
      "To meet the legal definition under the convention, it must also establish that any of the genocidal acts were committed with the intent to destroy a group in whole or in part.",
      "The commission concluded that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant had \u201cincited the commission of genocide.\u201d",
      "It cited Gallant\u2019s remarks in October 2023, after Hamas fighters attacked Israeli communities, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages.",
      "Gallant announced \u201ca complete siege\u201d of Gaza, declaring: \u201cNo electricity, no water, no food, no fuel. We are fighting human animals, and we act accordingly.\u201d",
      "Since then, Palestinian health officials say Israeli forces have killed nearly 65,000 people in Gaza, including thousands of children, while displacing most of the population and destroying or damaging much of its infrastructure.",
      "Addressing U.N. member states, the commission urged they employ \"all means reasonably available to them\" to prevent genocide in Gaza, and \"examine the involvement of officials\" mentioned in the report \"as those most responsible for international crimes\" in Gaza.",
      "Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry said on X that the report relies \u201centirely on Hamas falsehoods,\u201d adding it \u201ccategorically rejects this distorted and false report.\u201d",
      "The country's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, Daniel Meron, called the report \u201cscandalous\u201d and \u201cfake.\u201d",
      "\u201cIsrael categorically rejects the libelous rant,\" he said in a statement posted on X.",
      "It pointed to a study by Israel\u2019s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University that argued allegations of starvation, indiscriminate bombing, and deliberate civilian killings in Gaza lacked verifiable evidence.",
      "The ministry claimed the report \u201crefuted every single false claim regarding genocide.\u201d",
      "Several international rights groups and some Israeli NGOs have already accused Israel of committing genocide.",
      "Earlier this month, the International Association of Genocide Scholars passed a resolution saying the legal criteria had been met to establish that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Eighty-six percent of voting members backed the resolution.",
      "Meanwhile, the International Court of Justice is hearing a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of genocide; both Israel and the United States have rejected the accusation.",
      "While neither the commission nor the 47-member council it reports to can act against a country, the findings could be used by prosecutors at the International Criminal Court or the U.N.\u2019s International Court of Justice.",
      "There is an \u201caccumulated impact,\u201d said Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow with Chatham House\u2019s Middle East and North Africa Program. \"It isolates Israel further and further in the international arena. It legitimizes the isolation of Israel.\u201d",

      "He was\u00a089.",
      "Redford was best known as a go-to leading man of the late 1960s and 1970s, instantly recognizable for his windswept hair and widely beloved for his easy charisma. But he was also an accomplished filmmaker, committed political activist and culture-shaping entrepreneur.",
      "He won the best director Oscar for the family melodrama \u201cOrdinary People\u201d (1980), the first of his nine stints behind the camera.",
      "Redford\u2019s expansive spirit will live on through the Sundance Institute, a nonprofit organization he founded in 1981 that sponsors the Sundance Film Festival. The festival, held annually in snowy Park City, Utah, showcases offbeat projects and helps launch the careers of new artists.",
      "\u201cI saw other stories out there that weren\u2019t having a chance to be told and I thought, \u2018Well, maybe I can commit my energies to giving those people a chance,\u2019\u201d Redford recalled in a 2018 interview. \u201cAs I look back on it, I feel very good about that.\u201d",
      "In a career that stretched across more than six decades, Redford won two Academy Awards, including an honorary prize in 2002, and three Golden Globe Awards, including the Cecil B. DeMille Award lifetime achievement honor in 1994.",
      "President Barack Obama awarded Redford the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, saying in\u00a0remarks at the White House\u00a0that Americans \u201cadmire Bob not just for his remarkable acting, but for having figured out what to do next.\u201d",
      "Charles Robert Redford Jr. was born Aug. 18, 1936, in the beachside community of Santa Monica, California, to Martha Hart and Charles Robert Redford Sr., a milkman turned oil company accountant.",
      "The younger Redford described himself as a poor student who was more interested in the arts and athletics. He graduated from Van Nuys High School in 1954 and briefly attended the University of Colorado Boulder. He later ambled around Europe, soaking up the culture in France, Spain and Italy.",
      "He eventually moved to New York City, enrolling in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He made his Broadway debut in the play \u201cTall Story\u201d (1959) and went on to appear in several popular television shows of the early 1960s, including \u201cAlfred Hitchcock Presents\u201d and \u201cThe Twilight Zone.\u201d",
      "Redford\u2019s most high-profile theatrical performance from the period was opposite Elizabeth Ashley in the original Broadway run of Neil Simon\u2019s \u201cBarefoot in the Park\u201d (1963), playing the uptight newlywed Paul.",
      "\u201cBarefoot in the Park\u201d catapulted Redford to supporting roles in movies, including the off-kilter Alec Guinness comedy \u201cSituation Hopeless \u2026 But Not Serious\u201d (1965) and the show business tale \u201cInside Daisy Clover\u201d (1965), starring Natalie Wood.",
      "\u201cInside Daisy Clover\u201d handed Redford his first Golden Globe (for best new star), and the actor earned wider attention co-starring with Jane Fonda in both the prison break yarn \u201cThe Chase\u201d (1966) and the 1967 big-screen version of \u201cBarefoot in the Park.\u201d",
      "Redford reached a career turning point in 1969 with George Roy Hill\u2019s \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d He was the sharp-shooting Sundance Kid to Paul Newman\u2019s quick-witted Butch Cassidy, two charming Wild West outlaws trying to make their way to Bolivia.",
      "\u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\u201d anchored by one of the most electric star pairings in Hollywood history, conquered the box office and won over critics. Redford was suddenly a bankable leading man with his pick of projects \u2014 and legions of admirers across the country.",
      "The same year, Redford starred as a relentless skier in \u201cDownhill Racer\u201d and a lawman in \u201cTell Them Willie Boy Is Here.\u201d He followed those parts with turns as a motorcyclist in \u201cLittle Fauss and Big Halsy\u201d (1970) and a jewel thief in \u201cThe Hot Rock\u201d (1972), but both movies fizzled at the box office.",
      "\u201cThe Candidate,\u201d a political satire starring Redford as a callow U.S. Senate aspirant, performed respectably and collected largely positive reviews. Obama,\u00a0in his remarks\u00a0at the Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony in 2016, called it \u201cthe best movie about what politics is actually like, ever.\u201d",
      "Redford\u2019s next several projects were among his most commercially successful, lighting up multiplex ticket booths and cementing his status as one of the key A-list performers of the era.",
      "He captivated audiences as a rugged mountain man in Sydney Pollack\u2019s \u201cJeremiah Johnson\u201d (1972) and Barbra Streisand\u2019s romantic partner in \u201cThe Way We Were\u201d (1973). He teamed again with Paul Newman and director George Roy Hill for the light-hearted caper \u201cThe Sting\u201d (1973).",
      "\u201cThe Sting,\u201d starring Redford and Newman as too-cool-for-school grifters in the 1930s, dominated the box office, scooped up the Oscar for best picture, and delivered Redford his first and only nomination for best actor at the 1974 ceremony. (He lost to Jack Lemmon for \u201cSave the Tiger.\u201d)",
      "Redford scored more hits in the middle of the decade, playing the title character in a 1974 retelling of \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d a cocky aviator in \u201cThe Great Waldo Pepper\u201d (1975), and a CIA analyst swept into a high-stakes conspiracy in \u201cThree Days of the Conor\u201d (1975).",
      "He next co-starred in one of the most celebrated movies of the 1970s: \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d (1976), an adaptation of a bestselling memoir of the same name by The Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who doggedly investigated the Watergate scandal.",
      "\u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d a commercial and critical triumph, represented one of the peaks of Redford\u2019s influence in the film industry. He orchestrated the project, including purchasing the film rights to the book and hiring \u201cButch Cassidy\u201d scribe William Goldman to write the screenplay.",
      "The film, a tense and fast-paced account of how Woodward (Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) unraveled the conspiracy that brought down President Richard Nixon, also reflected Redford\u2019s political consciousness and sense of civic responsibility.",
      "\u201cAccuracy was the big, big objective in making the film,\u201d\u00a0Redford recalled in a 2006 interview. \u201cWe had to be accurate, otherwise we would fall under that perception that Hollywood was messing around with a very vital event.\u201d",
      "Redford closed out the 1970s with a relatively small part in the war epic \u201cA Bridge Too Far\u201d (1977) and the role of a shambolic rodeo star in \u201cThe Electric Horseman\u201d (1979), co-starring frequent collaborator Jane Fonda.",
      "The dawn of the 1980s marked the start of a crucial career chapter. He appeared in the 1980 prison flick \u201cBrubaker,\u201d but Redford\u2019s more significant project that year was his wrenching directorial debut, \u201cOrdinary People.\u201d",
      "\u201cOrdinary People\u201d chronicles an upper-middle-class Midwestern family wracked by grief and dysfunction. The film, starring Timothy Hutton, Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore, examines the emotional fault lines underneath America's clean-cut suburban ideal.",
      "Oscar voters lavished the acclaimed drama with four awards, including best picture and a director trophy for Redford. (\u201cRaging Bull\u201d fans are still smarting from the knockout punch.)",
      "Redford acted in only three more films in the 1980s \u2014 the baseball picture \u201cThe Natural\u201d (1984), the best picture winner \u201cOut of Africa\u201d (1985) and the courtroom comedy \u201cLegal Eagles\u201d (1986) \u2014 and directed the largely forgotten dramedy \u201cThe Milagro Beanfield War,\u201d released in 1987.",
      "But in that same period, Redford helped form one of the signature institutions of modern film culture. He founded the Sundance Institute in 1981 with the goal of discovering talent from outside the Hollywood system, highlighting independent productions and supporting new artists.",
      "The Sundance Film Festival, named for one of the actor\u2019s most iconic characters, grew into a cornerstone of the film industry and eventually one of the most glitzy extravaganzas on the Hollywood social calendar, known as much for screenings as for executive deal-making and VIP parties.",
      "The festival was a launching pad for some of the most well-known auteurs of the last quarter-century \u2014 Quentin Tarantino, Paul Thomas Anderson, Steven Soderbergh, Gina Prince-Bythewood \u2014 and continues to be an incubator for promising young writers, directors and other creative personalities.",

      "In the 1990s and early 2000s, as Sundance helped turn independent film into a lucrative business, Redford continued to act steadily.",
      "In those years, Redford starred in the heist comedy \u201cSneakers\u201d (1992), the erotic potboiler \u201cIndecent Proposal\u201d (1993), and the back-to-back 2001 thrillers \u201cThe Last Castle\u201d and \u201cSpy Game.\u201d",

      "\u201cA River Runs Through It\u201d and \u201cQuiz Show\u201d drew praise, and the latter received Oscar nominations for best picture and best director. Redford\u2019s subsequent directorial outings received mixed reviews, however, although \u201cLions\u201d and \u201cCompany\u201d allowed him to explore political themes.",
      "In his later years, Redford took on a challenging role in \u201cAll Is Lost,\u201d a 2013 survival story that featured virtually no other characters and barely any dialogue. The actor received a standing ovation after the film screened at the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "He portrayed former CBS newsman Dan Rather in \u201cTruth\u201d (2015) and introduced himself to a new generation of moviegoers as the villainous government operative Alexander Pierce in the Marvel franchise entries \u201cCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\u201d (2014) and \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d (2019).",

I figure now as I\u2019m getting into my 80s, it\u2019s maybe time to move toward retirement and spend more time with my wife and family,\u201d Redford told the Associated Press in 2018.",
      "He is survived by his wife, Sibylle Szaggars, and two children from a previous marriage to Lola Van Wagenen: Shauna Jean Redford and Amy Hart Redford.

    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance, hosting the podcast once helmed by Kirk, encouraged people to make trouble for individuals who were \"celebrating\" the conservative activist's death.",
    "story": [
      "The White House has ramped up its vow for vengeance in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination, with deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller promising to bring the resources of the federal government to bear against what he described as \u201cterrorist networks.\u201d",
      "Vice President JD Vance, meanwhile, argued that those identifying as liberals were largely to blame for political violence and endorsed efforts to shame and make job trouble for those publicly cheering Kirk\u2019s death.",
      "Their comments came Monday during an episode of Kirk\u2019s namesake podcast, which Vance hosted from his ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.",
      "\u201cIt is a vast domestic terror movement,\u201d said Miller, speaking of left-wing political organizations.",
      "\u201cWith God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people,\u201d he added. \u201cIt will happen, and we will do it in Charlie\u2019s name.\u201d",
      "Vance, who counted Kirk as a close friend and credited him Monday for his ascendance to the vice presidency, said he is \u201cdesperate\u201d for unity. He also said he believes it\u2019s impossible without pushing back on left-leaning individuals and groups that he described as being more supportive and condoning of political violence.",
      "\u201cWhen you see someone celebrating Charlie\u2019s murder, call them out,\u201d Vance added. \u201cAnd, hell, call their employer. We don\u2019t believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility, and there is no civility in the celebration of political assassination.\u201d",
      "Vance cited numbers from a YouGov survey, conducted after Kirk's assassination, in which 24% of respondents who described themselves as \u201cvery liberal\u201d said it was \u201calways\u201d or \u201cusually\u201d acceptable to be happy about the death of a political figure they oppose. Only 3% of those who described themselves as \u201cvery conservative\u201d answered that way.",
      "In the same survey, 26% of liberals from the ages of 18 to 44 said political violence can sometimes be justified. (Some academic research has cast doubt on whether eye-catching opinion surveys are accurately capturing true levels of support for political violence.)",
      "\u201cThis is not a both-sides problem,\u201d Vance said. \u201cIf both sides have a problem, one side has a much bigger and malignant problem, and that is the truth we must be told.\u201d",
      "He added, a moment later: \u201cWhile our side of the aisle certainly has its crazies, it is a statistical fact that most of the lunatics in American politics today are proud members of the far left.\u201d",
      "Growing political violence has affected both sides of the aisle; a Democratic state lawmaker and her husband were shot to death in Minnesota in June, and authorities said it was a \"politically motivated assassination.\"",
      "In the Kirk case, Tyler Robinson, 22, was arrested and faces charges of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, and obstruction of justice. Full details about a motive are not yet known, though FBI Director Kash Patel said in a Fox News interview Monday that Robinson's actions were premeditated and based on his political, left-leaning beliefs.",
      "Vance at one point aimed his ire The Nation, a progressive magazine that he accused of falsely smearing Kirk after his death. Vance also, as Trump has done in recent days, singled out George Soros, the 95-year-old Democratic megadonor and the founder of the Open Society Foundations, which he said has helped fund The Nation.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for the magazine said that it has \u201cnever received funding from George Soros\u201d or the Open Society Foundations. The spokesperson also said that the magazine stands by the article Vance attacked but that it has \u201cclarified the phrasing of a quote by Kirk that Vice President Vance referenced.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Open Society Foundations said the organization has \u201cunequivocally condemned the horrific murder of Charlie Kirk.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe oppose all forms of violence and condemn the outrageous accusations to the contrary,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cOur work is entirely peaceful and lawful. It is disgraceful to use this tragedy for political ends to dangerously divide Americans and attack the First Amendment.\u201d",
      "At one point during Monday's two-hour podcast, Vance spoke of the intimidation that he said a senior White House staffer who was friends with Kirk had faced since the assassination: \u201cleft-leaning\u201d operatives circulating leaflets and encouraging the staffer\u2019s neighbors to \u201charass him, or, God forbid, to do worse.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile he was mourning his dead friend, he and his wife had to worry about the political terrorists drawing a big target on the home he shares with his young children,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAre these people violent? I hope not, but are they guilty of encouraging violence? You damn well better believe it.\u201d",
      "Besides Miller, other guests during the program included White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Tucker Carlson, the conservative commentator who is also close with Trump and Vance. All hailed Kirk as a transformative figure in Republican politics. Some were milder in their interpretations of what his legacy should yield.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s our mission to go out there and embolden young conservatives \u2014 young Christians, most importantly \u2014 to go out there and continue to do his work, because it\u2019s exactly what he would want,\u201d Kaelan Dorr, the deputy White House communications director, told Vance. \u201cHe would want you to go find five people who don\u2019t believe in Jesus that day and give them a good lecturing, and walk them through everything in a way that is respectful and is, you know, grounded in fact. And I don\u2019t know how we replace that, but I think the energy that I\u2019m seeing amongst people is just palpable.\u201d",
      "Vance made several overtures to the many Democrats that he acknowledged do not condone such tactics or violence.",
      "\u201cNow I have heard many calls in the last few days for unity and for healing in the wake of Charlie\u2019s assassination,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have no idea how desperately I want that, how gratified I was when Democratic friends and even former Senate colleagues reached out to offer their condolences to me. I\u2019m so thankful, and I know there are so many like them all across our great country. I am desperate to wrap my arms around them, as we all unite to condemn political violence and the ideas that cause it.\u201d",
      "Vance also called on the same people he urged to target those celebrating Kirk\u2019s death to get involved in Turning Point USA, the political organization Kirk leaves behind.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the best way to honor Charlie\u2019s legacy,\u201d Vance said. \u201cStart a chapter of TPUSA, or get involved in the one that already exists. If you\u2019re older, volunteer for your local party, write an op-ed in your local paper, run for office.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t promise you this is going to be easy,\u201d Vance added. \u201cCan\u2019t promise you that all of us will avoid Charlie\u2019s fate. Can\u2019t promise you that I will avoid Charlie\u2019s fate. But the way to honor him is to shine the light of truth like a torch in the very darkest places.\u201d"

      "This year's lethal spread of measles in rural West Texas and other pockets of the U.S. was a strong warning about how protection against deadly childhood diseases is eroding around the nation.",
      "This was a key conclusion of a six-month NBC News investigation, in collaboration with Stanford University, resulting in the most comprehensive analysis of vaccinations and school exemptions to date.",
      "NBC News gathered massive amounts of data from state governments and archives of public records reaching back years or decades. With the help of infectious disease researchers at Stanford, NBC News filed scores of requests for documents, including materials obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, and wrestled different types of data into a standardized format to map and compare rates across thousands of counties.",
      "The analysis found that a large swath of the U.S. currently does not have the basic, ground-level immunity medical experts believe is necessary to stop the spread of measles, which had once receded into the past.",
      "NBC News data investigation: How progress against childhood diseases is backsliding.",

      "The conversation led to infectious diseases scientist Dr. Nathan Lo at Stanford University, who had mapped out vaccination and exemption data in a few states. Lo became a collaborator in this monthslong data project, helping identify the limitations of the broader state-level vaccination trends that are collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Outbreaks start locally",
      "We put vaccination trends under a microscope, down to the county level. The findings could help public health officials better predict where the next outbreak may occur and how to best allocate resources to stop it.",
      "Or parents of children at high risk of complications from infectious diseases could find out if their community is a potential hot spot.",
      "The analysis has identified unexpected trends.",
      "For example, St. Louis, a diverse, major metropolitan area, is in the midst of a slide in immunization rates. That\u2019s why it is a reporting focus.",

      "Our Methodology",
      "How NBC News collected the data",
      "NBC News built a database of kindergarten vaccination and exemption information using data provided by state governments, primarily health agencies. The data combines public information available for some states and data provided directly to NBC News.",
      "The data covers kindergartner vaccinations for each academic year.",
      "After collection, the data was collated and exemption rates were calculated in order to be analyzed. The analysis focuses on four facets of the data:",
      "Medical exemptions: Exemptions granted when students have a medical condition that would make vaccination potentially harmful.",
      "Nonmedical exemptions: Exemptions for students who opt out of required vaccinations due to personal beliefs or religious convictions.",
      "MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccinations: For states in which data is subdivided by number of doses, MMR vaccination is counted by the second dose.",
      "Up-to-date vaccinations: Students are considered \u201cup-to-date\u201d with their vaccinations if they have received the full vaccination series required for enrollment in their school.",
      "With a hodgepodge of formats, jurisdictions and collection practices across states, the task required extensive work to ensure that possible inconsistencies in the data were managed.",
      "Certain states, such as Ohio and New York, required further calculations to aggregate the state-supplied data.Other states required hand input of hundreds of rows of tabular data.All data was checked for accuracy.",

      "Not all states have recent data. Florida did not provide data on kindergarten exemptions after the 2021-2022 school year. Montana stopped collecting vaccine and exemption data after 2019, first due to Covid and thereafter due to the passage of a state bill (HB 334) in 2021 that struck down the mandate for the state to collect data on immunizations.Certain states (such as Arizona, Colorado and Minnesota) do not collect an overall \u201cup-to-date\u201d figure representing the percentage of kindergarteners who are compliant with all required vaccines. Others (such as Florida, New Hampshire, New Jersey and South Carolina) provided only \u201cup-to-date\u201d numbers. In other states \u2014 Mississippi, New Hampshire and South Carolina \u2014 data was provided only for years K-12, rather than specifically kindergarteners. West Virginia also falls into this category for their exemption data. Mississippi could share only pre-K-12 exemption data.Some states \u2014 Illinois and New York \u2014 do not collect data at grade level, so data is for elementary schools as a whole (up to K-8 for Illinois, New York was based on New York State Education Department labeling of elementary schools), rather than kindergarteners in specific. Hawaii also fell into this category (up to K-5), as its school-level data was more consistent than its kindergarten-specific data. New Mexico includes 5- and 6-year-olds in its data, and state officials told NBC News that the inclusion of children before they enter kindergarten is one reason its vaccination rates are lower than in other places.Other states did not provide data on a county level.

West Virginia was unable to provide county-level immunization data.Some states (e.g., Michigan, New Mexico) collect data by calendar year, rather than school year.Wyoming did not consistently report data among kindergarteners, so the most consistent reported value was used instead: one-dose MMR among 19- to 35-month-olds. Accordingly, exemptions among children younger than 5 were used to correspond with this age group.West Virginia was unable to provide county-level immunization data, but was able to provide exemption data per county, starting with the issuance of Executive Order 7-25 in January, which overturned the state\u2019s longstanding ban on nonmedical exemptions.Alaska was unable to provide regional exemption data for privacy reasons because of small sample sizes.",

      "\u201cWe found that in southern China and Southeast Asia, there were many archeological sites that contain human burials that are between four and 14,000 years old,\u201d Professor Peter Bellwood, a co-author of the study, told NBC News in a phone interview on Tuesday.",
      "The study, which was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examined 54 pre-Neolithic burials from 11 archaeological sites in southern China and Southeast Asia, with large numbers of samples coming from Vietnam and China\u2019s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and smaller numbers coming from the Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.",
      "Human remains were found in tightly crouched or squatting postures, often with traces of burning. The researchers said findings confirmed that many of the remains had been smoke-dried over fire for extended periods before burial in a process of mummification.",
      "The remains \u201cbelong to an original hunter-gatherer population that occupied Southeast Asia in Paleolithic times, and that continued in occupation in places like Australia and New Guinea through into current times,\u201d said Bellwood, an emeritus professor of archaeology in the School of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Australian National University in Canberra.",
      "Previously, the oldest known mummies had been found not in Egypt but in modern-day Peru and Chile, where they were prepared by a fishing people called the Chinchorro about 7,000 years ago.",

      "\u201cBarefoot in the Park\u201d catapulted Redford to supporting roles in movies, including the off-kilter Alec Guinness comedy \u201cSituation Hopeless \u2026 But Not Serious\u201d (1965) and the show business tale \u201cInside Daisy Clover\u201d (1965), starring Natalie Wood.",
      "\u201cInside Daisy Clover\u201d handed Redford his first Golden Globe (for best new star), and the actor earned wider attention co-starring with Jane Fonda in both the prison break yarn \u201cThe Chase\u201d (1966) and the 1967 big-screen version of \u201cBarefoot in the Park.\u201d",
      "Redford reached a career turning point in 1969 with George Roy Hill\u2019s \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d He was the sharp-shooting Sundance Kid to Paul Newman\u2019s quick-witted Butch Cassidy, two charming Wild West outlaws trying to make their way to Bolivia.",
      "\u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\u201d anchored by one of the most electric star pairings in Hollywood history, conquered the box office and won over critics. Redford was suddenly a bankable leading man with his pick of projects \u2014 and legions of admirers across the country.",
      "The same year, Redford starred as a relentless skier in \u201cDownhill Racer\u201d and a lawman in \u201cTell Them Willie Boy Is Here.\u201d He followed those parts with turns as a motorcyclist in \u201cLittle Fauss and Big Halsy\u201d (1970) and a jewel thief in \u201cThe Hot Rock\u201d (1972), but both movies fizzled at the box office.",
      "\u201cThe Candidate,\u201d a political satire starring Redford as a callow U.S. Senate aspirant, performed respectably and collected largely positive reviews. Obama,\u00a0in his remarks\u00a0at the Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony in 2016, called it \u201cthe best movie about what politics is actually like, ever.\u201d",
      "Redford\u2019s next several projects were among his most commercially successful, lighting up multiplex ticket booths and cementing his status as one of the key A-list performers of the era.",
      "He captivated audiences as a rugged mountain man in Sydney Pollack\u2019s \u201cJeremiah Johnson\u201d (1972) and Barbra Streisand\u2019s romantic partner in \u201cThe Way We Were\u201d (1973). He teamed again with Paul Newman and director George Roy Hill for the light-hearted caper \u201cThe Sting\u201d (1973).",
      "\u201cThe Sting,\u201d starring Redford and Newman as too-cool-for-school grifters in the 1930s, dominated the box office, scooped up the Oscar for best picture, and delivered Redford his first and only nomination for best actor at the 1974 ceremony. (He lost to Jack Lemmon for \u201cSave the Tiger.\u201d)",
      "Redford scored more hits in the middle of the decade, playing the title character in a 1974 retelling of \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d a cocky aviator in \u201cThe Great Waldo Pepper\u201d (1975), and a CIA analyst swept into a high-stakes conspiracy in \u201cThree Days of the Conor\u201d (1975).",
      "He next co-starred in one of the most celebrated movies of the 1970s: \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d (1976), an adaptation of a bestselling memoir of the same name by The Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who doggedly investigated the Watergate scandal.",
      "\u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d a commercial and critical triumph, represented one of the peaks of Redford\u2019s influence in the film industry. He orchestrated the project, including purchasing the film rights to the book and hiring \u201cButch Cassidy\u201d scribe William Goldman to write the screenplay.",
      "The film, a tense and fast-paced account of how Woodward (Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) unraveled the conspiracy that brought down President Richard Nixon, also reflected Redford\u2019s political consciousness and sense of civic responsibility.",
      "\u201cAccuracy was the big, big objective in making the film,\u201d\u00a0Redford recalled in a 2006 interview. \u201cWe had to be accurate, otherwise we would fall under that perception that Hollywood was messing around with a very vital event.\u201d",
      "Redford closed out the 1970s with a relatively small part in the war epic \u201cA Bridge Too Far\u201d (1977) and the role of a shambolic rodeo star in \u201cThe Electric Horseman\u201d (1979), co-starring frequent collaborator Jane Fonda.",
      "The dawn of the 1980s marked the start of a crucial career chapter. He appeared in the 1980 prison flick \u201cBrubaker,\u201d but Redford\u2019s more significant project that year was his wrenching directorial debut, \u201cOrdinary People.\u201d",
      "\u201cOrdinary People\u201d chronicles an upper-middle-class Midwestern family wracked by grief and dysfunction. The film, starring Timothy Hutton, Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore, examines the emotional fault lines underneath America's clean-cut suburban ideal.",
      "Oscar voters lavished the acclaimed drama with four awards, including best picture and a director trophy for Redford. (\u201cRaging Bull\u201d fans are still smarting from the knockout punch.)",
      "Redford acted in only three more films in the 1980s \u2014 the baseball picture \u201cThe Natural\u201d (1984), the best picture winner \u201cOut of Africa\u201d (1985) and the courtroom comedy \u201cLegal Eagles\u201d (1986) \u2014 and directed the largely forgotten dramedy \u201cThe Milagro Beanfield War,\u201d released in 1987.",
      "But in that same period, Redford helped form one of the signature institutions of modern film culture. He founded the Sundance Institute in 1981 with the goal of discovering talent from outside the Hollywood system, highlighting independent productions and supporting new artists.",
      "The Sundance Film Festival, named for one of the actor\u2019s most iconic characters, grew into a cornerstone of the film industry and eventually one of the most glitzy extravaganzas on the Hollywood social calendar, known as much for screenings as for executive deal-making and VIP parties.",
      "The festival was a launching pad for some of the most well-known auteurs of the last quarter-century \u2014 Quentin Tarantino, Paul Thomas Anderson, Steven Soderbergh, Gina Prince-Bythewood \u2014 and continues to be an incubator for promising young writers, directors and other creative personalities.",
      "It has likewise focused national attention on seminal independent films such as Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cSex, Lies, and Videotape\u201d (1989) and Tarantino\u2019s \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d (1992) as well as \u201cClerks\u201d (1994),\u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d (1999), \u201cDonnie Darko\u201d (2001) and \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine\u201d (2006).",
      "In the 1990s and early 2000s, as Sundance helped turn independent film into a lucrative business, Redford continued to act steadily.",
      "In those years, Redford starred in the heist comedy \u201cSneakers\u201d (1992), the erotic potboiler \u201cIndecent Proposal\u201d (1993), and the back-to-back 2001 thrillers \u201cThe Last Castle\u201d and \u201cSpy Game.\u201d",
      "He was also an active director during that period, helming \u201cA River Runs Through It\u201d (1992), \u201cQuiz Show\u201d (1994), \u201cThe Horse Whisperer\u201d (1998), \u201cThe Legend of Bagger Vance\u201d (2000), and \u201cLions for Lambs\u201d (2007), and more recently \u201cThe Conspirator\u201d (2010) and \u201cThe Company You Keep\u201d (2012).",
      "\u201cA River Runs Through It\u201d and \u201cQuiz Show\u201d drew praise, and the latter received Oscar nominations for best picture and best director. Redford\u2019s subsequent directorial outings received mixed reviews, however, although \u201cLions\u201d and \u201cCompany\u201d allowed him to explore political themes.",
      "In his later years, Redford took on a challenging role in \u201cAll Is Lost,\u201d a 2013 survival story that featured virtually no other characters and barely any dialogue. The actor received a standing ovation after the film screened at the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "He portrayed former CBS newsman Dan Rather in \u201cTruth\u201d (2015) and introduced himself to a new generation of moviegoers as the villainous government operative Alexander Pierce in the Marvel franchise entries \u201cCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\u201d (2014) and \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d (2019).",
      "Redford\u2019s leading role as a gentlemanly bank robber in David Lowery\u2019s character study \u201cThe Old Man & the Gun\u201d (2018) was his last, adding a gentle grace note to an illustrious Hollywood career.",
      "\u201cI just figure that I\u2019ve had a long career that I\u2019m very pleased with. It\u2019s been so long, ever since I was 21. I figure now as I\u2019m getting into my 80s, it\u2019s maybe time to move toward retirement and spend more time with my wife and family,\u201d Redford told the Associated Press in 2018.",
      "He is survived by his wife, Sibylle Szaggars, and two children from a previous marriage to Lola Van Wagenen: Shauna Jean Redford and Amy Hart Redford. Redford and his first wife lost two sons: Scott Anthony Redford, born in 1959, died of sudden infant death syndrome; David James Redford died of cancer in 2020."

      "Tom Brady will return to competitive football, sort of.",
      "The seven-time Super Bowl winning quarterback was announced on Monday as the headliner for a new flag football event featuring both active and retired NFL players that will take place March 21, 2026 \u2014 in Saudi Arabia.",
      "According to Fanatics, the sports merchandiser partly behind the event, Brady will make his \"first official return to the field\" since retirement by taking part in a three-team round-robin tournament to be broadcast by FOX Sports and played under the same five-on-five format to be used when flag football makes its Olympics debut in 2028, on a 50-yard field. Whether that means Brady will officially be throwing passes for the first time since 2023 wasn't explicitly spelled out. But each team will be coached by an active NFL coach: Las Vegas' Pete Carroll, Denver's Sean Payton and San Francisco's Kyle Shanahan.",
      "Active NFL players Christian McCaffrey of San Francisco, Sauce Gardner of the New York Jets, CeeDee Lamb of Dallas, Saquon Barkley of Philadelphia, Myles Garrett of Cleveland, Tyreek Hill of Miami and Brock Bowers and Maxx Crosby of Las Vegas all were announced as taking part, though how much each would participate on the field in the offseason event was not detailed.",
      "The Saudi Arabia-backed event is co-organized by Turki Al-Sheikh, the chairman of the country\u2019s General Entertainment Authority, and is the latest piece of sports real estate bearing the imprint of the 44-year-old.",
      "He has spearheaded a campaign by the ruling Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to help soften the country\u2019s image on the world stage with numerous entries into global sports, from the creation of LIV Golf, a competitor to the top U.S. men's golf tour, to the country's 2021 takeover of the Premier League soccer club Newcastle through a sovereign wealth fund. The Women's Tennis Association will hold its season-ending final in Riyadh in November. Human-rights organizations have criticized the high-profile investments in sports as trying to distract from the country's human rights record, a practice described as \"sportswashing.\"",
      "Al-Sheikh's involvement in sports to this point has been largely limited to combat sports, with The Athletic describing him earlier this year as \"boxing's most powerful figure.\" Last year, Al-Sheikh, who had already served as matchmaker for huge bouts, also purchased one of the sport's oldest media outlets, The Ring magazine. Al-Sheikh, along with UFC President Dana White, helped promote the Canelo Alvarez-Terence Crawford megafight on Netflix on Saturday.",
      "Now, Saudi Arabia will serve as a backdrop for flag football as the sport gains more relevance ahead of its Olympic debut. When NFL owners approved active NFL players to take part in the Olympics during a spring vote, the green light drew hearty approval from players across the league.",
      "Brady and Al-Sheikh stood together on the field inside the Las Vegas stadium earlier Monday to announce the deal.",
      "The famously competitive Brady did not seem ready to treat the event as a stakes-free exhibition.",
      "\u201cI will be bringing home the trophy,\u201d Brady said in a prepared statement."

      "Georgia, a longtime Republican stronghold, has emerged as a battleground state in recent years, and the governor\u2019s race next year is expected to be one of the most competitive in the country. After Biden won the state narrowly in 2020, Trump won it last year.",

      "Moments ago, Cooper picked up the coveted award, which now cements him as the youngest male actor to win an Emmy \u2014 ever.",
      "The honor was previously held by a then 16-year-old Scott Jacoby, who had won best supporting actor in 1973 for his role in the made-for-TV drama film \u201cThat Certain Summer.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the youngest female Emmy winner is Roxana Zal, who won in 1984 for best supporting actress in a limited series or movie at 14 for \u201cSomething About Amelia.\u201d",
      "Prior to his historic win on Sunday night, Cooper spoke exclusively to TODAY.com about the significance of his then potential win and what he felt about being honored.",
      "\u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of pressure on me, but it\u2019s just, obviously, it\u2019s a bonus,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it just shows how well the show is done. So, yeah, it\u2019s just a good way to end.\u201d",
      "During his acceptance speech, Cooper elaborated on his win and how it fit into the trajectory of his life.",
      "\"A couple years back I didn't expect to be in the United States, let alone here. Tonight proves if you listen, you focus and you step out of your comfort zone, you can achieve anything in life. I was nothing three years ago. I'm here now,\" he said.",
      "\"If you step out of your comfort zone, who cares if you get embarrassed? Anything can be possible,\" he continued.",
      "He went on to thank his parents, the show's creators, Netflix and more. \"It may be my name on the wall but it really belongs to the people behind the camera,\" he said.",
      "Cooper\u2019s poignant thoughts about his role in the film during his acceptance speech are just a snapshot of the impact that the award-winning series has had on him and the many people the show affected.",
      "Co-created by and co-starring Stephen Graham, who played Jamie\u2019s dad Eddie Miller, \u201cAdolescence\u201d is inspired by real events, which included a series of recent local stabbings.",
      "\u201cThere was an incident where a young boy (allegedly) stabbed a girl,\u201d Graham told Tudum. \u201cIt shocked me. I was thinking, \u2018What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happening in society where a boy stabs a girl to death? What\u2019s the inciting incident here?\u2019 And then it happened again, and it happened again, and it happened again. I really just wanted to shine a light on it, and ask, \u2018Why is this happening today? What\u2019s going on? How have we come to this?\u2019\u201d",
      "In his interview with the outlet, Graham said that he hoped the show would help answer the question, \u201cWhat is happening to our young men these days and what are the pressures they face from their peers, from the internet and from social media?\u201d",
      "Aside from the ripped-from-the-headline effect, the series has also struck a chord with critics and parents alike. Following its release on March 13, \u201cAdolescence\u201d became the No. 1. English-language show on Netflix in the U.S. It also garnered a critics approval rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, which has since been updated to 98% with 109 critic reviews.",
      "In a Sunday Focus segment on TODAY March 30, NBC\u2019s Daniele Hamamdjian explored the impact of the series and the national conversation it sparked about online culture and the complex issues of teens.",
      "Speaking to psychologists about some of those hot button issues, Hamamdjian told Sunday TODAY\u2019s Willie Geist that experts advise that the best way to start a conversation with kids about such issues is to \u201cget off your own device.\u201d",
      "\u201cAdults need to model the right behavior, monitoring screen time and the types of content viewed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe point .. is to remind kids that there are real relationships out there and in the real world. Not just online and in apps and parents should encourage in person interactions.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Nate Bargatze wasted no time getting the laughs in the opening moments of the 77th Annual Emmy Awards.",
      "Instead of kicking things off with a traditional monologue, the \"Hello World\" comedian opened the show with a throwback to one of his most popular sketches from his time hosting Saturday Night Live: \"Washington's Dream.\"",
      "Except instead of portraying America's first president, however, Bargatze instead took on Philo T. Farnsworth, otherwise known as the man who first invented television.",
      "In the skit, Bargatze described a future in which, among other things, people would watch TV while \"sitting on the toilet.\"",
      "He also poked fun at streaming (\"a new way for companies to lose money\"), Stanley Tucci's two Italy-set travel shows, some of this year's Emmy-nominated shows and specific networks, among other TV-related topics.",
      "Bargatze was joined by SNL cast members Mikey Day, Bowen Yang and James Austin Johnson.",
      "Follow along for live Emmys updates.",
      "Fans will likely remember Bargatze's 2023 portrayal of George Washington during SNL's 49th season in which America's first president shares his dreams for the future while at an army camp.",
      "In his \"speech\" to the troops, which include Day, Yang and Kenan Thompson, Bargatze decreed that the U.S. would forsake the easy-to-figure-out metric system for a weights and measures system complicated beyond compare, among other declarations.",
      "The memorable sketch has since racked up more than 25 million views on YouTube and become a fan favorite.",
      "Bargatze reprised the role of Washington for a SNL sequel in October 2024 for part two of \"Washington's Dream.\"",
      "In last year's sketch, the comedian could be found leading soldiers across the Delaware River in 1776 and deciding to do \"our own thing\" with the English language including spelling words \"different ways.\"",
      "\u201cAnd we will create our own foods and name them what we want, like the hamburger,\u201d Bargatze declared, to which Day responded, \u201cMade of ham, sir?\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it only were that simple,\" pondered Bargatze in the memorable skit.",
      "After opening the Emmys with the SNL throwback sketch, Stephen Colbert did a short monologue, followed by an opening monologue by Bargatze, in which the comedian announced he was donating $100,000 to the Boys & Girls Club of America depending how long Emmy speeches go."

      "LONDON \u2014 President Donald Trump enjoys spectacle, but this is not what Britain had in mind.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer fought to offer Trump a second state visit starting Wednesday \u2014 an unprecedented flourish meant to bolster Starmer\u2019s authority and flatter the American leader at a crucial moment for the United Kingdom and its allies.",
      "Instead, Trump will arrive in a fractious Britain to meet with political leaders beset by long-running discontent and royals navigating family feuds.",
      "Should he open the country's notorious tabloids, the president could survey the fallout from flag-waving far-right marchers in the streets, feverish speculation about the prime minister's position and a family summit over tea that sought to ease those royal tensions.",
      "The backdrop could hardly be worse for the carefully planned choreography of pomp and ceremony.",
      "The prime minister\u2019s hand-picked ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, was fired last week after revelations of his years-old correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender and financier.",
      "Appointing Mandelson was billed as a savvy move designed to curry favor with Trump, but it has instead detonated into the gravest crisis of Starmer\u2019s premiership so far \u2014 crystalizing bubbling frustrations with his yearlong tenure. Starmer\u2019s deputy, Angela Rayner, also resigned in September after admitting she underpaid property taxes.",
      "Starmer's approval ratings continue to plunge as far-right Reform UK, led by Trump ally Nigel Farage, capitalizes on the public discontent to pull ahead in some polls.",
      "This has all fueled growing whispers of a leadership contest \u2014 a remarkable reversal for a prime minister who won a huge majority just 15 months ago on a vow of stability.",
      "On the streets, the mood is darker still.",
      "A far-right march led by Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record, drew more than 100,000 people to the streets of the capital Saturday. Elon Musk, formerly Trump\u2019s right-hand man in the White House, called into the rally. He urged a \u201cdissolution of Parliament\u201d and told attendees that \"you either fight back or you die,\" in comments that were condemned by Starmer and others.",
      "While the politics look volatile, Trump's state visit will showcase an institution Britain has long turned to as a bastion of consistency and grandeur.",
      "Yet, his arrival at Windsor Castle on Wednesday, where King Charles III is expected to make a speech in honor of the president, comes at a time when the royals are also under renewed scrutiny.",
      "Prince Andrew is back in the headlines thanks to renewed coverage of Epstein, an unwelcome reminder of unresolved questions about his role. Meanwhile, the frenzied coverage of Prince Harry\u2019s tea with the king last week has resurfaced family tensions that led father and son to go almost two years without meeting.",
      "While Harry suggested Sunday that he wants to see his father more often, relations with his brother, Prince William, the heir to the throne, do not appear to have improved.",
      "Starmer had hoped that hosting a U.S. president \u2014 with all the King\u2019s Guards, red carpets and palace banquets that it will entail \u2014 would broadcast strength and competence.",
      "But Trump's visit, analysts say, may only amplify Britain\u2019s domestic turmoil, rather than mask it.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s administration tends to be very interested in the domestic politics of European countries,\u201d said Olivia O\u2019Sullivan, director of the UK in the World Programme at the London-based think tank Chatham House.",
      "For Starmer, there\u2019s \u201ca pretty challenging landscape at home and overseas,\u201d she told NBC News, and a likelihood that Trump may \u201csay something or address something outside of the carefully diplomatically choreographed statements and announcements.\u201d",
      "The prospect of a second state visit for Trump drew criticism, with opponents accusing Starmer of needlessly flattering a deeply polarizing figure in the U.K. A mass demonstration is planned on the first day of his trip, with a further protest planned near Windsor Castle.",
      "The risk, experts argue, is that Trump\u2019s presence could further weaken Starmer at home.",
      "\u201cTrump is so unpopular with most Brits that no one \u2014 not even Nigel Farage \u2014 is going to win many voters over by being seen close to him,\u201d said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.",
      "A recent poll found that 70% of Britons disliked Trump, and 44% thought his state visit should be canceled.",
      "While many on Britain\u2019s far right \u201clove Trump,\u201d he added, \u201can awful lot more Brits think he\u2019s either nuts or dangerous \u2014 or both \u2014 so anyone seen to be fanboying him will get short shrift.\u201d",
      "While Trump will no doubt get his desired display of grandeur when he lands in London, turmoil bubbles underneath."

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian children have been taken to over 200 different facilities across Russia, including locations where they have been subjected to forced \u201cre-education\u201d and military training in a clear violation of international law, according to new research.",
      "Eight different types of facilities, ranging from summer camps to religious sites to military academies stretching across the entire expanse of Russia, have been identified in the report from the Yale School of Public Health Humanitarian Research Lab published Tuesday.",
      "The study was initiated at Ukraine\u2019s request to better understand the full size of the network of facilities where children are held, to help them eventually return to their homeland, Nathaniel Raymond, the executive director of the research lab, said in a telephone interview Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that all the people involved in different ways to bring the kids back have the most accurate geospatial information possible, and this is it,\u201d he said.",
      "Using open-source intelligence, news reports and Russian government documents, as well as satellite imagery, the Yale report identified 210 different locations where children are taken. Some are brought to locations temporarily, while others are given Russian citizenship and coerced into forced adoption, the report says.",
      "At most sites, children go through \u201cre-education\u201d programs to enforce Russian patriotism, including lectures in Russian history and singing the national anthem, it adds.",
      "Others, particularly older children, have received military training at cadet academies and a military base, including \u201cdrone control and tactics training,\u201d and have participated in shooting and grenade-throwing competitions, according to the report.",
      "The researchers said they cannot verify if any of the children given military training were ever conscripted into the Russian military or were otherwise deployed in the war in Ukraine.",
      "Russia\u2019s children\u2019s rights commissioner, Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, and the country\u2019s foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s official \u201cBring Kids Back\u201d program, which partners the government with other countries and international organizations to return kids from Russia, has recorded nearly 20,000 cases of unlawful deportations and forced transfers of children.",
      "The new report does not estimate the number of children who have been held either temporarily or indefinitely in Russia. But Raymond said identifying the locations gives a better sense of the scale, comparing it to the carnival game of trying to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar.",
      "\u201cRight now, with this report, we volumetrically know as much as we\u2019re probably going to know how big the jar is, and the jar is gigantic,\u201d he said.",
      "The report builds on research that has helped support allegations of war crimes against Russian President Vladimir Putin issued by the International Criminal Court, which has issued an arrest warrant accusing him of overseeing the forced abductions and deportations. The ICC has also accused Lvova-Belova of committing similar crimes.",
      "The Kremlin has previously denied the allegations and said the warrants were \u201coutrageous.\u201d",
      "Ukraine has made the return of abducted children central to any talks with Russia to end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy raised the issue with President Donald Trump during a meeting at the White House last month, days after Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin in Alaska.",
      "Last week, Zelenskyy announced plans to hold a \u201chigh-level event\u201d on abducted children during the meeting of the U.N. General Assembly later this month.",
      "The research was hampered after State Department funding for the Conflict Observatory program, which Yale was part of, was cut by executive order by Trump. It has not been restored. All of the data would have been lost, but a contractor working on the project in Florida protectively kept a backup, according to Raymond.",
      "The lab\u2019s repository of data has been transferred to Europol, a European law enforcement agency.",
      "The researchers have also stopped directly sharing their findings with the ICC after the Trump administration-imposed sanctions on the court in February.",
      "Previously, Raymond said, the lab had cooperated with the ICC on investigations of allegations of war crimes committed in Ukraine on the basis of an agreement put in place during the Biden administration.",
      "Now, he said, researchers are operating under the assumption that the previous agreement is no longer valid. \u201cWe no longer believe that it is safe for us to attempt to share information with them, given the lack of clarity legally from the Trump administration,\u201d he said.",
      "However, a new bipartisan push in the Senate is underway to label Russia a state sponsor of terrorism unless it returns Ukrainian children taken during the war. Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; and Katie Britt, R-Ala., introduced a bill last week threatening to add both Russia and Belarus to the list, which currently includes only Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria."

      "The inquiry's conclusion is the strongest U.N. finding to date but the body is independent and does not officially speak for the U.N. The team was commissioned by the Human Rights Council, the U.N.\u2019s top human rights body.",
      "It said Israel has attacked \u201cprotected objects\u201d such as civilian homes and healthcare facilities, while targeting \u201ccivilians and other protected persons.\u201d It also accused Israel of severely mistreating detainees, carrying out forced displacement and environmental destruction, and blocking essential aid, water and supplies.",
      "The report cited an attack on Gaza\u2019s largest fertility clinic, which reportedly destroyed 4,000 embryos and 1,000 sperm samples and fertilized eggs, as a measure intended to prevent births.",
      "To meet the legal definition under the convention, it must also establish that any of the genocidal acts were committed with the intent to destroy a group in whole or in part.",
      "The commission concluded that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant had \u201cincited the commission of genocide.\u201d",
      "It cited Gallant\u2019s remarks in October 2023, after Hamas fighters attacked Israeli communities, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages.",
      "Gallant announced \u201ca complete siege\u201d of Gaza, declaring: \u201cNo electricity, no water, no food, no fuel. We are fighting human animals, and we act accordingly.\u201d",
      "Since then, Palestinian health officials say Israeli forces have killed nearly 65,000 people in Gaza, including thousands of children, while displacing most of the population and destroying or damaging much of its infrastructure.",
      "Addressing U.N. member states, the commission urged they employ \"all means reasonably available to them\" to prevent genocide in Gaza, and \"examine the involvement of officials\" mentioned in the report \"as those most responsible for international crimes\" in Gaza.",
      "Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry said on X that the report relies \u201centirely on Hamas falsehoods,\u201d adding it \u201ccategorically rejects this distorted and false report.\u201d",
      "The country's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, Daniel Meron, called the report \u201cscandalous\u201d and \u201cfake.\u201d",
      "\u201cIsrael categorically rejects the libelous rant,\" he said in a statement posted on X.",
      "It pointed to a study by Israel\u2019s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University that argued allegations of starvation, indiscriminate bombing, and deliberate civilian killings in Gaza lacked verifiable evidence.",
      "The ministry claimed the report \u201crefuted every single false claim regarding genocide.\u201d",
      "Several international rights groups and some Israeli NGOs have already accused Israel of committing genocide.",
      "Earlier this month, the International Association of Genocide Scholars passed a resolution saying the legal criteria had been met to establish that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Eighty-six percent of voting members backed the resolution.",
      "Meanwhile, the International Court of Justice is hearing a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of genocide; both Israel and the United States have rejected the accusation.",
      "While neither the commission nor the 47-member council it reports to can act against a country, the findings could be used by prosecutors at the International Criminal Court or the U.N.\u2019s International Court of Justice.",
      "There is an \u201caccumulated impact,\u201d said Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow with Chatham House\u2019s Middle East and North Africa Program. \"It isolates Israel further and further in the international arena. It legitimizes the isolation of Israel.\u201d",
      "Pointing to the intense new ground assault on Gaza City, he told NBC News that \u201cit\u2019s difficult to very much for a country to defend itself against when it continues like this.\u201d",
      "Israel \u201cwill end up as a pariah state\u201d under Netanyahu, he said.",
      "Netanyahu appeared to acknowledge the international backlash on Monday, saying Israel was facing a \"kind of isolation,\" and called on the country to become self-reliant.",
      "\u201cWe are Athens and Sparta, or perhaps Super-Sparta,\" he told The Jerusalem Post. \"We have no choice.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 More than 100,000 people descended on Britain\u2019s capital on Saturday for one of the country\u2019s largest far-right rallies in decades.",
      "The \u201cUnite the Kingdom\u201d rally was organized by Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record, and attended by billionaire Elon Musk via video link. Amid a sea of flag-waving and soccer-style chanting from large crowds that exceeded expectations, violent clashes with police led to dozens of arrests.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that Britain would \u201cnever surrender\u201d to far-right protesters and condemned attacks against police officers as well as the racist intimidation of minorities.",
      "The English flag \u201crepresents our diverse country,\u201d he said.",
      "But the march came amid a surge of nationalism in the U.K., with a far-right party topping the polls, and the murder of American conservative activist Charlie Kirk \u2014 an assassination Robinson used to mobilize support in the run-up to the event.",
      "Robinson \u2014 whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2014 has long inspired rallies of mostly white, mostly male followers campaigning against Islam and immigration.",
      "He billed Saturday's event as Britain\u2019s \u201clargest free speech festival.\u201d",
      "In a video link to the rally, billionaire Musk called for a change of government in Britain and railed against the \"woke mind virus\" and \"uncontrolled immigration.\"",
      "\u201cMy appeal is to British common sense, which is to look carefully around you and say: \u2018If this continues, what world will you be living in?\u2019\" said Musk, who has previously spoken out in support of Robinson and other far-right causes across the world. \u201cWhether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die, that\u2019s the truth, I think.\u201d",
      "His comments drew criticism from British opposition lawmaker Ed Davey, who urged politicians from all parties \"to condemn his deeply dangerous and irresponsible rhetoric.\"",
      "\"Britain must stand united against this clear attempt to undermine our democracy,\" he said on X.",
      "Saturday's demonstration saw \"disorder, violence directed at officers and 26 officers injured,\" London's police force said, adding that it had made 25 arrests.",
      "Police were \"assaulted with kicks and punches,\" and Unite the Kingdom demonstrators threw \"bottles, flares and other projectiles\" as they tried to enter a \u201csterile area\u201d created to separate them from a smaller counterprotest organized by Stand Up to Racism.",
      "Footage posted by the force showed police with riot shields pushing back a crowd of protesters.",
      "Robinson had told attendees not to wear masks, drink alcohol or be violent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a time for riots,\u201d he said in a video on X. \u201cIt\u2019s not a time for violence. It\u2019s a time where you come and you stand proudly for your country.\u201d",
      "The Metropolitan Police told NBC News they estimated there were 110,000 to 150,000 people in attendance at the Unite the Kingdom protest, \"significantly exceeding the estimates of organizers,\" and 5,000 at the counterdemonstration.",
      "British police had urged Muslim Londoners not to alter their plans, despite a record of \u201canti-Muslim rhetoric and incidents of offensive chanting by a minority at previous marches.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere have been some suggestions that Muslim Londoners should change their behavior this Saturday, including not coming into town,\u201d said Metropolitan Police Cmdr. Clair Haynes, who is in charge of the public order policing operation in London. \u201cThat is not our advice. Everyone should be able to feel safe traveling into and around London.\u201d",
      "With five Premier League soccer matches taking place in the capital the same day, more than 1,600 officers were deployed, police said.",
      "\u201cThe football lads are coming from everywhere,\u201d said Robinson, who was released from prison in May after being jailed for contempt of court in October.",
      "In a Thursday video to supporters about Kirk, who was fatally shot Wednesday while speaking at an event at a university in Utah, Robinson referred to \u201cthe bastard who has murdered him, or the organization, the corporation or the government it is that has killed him.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn honour of @charliekirk11 & in honour of freedom on the 13th we march,\u201d he wrote in a separate post on X.",
      "Hundreds of people gathered at a vigil in London on Friday night to mourn Kirk, 31, a father of two.",
      "Britain\u2019s far right has been emboldened as Reform UK, a party led by Trump ally Nigel Farage, tops the polls. Farage recently said he would deport 600,000 people if he wins the next election.",
      "In recent months, English flags have increasingly appeared on lampposts, crosswalks and apartment windows \u2014 seen by some as patriotism and by others as linked to soccer hooliganism and racism.",
      "A counterprotest was led by leftist lawmakers Zarah Sultana and Diane Abbott.",
      "Footage posted by the group on X showed hundreds of people gathered chanting, \u201cRefugees are welcome here.\u201d",
      "Nearly 900 people, many of them older than 60, were arrested under counterterrorism legislation at a London demonstration last weekend against the ban on the group Palestine Action.",
      "The British government banned Palestine Action \u2014 which describes itself as a direct action movement that uses disruptive methods \u2014 as a terrorist organization in July, putting it alongside Al Qaeda and ISIS. Membership or support is now a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison.",
      "That extends to acts such as wearing clothing, carrying items or holding placards that could reasonably be seen as showing affiliation with the group."

      "But this latest match, a group stage game at the Asia Cup, is especially fraught as it\u2019s the first time the two South Asian teams are meeting since their countries fought a deadly armed conflict in May.",
      "The four days of fighting were set off the previous month by a terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 26 people and which India said was carried out with Pakistan\u2019s support, which Pakistan denied.",
      "Coaches for both teams say players are focused on the cricket at the eight-team tournament, which India won last year. India was also supposed to be the site of this year\u2019s Asia Cup, but it was moved to the United Arab Emirates city of Dubai because of the recent India-Pakistan conflict."

      "The visit comes at a moment of high tension for the longtime allies following Israel\u2019s attempted assassination of Hamas leaders on Qatari soil earlier this week. Israel\u2019s strikes in the middle of peace negotiations to end the war in Gaza have outraged Qatar, a key mediator in the war, as well as other key U.S. allies in the region and the Trump administration has attempted to distance itself from the action.",

      "\u201cAttacking our territories while we were busy with negotiations has uncovered the intention of Israel. It is trying to undermine any prospect of peace.

      "\u201cAs for what you\u2019re seeing with the West Bank and the annexation, that\u2019s not a final thing,\u201d Rubio said at a news conference in September. \u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s being discussed among some elements of Israeli politics.\u201d",
      "In Israel this week, Rubio will discuss the U.S. \u201ccommitment to fight anti-Israel actions,\u201d including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism, and lawfare at the ICC and ICJ,\u201d the State Department announced.",
      "Rubio will then travel to the U.K., where he will meet with new U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper to discuss U.S.-U.K. \"cooperation on critical global challenges, including ending the Russia-Ukraine war, preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, ensuring release of all Hamas-held hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza, and competing with China.\u201d"

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Less than a week before he was killed, Charlie Kirk was in Asia spreading his conservative and anti-immigration message, making stops in South Korea and Japan, where he urged people to have more children and embrace religion.",
      "\u201cTheir country is totally under attack,\u201d he said of South Korea on his podcast this week after returning from his trip. \u201cThe same things that we have been fighting for here, whether it be lawfare in South Korea or mass migration in Japan \u2014 this is a worldwide phenomenon.\u201d",
      "There is a receptive audience for messages such as Kirk\u2019s in South Korea and Japan, both East Asian democracies and U.S. allies with highly monoethnic populations, falling birth rates and growing far-right movements.",
      "Anti-feminist backlash in South Korea, which ranks 101st out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s latest Global Gender Gap Report, was said to play a role in the 2022 presidential election victory of Yoon Suk Yeol. As Yoon faced impeachment over his December 2024 declaration of martial law, supporters who embraced his claims of election fraud and legal persecution adopted symbols and slogans associated with President Donald Trump.",
      "In Japan, government efforts to bring in more foreign labor in the face of an aging population have met with resistance, and last month there was public panic when misinformation about a new cultural exchange program suggested it would lead to a flood of immigrants from four countries in Africa.",
      "Kirk\u2019s first stop was in Seoul, where last Friday and Saturday he spoke at Build Up Korea, a conservative forum previously attended by Donald Trump Jr. and whose advisory board includes President Trump\u2019s adviser Alex Bruesewitz and Steve Bannon\u2019s daughter Maureen Bannon.",
      "\u201cThe phenomenon of young people, especially men, turning conservative is occurring simultaneously across multiple continents,\u201d said Kirk, 31, according to the South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo.",
      "\u201cIt is not unique to the U.S., which is why it deserves more attention. That is why I chose South Korea as my first Asian destination,\u201d said Kirk, a co-founder of Turning Point USA, a nonprofit group that promotes conservative political ideals to young people.",
