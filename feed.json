      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Marvel's first family stumbled in theaters in its second weekend, but still held on to the top spot at the box office.",
      "\u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d earned $40 million from 4,125 North American theaters, a 66% drop from a healthy $117.6 million debut. The film was accompanied by comedies \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d and \u201cThe Naked Gun\" in the top three box office rankings.",
      "The superhero movie dipped significantly more than Marvel's previous film, \u201cThunderbolts,\u201d which took a 55% dive in its second weekend.",
      "\u201cFirst Steps\u201d is the last major blockbuster of the summer. It added nearly $40 million internationally in its second weekend, bringing thefilm's global total to $369 million. The movie's box office drop off was surprising given its strong reviews, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore.",
      "Though the movie\u2019s debut weekend may have given box office results a strong push toward the $4 billion summer benchmark, August is off to a slow start, he said.",
      "\u201cIt's a tough lift, but we might be able to get there. It really means that all the films are gonna have to stand on their own,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be about getting great reviews, having that staying power, that longevity in the marketplace.\u201d",
      "Newcomer comedy \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d earned second place at the box office this weekend, with $22 million from 3,852 North American theaters. That was on par with projections and also in line with the first movie in the series, which brought in $23 million in 2022. Paramount\u2019s slapstick comedy, \u201cThe Naked Gun,\u201d also in its debut weekend, snagged the third box office spot, earning $17 million from 3,344 locations.",
      "Jim Orr, president of domestic distribution for Universal Pictures, said the solid debut for \u201cThe Bad Guys 2,\u201d coupled with strong audience reaction scores, \u201cshould point to a very long, very successful run through not only the rest of the summer, but really, I think into the fall.\"",
      "James Gunn's \u201cSuperman,\u201d which opened four weekends ago and already crossed $550 million globally, earned $13.8 million domestically this weekend, taking the fourth spot. \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d followed with $8.7 million.",
      "The horror movie \u201cTogether\u201d had a strong debut weekend, coming in at sixth place and earning $6.8 million domestically, proof that August is a month for edgier and off-beat films, Dergarabedian said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what this month is about. It\u2019s not just about box office,\" Dergarabedian said. \"It\u2019s also about providing really interesting, rewarding movie-going experiences for audiences.\u201d",
      "Dergarabedian said he expects highly-anticipated movies hitting theaters in the next few weeks \u2014 including \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d and Zach Cregger\u2019s horror movie \u201cWeapons\u201d \u2014 to give August a needed boost.",

      "Prosecutors say they will seek a prison sentence for music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs that is substantially higher than the four to five years they initially expected he might face under federal sentencing guidelines",
      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors said they now expect music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs could face a prison sentence \u201csubstantially higher\u201d than the four to five years they once thought he was likely to face after his conviction on two prostitution-related charges.",
      "They made the observation late Thursday in a Manhattan federal court written submission in which they also opposed Combs' request this week to be released on $50 million bail while he awaits an Oct. 3 sentencing.",
      "In early July, Combs, 55, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges carrying potential life prison terms but was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for arranging for girlfriends and male sex workers to travel to engage in sexual encounters that he filmed.",
      "Each prostitution-related charge carries a potential maximum 10 years in prison.",
      "Prosecutors said after the verdict that they thought federal sentencing guidelines meant to prevent wide disparities in sentencings for the same crimes would likely call for a prison term of four to five years. But they said Thursday they believe the guidelines range \u201cwill be substantially higher,\u201d raising the risk Combs will flee.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian will have wide latitude in determining a sentence and can choose to ignore the guidelines, which are not mandatory. Combs' lawyers have said they believe the guidelines, if properly calculated, will call for 21 to 27 months in prison.",
      "On the day of the verdict, prosecutors won a bail fight after defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo argued Combs should be freed immediately on bail.",
      "Subramanian denied the defense request, saying Combs had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a \u201clack of danger to any person or the community.\u201d But he said Agnifilo could renew the request.",
      "In doing so Tuesday, Agnifilo cited other cases he said were comparable to Combs' conviction in which defendants were granted bail. And he cited severe conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where Combs has been held since his September arrest at a New York hotel.",

      "Prosecutors said in their filing Thursday that Combs' conviction on the prostitution-related counts carried a mandatory requirement that he remain in jail prior to sentencing, unless he could prove exceptional circumstances, which they said he cannot.",
      "They said he should also remain in prison as a danger to the community, a claim that Agnifilo disputed in his papers.",
      "\u201cSean Combs will not be violent to anyone. As we said in court, this jury gave him his life back, and he will not squander his second chance at life, nor would he do anything to further jeopardize his seven children not having a father, and four of his children not having a parent at all,\u201d Agnifilo wrote earlier this week.",
      "Prosecutors also said conditions at the federal lockup had improved considerably before Combs was arrested. A federal judge in January 2024 had blasted conditions at the jail, including its extensive lockdowns and inadequate medical care.",
      "Prosecutors said cases cited by Agnifilo in which other defendants received bail were not comparable to the crimes Combs was convicted of carrying out, particularly because of his propensity for violence.",
      "\u201cThe defendant's extensive history of violence \u2014 and his continued attempt to minimize his recent violent conduct \u2014 demonstrates his dangerousness and that he is not amendable to supervision,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe defendant utterly fails to establish by clear and convincing evidence, as required, that he does not pose a danger to the community.\u201d",

      "Deen said her four restaurants outside Savannah will remain open. They're located in Nashville and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; and Branson, Missouri.",
      "Deen was divorced and nearly broke when she moved to Savannah with her boys in 1989 and started a catering business called The Bag Lady. She opened her first restaurant a few years later at a local Best Western hotel, then started The Lady & Sons in downtown Savannah in 1996.",

      "Her second husband, Gene Ward, died in December. In May, Seely revealed that she was in recovery after undergoing multiple back surgeries, two emergency procedures and spending 11 days in the ICU. She also suffered a bout of pneumonia.",
      "\u201cRehab is pretty tough, but each day is looking brighter and last night, I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. And it was neon, so I knew it was mine!\u201d she said in a statement at the time. \u201cThe unsinkable Seely is working her way back.\u201d",
      "Seely was born in July 1940, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, about two hours north of Pittsburgh and raised in nearby Townville. Her love of country music was instant; her mother sang, and her father played the banjo. When she was a child, she sang on local radio programs and performed on local television. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \u201cDon\u2019t Touch Me,\u201d the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",

Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones, and Little Jimmy Dickens.",
      "And Seely never stopped working in country music. Since 2018, she's hosted the weekly \u201cSunday\u2019s with Seely\u201d on Willie Nelson's Willie\u2019s Roadhouse SiriusXM channel. That same year, she was inducted into the Music City Walk of Fame.",

      "Netflix's animated musical film \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d has become the surprise hit of the summer",
      "NEW YORK -- In the colorful, animated, musical world of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d everyone is a fan. The general public rocks T-shirts supporting their favorite idols. They hold light sticks and stare starry-eyed at stadium stages; they scream, they cry, they cheer, they buy the merch.",
      "It shouldn't come as much of a surprise, then, that the Sony Pictures/ Netflix film itself has inspired similar fanfare, having topped the streamer\u2019s global rankings. Fans have flooded the internet with art, covers, cosplay and choreography in response to the movie, which follows the fictional K-pop girl group HUNTR/X as they fight demons.",
      "And it's not just the film that's a summer hit. The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack has topped the charts \u2014 debuting at No. 1 on Billboard's Soundtracks chart and No. 8 on the all-genre Billboard 200.",
      "Here's how \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d became the year's surprising success story.",
      "The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack utilizes some of the best and brightest in the genre. That included a partnership with K-pop company The Black Label, co-founded by super producer Teddy Park, known for his work with YG, Blackpink and 2NE1 \u2014 empowered girl groups used as references for the film\u2019s protagonists, the trio HUNTR/X.",
      "It's one of the many reasons the musical film's soundtrack stands on its own. Filmmakers \u201creally did their homework,\u201d says Jeff Benjamin, a music journalist who specializes in K-pop.",
      "Indeed, they did a lot of research. One of the film\u2019s directors, Maggie Kang, said that her team prioritized \u201crepresenting the fandom and the idols in a very specific way,\u201d as to not disappoint K-pop fans.",
      "They pulled from a treasure trove of influences heard at every corner: The fictional, rival boy band Saja Boys\u2019 hit song \u201cSoda Pop,\u201d for example, references the \u201990s K-pop group H.O.T.",
      "And it has worked. \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is the highest charting soundtrack of 2025, with eight of its songs landing on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked at No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200. To put that in perspective: Lorde's \u201cVirgin\u201d and Justin Bieber's \u201cSwag\u201d did the same.",
      "In some ways, it recalls Disney's \u201cEncanto,\u201d which topped the Billboard 200 and produced a No. 1 hit, \u201cWe Don't Talk About Bruno \u201d in 2022. Similarly, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d embraces \u201cthe original soundtrack, which is a lost art form,\u201d adds Benjamin.",
      "Tamar Herman, a music journalist and author of the \u201cNotes on K-pop\u201d newsletter, says the movie succeeds because it embraces animated musical tradition and authentic K-pop music production styles in equal measure. She considers \u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d to be \u201ca musical with songs inspired by K-pop,\u201d not unlike a Jukebox musical, where the songs of ABBA are reimagined for \u201cMamma Mia.\u201d",
      "The novelty of the film, too, seems to be resonating. Where many animated films rely on adapting existing intellectual property, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is original. And it comes from an original perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely Korean, it\u2019s not completely Western and it\u2019s kind of right in that middle,\u201d says Kang. \u201cIt\u2019s like not pulled from one side; it\u2019s kind of flavors of both. So, I think that\u2019s what makes the movie feels a little different.\u201d",
      "And \u201cthe core story is what\u2019s drawing everybody in,\u201d says Kang.",
      "San Francisco-based cosplayer and content creator Nanci Alc\u00e1ntar, who goes by Naanny Lee online agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a K-pop group, but it also tells a story of their journey, of how they transform into powerful warriors,\u201d said Alc\u00e1ntar in Spanish. For her, it goes beyond K-pop \u2014 it\u2019s about the narrative.",
      "Kang\u2019s approach to cultural authenticity, too, may have contributed to the film\u2019s crossover appeal. Rather than explaining Korean elements like HUNTR/X\u2019s visit to a traditional medicine clinic or translating K-pop light stick culture for Western audiences, she opted for full immersion. \u201cWe just wanted everybody to just accept that they were in Korea,\u201d Kang said.",
      "The director said this method of \u201cthrowing people into the deep end of a culture\u201d breaks down barriers better than heavy-handed explanation. \u201cWe just wanted to keep everything feeling normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you don\u2019t shine a light on it, it just becomes more easily accepted.\u201d",

      "Herman compares the movie to another Sony animation: \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,\u201d which also attracted a broad audience with its creative animation. \u201cAnd it's a fun, animated musical, which we haven't had in a while,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s campy, it's engaging, it's universal.\u201d",
      "Santiago was initially skeptical of the title \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like with big companies they kind of like to use K-pop as a bait. They kind of like to take advantage of K-pop fans\u2019 sincerity,\u201d said Santiago. \u201cBut I felt like with this one, it was such like kind of a love letter to K-pop fans.\u201d",
      "Indeed \u2014 if the film wasn't authentic to K-pop fans' experience, or mocked them, it is unlikely to have become so popular, says Benjamin. Instead, there are Easter eggs for the dedicated K-pop listener.",

      "Met General Manager Peter Gelb had demanded that she repudiate Putin shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, but she refused and was withdrawn from three Met productions. The Met replaced her with Ukrainian soprano Liudmyla Monastyrska in at least one of those productions.",

      "NEW YORK -- For Buddy Guy \u2014 a stalwart and staunch defender of the blues \u2014 there's nothing more important than keeping his chosen genre at the forefront of conversation. It comes naturally: Guy is one of America's greatest guitar players, a singular artist with a thick roster of A-list super fans \u2014 Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Gary Clark Jr. among them.",
      "The list also includes innovative writer and director Ryan Coogler, who tapped Guy for his critically acclaimed film \u201cSinners\u201d earlier this year, and artists like Peter Frampton and the Eagles' Joe Walsh, who feature on his new album \u201cAin't Done with the Blues.\u201d It releases Wednesday, on Guy's 89th birthday.",
      "For the eight-time Grammy Award-winning musician, those recognitions aren't priority. The longevity of the music that made his life is his primary concern. \u201cLike I promised B.B. King, Muddy Waters and all of them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press over the phone, \u201cI do the best I can to keep the blues alive.\u201d",
      "He's concerned that radio stations no longer play the blues, and that the genre might miss out on connecting with younger listeners. It's one of the reasons \u201cAin't Done with the Blues\u201d is a strong collection of classics that run the risk of being forgotten \u2014 like on the album closer \u201cTalk to Your Daughter,\u201d a rendition of the J.B. Lenoir tune.",
      "In Guy's performance, there's an undeniable universality. \u201cBlues is based on everyday life,\u201d he says. \u201cA good time or a bad time.\u201d",
      "Or, another way Guy explains it: \u201cMusic is like a bowl of real good gumbo. They got all kinds of meat in there. You got chicken in there, you got sausage in there. You got a seafood in it. ... When we play music, we put everything in there.\u201d",
      "It's resonating. In its 2025 midyear report, Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, found that U.S. on-demand audio streams of blues music has climbed this year due to the success of \u201cSinners.\u201d",

      "Rene\u00e9 Rapp's second album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d gave the 25-year-old multi-hyphenate an outlet to work through the whirlwind that has been her career so far",
      "NEW YORK -- Rene\u00e9 Rapp was clear on her intentions for her sophomore album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d from the start.",
      "\u201cI wanted to love this,\u201d Rapp says. \u201cI wanted to be able to walk away from this and be so proud of myself and impressed, no matter what anybody else thought.\u201d Her first album, 2023's \u201cSnow Angel, \u201d  had been an experiment in figuring out her sound (a mix of pop, R&B and heart-wrenching ballads), and assembling a collection of songs that worked together. This album, out Friday, offered the chance to do it again, with an eye toward the way her life had changed in the intervening years.",
      "\u201cThat intention, and also wanting to prove it to myself, was really grueling,\u201d Rapp told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd also really fun.\u201d",
      "The writing process gave Rapp, 25, an outlet to work through the burnout-inducing whirlwind that was her career in those two years. Uncharacteristically restrained in its vocal styling, the album's lead single, \u201cLeave Me Alone,\u201d is strikingly open \u2014 clever zingers allude to her departure from HBO\u2019s \u201cSex Lives of College Girls,\u201d the media frenzy that surrounded her turn as Regina in the 2024 remake of \u201cMean Girls,\u201d and the external pressure she felt to put out more music after the positive reception of \u201cSnow Angel.\u201d Basically, anything that's been said about her in the last few years? She reframes it, poking fun at her reputation and the industry.",
      "\u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d felt like a proper introduction to the album, Rapp says, and \u201cBite Me\u201d \u2014 both a warning and a tease \u2014 the appropriate title. Paris Hilton and Monica Lewinsky were among the famous faces that teased the album upon its announcement, donning merch emblazoned with the title in bold print. Rapp herself posed in front of a newsstand filled with mock tabloids depicting her as a diva, concealed behind big sunglasses and a fur coat, to promote the second single, \u201cMad.\u201d (\u201cThat's a Rapp!\u201d the headline read.)",
      "\u201cIt really feels just like a time capsule of those two years of my life, a lot having to do with the business and the industry and people\u2019s expectations of me,\u201d Rapp says of the album. \u201cAnd then also me wanting things for myself and being confused where those two roads diverge.\u201d",
      "Rapp's confidence and humor is evident across the album, just as it is on stage \u2014 \u201cI write lyrics in the way that I talk,\u201d she says. Many of the tracks tackle the destabilizing emotions that accompany the beginning and end of relationships, whether platonic or romantic, and how her now-very public career has amplified the challenges of creating, and maintaining, those connections.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so surrounded all the time, but I feel so lonely, and it feels really heavy and isolating. And I think a lot of that is just being an artist. And I also think a lot of that is just like the nature of like the business, for better or for worse,\" she says. The can't-be-bothered attitude heard on \u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d is countered by the ache of \u201cThat's So Funny,\u201d which recounts the end of a deeply affecting, but ultimately toxic friendship in Rapp's signature soaring vocals.",

      "As she readies for fans to hear the album, she hopes it offers them some reprieve. \u201cI hope that the weight of the world doesn\u2019t feel as massive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy to obsess over everything and be constantly lost in your head.\u201d",
      "Giving them a glimpse into hers, she hopes, is empowering \u2014 and fun: \u201cIt\u2019s just, it feels like a big party that like everybody wants in on.\u201d",

      "U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.",
      "It has. The question now is whether some of the public reactions the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.",
      "Titled \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to \u201cwoke\u201d American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",
      "Some critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits.",
      "Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the criticism could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the \u201cgenes\u201d pun.",
      "\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEither one of the three aren\u2019t good.\u201d",
      "Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message.",
      "\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.",
      "American Eagle didn't respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier.",
      "A day after Sweeney was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday.",
      "Like many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce.",
      "Adamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, \u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\u201d Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields' age.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same playbook: a very hot model saying provocative things shot in an interesting way,\u201d Adamson said.",
      "Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told industry news website Retail Brew last week that \u201cSydney is the biggest get in the history of American Eagle,\u201d and the company would promote the partnership in a way that matched.",
      "The campaign features videos of Sweeney wearing slouchy jeans in various settings. She will appear on 3-D billboards in Times Square and elsewhere, speaking to users on Snapchat and Instagram, and in an AI-enabled try-on feature.",
      "American Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a nonprofit crisis counseling service.",
      "In a news release, the company noted \u201cSweeney\u2019s girl next door charm and main character energy \u2013 paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously \u2013 is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.\u201d",
      "In one video, Sweeney walks toward an American Eagle billboard of her and the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney has great genes.\u201d She crosses out \u201cgenes\u201d and replaces it with \u201cjeans.\u201d",

      "But what critics found the most troubling was a teaser video in which Sweeney says, \u201cGenes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.\u201d",
      "The video appeared on American Eagle\u2019s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the campaign.",
      "While remarking that someone has good genes is sometimes used as a compliment, the phrase also has sinister connotations. Eugenics gained popularity in early 20th century America, and Nazi Germany embraced it to carry out Adolf Hitler\u2019s plan for an Aryan master race.",
      "Civil rights activists have noted signs of eugenics regaining a foothold through the far right's promotion of the \u201cgreat replacement theory,\u201d a racist ideology that alleges a conspiracy to diminish the influence of white people.",
      "Shalini Shankar, a cultural and linguistic anthropologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, said she had problems with American Eagle's \u201cgenes\u201d versus \u201cjeans\u201d because it exacerbates a limited concept of beauty.",
      "\u201cAmerican Eagle, I guess, wants to rebrand itself for a particular kind of white privileged American,\u201d Shankar said. \u201cAnd that is the kind of aspirational image they want to circulate for people who want to wear their denim.\u201d",
      "Many critics compared the American Eagle ad to a misstep by Pepsi in 2017, when it released a TV ad that showed model Kendall Jenner offer a can of soda to a police officer while ostensibly stepping away from a photo shoot to join a crowd of protesters.",
      "Viewers mocked the spot for appearing to trivialize protests of police killings of Black people. Pepsi apologized and pulled the ad.",
      "The demonstrations that followed the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis pushed many U.S. companies to make their advertising better reflect consumers of all races.",

      "Jazmin Burrell, founder of brand consulting agency Lizzie Della Creative Strategies, said she's noticed while shopping with her cousin more ads and signs that prominently feature white models.",
      "\u201cI can see us going back to a world where diversity is not really the standard expectation in advertising,\u201d Burrell said.",
      "American Eagle has been praised for diverse marketing in the past, including creating a denim hijab in 2017 and offering its Aerie lingerie brand in a wide range of sizes. A year ago, the company released a limited edition denim collection with tennis star Coco Gauff.",
      "The retailer has an ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion program that is primarily geared toward employees. Two days before announcing the Sweeney campaign, American Eagle named the latest recipients of its scholarship award for employees who are driving anti-racism, equality and social justice initiatives.",
      "Marketing experts offer mixed opinions on whether the attention surrounding \u201cgood jeans\u201d will be good for business.",
      "\u201cThey were probably thinking that this is going to be their moment,\" Myles Worthington, the founder and CEO of marketing and creative agency WORTHI. \"But this is doing the opposite and deeply distorting their brand.\"",
      "Melissa Murphy, a marketing professor at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Tepper School of Business, said she liked certain parts of the campaign but hoped it would be expanded to showcase people besides Sweeney for the \u201csake of the brand.\u201d",
      "Other experts say the buzz is good even if it's not uniformly positive.",
      "\u201cIf you try to follow all the rules, you\u2019ll make lots of people happy, but you\u2019ll fail,\u201d Adamson said. \u201cThe rocket won\u2019t take off. \u201d",

      "A group of more than 20 states are suing the Trump administration over efforts to cut Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- More than 20 mostly Democratic-led states sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its efforts to cut Medicaid payments to the nation's largest abortion provider \u2014 Planned Parenthood.",
      "The move comes in response to the package of tax breaks and spending cuts Trump signed earlier this month. A portion of the new cuts are focused on services such as cancer screenings and tests, birth control and treatment for sexually transmitted infections \u2014 by ending Medicaid reimbursements for a year for major providers of family planning services.",
      "The cuts apply to groups that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023. The goal was to target Planned Parenthood, but the legislation also affected a major medical provider in Maine.",
      "California, New York, Connecticut, other states and Washington, D.C. argue in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts that the provision's language is unclear about which groups it applies to. They also say it retaliates against Planned Parenthood for advocating for abortion access, violating the free speech clause of the First Amendment.",
      "The states are asking that the portion of the law be blocked and deemed unconstitutional.",
      "The cuts threaten health care access for many low-income Americans, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference.",
      "\u201cThis attack isn't just about abortion,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cIt's about denying vulnerable communities access to care they rely on every day.\u201d",

      "Maine Family Planning, which operates 18 clinics offering a range of services across the state, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America filed separate lawsuits earlier this year challenging the cuts. Planned Parenthood said although it is not specifically named in the law, the provision was meant to affect its nearly 600 centers in 48 states. About a third of those clinics risk closure because of the legislation, which would strip care from more than 1 million patients, the group argues.",

      "DETROIT -- The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s plan this week to relax rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions is the latest Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric.",
      "As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA on Tuesday said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. That would cripple the legal basis for limiting emissions from things like power plants and motor vehicles.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.",
      "The tax law approved in early July also includes another provision that will hit Tesla and other EV makers in the pocketbook \u2014 repealing fines for automakers that don\u2019t meet federal fuel economy standards.",
      "Automakers can buy credits under a trading program if they don\u2019t meet the mileage standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don\u2019t rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers. The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.",
      "That is all set to go away under the new law.",
      "Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California\u2019s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales.",
      "It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles. And that's significant because transportation \u2014 which also includes ships, trains and planes \u2014 is the sector that contributes the most to planet-warming emissions in the U.S.",
      "Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation\u2019s vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. EVs do not use gasoline or emit greenhouse gases.",
      "The Trump administration and the auto industry have said both rules were unreasonable for manufacturers.",
      "Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 \u2014 they're currently at about 8% \u2014 along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon.",
      "The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035.",
      "But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden\u2019s inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. NHTSA will likely reset or significantly weaken them.",
      "Then there are the fines that automakers will no longer face for falling short on the fuel economy rules.",
      "\u201cWith the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, new penalties for automakers not complying with an illegal fuel economy standard designed to push EVs will be zero,\u201d NHTSA spokesman Sean Rushton said in a statement.",
      "Some legacy automakers have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties for not meeting them. Just last year, Jeep-maker Stellantis paid $190.7 million for model years 2019 and 2020, and General Motors paid $128.2 million for the 2016 and 2017 model years.",

      "The agency wrote to carmakers earlier this month informing them the penalties wouldn\u2019t be issued from the model year 2022 onward. Some automakers confirmed receiving the letter but declined to comment further.",
      "Experts say without them, the law \u201cinvites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a \u201cstunning decision\u201d for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. She said it amounted to a windfall for companies that chose to pay penalties rather than produce more efficient cars.",
      "Carlson said backing away from future fines also \u201cposes a dilemma for auto manufacturers who may feel bound to comply with the law, even if there is not a financial consequence for failing to do so.\u201d",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traditionally releases the vaccination coverage data in its flagship publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. CDC officials usually speak to the trends and possible explanations, and stress the importance of vaccinations. This year, the agency quietly posted the data online and \u2014 when asked about it \u2014 emailed a statement.",
      "\u201cThe decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Parents should consult their health care providers on options for their families,\u201d the statement said, adding; \u201cVaccination remains the most effective way to protect children from serious diseases like measles and whooping cough, which can lead to hospitalization and long-term health complications.\u201d",
      "The wording is more ambivalent about the importance of vaccinations than in the past. That is in keeping with communications from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before President Donald Trump put him in charge of federal health agencies.",
      "O'Leary noted the changes in the CDC messaging, which places personal choice before community protection.",

      "For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to school attendance mandates that required key vaccinations. All U.S. states and territories require that children attending child care centers and schools be vaccinated against a number of diseases, including, measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, whooping cough and chickenpox.",
      "All states allow exemptions for children with medical conditions that prevent them from receiving certain vaccines. And most also permit exemptions for religious or other nonmedical reasons.",
      "In the last decade, the percentage of kindergartners with medical exemptions has held steady, at about 0.2%. But the percentage with nonmedical exemptions has risen.",
      "The rates can be influenced by policies that make it harder or easier to obtain exemptions, and by local attitudes among families and doctors about the need to get children vaccinated. Online misinformation and the political divide that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines have led more parents to question routine childhood vaccinations, experts say.",
      "According to the CDC data, 15.4% of kindergartners had an exemption to one or more vaccines in Idaho in the last school year. But fewer than 0.5% did in Connecticut.",
      "It\u2019s good news that the vast majority of parents continue to get their kids vaccinated, O\u2019Leary said. And it\u2019s noteworthy that there is a gap between the percentage vaccinated and the percentage who are exempted \u2014 meaning there likely are unmet access issues, he added.",

      "West Virginia is banning seven artificial dyes from school meals before the start of class",
      "When school starts in West Virginia next month, 240,000 students in districts large and small will notice something missing from their cafeteria trays.",
      "Gone will be red Jell-O fruit cups, yogurt topped with brightly hued sprinkles and Cool Ranch Doritos \u2014 all foods made with synthetic dyes.",
      "In their place will be foods that contain colors made only from natural sources \u2014 such as vegetables, spices and seeds \u2014 after West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a sweeping new law in March banning seven artificial dyes from school meals.",
      "Other states have enacted similar laws that would strip artificial dyes from school meals, but West Virginia\u2019s action is the first to take effect, starting Aug. 1. It triggered a four-month sprint that that left state and local nutrition directors reeling.",
      "\u201cI think the initial reaction was like, \u2018Wow, what are we going to do?\u2019\" said Tony Crago, director of child nutrition for the West Virginia Department of Education. \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d",
      "Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3.",
      "\u201cWhen it went into law, it was shocking,\u201d said Diane Miller, who leads child nutrition and food services for Kanawha County Schools in the state\u2019s central region. \u201cWe began to realize that these dyes were in much more than just your cereals.\u201d",
      "West Virginia's ban on synthetic dyes was cheered by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has successfully pressured food makers to agree to remove artificial colors from their products. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028.",
      "The move is aimed at halting potential health effects from the dyes, which have been linked to neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. It's part of a larger focus on limiting artificial ingredients in food, Morrisey said in March.",
      "\u201cBy eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we\u2019re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges,\u201d he said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of the dyes, citing mixed evidence of potential harm. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said the color additives are safe when \u201cused properly,\u201d in the amounts and products approved by the agency. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, \u201cbut some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.\u201d",
      "More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects.",
      "\u201cWhen you get rid of petroleum-based dyes, kids aren't gonna all suddenly be healthy,\u201d Makary said on a recent podcast. \u201cWe're not going to address the fact that 30% of our nation's kids have prediabetes by simply removing petroleum-based food dyes. But these are steps in the right direction.\u201d",
      "Nutrition experts agree that removing artificial colors from foods doesn\u2019t address the main drivers of America\u2019s chronic health problems. Those stem largely from ingredients such as added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.",

      "Some suppliers had already removed artificial dyes from some school foods, swapping them for products colored with beet juice or turmeric, said Hollie Best, food service director for Wood County Schools in Parkersburg, which has 11,000 children in 27 schools. Overall, Best said she removed just five foods from her menus.",
      "General Mills said 98% of its products for schools were already made without the banned colors. The company \u201cwill be compliant\u201d with West Virginia's law immediately and plans to remove the dyes from school foods nationwide by next summer, said Mollie Wulff, a company spokesperson.",
      "In Miller\u2019s district, with 23,000 students in 67 schools, the new law affects about 10% of the foods served, she estimated. She expected some foods to contain artificial colors, like strawberry milk and Pop-Tarts. Others were surprising, such as pickles, salad dressing and certain snack chips.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, \u2018Oh my gosh, no more Doritos?'\" Miller said. The popular Cool Ranch flavor contains dyes Red 40, Blue 1 and Yellow 5.",

      "\u201cBecause the last thing we need them to do is to choose not to participate in our school lunch program,\u201d she said, adding that schools provide many students their healthiest meals of the day.",
      "Parents of children with sensitivities or allergies to artificial dyes had already raised concerns, according to school food directors. But for others, the presence of synthetic colors in school meals hasn\u2019t been an issue. Chris DeRico, nutrition director of Barbour County Schools, with 2,000 students, said few parents seemed worried about dyes.",
      "\u201cThey'd be in the minority, I believe,\" he said. \u201cIn rural West Virginia, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really on radar screens.\u201d",

      "Asked whether she likes school lunches in general, the incoming fourth-grader echoed the sentiments of picky kids everywhere: \u201cSometimes I don't, sometimes I do. It just depends on what it is.\u201d",

      "It was called a \u201cbaby parade.\u201d",
      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\u201d said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don\u2019t have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies\u2019 lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breast feeding supplies and baby clothes but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She\u2019s heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade Friday.",

      "That was clear, they said, during the new panel's first meeting, in June.

      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Abdur Rahman Tarif was talking to his sister Meherunnesa over the phone when the voice on the other end of the call suddenly fell silent.",
      "In that moment, Tarif knew something bad had happened. He rushed home, dodging the exchange of fire between security forces and protesters on the streets of Dhaka. When he finally arrived, he discovered his parents tending to his bleeding sister.",

Three days later, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus took over the country as head of an interim government, promising to restore order and hold a new election after necessary reforms.",

But despite the bloodshed and lives lost, many say the prospect for a better Bangladesh with a liberal democracy, political tolerance and religious and communal harmony has remained a challenge.",

      "Bangladesh's anti-government movement exacted a heavy price. Hundreds of people, mostly students, were killed in violent protests. Angry demonstrators torched police stations and government buildings. Political opponents often clashed with each other, sometimes leading to gruesome killings.",
      "Like many Bangladeshis, Tarif and his sister took part in the uprising, hoping for a broader political change, particularly after when one of their cousins was shot and killed by security forces.",
      "\"We could not stay home and wanted Sheikh Hasina to go,\u201d 20-year-old Tarif said. \u201cUltimately we wanted a country without any discrimination and injustice.\u201d",

      "Bickering political parties have failed to reach a consensus on a timetable and process for elections. Mob violence, political attacks on rival parties and groups, and hostility to women\u2019s rights and vulnerable minority groups by religious hardliners have all surged.",
      "Some of the fear and repression that marked Hasina\u2019s rule, and abuses such as widespread enforced disappearances, appear to have ended, rights groups say. However, they accuse the new government of using arbitrary detention to target perceived political opponents, especially Hasina\u2019s supporters, many of whom have been forced to go into hiding.",

      "The hospital was in the path of the blast and was heavily damaged. He found his daughter lying on the floor as her colleagues tried to revive her. They weren't able to save her. She was one of four medical staff killed there.",
      "\u201cI started telling God that living for 60 years is more than enough. If you're going to take someone from the family, take me and leave her alive,\u201d he told The Associated Press from his home in Bsalim, some 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) away from the port. He sat in a corner where he put up portraits of Jessica next to burning incense to honor her.",

      "The Aug. 4, 2020 blast in Beirut\u2019s port tore through the Lebanese capital after hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in a warehouse. The gigantic explosion killed at least 218 people, according to an AP count, wounded more than 6,000 others and devastated large swathes of Beirut, causing billions of dollars in damages.",
      "It further angered the nation, already in economic free-fall after decades of corruption and financial crimes. Many family members of the victims pinned their hopes on Judge Tarek Bitar, who was tasked with investigating the explosion. The maverick judge shook the country\u2019s ruling elite, pursuing top officials, who for years obstructed his investigation.",
      "But five years after the blast, no official has been convicted as the probe stalled. And the widespread rage over the explosion and years of apparent negligence from a web of political, security and judicial officials has faded as Lebanon's economy further crumbled and conflict rocked the country.",
      "Judge Bitar had aimed to release the indictment last year but it was stalled by months of war between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group that decimated large swaths of southern and eastern Lebanon, killing some 4,000 people.",
      "In early 2025, Lebanon elected President Joseph Aoun, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and a Cabinet that came to power on reformist platforms. They vowed that completing the port probe and holding the perpetrators to account would be a priority.",
      "\u201cThere will be no settlement in the port case before there is accountability,\u201d Salam said Sunday.",
      "Bitar, apparently galvanized by these developments, summoned a handful of senior political and security officials in July, as well as three judges in a new push for the case, but was unable to release an indictment over the summer as had been widely expected.",
      "However, the judge has been working on an additional phase of his investigation \u2014 now some 1,200 pages in length \u2014 aiming for the indictment to be out by the end of the year, according to four judicial officials and two security officials. They all spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "Before completing his own report, he is waiting to receive a fourth and final report from France, which has conducted its own probe into the blast given that several of those killed are citizens of the European country. Bitar since 2021 had received three technical reports, while the fourth will be the French investigation's conclusion, which also looks at the cause of the explosion, the officials added.",

      "The port and the surrounding Beirut neighborhoods that were leveled in the deadly blast appear functional again, but there are still scars. The most visible are what\u2019s left standing of the mammoth grain silos at the port, which withstood the force of the blast but later partly collapsed in 2022 after a series of fires. Culture Minister Ghassan Salameh Sunday classified them as historical monuments.",
      "There was no centralized effort by the cash-strapped Lebanese government to rebuild the surrounding neighborhoods. An initiative by the World Bank, Europe and United Nations to fund recovery projects was slow to kick off, while larger reconstruction projects were contingent on reforms that never came.",
      "Many family and business owners fixed their damaged property out of pocket or reached out to charities and grassroots initiatives.",

However, humanitarian conditions remain dire, and residents of Sweida have called for the road into the city to be fully opened, saying the aid that has come in is not enough.",
      "The clashes that displaced tens of thousands of people came after months of tensions between Damascus and Sweida.

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia.",
      "\u201cChina will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,\u201d China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff.",
      "\u201cCoercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.",
      "The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable \u2014 after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.",

      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Donald Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \u201cRealizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\u201d for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",

WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Trump, Kennedy said.",

      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \u201cstrategic solidarity\u201d with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\u201cBeijing simply can\u2019t afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The vast majority of U.S. adults are at least somewhat stressed about the cost of groceries, a new poll finds, as prices continue to rise and concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs remain widespread.",
      "About half of all Americans say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress in their life right now, while 33% say it's a \u201cminor\u201d source of stress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only 14% say it's not a source of stress, underscoring the pervasive anxiety most Americans continue to feel about the cost of everyday essentials.",
      "Other financial stressors \u2014 like the cost of housing or the amount of money in their bank accounts \u2014 are also broadly felt, but they weigh more heavily on younger Americans, who are less likely than older adults to have significant savings or own property.",
      "The survey also found that about 4 in 10 Americans under age 45 say they've used what are known as \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d services when spending on entertainment or restaurant meals or when paying for essentials like groceries or medical care.",
      "Adam Bush, 19, based in Portland, New York, is one of those younger Americans who has used pay-later services for things like groceries or entertainment. Bush works as a welder, fabricating parts for trucks for Toyota, and makes under $50,000 per year.",

While Americans over age 60 are less likely than younger people to feel major financial anxiety about housing, their savings, child care, or credit card debt, they are just as worried about the cost of groceries.",
      "Esther Bland, 78, who lives in Buckley, Washington, said groceries are a \u201cminor\u201d source of stress \u2014 but only because her local food banks fill the gap. Bland relies on her Social Security and disability payments each month to cover her rent and other expenses \u2014 such as veterinary care for her dogs \u2014 in retirement, after decades working in an office processing product orders.",
      "\u201cI have no savings,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm not sure what's going on politically when it comes to the food banks, but if I lost that, groceries would absolutely be a major source of stress.\u201d",

      "\u201cSoap, paper towels, toilet paper. I buy gas at Costco, but we haven't seen $3 a gallon here in a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cI stay home a lot. I only put about 50 miles on my car a week.\u201d",
      "According to the poll, 64% of the lowest-income Americans \u2014 those who have a household income of less than $30,000 a year \u2014 say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d stressor. That's compared with about 4 in 10 Americans who have a household income of $100,000 or more.",
      "But even within that higher-income group, only about 2 in 10 say grocery costs aren't a worry at all.",
      "Housing is another substantial source of worry for U.S. adults \u2014 along with their savings, their income and the cost of health care. About half of U.S. adults say housing is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, according to the poll, while about 4 in 10 say that about the amount of money they get paid, the amount of money they have saved and the cost of health care.",

      "But some groups are feeling much more anxiety about their finances than others. Women, for instance, are more likely than men to report high levels of stress about their income, savings, the cost of groceries and the cost of health care. Hispanic adults are also particularly concerned about housing costs and both credit card and student debt.

      "The Culinary Workers Union representing 60,000 hospitality workers in Nevada has achieved a historic victory on the Las Vegas Strip",
      "LAS VEGAS -- When Susana Pacheco accepted a housekeeping job at a casino on the Las Vegas Strip 16 years ago, she believed it was a step toward stability for her and her 2-year-old daughter.",
      "But the single mom found herself exhausted, falling behind on bills and without access to stable health insurance, caught in a cycle of low pay and little support. For years, she said, there was no safety net in sight \u2014 until now.",
      "For 25 years, her employer, the Venetian, had resisted organizing efforts as one of the last holdouts on the Strip, locked in a prolonged standoff with the Culinary Workers Union. But a recent change in ownership opened the Venetian\u2019s doors to union representation just as the Strip\u2019s newest casino, the Fontainebleau, was also inking its first labor contract.",
      "The historic deals finalized late last year mark a major turning point: For the first time in the Culinary Union's 90-year history, all major casinos on the Strip are unionized. Backed by 60,000 members, most of them in Las Vegas, it is the largest labor union in Nevada. Experts say the Culinary Union\u2019s success is a notable exception in a national landscape where union membership overall is declining.",
      "\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve shown that change can be a positive force, and I\u2019m confident that this partnership will continue to benefit us all in the years to come,\" Patrick Nichols, president and CEO of the Venetian, said shortly after workers approved the deal.",
      "Pacheco says their new contract has already reshaped her day-to-day life. The housekeeper no longer races against the clock to clean an unmanageable number of hotel suites, and she\u2019s spending more quality time with her children because of the better pay and guaranteed days off.",
      "\u201cNow with the union, we have a voice,\u201d Pacheco said.",
      "These gains come at a time when union membership nationally is at an all-time low, and despite Republican-led efforts over the years to curb union power. About 10% of U.S. workers belonged to a union in 2024, down from 20% in 1983, the first year for which data is available, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics.",
      "President Donald Trump in March signed an executive order seeking to end collective bargaining for certain federal employees that led to union leaders suing the administration. Nevada and more than two dozen other states now have so-called \u201cright to work\u201d laws that let workers opt out of union membership and dues. GOP lawmakers have also supported changes to the National Labor Relations Board and other regulatory bodies, seeking to reduce what they view as overly burdensome rules on businesses.",
      "Ruben Garcia, professor and director of the workplace program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas law school, said the Culinary Union's resilience stems from its deep roots in Las Vegas, its ability to adapt to the growth and corporatization of the casino industry, and its long history of navigating complex power dynamics with casino owners and operators.",
      "He said the consolidation of casinos on the Las Vegas Strip mirrors the dominance of the Big Three automakers in Detroit. A few powerful companies \u2014 MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts \u2014 now control most of the dozens of casinos along Las Vegas Boulevard.",
      "\u201cThat consolidation can make things harder for workers in some ways, but it also gives unions one large target,\" Garcia said.",

But a last-minute deal with Caesars narrowly averted the walkout, and it triggered a domino effect across the Strip, with the union quickly finalizing similar deals for workers at MGM Resorts and Wynn properties.",
      "The latest contracts secured a historic 32% bump in pay over the life of the five-year contract. Union casino workers will earn an average $35 hourly, including benefits, by the end of it.",
      "The union's influence also extends far beyond the casino floor. With its ability to mobilize thousands of its members for canvassing and voter outreach, the union's endorsements are highly coveted, particularly among Democrats, and can signal who has the best shot at winning working-class votes.",
      "The union's path hasn't always been smooth though. Michael Green, a history professor at UNLV, noted the Culinary Union has long faced resistance.",
      "\u201cHistorically, there have always been people who are anti-union,\u201d Green said.",
      "Earlier this year, two food service workers in Las Vegas filed federal complaints with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing the union of deducting dues despite their objections to union membership. It varies at each casino, but between 95 to 98% of workers opt in to union membership, according to the union.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Culinary Union bosses deserve my support,\u201d said one of the workers, Renee Guerrero, who works at T-Mobile Arena on the Strip. \u201cTheir actions since I attempted to exercise my right to stop dues payments only confirms my decision.\u201d",
      "But longtime union members like Paul Anthony see things differently. Anthony, a food server at the Bellagio and a Culinary member for nearly 40 years, said his union benefits \u2014 free family health insurance, reliable pay raises, job security and a pension \u2014 helped him to build a lasting career in the hospitality industry.",

      "MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Camels have long been the backbone of Somalia 's pastoralist culture, feeding families, transporting goods and standing tall in local folklore. But on the dusty outskirts of the capital, the camel now finds itself at the center of an agricultural revolution that could redefine Somali farming.",
      "On a breezy Wednesday morning in mid-June, The Associated Press visited Beder Camel Farm \u2014 one of a new generation of camel dairies springing up around Mogadishu.",
      "Dozens of camels sauntered around sandy paddocks while others nibbled on fresh fodder under the watchful eyes of herders. In a nearby shed, workers carefully milked the animals and collected the frothy yield in sanitized containers.",
      "Demand for camel milk is growing, buoyed by a wave of local entrepreneurs who see untapped potential in a traditional resource.",
      "Somalia is home to over 7 million camels \u2014 more than any other country on Earth \u2014 but only a fraction of that milk has ever reached urban grocery shelves, according to industry estimates.",
      "At the heart of the shift toward a modern approach to camel milk production is Dr. Abdirisak Mire Hashi, a veterinarian and the farm\u2019s manager. For Hashi, it's not only about profit \u2014 it's about preserving heritage while embracing progress.",
      "\u201cSomalis take pride in their heritage of raising camels. However, the way camels are raised has changed significantly over time,\" Hashi told The Associated Press as he inspected a milking herd.",
      "Each camel at Beder now produces up to 10 liters (2.6 gallons) of milk daily \u2014 double what traditional herders typically yield. The increase is attributed to new investments in veterinary care, better feed, and modern milking practices. The camels are routinely checked by vets, given nutritional supplements, and grazed on scientifically blended fodder, a far cry from the roaming nomadic herds of decades gone by.",
      "\u201cWe were among the first to establish this kind of farm back in 2006, when very few people even knew about commercial camel milk production,\u201d said Jama Omar, CEO of Beder Camel Farm. \u201cOther farms have entered the market since then, but we currently hold around 40% of the market share.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe employ nearly 200 full-time staff,\u201d he added. \u201cIn addition, we bring in seasonal workers during key periods such as planting and harvest.\u201d",
      "The farm\u2019s biggest leap may be its yogurt factory \u2014 the first in Somalia dedicated to processing camel milk into yogurt.",
      "Inside the factory, workers in white coats oversee stainless steel vats as fresh milk is cultured and packed. The final product is sold under the Beder brand which now retails in urban supermarkets across Mogadishu.",
      "Nelson Njoki Githu, a Kenyan-born food engineer overseeing the production line, says camel milk yogurt isn\u2019t just a novelty \u2014 it fills an important nutritional gap for local consumers.",
      "\u201cThe number one benefit compared to cow milk is that camel milk has lower levels of lactose,\u201d Githu explained. \u201cPeople with lactose intolerance can consume this milk without any issue. Again, the vitamin levels are higher, especially vitamin C, iron and zinc, compared to cow milk.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt's a tough lift, but we might be able to get there. It really means that all the films are gonna have to stand on their own,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be about getting great reviews, having that staying power, that longevity in the marketplace.\u201d",
      "Newcomer comedy \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d earned second place at the box office this weekend, with $22 million from 3,852 North American theaters. That was on par with projections and also in line with the first movie in the series, which brought in $23 million in 2022. Paramount\u2019s slapstick comedy, \u201cThe Naked Gun,\u201d also in its debut weekend, snagged the third box office spot, earning $17 million from 3,344 locations.",
      "Jim Orr, president of domestic distribution for Universal Pictures, said the solid debut for \u201cThe Bad Guys 2,\u201d coupled with strong audience reaction scores, \u201cshould point to a very long, very successful run through not only the rest of the summer, but really, I think into the fall.\"",
      "James Gunn's \u201cSuperman,\u201d which opened four weekends ago and already crossed $550 million globally, earned $13.8 million domestically this weekend, taking the fourth spot. \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d followed with $8.7 million.",
      "The horror movie \u201cTogether\u201d had a strong debut weekend, coming in at sixth place and earning $6.8 million domestically, proof that August is a month for edgier and off-beat films, Dergarabedian said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what this month is about. It\u2019s not just about box office,\" Dergarabedian said. \"It\u2019s also about providing really interesting, rewarding movie-going experiences for audiences.\u201d",
      "Dergarabedian said he expects highly-anticipated movies hitting theaters in the next few weeks \u2014 including \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d and Zach Cregger\u2019s horror movie \u201cWeapons\u201d \u2014 to give August a needed boost.",
      "The box office is currently up 9.5% from last year.",

      "The federal jury held that Tesla bore significant responsibility because its technology failed and that not all the blame can be put on a reckless driver, even one who admitted he was distracted by his cell phone before hitting a young couple out gazing at the stars. The decision comes as Musk seeks to convince Americans his cars are safe enough to drive on their own as he plans to roll out a driverless taxi service in several cities in the coming months.",
      "The decision ends a four-year long case remarkable not just in its outcome but that it even made it to trial. Many similar cases against Tesla have been dismissed and, when that didn't happen, settled by the company to avoid the spotlight of a trial.",
      "\u201cThis will open the floodgates,\u201d said Miguel Custodio, a car crash lawyer not involved in the Tesla case. \u201cIt will embolden a lot of people to come to court.\u201d",
      "The case also included startling charges by lawyers for the family of the deceased, 22-year-old, Naibel Benavides Leon, and for her injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo. They claimed Tesla either hid or lost key evidence, including data and video recorded seconds before the accident.",
      "Tesla has previously faced criticism that it is slow to cough up crucial data by relatives of other victims in Tesla crashes, accusations that the car company has denied. In this case, the plaintiffs showed Tesla had the evidence all along, despite its repeated denials, by hiring a forensic data expert who dug it up. Tesla said it made a mistake after being shown the evidence and honestly hadn\u2019t thought it was there.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s verdict is wrong,\" Tesla said in a statement, \u201cand only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla\u2019s and the entire industry\u2019s efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology,\u201d They said the plaintiffs concocted a story \u201dblaming the car when the driver \u2013 from day one \u2013 admitted and accepted responsibility.\u201d",
      "In addition to the punitive award, the jury said Tesla must also pay $49 million in compensatory damages, bringing the total borne by the company to $249 million.",

      "But the issue of trust generally in the company came up several times in the case, including in closing arguments Thursday. The plaintiffs\u2019 lead lawyer, Brett Schreiber, said Tesla\u2019s decision to even use the term Autopilot showed it was willing to mislead people and take big risks with their lives because the system only helps drivers with lane changes, slowing a car and other tasks, falling far short of driving the car itself.",
      "Schreiber said other automakers use terms like \u201cdriver assist\u201d and \u201ccopilot\u201d to make sure drivers don\u2019t rely too much on the technology.",

Noting that McGee had gone through the same intersection 30 or 40 times previously and hadn\u2019t crashed during any of those trips, Smith said that this isolates the cause to one thing alone: \u201cThe cause is that he dropped his cell phone.\u201d",

      "Warren Buffett's company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathawa...",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Warren Buffett's company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll.",
      "Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year.",
      "Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it has to record the current value of its massive investment portfolio even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprise shareholders by selling off a huge chunk of its Apple stake which inflated the investment gains then.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies \u2014 major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses \u2014 generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that.",
      "Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products.",
      "This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands.",
      "Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft\u2019s core collection of processed foods.",
      "Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands.",

      "Many investors are watching Berkshire's BNSF closely after rival Union Pacific announced a plan to buy Norfolk Southern earlier this week to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. The speculation is that BNSF needs to pursue a merger with eastern rail CSX to be able to compete.",
      "But CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it isn't Buffett's style to jump into a deal just because the market thinks he should. Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation.",
      "\u201cHe wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,\u201d Seifert said. \u201cI think one of the reasons why that cash hasn\u2019t been deployed is that valuations run through the Berkshire M-and-A model tend to be too rich. But if there\u2019s a logical case to be made they\u2019ll accept it.\u201d",
      "And BNSF appears to be doing fine right now on its own. The railroad recorded a 19% jump in its operating profit this quarter at $1.47 billion as it cut costs and delivered about 1% more shipments.",

      "LONDON -- On a charming cobblestone street tucked away in London\u2019s East End, a pub proudly hangs out a sign that reads \u201cOldest riverside pub in London.\u201d Across the Thames River, a pub with a different name makes the same bold claim.",
      "The unofficial title of the oldest riverside pub in the city has long been disputed, with both the Mayflower and the Prospect of Whitby laying claim to the title.",
      "The two contenders can be found along a quiet stretch of the Thames, far from the city\u2019s crowded souvenir shops and tourist sites, serving up traditional British dishes \u2014 from steak and ale pie to sticky toffee pudding \u2014 with a side of history.",
      "The Mayflower is named after the Pilgrim Mayflower ship, which set sail from the site in 1620 to begin its journey to America. Though it only got its name in 1957, it is said to have some of the ship\u2019s original timbers incorporated into its structure.",
      "Today, pubgoers who can prove direct descent from one of the Mayflower passengers can sign its \u201cDescendants Book.\u201d",
      "Every night, tourists step out of black cabs at the doors of the two pubs, trading the capital\u2019s modern skyscrapers for the storied streets of London\u2019s East End, lined with quaint terraced houses and red brick warehouses.",
      "In both pubs they enter spaces where old paintings hanging on dark paneled walls and other mementos of their histories seem to leave the contemporary world behind.",
      "\u201cThere really is a feeling that you might have stepped back in time and could be drinking beer with sailors or pirates or anybody from any Dickens novels really,\" said Emily Godwin, a Londoner who has been to both. She spoke while sipping a pint of lager with friends at the Prospect on a recent summer evening.",
      "The Prospect boasts a pewter bar \u2013 the longest of its kind in Britain \u2014 where the infamous \u201cHanging Judge Jeffreys\u201d is said to have watched the many hangings that took place at the nearby \u201cExecution Dock.\u201d Early on, the pub was known as the Devil\u2019s Tavern due to its association with thieves and smugglers. A hanging noose outside serves as a reminder of the pub\u2019s grisly history.",
      "It \u201cfeels like such a pocket of history in London,\u201d Godwin said. \u201cSo much of London\u2019s East End feels very new and trendy, and the Prospect feels like it\u2019s barely changed.\u201d",
      "British pubs have always been at the center of social life, with locals coming together over a pint, even in times of war and economic hardship. But the last five years have been challenging for the industry as pubs contended with the COVID-19 pandemic and rising costs.",
      "This year an estimated 378 venues are set to shutter across England, Wales, and Scotland, according to the British Beer and Pub Association.",
      "\u201cWhen a pub closes, it puts people out of a job, deprives communities of their heart and soul and hurts the local economy,\u201d said Emma McClarkin, head of the BBPA.",

      "The Prospect claims it was established in 1520, with its original flagstone surviving an arson attack in 1666 \u2014 the same year as the Great Fire of London. The pub was outside of the city limits at that time and was not affected by the conflagration that gutted the medieval city.",
      "Justin Billington, assistant manager at the Prospect, said some people date the pub to its full reconstruction in 1774 after the 1666 fire. But he doesn't see it that way, noting that it operated continuously. The day after the fire, the workers rolled out a barrel of beer that had survived the flames and locals showed up with their tankards, drinking vessels, and enjoyed a drink on the spot.",
      "There were several reconstructions in the pub's subsequent history, but none withstood the salt water and shifting foundations of the Thames, Billington explained. Not, that is, until 1774 when the retired captain of a merchant ship called \u201cThe Prospect\u201d rebuilt it using the ship.",
      "\u201cThis rebuild held and continues to hold on for dear life,\" he said.",
      "If the pub was actually established in 1774, that would make the Mayflower \u2014 established in the 16th century \u2014 older.",
      "But there are no hard feelings between the pubs as Billington described their competition as a \u201cloving rivalry.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe compete against each other to be the oldest, and to serve the best food and drink,\u201d he said.",
      "But the question remains: How can either pub definitively claim the title?",
      "Unlike the title of the \u201cOldest pub in England,\u201d held by the Porch House in southern England, which is said to date to the 10th century, there is no official certification for the oldest pub in London.",
      "Guinness World Records said it has not formally awarded the title because of the complexities created by numerous name changes, relocations and reconstructions.",
      "\u201cThere are lots of very old pubs that might make a claim to being oldest, but it could be contested because it could be argued they weren\u2019t always in \u2018London,\u2019\u201d English historian and author Jacob Field said. \u201cMany pubs have changed name over time, making it hard to claim they are the oldest.\"",

      "Millions of student borrowers could begin having their wages garnished as soon as this summer",
      "NEW YORK -- Millions of student borrowers could begin having their wages garnished as soon as this summer, according to estimates from credit bureau TransUnion.",
      "The company predicts that by August roughly 3 million borrowers could move into default, meaning they're 270 days past due on payments. At that point, loan holders are at risk of having 15% of their pay docked by the government, with the money going toward the outstanding debt. There has been no clear indication of when wage garnishment will start.",
      "After the pandemic-era pause on student loan payments ended in May, borrowers have had to reassess the state of their loans and budgets. According to TransUnion, another 2 million borrowers are on course to default in September.",
      "A Biden-administration grace period, during which late or missed payments were not counted against credit scores, ended in the fall.",
      "Since then, millions of borrowers have seen hits to their credit ratings.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "\u201cThe most important thing borrowers can do before administrative wage garnishment restarts is to log into studentaid.gov to check whether their federal student loans are in default and take steps now to remove them from default,\u201d said Kyra Taylor, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.",
      "Taylor said it's not uncommon for borrowers to be unaware that their loans are in default. If borrowers attended college or graduate school during different periods of time, or if they have different federal loan types, they may also have multiple student loan servicers.",
      "If that's the case, you should act now to get your loans out of default and back into good standing by either entering a rehabilitation agreement, where you must make nine consecutive payments based on their income, or by consolidating your loans into a new federal Direct Loan.",
      "\u201cBecause this hasn\u2019t happened for so long, there are many people who have no idea they\u2019re at risk,\" said Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "Wait times for student borrowers attempting to contact their loan servicers have been long, with many dropped calls, in part due to layoffs at the Education Department. Ba\u00f1ez recommends contacting your congressperson, using a casework tool that can guide you through submitting a constituent request.",
      "\u201cThese offices have entire teams dedicated to constituent casework for when you have an issue with a federal agency, such as the Department of Education,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you can request assistance from your member of congress \u2014 your representative or senator.\u201d",
      "Until past due payments are paid or the loan's default status is resolved, borrowers are at risk of having up to 15% of their wages deducted directly from their paychecks.",

      "Richelle Brooks, 37, an education administrator based in Los Angeles, said she's received warnings and notices about the resumption of collection of her loans. For several degrees, she still has $239,000 in outstanding debt, and she was informed her monthly payments on those loans will be roughly $3,000.",
      "\u201cI can't afford it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just came out of the moratorium \u2014 not paying for five years. People getting these notices \u2014 they're terrified. I'm uneasy, too.\"",
      "Brooks said she's an informed borrower who stays up to date on each development and who knows her options. She plans to enroll in coding classes, at least half-time, which could place her loans in deferment, so she wouldn't be required to make monthly payments, while she makes a financial plan.",
      "There's still time to take action.",
      "According to Taylor, the Department of Education must provide 30 days notice before it sends a garnishment order to your employer. During that time, you can request a hearing to object by telling the department that the garnishment would cause you financial hardship. You can also request that the department reduce the amount being garnished and submit documentation about your income and expenses.",
      "To do this, you must make your hearing request in writing, postmarked no later than 30 days after the garnishment order. Your loan holder will then arrange the hearing. If you're unsure who your loan holder is, you can contact the Education Department's Default Resolution Group.",
      "If you were laid off from your last job, you can also object to garnishment if you have not been in your current job for 12 consecutive months. You can further request a hearing and object if you submitted an application for certain kinds of statutory discharges and those have not yet been decided. Some common reasons for statutory discharge of student loans include: if the school you attended closed before you could complete your degree, if your school owes you a refund but fails to pay it, if you're experiencing total disability, or if you're experiencing bankruptcy.",
      "\u201cIf the borrower requests a hearing within 30 days after receiving the garnishment notice, the department cannot start garnishment until it issues a decision on the borrower\u2019s objections and financial hardship request,\u201d Taylor said.",
      "You can request a hearing after the 30 day period is up, but in those cases the department will generally not stop garnishing your wages while the hearing request is pending.",

      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariff rates of up to 41% on U.S. imports from dozens of countries drew expressions of relief Friday from some countries that negotiated a deal or managed to whittle them down from rates announced in April. Others expressed disappointment or frustration over running out of time after hitting Trump's Aug. 1 deadline for striking deals with America\u2019s trading partners.",
      "The new rates are due to take effect on Aug. 7, but uncertainty over what Trump might do next remains. The way ahead for China, which runs the largest trade surplus with the U.S., is unclear after talks earlier this week in Stockholm produced no deal. Trump has yet to say if he'll extend an Aug. 12 pause on painfully high import duties on Chinese products.",
      "The reaction from financial markets was muted. Benchmarks fell in Asia, with South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropping nearly 4% after the tariff rate for the U.S. ally was set at 15%. The U.S. dollar weakened against the Japanese yen, trading at more than 150 yen per dollar.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his government was disappointed by Trump's move to raise the U.S. tariff on goods from America's northern neighbor to 35% from 25%, effective Friday. Goods transshipped from unspecified other countries face a 40% import duty.",
      "Trump cited what he said was a lack of cooperation in stemming trafficking in illicit drugs across the northern border. He also slammed Canada's plan to recognize a Palestinian state and has expressed frustration with a trade deficit largely fueled by U.S. oil purchases.",
      "\u201cCanada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,\u201d Carney said in a statement.",
      "Many of Canada's exports to the U.S. are covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and face no tariff. But steel, lumber, aluminum and autos have been subject to still higher tariffs.",
      "Switzerland was reeling after Trump ordered a 39% tariff rate for the land of luxury watches, pharmaceuticals and financial services. That was up from his original proposal of a 31% duty.",
      "\u201cThe Federal Council notes with great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland\u2019s very constructive stance from the outset, the U.S. intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland,\u201d the government said in a post on X. It said it would continue to seek a negotiated solution.",
      "New Zealand officials said Friday they would keep lobbying Trump to cut the 15% tariff he announced for their country\u2019s exports to the U.S., up from the original 10% baseline set in April.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a good thing. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s warranted,\u201d Trade Minister Todd McClay told Radio New Zealand. The exporter of meat, dairy, wine and farm machinery ran a $1.1 billion trade surplus with the U.S. in 2024, according to U.S. Trade Representative data.",
      "McClay said New Zealand exporters had reported they could absorb a 10% tariff or pass it on to U.S. consumers through increased costs. A further increase would \u201cchange the equation,\u201d he said.",
      "Neither New Zealand nor its neighbor Australia have struck tariff deals with the Trump administration. Australian steel and aluminum exports have faced a steep 50% tariff since June.",
      "Australian Trade Minister Don Farrell said the 10% overall tariff on Australia\u2019s exports to the United States was a vindication of his government\u2019s \u201ccool and calm negotiations.\u201d But he said even that level was not justified.

      "\u201cIf you like to drink spirits and you\u2019ve never had baijiu, it\u2019s kind of like eating noodles but you\u2019ve never had spaghetti,\u201d said Jim Boyce, a Canadian writer and wine expert who founded World Baijiu Day a decade ago. The annual event aims to promote the traditional liquor, which is far less known internationally than whiskey or vodka.",
      "Moutai, a kind of baijiu made in mountainous Guizhou province in southwestern China, is known as the country\u2019s \u201cnational liquor.\u201d",
      "Perhaps its biggest endorsement came in 1974, when U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger banqueted with Deng Xiaoping, who would later become China's top leader.",
      "\u201cI think if we drink enough Moutai, we can solve anything,\" Kissinger said.",
      "\u201cThen, when I return to China, we must take steps to increase our production of it,\u201d Deng replied, according to an archived document from the U.S. State Department\u2019s Office of the Historian.",
      "Price fluctuations of Feitian Moutai, the liquor\u2019s most famous brand, serve as a barometer for China\u2019s baijiu market. This year, its price has dropped by 36% after four consecutive years of decline, according a report by the China Alcoholic Drinks Association.",
      "The report forecast China\u2019s baijiu production will likely fall for the eighth straight year in 2025. Baijiu consumption has dropped as people spend more cautiously, cutting back on banquets and drinking due to a weaker economy.",
      "Perennial anti-corruption campaigns by the ruling Communist Party targeting lavish official dinners have taken a harsh toll. In May, the party issued new rules banning cigarettes and alcohol during work meals.",
      "China's drinking culture is evolving, with younger people keen to protect their health and less inclined to overindulge or be bound by rigid social conventions. Faced with far more choices, they might instead opt for whiskey, wine or non-alcoholic alternatives.",
      "\u201cThere is an old saying in China: 'No banquet is complete without alcohol.\u2019 It means in the past, without alcohol there is no social lubricant,\u201d 30-year-old Chi Bo said while having cocktails with friends in Beijing\u2019s chic Sanlitun area.",

      "Kweichou Moutai partnered with China's Luckin' Coffee last year to introduce a Moutai-flavored latte that reportedly sells 5 million cups a day across China. Bartenders also are designing cocktails using a baijiu base.",
      "\u201cThere are so many choices right now,\u201d Boyce said. \u201cIt\u2019s just about fighting for attention in terms of choice.\u201d",
      "Jiangxiaobai, a newer brand made in southwestern China\u2019s Chongqing, has targeted young consumers from the beginning. It offers fruit-infused baijiu with an alcohol content below 10%, packaged in smaller, more affordable bottles adorned with philosophical or sentimental phrases meant to resonate with Chinese youth such as, \u201cUnspoken words. In my eyes, in drafts, in dreams, or downed in a drink.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur promotion of products combines the culture and lifestyle young people advocate,\" Jiangxiaobai marketing director Fan Li said. \"From our products to our branding, it\u2019s a process of embracing the younger generation.\"",
      "Shirley Huang, out with friends on a Friday night in Sanlitun, said she had never touched baijiu at age 27, preferring cocktails. But that night, something new on the menu caught her attention: a baijiu-based cocktail.",
      "\u201cBaijiu is quietly making its way into our lives. We just haven\u2019t noticed,\u201d she said \u201cIt may not appear as itself, but it reemerges in new forms.\u201d",

      "Panama\u2019s Comptroller General filed two lawsuits on Wednesday, seeking to declare unconstitutional a contract that granted the operation of ports at both ends of the canal to the Hong Kong subsidiary, and to nullify its renewal four years ago, saying it was \u201cabusive\u201d of Panama's interests.",
      "In turn, Panama Ports Company said its operations have had a positive impact, from building world-class ports to creating more than 25,000 direct and indirect jobs and contributing billions of balboas \u2014 Panama's currency \u2014 to the country's economy.",

      "The company operates the ports of Balboa, in the Pacific, and Cristobal, in the Atlantic, under a concession contract approved in 1997 and renewed in 2021 for 25 more years. CK Hutchison is controlled by the family of Li Ka-shing, the southern Chinese city\u2019s richest man.",
      "Panama\u2019s comptroller authority in April said that an audit of Panama Ports Company found irregularities in the renewal of the concession. But the company denied allegations that it had failed to pay about $1.2 billion to the Central American country.",

      "And, thanks to a natural experiment nearly two decades ago, researchers can forecast what that will mean for patient care. Among the problems they predict will develop as a direct result of these people losing coverage:",

      "Here\u2019s a deeper look at the research and challenges that could develop.",
      "It will become harder for many people to enroll in Medicaid or individual insurance plans and then stay covered. Medicaid is a state and federally funded program that covers care for people with low incomes.",
      "States will have to verify every six months whether someone remains eligible for Medicaid. That could cause coverage lapses for people with incomes that fluctuate or for those who move and miss renewal paperwork.",
      "Many also are expected to lose coverage as states require Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer or go to school unless exempted.",
      "Enrollment in Medicaid has swelled in recent years. Republicans are cutting back in part to help fund tax breaks and pay for other priorities like border security. They also say they are trying to root out waste and fraud by rightsizing Medicaid for the population it was initially designed to serve \u2014 mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children.",
      "People covered through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual insurance marketplaces also will see shorter enrollment windows and no more automatic renewals.",
      "Gaffney, of Harvard Medical School, and other researchers looked to past studies to measure how many people would experience detrimental effects, like going without prescriptions, from the upcoming changes. Gaffney updated the published analysis, which was originally based on the House version of the bill, at the AP\u2019s request.",
      "One study in particular was critical for their work: In 2008, Oregon offered a rare opportunity to compare groups of people enrolled in Medicaid with those who were not.",
      "After a four-year period of frozen enrollment due to budget limitations, the state determined it could enroll 10,000 more people in Medicaid. It used a lottery system to make the selection amid high demand.",
      "That gave researchers a chance to follow people who got coverage and those who did not, similar to how scientists testing a new drug might compare patients taking it to those given a placebo.",
      "\u201cThis is a gold standard research design because it replicates a randomized-controlled trial,\u201d said Christine Eibner, a senior economist at RAND Corp. who was not involved in the study.",
      "Applying results from that study and other research to the recent CBO estimate allowed Gaffney and other researchers to estimate specific effects of losing coverage.",
      "\u201cBy taking coverage away, we are putting patients in a terrible position,\u201d said Gaffney, a former president of Physicians for a National Health Program.",

      "The workgroups typically include committee members and experts from medical and scientific organizations. At workgroup meetings, members evaluate data from vaccine manufacturers and the CDC, and formulate vaccination recommendation proposals to be presented to the full committee.",

      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak\u2019s first five years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite gruesome,\u201d said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",

      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars.",

      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \u201clook sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\u201d said Gehman. \u201cThey\u2019re voracious eaters.\u201d",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2013 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",

      "Russia\u2019s space chief has visited the United States to discuss cooperation between Moscow and Washington on the International Space Station and lunar research with NASA\u2019s acting chief, the first such face-to-face meeting in more than seven years",
      "MOSCOW -- Russia\u2019s space chief has visited the United States to discuss plans for continued cooperation between Moscow and Washington on the International Space Station and lunar research with NASA\u2019s acting chief, the first such face-to-face meeting in more than seven years.",
      "Dmitry Bakanov, the director of the state space corporation Roscosmos, met Thursday with NASA's new acting administrator, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, on a visit to attend the planned launch of a U.S.-Japanese-Russian crew to the space station. The launch was delayed by weather until Friday.",
      "Roscosmos said Bakanov and Duffy discussed \"further work on the International Space Station, cooperation on lunar programs, joint exploration of deep space and continued cooperation on other space projects.\u201d",
      "Once bitter rivals in the space race during the Cold War, Roscosmos and NASA cooperated on the space station and other projects. That relationship was beset with tensions after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in 2022, but Washington and Moscow have continued to work together, with U.S. and Russian crews continuing to fly to the orbiting outpost on each country's spacecraft.",
      "Plans for broader cooperation, including possible Russian involvement in NASA's Artemis program of lunar research, have fallen apart.",
      "As Russia has become increasingly reliant on China for its energy exports and imports of key technology amid Western sanctions, Roscosmos has started cooperation with China on its prospective lunar mission.",
      "Speaking to Russian reporters after the talks with Duffy, Bakanov said that they agreed to keep working on keeping the space station in operation to the end of the decade.",

      "Linda and Tim Pierce have welcomed a baby boy using a 30-year-old embryo",
      "A baby boy born last week to an Ohio couple developed from an embryo that had been frozen for more than 30 years in what is believed to be the longest storage time before a birth.",
      "In what's known as embryo adoption, Linda and Tim Pierce used a handful of embryos donated in 1994 in pursuit of having a child after fighting infertility for years. Their son was born Saturday from an embryo that had been in storage for 11,148 days, which the Pierces\u2019 doctor says sets a record.",
      "It\u2019s a concept that has been around since the 1990s but is gaining attraction as some fertility clinics and advocates, often Christian-centered, oppose discarding leftover embryos because of their belief that life begins at or around conception and that all embryos deserve to be treated like children who need a home.",
      "\u201cI felt all along that these three little hopes, these little embryos, deserved to live just like my daughter did,\u201d said Linda Archerd, 62, who donated her embryos to the Pierces.",
      "Just about 2% of births in the U.S. are the result of in vitro fertilization, and an even smaller fraction involve donated embryos.",
      "However, medical experts estimate about 1.5 million frozen embryos are currently being stored throughout the country, with many of those in limbo as parents wrestle with what to do with their leftover embryos created in IVF labs.",
      "Further complicating the topic is a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that said that frozen embryos have the legal status of children. State leaders have since devised a temporary solution shielding clinics from liability stemming from that ruling, though questions linger about remaining embryos.",
      "Archerd says she turned to IVF in 1994. Back then, the ability to freeze, thaw and transfer embryos was making key progress and opening the door for hopeful parents to create more embryos and increase their chances of a successful transfer.",
      "She wound up with four embryos and initially hoped to use them all. But after the birth of her daughter, Archerd and her husband divorced, disrupting her timeline for having more children.",
      "As the years turned into decades, Archerd said she was wracked with guilt about what to do with the embryos as storage fees continued to rise.",
      "Eventually, she found Snowflakes, a division of Nightlight Christian Adoptions, which offers open adoptions to donors that allows people like Archerd. She was also able to set preferences for what families would adopt her embryos.",

      "The process was tricky, requiring Archerd to contact her initial fertility doctor in Oregon and dig through paper records to get the proper documentation for the donation. The embryos then had to be shipped from Oregon to the Pierces\u2019 doctor in Tennessee. The clinic, Rejoice Fertility in Knoxville, refuses to discard frozen embryos and has become known for handling embryos stored in outdated and older containers.",
      "Of the three donated embryos the Pierces received from Archerd, one didn\u2019t make the thaw. Two were transferred to Lindsey Pierce\u2019s womb, but just one successfully implanted.",
      "According to Dr. John David Gordon, the transfer of the nearly 31-year-old embryo marks the longest-frozen embryo to result in a live birth. He would know, Gordon says his clinic assisted in the previous record, when Lydia and Timothy Ridgeway were born from embryos frozen for 30 years, or 10,905 days.",
      "\u201cI think that these stories catch the imagination,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cBut I think they also provide a little bit of a cautionary tale to say: Why are these embryos sitting in storage? You know, why do we have this problem?\u201d",
      "In a statement, Lindsey and Tim Pierce said the clinic\u2019s support was just what they needed.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t go into this thinking about records \u2014 we just wanted to have a baby,\u201d Lindsey Pierce said.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping that they\u2019re going to send pictures,\u201d she said, noting that the parents have already sent several after the birth. \u201cI\u2019d love to meet them some day. That would be a dream come true to meet \u2014 meet them and the baby.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk is a kingmaker on X",
      "ROME -- Hard-right commentators, politicians and activists in Europe have uncovered a secret to expanding their influence: engaging with Elon Musk.",
      "Take the German politician from a party whose own domestic intelligence agency has designated as extremist. Her daily audience on X surged from 230,000 to 2.2 million on days Musk interacted with her posts. She went on to lead her party to its best-ever electoral showing.",
      "Or the anti-immigration activist in Britain, who was banned from Twitter and sentenced to 18 months in prison for contempt of court. Since Musk let him back on the platform in late 2023, he\u2019s mentioned, reposted or replied to the billionaire more than 120 times on X \u2014 and gained nearly a million followers.",
      "Even a little-known social-media influencer turned politician from Cyprus has benefited from the Musk effect. Before winning a surprise seat in the European Parliament, where he\u2019s advocated for Musk, the influencer seemed to have one ambition: to hug the world\u2019s richest man. He got his hug \u2014 and political endorsements. On days Musk has interacted with his account on X, the man\u2019s audience exploded from just over 300,000 to nearly 10 million views.",
      "Elon Musk may have tumbled from political grace in Washington -- he stepped down as an adviser to President Donald Trump in May and has since traded insults with the president -- but as he works to build his own political party, his power on X his power remains unchecked.",
      "Musk\u2019s influence on the platform he bought for $44 billion has made him a kingmaker at home and abroad. Among those he has chosen to cultivate are hard-right politicians and insurgent influencers across Europe, according to an Associated Press analysis of public data. His dominance, which has real-world financial and political impacts, is fueling concerns in Europe about foreign meddling -- not from Russia or China this time, but from the United States.",
      "\u201cEvery alarm bell needs to ring,\u201d said Christel Schaldemose, a vice president of the European Parliament who works on electoral interference and digital regulation. \u201cWe need to make sure that power is not unbalanced.\u201d",
      "In seeking to quantify Musk\u2019s effect on European politics, The Associated Press analyzed more than 20,000 posts over a three-year period from 11 far-right European figures across six countries who frequently promote a hard-right political or social agenda and had significant interactions with Elon Musk since he purchased Twitter. Tens of thousands of posts by Musk on Twitter, now known as X, were also collected.",
      "The AP used the records, obtained from data provider Bright Data, to analyze how Musk\u2019s account interacted with the European influencers, and vice versa, and the extent to which Musk\u2019s engagement boosted their reach.",
      "These case studies are not meant to be representative of a broad universe; rather, they showcase the ways in which Musk\u2019s engagement can have an impact on local influencers who share his views.",
      "Due to limitations on data collection, the dataset is not a complete record of all posts made by these accounts. Even so, it captured at least 920 instances in which one of the European accounts tagged, replied or otherwise attempted to interact with Musk\u2019s account, and at nearly 190 instances where Musk\u2019s own posts interacted with the Europeans.",
      "The AP also analyzed records of daily follower counts, using data from Social Blade, to measure any growth in the European accounts\u2019 audience that occurred in the wake of Musk\u2019s online interactions. This kind of analysis is no longer possible. In March, Social Blade removed X from its analytics, saying that X had increased its data access fees to prohibitive levels, making the platform harder to research.",
      "Among those included in AP\u2019s analysis are several people who have run into legal trouble in their own countries. An anti-immigrant agitator in the U.K., for example, was sentenced in October to 18 months in prison for violating a court order blocking him from making libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee. A German politician was convicted last year of knowingly using a Nazi slogan in a speech. An Italian vice premier was acquitted in December of illegally detaining 100 migrants aboard a humanitarian rescue ship.",
      "Others examined by AP were an influencer known as the \u201cshieldmaiden of the far-right;\u201d a German activist dubbed the \u201canti-Greta Thunberg\u201d now living in what amounts to political exile in Washington, D.C.; and two politicians who have advocated for the interests of Musk\u2019s companies as those firms seek to expand in Europe.",
      "AP\u2019s analysis shows how Musk is helping unite nationalists across borders in common cause to halt migration, overturn progressive policies and promote an absolutist vision of free speech. While his efforts have sparked backlash in some countries, Musk\u2019s promotion of a growing alliance of hard-right parties and individuals has helped rattle the foundation of a transatlantic bond that has guided U.S. and European relations for over eight decades.",
      "Engagement from Musk does not guarantee a surge in followers or page views. But AP found it can have a huge impact, especially on up-and-coming influencers. One account that began with around 120,000 followers when Musk took over Twitter in October 2022 topped 1.2 million by January of this year. Seven other European accounts saw six-figure increases in their follower counts over the same period.",
      "Most of the 11 accounts examined saw triple-digit percentage increases in their followers. Even some that grew more steadily on their own before Musk interacted with them saw their follower counts rise sharply after he began engaging with their posts. Similarly, on days Musk interacted with a post, its account saw its views soar \u2014 in most cases, accruing two to four times as many views, with a few seeing boosts 30 or 40 times their normal daily viewership.",
      "Musk is not the only factor influencing the growth of these accounts, of course, but their rising fortunes are a measure of how the platform has evolved under his leadership. When Musk acquired X, he pledged to turn it into a haven for free speech, declaring himself a \u201cfree speech absolutist.\u201d AP\u2019s analysis adds to growing evidence that instead of serving as a neutral forum for free speech, X amplifies Musk\u2019s speech.",
      "This shift has given him sweeping power to direct people\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an extreme asymmetry in the way Musk is able to leverage and shape the platform,\u201d said Timothy Graham, an associate professor in digital media at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, who has studied data anomalies on X. \u201cThere\u2019s an unequivocal sense when you go onto the site that you\u2019re entering Musk\u2019s kingdom.\u201d",
      "Since he acquired Twitter in 2022, Musk has come to dominate the platform. His followers have more than doubled, to more than 220 million \u2014 growth so tremendous that it easily outpaced the other Top 10 accounts. Not even Taylor Swift has been able to keep up.",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose followers grew by 21 million \u2014 or 25% \u2014 from October 2022 through January, clocked a distant second. Donald Trump\u2019s followers grew by 14%, or around 12 million, while Taylor Swift mustered a mere 3% growth, or 3 million new followers.",
      "None of the other Top 10 accounts have shown such consistent follower growth, month after month, AP found. The result is a further concentration of power for the world\u2019s richest man, who now commands the most popular account on a social media platform used by hundreds of millions of people around the world.",
      "Given the opacity of the algorithms that power X, it\u2019s hard to determine with certainty what array of factors might be driving such unusual \u2014 and unusually consistent \u2014 growth in Musk\u2019s account. But researchers who have analyzed data patterns on X argue that the platform\u2019s algorithm has, at times, been altered to amplify Musk\u2019s voice.",
      "How X promotes content is a growing point of contention in Europe. In January, the European Union expanded its investigation of X to assess how the platform pushes content to users and why some material goes viral. In February, French prosecutors opened a separate investigation into X over allegations that Musk changed the platform\u2019s algorithms to promote biased content.",
      "Musk\u2019s public attacks on left-leaning politicians, support for hard-right policies and loose handling of facts have prompted rebukes from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Italian President Sergio Mattarella, and Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.",
      "X did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Musk\u2019s dominance creates a strong incentive for people seeking to increase their clout \u2014 or their revenues, through the platform\u2019s monetization options \u2014 to exploit these network effects and try to get Musk to engage with their content.",
      "\u201cPeople know that he\u2019s gearing everything towards him,\u201d said Graham, the digital media scholar in Australia. \u201cThey\u2019re doing everything they can to get close to this person because he is the moneymaker.\u201d",
      "Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, for example, has benefited from the Musk effect. AfD coleader Alice Weidel helped lead the party, which advocates for nationalist and anti-immigrant policies, to second place in German parliamentary elections in February.",
      "When Musk interacted with her account in the run-up to those elections, the average number of daily views she got rose from about 230,000 to 2.2 million.",
      "Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency in May classified Weidel\u2019s party as a right-wing extremist organization, which would subject the AfD to greater surveillance. The party, which maintains that it\u2019s a victim of politically motivated defamation, promptly filed a lawsuit against the move, which Musk, along with top U.S. officials blasted as an attack on free speech. The designation has been suspended pending judicial review.",

      "AfD officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Naomi Seibt, a German climate skeptic, pinged Musk nearly 600 times between October 2022 and Jan. 2025. Musk finally engaged in June 2024, when he asked her to explain why the AfD is so controversial in Germany.",
      "Since then, Musk has replied to, quoted or tagged Seibt more than 50 times, and her followers have grown by more than 320,000 since Musk took over the platform. On days Musk interacted with Seibt, her posts, on average, got 2.6 times as many views.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t intentionally \u2018invade\u2019 Elon\u2019s algorithm,\u201d Seibt told AP. \u201cObviously Elon has a lot of influence and can help share a message even with those who are usually glued to the legacy media, particularly in Germany.\u201d",

      "Musk has also boosted the influence of political insurgents in the U.K. Days before British national elections last July, Musk took to X to ask Nigel Farage, the leader of the populist Reform U.K. party: \u201cWhy does the media keep calling you far-right? What are your policies?\u201d",
      "Farage replied eagerly: \u201cBecause we believe in family, country and strong borders. Call me!\u201d",
      "Such interactions from Musk helped Farage more than triple his daily audience. Farage did not reply to requests for comment.",
      "In Spain, Rub\u00e9n Pulido, a columnist for a newspaper published by the populist Vox party\u2019s think tank, hit the jackpot in August, when Musk responded to two posts in which he argued that rescue boats operated by nongovernmental organizations effectively help smugglers move migrants to Europe. Pulido\u2019s visibility soared. On days Musk engaged with him, his account got nearly 300,000 views \u2014 roughly three times more than usual.",
      "When Musk didn\u2019t interact with Pulido\u2019s account, the results were just as clear. In January, he again inveighed against migrant rescues and sought to get Musk\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cHi @elonmusk! Speak up,\u201d he urged.",
      "Three weeks later, he tweeted: \u201cPerhaps @elonmusk might find this interesting.\u201d",
      "That post garnered just 5,128 views.",
      "Pulido did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "While Musk helped boost the accounts of such fringe parties and rising influencers, his interactions did not provide as stark a benefit to more established politicians, AP found. That was true for both Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose ruling Brothers of Italy party has neo-fascist roots, and Dutch politician Geert Wilders, an anti-Islamic firebrand who has been called the Dutch Donald Trump.",

      "Tommy Robinson, a British anti-immigration agitator who was released from prison in May, after serving a reduced sentence of seven months for contempt of court, has a link to his fundraising page on his X profile. Interactions from Musk more than doubled Robinson\u2019s daily views, from around 380,000 to nearly 850,000. Robinson \u2014 whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2014 could not be reached for comment",
      "Radio Genoa, an account reportedly investigated by Italian authorities last year for allegedly spreading hate speech about migrants, used X to publicize a call for a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for legal defense. Radio Genoa has pinged Musk dozens of times over the last three years, and for good reason: On days Musk engaged with him, the views on his account doubled. Radio Genoa\u2019s followers surged from less than 200,000 before Musk\u2019s engagement to over 1.2 million. Radio Genoa could not be reached for comment.",
      "Eva Vlaardingerbroek -- a conservative Dutch political commentator dubbed the \u201cshieldmaiden of the far-right\u201d whose account Musk has engaged with three dozen times -- uses X to solicit tips and has creator status, which allows her to charge subscription fees.

      "Musk has also advocated for Matteo Salvini, vice premier of Italy and the leader of the hard-right, anti-migrant League party. On X, Musk\u2019s interactions boosted Salvini\u2019s daily visibility more than fourfold.

      "Before Fidias Panayiotou \u2014 a 25-year-old social media influencer from Cyprus with no political experience \u2014 won a surprise seat as an independent in the European Parliament last year, he spent weeks camped outside Twitter and Space X headquarters in a highly publicized quest to hug the world\u2019s richest man. In January 2023, his wish came true. Their embrace went viral.",

      "Since taking his seat, Panayiotou -- whose positions often also reflect the views of Cyprus\u2019 traditional leftist establishment -- has praised X on the floor of the European Parliament, pushed back against regulations that impact the platform, and credited Musk with sparking his call to fire 80% of EU bureaucrats.",
      "Musk, evidently, was pleased. \u201cVote for Fidias,\u201d he posted on X, an endorsement that was viewed more than 11.5 million times. \u201cHe is smart, super high energy and genuinely cares about you!\u201d",

      "A federal appeals court has upheld a jury verdict condemning Google\u2019s Android app store as an illegal monopoly, clearing the way for a federal judge to enforce a potentially disruptive shakeup that\u2019s designed to give consumers more choices",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal appeals court has upheld a jury verdict condemning Google's Android app store as an illegal monopoly, clearing the way for a federal judge to enforce a potentially disruptive shakeup that's designed to give consumers more choices.",
      "The unanimous ruling issued Thursday by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals delivers a double-barreled legal blow for Google, which has been waylaid in three separate antitrust trials that resulted in different pillars of its internet empire being declared as domineering scofflaws monopolies since late 2023.",
      "The unsuccessful appeal represents a major victory for video game maker Epic Games, which launched a legal crusade targeting Google\u2019s Play Store for Android apps and Apple\u2019s iPhone app store nearly five years ago in an attempt to bypass exclusive payment processing systems that charged 15% to 30% commissions on in-app transactions.",
      "The jury's December 2023 rebuke of Google's app store for Android-powered smartphones began a cascade of setbacks that includes monopoly judgements against the company's ubiquitous search engine last year and the technology underlying its digital ad network earlier this year.",
      "Although not as lucrative as Google's search engine or ad system, the Play Store for Android apps has long been a gold mine that generated billions of dollars in annual revenue by taking a 15% to 30% cut from in-app transactions funneled through the company's own payment processing system.",
      "Following a month-long trial, a nine-person jury determined that Google had rigged its system to thwart alternative app stores from offering better deals to consumers and software developers. That verdict resulted in U.S. District Judge James Donato ordering Google to tear down digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition, triggering the company's appeal to overturn the jury's finding and void the judge's mandated shakeup.",
      "But a three-judge panel that heard Google's appeal in February rejected its lawyers' contention that Donato erred by allowing the case to be determined by a jury that deviated from the market definition outlined by another federal judge who mostly sided with Apple in Epic's case against the iPhone maker's app store.",
      "Epic's lawsuit \"was replete with evidence that Google\u2019s anticompetitive conduct entrenched its dominance, causing the Play Store to benefit from network effects,\" the judges wrote in the decision.",

      "Unless Google can extend the enforcement delay placed on Donato's order issued last October, the company will have to begin an overhaul that includes making the Play Store's entire library of more than 2 million Android apps available to would-be rivals and also help distribute the alternative options. Google has argued that the required revisions will raise privacy and security risks by exposing consumers to scam artists and hackers masquerading as legitimate app stores.",
      "But Epic's lawyers have ridiculed Google's warnings about the changes as scare tactics in a desperate attempt to protect the fortunes of its corporate parent Alphabet Inc.",
      "Although Epic fell short in its attempt to have the iPhone's app store declared a monopoly, that case resulted in a judge issuing an order that required Apple to surrender exclusive control over the payment processing of in-app transactions and allow links to alternative systems without collecting a commission.",
      "Besides being hit with Donato's order, Google still faces further trouble ahead that could leave an even bigger dent in its finances.",
      "As part of the effort to address Google\u2019s illegal monopoly in search, a federal judge is weighing a proposal by the U.S. Justice Department that would require the sale of its Chrome web browser and ban the multibillion dollar deals that company has been making with Apple and others to lock-in its search engine as the main gateway to the internet.",
      "Google is also facing a proposed breakup of its advertising technology as part of the countermeasures to its monopoly in that business. A trial on that proposal is scheduled to begin in September.",

      "Musk is a kingmaker on the platform he acquired in 2022 for $44 billion. He has used his influence to cultivate hard-right politicians and insurgent activists across Europe. A retweet or reply from Musk can lead to millions of views and tens of thousands of new followers, according to an Associated Press analysis of public data.",
      "That fact has not been lost on influencers who have tagged Musk persistently, seeking a reply or a retweet. It has also fueled concerns in Europe about foreign meddling -- not from Russia or China, but from the United States.",
      "\u201cEvery alarm bell needs to ring,\u201d Christel Schaldemose, a vice president of the European Parliament who works on electoral interference and digital regulation, told AP.",

      "Since acquiring Twitter in October 2022, Elon Musk\u2019s followers have more than doubled, to over 220 million. No other large account has shown such high or consistent growth.",
      "The result: If Musk\u2019s X account is his megaphone, it has gotten a lot bigger since he took over -- a change that has global implications.",
      "The accounts Musk has been promoting are part of a growing global alliance of nationalistic parties and individuals united in common cause to halt migration, overturn progressive policies and promote an absolutist vision of free speech, which has rattled the foundation of a trans-Atlantic bond that guided U.S. and European relations for over eight decades.",
      "Several of the accounts AP analyzed belong to people who have faced allegations of illegal behavior in their own countries. Tommy Robinson, an anti-immigrant agitator in the U.K., was sentenced in October to 18 months in prison for violating a court order blocking him from making libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee. Bjoern Hoecke, a politician from Germany\u2019s Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party, was convicted last year of knowingly using a Nazi slogan in a speech.",
      "Italian vice premier Matteo Salvini was acquitted in December of allegations he illegally detained 100 migrants aboard a humanitarian rescue ship",
      "Among the others examined by AP: Alice Weidel, who helped lead Germany\u2019s Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party to its best electoral showing this year; Eva Vlaardingerbroek, a Dutch influencer known as the \u201cshieldmaiden of the far-right\u201d; Naomi Seibt, a German activist dubbed the \u201canti-Greta Thunberg\u201d now living in what amounts to political exile in Washington DC; Rub\u00e9n Pulido and Foro Madrid, both associated with Spain\u2019s populist Vox party; and Fidias Panayioutou, a politician from Cyprus who has also advocated for Musk\u2019s companies.",
      "These accounts collectively gained roughly 5 million followers from the time Musk took over Twitter in October 2022 through January of this year. Most saw triple-digit percentage increases in their followers -- as high as 920%, or in one case of a tiny account exploding over that time, topping 6,000%. Even some accounts that grew more steadily on their own saw their follower counts sharply begin rising once Musk started interacting with them. Similarly, on days Musk interacted with a post, the number of views the account got soared \u2014 in most cases, accruing two to four times as many views, with a few seeing boosts 30 or 40 times their normal daily viewership.",
      "More established players in Musk\u2019s orbit -- like Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose ruling Brothers of Italy party has neo-fascist roots \u2014 benefit less when Musk interacts with them on X, AP found.",

      "Here are some things to know about the amoeba, its latest victim and other dangers on freshwater lakes:",
      "The amoeba's scientific name is Naegleria fowleri and it is most dangerous in water that stays for a while over 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius), including in lakes and rivers in the U.S. and other places with hot, sometimes dry summers like Pakistan and Australia. Infections have been reported in 26 U.S. states as far north as Minnesota.",
      "The amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerve in the nose. Once inside, it causes an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.",
      "Symptoms start as a fairly standard headache and nausea. By the time the pain becomes severe, it is almost always too late to save the infected person. Of the 167 cases reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the deaths happened within five days of getting sick, according to the CDC.",
      "One infection in a body of water doesn\u2019t increase the chances of another infection in the same body of water, the agency said. The amoeba cannot move from one person to another.",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

      "China has been public about its ambition to build its own version of Starlink to meet both domestic national security needs and compete with Starlink in foreign markets. In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X\u2019s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",
      "U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cUkraine was a warning shot for the rest of us,\u201d said Nitin Pai, co-founder and director of the Takshashila Institution, a public policy research center based in Bangalore, India. \u201cFor the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

      "When big infrastructure projects spring up, one crucial law \u2014 the National Environmental Policy Act \u2014 has for decades been a key way the government has required powerful industry interests to consider the environment and the public\u2019s voice",
      "When President Donald Trump rolled out a plan to boost artificial intelligence and data centers, a key goal was wiping away barriers to rapid growth.",
      "And that meant taking aim at the National Environmental Policy Act \u2014 a 55-year-old, bedrock law aimed at protecting the environment through a process that requires agencies to consider a project's possible impacts and allows the public to be heard before a project is approved. Data centers, demanding vast amounts of energy and water, have aroused strong opposition in some communities.",
      "The AI Action Plan Trump announced last week would seek to sweep aside NEPA, as it's commonly known, to streamline environmental reviews and permitting for data centers and related infrastructure. Republicans and business interests have long criticized NEPA for what they see as unreasonable slowing of development, and Trump\u2019s plan would give \u201ccategorical exclusions\u201d to data centers for \u201cmaximum efficiency\u201d in permitting.",
      "A spokeswoman for the White House Council on Environmental Quality said the administration is \u201cfocused on driving meaningful NEPA reform to reduce the delays in federal permitting, unleashing the ability for America to strengthen its AI and manufacturing leadership.\"",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s par for the course for this administration. The attitude is to clear the way for projects that harm communities and the environment,\u201d said Erin Doran, senior staff attorney at environmental nonprofit Food & Water Watch.",
      "Here's what to know about this key environmental law, and Trump's effort to weaken it:",
      "NEPA is a foundational environmental law in the United States, \u201cessentially our Magna Carta for the environment,\u201d said Wendy Park, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, another environmental group, referring to the 13th century English legal text that formed the basis for constitutions worldwide.",
      "Signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1970, NEPA requires federal agencies proposing actions such as building roads, bridges or energy projects to study how their project will affect the environment. Private companies are also frequently subject to NEPA standards when they apply for a permit from a federal agency.",
      "In recent years, the law has become increasingly important in requiring consideration of a project's possible contributions to climate change.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a really important function because otherwise we\u2019re just operating with blinders just to get the project done, without considering whether there are alternative solutions that might accomplish the same objective, but in a more environmentally friendly way,\" Park said.",
      "But business groups say NEPA routinely blocks important projects that often take five years or more to complete.",
      "\u201cOur broken permitting system has long been a national embarrassment,'' said Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Global Energy Institute. He called NEPA \u201ca blunt and haphazard tool\u201d that too often is used to block investment and economic development.",
      "The White House proposal comes as Congress is working on a permitting reform plan that would overhaul NEPA, addressing long-standing concerns from both parties that development projects -- including some for clean energy -- take too long to be approved.",
      "NEPA's strength \u2014 and usefulness \u2014 can depend on how it's interpreted by different administrations.",
      "Trump, a Republican, sought to weaken NEPA in his first term by limiting when environmental reviews are required and limiting the time for evaluation and public comment. Former Democratic President Joe Biden restored more rigorous reviews.",
      "In his second term, Trump has again targeted the law.",
      "An executive order that touched on environmental statutes has many agencies scrapping the requirement for a draft environmental impact statement. And the CEQ in May withdrew Biden-era guidance that federal agencies should consider the effects of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions when conducting NEPA reviews.",

      "John Ruple, a research professor of law at the University of Utah, said sidelining NEPA could actually slow things down. Federal agencies still have to comply with other environmental laws, like the Endangered Species Act or Clean Air Act. NEPA has an often overlooked benefit of forcing coordination with those other laws, he said.",
      "A botanist by training, Mary O\u2019Brien was working with a small organization in Oregon in the 1980s to propose alternative techniques to successfully replant Douglas fir trees that had been clear-cut on federal lands. Aerially sprayed herbicides aimed at helping the conifers grow have not only been linked to health problems in humans but were also killing another species of tree, red alders, that were beneficial to the fir saplings, O\u2019Brien said.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service had maintained that the herbicides' impact on humans and red alders wasn\u2019t a problem. But under NEPA, a court required the agency to redo their analysis and they ultimately had to write a new environmental impact statement.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental concept: \u2018Don\u2019t just roar ahead.\u2019 Think about your options,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",

Hunters, landowners, loggers and ranchers all had different opinions on how the restoration should be handled. She said NEPA\u2019s requirement to get the public involved made for better research and a better plan.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the laws that\u2019s the most often used by the public without the public being aware,\u201d said Stephen Schima, senior legislative counsel at environmental law nonprofit Earthjustice. \u201cNEPA has long been the one opportunity for communities and impacted stakeholders and local governments to weigh in.\u201d",
      "Schima said rolling back the power of NEPA threatens the scientific integrity of examining projects' full impacts.",
      "\u201cDecisions are going to be less informed by scientific studies, and that is one of the major concerns here,'' he said.",
      "Ruple said uncertainty from NEPA changes and competing opinions on how to comply with the law's requirements may invite even more litigation.",

      "Chances are, you've heard Julia Whelan's voice. She's the award-winning narrator behind more than 600 audiobooks by a long list of bestselling authors including Taylor Jenkins Reid,Emily Henry, Michael Crichton, V.E. Schwab and Kristin Hannah. She's also narrated long-form articles for The New Yorker, The Atlantic and Vanity Fair.",
      "You may have read her own writing, too. Whelan's first novel, 2018's \u201cMy Oxford Year,\u201d has been adapted to a Netflix film, out Friday, starring Sofia Carson. The story actually began as a screenplay by Allison Burnett and had been gestating in development for years. Whelan was brought in to help with the script because she had studied abroad at Oxford her junior year of college. Producers then asked if she thought it would make a good book.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Nothing has ever wanted to be a book more. Please let me do this,'\u201d she recalls. It ended up an international bestseller. Her second novel, 2022's \u201cThank You For Listening,\u201d was critically praised. (\u201cThank You For Listening\u201d is about a former actor-turned-audiobook narrator who falls in love with another audiobook narrator.)",

Statista projects this year it will reach $9.84 billion because of smartphones, the increased popularity of audio content and people's desire to multitask.

      "WHELAN: The only reason I was doing 70 books a year was because that\u2019s how many books you have to do when you\u2019re first starting out to keep your head above water because the rates are low. It would be OK if there were a kickback for success, but narrators don\u2019t get royalties. As we\u2019ve seen the industry grow and as we\u2019ve seen the cache of certain narrators expand, and we know listeners will seek out audiobooks that their favorite narrators record. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me that we should be cut out of the long-term financial benefit of success. Audiobrary does a profit-share model with writers, who I also feel don\u2019t get enough percentage of the pie, and a royalty share for narrators. We are also a direct-to-consumer retail channel, so when you buy directly from us, you\u2019re not giving 50-75% of that sale to a retailer. You\u2019re giving it directly to the people who made the product.",

      "The first news conference with Texas Democrats on Monday was with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in Albany. Hochul's message for Texas House Democrats was, \"You are on the right side of history. And you're not alone.\"",
      "\"As I said, history will judge us and how we respond to this moment. But here in New York, we will not stand on the sidelines with the timid souls on the sidelines who don't care and will not invest their heart and soul into this battle. This is a war,\" Hochul continued. \"We are at war and that's why the gloves are off. And I say, bring it on.\"",
      "Hochul said that she would seek to disband or change New York's independent redistricting commission through a constitutional amendment in response to Texas -- but admitted that doing so would not be possible before the 2028 election.

      "\u201cTell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cDo not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country.\u201d",

      "But Democrats had little desire to give in without the spending cut reversals or some other incentive, even though they too were eager to skip town after several long months of work and bitter partisan fights over legislation.",

    "story": [
      "A video showing the violent arrest of a Black college student in Florida has sparked calls for drivers to use cameras that show a view from inside their car",
      "A video that captured the brutal arrest of a Black college student pulled from his car and beaten by officers in Florida has led to an investigation and calls for motorists to consider protecting themselves by placing a camera inside their vehicles.",
      "William McNeil Jr. captured his February traffic stop on his cellphone camera, which was mounted above his dashboard. It offered a unique view, providing the only clear footage of the violence by officers, including punches to his head that can't clearly be seen in officer body camera footage released by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.",
      "Since McNeil had the foresight to record the encounter from inside the vehicle, \u201cwe got to see firsthand and hear firsthand and put it all in context what driving while Black is in America,\u201d said civil rights attorney Ben Crump, one of several lawyers advising McNeil.",
      "\u201cAll the young people should be recording these interactions with law enforcement,\" Crump said. Because what it tells us, just like with George Floyd, if we don\u2019t record the video, we can see what they put in the police report with George Floyd before they realized the video existed.\u201d",
      "McNeil was pulled over that day because officers said his headlights should have been on due to bad weather, his lawyers said. His camera shows him asking the officers what he did wrong. Seconds later, an officer smashes his window, strikes him as he sat in the driver\u2019s seat and then pulls him from the car and punches him in the head. After being knocked to the ground, McNeil was punched six more times in his right thigh, a police report states.",
      "The incident reports don't describe the officer punching McNeil in the head. The officer, who pulled McNeil over and then struck him, described the force this way in his report: \u201cPhysical force was applied to the suspect and he was taken to the ground.\u201d",
      "But after McNeil posted his video online last month and it went viral, the sheriff's office launched an internal investigation, which is ongoing. A sheriff\u2019s office spokesperson declined to comment about the case this week, citing pending litigation, though no lawsuit has been filed over the arrest.",
      "McNeil said the ordeal left him traumatized, with a brain injury, a broken tooth and several stiches in his lip. His attorneys accused the sheriff's office of trying to cover up what really happened.",
      "\u201cOn Feb. 19, 2025, Americans saw what America is,\u201d said another of McNeil\u2019s lawyers, Harry Daniels. \u201cWe saw injustice. You saw abuse of police power. But most importantly we saw a young man that had a temperament to control himself in the face of brutality.\u201d",
      "The traffic stop, he said, was not only racially motivated but \u201cit was unlawful, and everything that stemmed from that stop was unlawful.\"",
      "McNeil is hardly the first Black motorist to record video during a traffic stop that turned violent \u2014 Philando Castile's girlfriend livestreamed the bloody aftermath of his death during a 2016 traffic stop near Minneapolis. But McNeil's arrest serves as a reminder of how cellphone video can show a different version of events than what is described in police reports, his lawyers said.",
      "Christopher Mercado, who retired as a lieutenant from the New York Police Department, agreed with McNeil's legal team's suggestion that drivers should record their police interactions and that a camera mounted inside a driver's car could offer a unique point of view.",
      "\"Use technology to your advantage,\" said Mercado, an adjunct assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing nefarious about it. It's actually a smart thing in my opinion.\u201d",
      "Rod Brunson, chairman of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland, said he thinks it's a good idea for citizens to film encounters with police \u2014 as long as doing so doesn't make the situation worse.",

      "\u201cI think that's a form of protection \u2014 it's safeguarding them against false claims of criminal behavior or interfering with officers, etc.,\u201d Brunson said.",
      "Although the sheriff's office declined to speak to The Associated Press this week, Sheriff T.K. Waters has spoken publicly about McNeil's arrest since video of the encounter went viral. He pushed back against some of the allegations made by McNeil's lawyers, noting that McNeil was told more than a half-dozen times to exit the vehicle.",
      "At a news conference last month, Waters also highlighted images of a knife in McNeil's car. The officer who punched him claimed in his police report that McNeil reached toward the floor of the car, where deputies later found the knife.",
      "Crump, though, said McNeil's video shows that he \u201cnever reaches for anything,\u201d and a second officer wrote in his report that McNeil kept his hands up as the other officer smashed the car window.",
      "A camera inside a motorist's vehicle could make up for some shortcomings of police bodycams, which can have a narrow field of view that becomes more limited the closer an officer gets to the person being filmed, Mercado said.",
      "However, after the police murder of Floyd, some states and cities debated how and when citizens should be able to capture video of police. The Constitution guarantees the right to record police in public, but a point of contention in some states has been whether a civilian's recording might interfere with the ability of officers to do their job. In Louisiana, for example, a new law makes it a crime to approach within 25 feet (7.6 meters) of a police officer in certain situations.",
      "Waters acknowledged those limitations at a news conference last year, as he narrated video of a wild brawl between officers and a fan in the stands at EverBank Stadium during a football game last year between the universities of Georgia and Florida.",
      "The sheriff showed the officers' bodycam videos during the start of the confrontation near the top of the stadium. But when the officers subdued the suspect and were pressing against him, the bodycam footage didn't capture much, so the sheriff switched to stadium security video shot from a longer distance away.",
      "In McNeil's case, the bodycam video didn't clearly capture the punches thrown. If it had, the case would have been investigated right away, the sheriff said.",
      "For the past 20 years, Brunson has been interviewing young Black men in several U.S. cities about their encounters with law enforcement. When he first began submitting research papers for academic review, many readers didn't believe the men's stories of being brutalized by officers.",
      "\u201cPeople who live in a civil society don't expect to be treated this way by the police. For them, their police interactions are mostly pleasant, mostly cordial,\" Brunson said.",
      "\u201cSo it's hard for people who don\u2019t have a tenuous relationship with the police to fathom that something like this happens,\u201d he said. \"And that\u2019s where video does play a big part because people can't deny what they see.\u201d",

Democrats hold 62 of the seats in the majority-Republican chamber and at least 51 left the state, said Josh Rush Nisenson, spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus.

      "In a ruling handed down Friday, U.S. District Judge William Smith granted Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha\u2019s motion for summary judgment that dismisses a lawsuit filed by a coalition of gun owners in 2023.",
      "The lawsuit stems from a Rhode Island law dictating how the state issues firearms permits.",
      "According to the statute, local officials are required to issue concealed-carry permits to anyone who meets the specific criteria outlined in the statute. However, it also allows the attorney general\u2019s office to issue open-carry permits \u201cupon a proper showing of need.\u201d Unlike municipalities, the attorney general is not required to issue such permits.",
      "The plaintiffs, largely led by Michael O\u2019Neil, a lobbyist for the Rhode Island 2nd Amendment Coalition and a firearm instructor, said in their initial complaint that the attorney general's office denied all seven of their applications in 2021 for an \u201cunrestricted\u201d firearm permit, allowing both open and concealed carry. Court documents show that the attorney general's office denied their permits because all of them had been granted \u201crestricted\u201d permits, which only allowed concealed carry.",
      "Smith said in his ruling that unrestricted permits \u201care a privilege and there is no constitutionally protected liberty interest in obtaining one.\u201d",
      "The plaintiffs had hoped for a similar ruling handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022, where the justices struck down a New York state law that had restricted who could obtain a permit to carry a gun in public.",

But investigators said the pilots might not have realized that because the barometric altimeter they were relying on was reading 80 to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) lower than the altitude registered by the flight data recorder.",
      "The NTSB subsequently found similar discrepancies in the altimeters of three other helicopters from the same unit.",
      "An expert with Sikorsky, which makes the Black Hawks, said the one that crashed was an older model that lacked the air data computers that make for more accurate altitude readings in newer versions.",
      "Army Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that an 80- to 100-foot (24- to 30-meter) discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter would not be alarming, because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Plus Army pilots strive to stay within 100 feet (30 meters) of target altitude on flights, so they could still do that even with their altimeters that far off.",
      "But Rick Dressler of medevac operator Metro Aviation told the NTSB that imprecision would not fly with his helicopters. When a helicopter route like the one the Black Hawk was flying that night includes an altitude limit, Dressler said, his pilots consider that a hard ceiling.",
      "Both tried to deflect responsibility for the crash, but the testimony highlighted plenty of things that might have been done differently. The NTSB\u2019s final report will be done next year, but there likely will not be one single cause identified for the crash.",
      "\u201cI think it was a week of reckoning for the FAA and the U.S. Army in this accident,\u201d aviation safety consultant and former crash investigator Jeff Guzzetti said.",
      "Army officials said the greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Ronald Reagan International Airport with separation distances as small as 75 feet (23 meters) between helicopters and planes when planes are landing on a certain runway at Reagan.",

      "\u201cThe fact that we have less than 500-foot separation is a concern for me,\u201d said Scott Rosengren, chief engineer in the office that manages the Army\u2019s utility helicopters.",
      "Army Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vechten said he was surprised the air traffic controller let the helicopter proceed while the airliner was circling to land at Reagan\u2019s secondary runway, which is used when traffic for the main runway stacks up and accounts for about 5% of flights.",
      "Van Vechten said he was never allowed to fly under a landing plane as the Black Hawk did, but only a handful of the hundreds of times he flew that route involved planes landing on that runway. Other pilots in the unit told crash investigators it was routine to be directed to fly under landing planes, and they believed that was safe if they stuck to the approved route.",
      "Frank McIntosh, the head of the FAA\u2019s air traffic control organization, said he thinks controllers at Reagan \u201cwere really dependent upon the use of visual separation\u201d to keep traffic moving through the busy airspace. The NTSB said controllers repeatedly said they would just \u201cmake it work.\u201d They sometimes used \u201csqueeze plays\u201d to land planes with minimal separation.",
      "On the night of the crash, a controller twice asked the helicopter pilots whether they had the jet in sight, and the pilots said they did and asked for visual separation approval so they could use their own eyes to maintain distance. Testimony at the hearing raised serious questions about how well the crew could spot the plane while wearing night vision goggles and whether the pilots were even looking in the right spot.",
      "The controller acknowledged in an interview that the plane\u2019s pilots were never warned when the helicopter was on a collision path, but controllers did not think telling the plane would have made a difference at that point. The plane was descending to land and tried to pull up at the last second after getting a warning in the cockpit, but it was too late.",
      "An FAA working group tried to get a warning added to helicopter charts back in 2022 urging pilots to use caution whenever the secondary runway was in use, but the agency refused. The working group said \u201chelicopter operations are occurring in a proximity that has triggered safety events. These events have been trending in the wrong direction and increasing year over year.\u201d",
      "Separately, a different group at the airport discussed moving the helicopter route, but those discussions did not go anywhere. And a manager at a regional radar facility in the area urged the FAA in writing to reduce the number of planes taking off and landing at Reagan because of safety concerns.",
      "The NTSB has also said the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan in the three years before the collision,",
      "NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said \u201cevery sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that.\u201d But after the accident, the FAA transferred managers out of the airport instead of acknowledging that they had been warned.",
      "\u201cWhat you did is you transferred people out instead of taking ownership over the fact that everybody in FAA in the tower was saying there was a problem,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cBut you guys are pointing out, \u2018Welp, our bureaucratic process. Somebody should have brought it up at some other symposium.\u2019\u201d",

      "PERKINSTON, Miss. -- In the embrace of a cheerfully chittering spider monkey named Louie, an Army veteran who grappled for decades with post-traumatic stress disorder says he finally feels at peace.",
      "\u201cBeing out here has brought a lot of faith back to me,\u201d said John Richard. \u201cThere's no feeling like it.\u201d",
      "The bond began last fall when Richard was helping two married veterans set up the Gulf Coast Primate Sanctuary, volunteering his time to build the enclosure that's now Louie's home in rural southeast Mississippi.",
      "During a recent visit, Louie quickly scampered up Richard's body, wrapping his arms and tail around him in a sort of hug. Richard, in turn, placed his hand on the primate's back and whispered sweetly until Louie disentangled himself and swung away.",
      "\u201cHe's making his little sounds in my ear, and you know, he's always telling you, \u2018Oh, I love you,\u2019\u201d Richard said. \u201c\u2018I know you're OK. I know you're not going to hurt me.\u2019\u201d",
      "Richard said his connection with Louie helped more than any other PTSD treatment he received since being diagnosed more than 20 years ago.",
      "It's a similar story for the sanctuary's founder, April Stewart, an Air Force veteran who said she developed PTSD as a result of military sexual trauma.",
      "\u201cIt was destroying my life. It was like a cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a trauma that was never properly healed.\u201d",
      "Stewart's love of animals was a way to cope. She didn\u2019t necessarily set out to create a place of healing for veterans with PTSD, but that\u2019s what the sanctuary has become for some volunteers.",
      "\u201cBy helping the primates learning to trust, we\u2019re also reteaching ourselves how to trust, and we\u2019re giving ourselves grace with people,\u201d she said.",
      "Her 15-acre property, nestled amid woods and farmland, is filled with rescue dogs, two rather noisy geese and a black cat. It's also now home to three spider monkeys, two squirrel monkeys and two kinkajous, a tropical mammal that is closely related to raccoons.",

Checking on the animals \u2014 changing their blankets, bringing food and water \u2014 is one of the first and last things Stewart does each day.",
      "However, she can't do it alone. She relies on a group of volunteers for help, including several other veterans, and hopes to open the sanctuary to the public next summer for guided educational tours.",
      "Stewart and her husband, also a veteran, decided to open the sanctuary in October after first rescuing and rehoming monkeys. With the help of two exotic-animal veterinarians, they formed a foundation that governs the sanctuary \u2014 which she said is the only primate sanctuary in Mississippi licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture \u2014 and ensures the animals will be cared for even when the Stewarts are no longer able to run it themselves.",
      "All the animals were once somebody's pet, but their owners eventually couldn't take care of them. Stewart stressed that primates do not make good or easy pets. They need lots of space and socialization, which is often difficult for families to provide.",
      "The sanctuary's goal is to provide as natural a habitat as possible for the animals, Stewart said, and bring them together with their own species.",

      "Her publicist, Don Murry Grubbs, said she died Friday after succumbing to complications from an intestinal infection.",
      "Known as \"Miss Country Soul\" for her unique vocal style, Seely was a trailblazer for women in country music, celebrated for her spirited nonconformity and for a string of undeniable hits in the '60s and '70s.",
      "Her second husband, Gene Ward, died in December. In May, Seely revealed that she was in recovery after undergoing multiple back surgeries, two emergency procedures and spending 11 days in the ICU. She also suffered a bout of pneumonia.",
      "\"Rehab is pretty tough, but each day is looking brighter and last night, I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. And it was neon, so I knew it was mine!\" she said in a statement at the time. \"The unsinkable Seely is working her way back.\"",

      "Seely was born in July 1940, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, about two hours north of Pittsburgh and was raised in nearby Townville. Her love of country music was instant; her mother sang, and her father played the banjo. When she was a child, she sang on local radio programs and performed on local television. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job with Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \"Don't Touch Me,\" the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",
      "Cochran and Seely were married in 1969 and divorced in 1979.",
      "Seely broke boundaries in her career \u2014 at a time when country music expected a kind of subservience from its women performers, Seely was a bit of a rebel, known for wearing a miniskirt on the Grand Ole Opry stage when it was still taboo.",
      "And she had a number of country hits in the '60s and '70s, including three Top 10 hits on what is now known as Billboard's hot country songs chart: \"Don't Touch Me,\" 1967's \"I'll Love You More (Than You Need)\" and 1973's \"Can I Sleep In Your Arms?\", adapted from the folk song \"Can I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight Mister?\"",
      "In the years since, Seely continued to release albums, perform and host, regularly appearing on country music programming. Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones and Little Jimmy Dickens.",
      "And Seely never stopped working in country music. Since 2018, she's hosted the weekly \"Sunday's with Seely\" on Willie Nelson's Willie's Roadhouse SiriusXM channel. That same year, she was inducted into the Music City Walk of Fame.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 15:38:49 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer's love for the Great American Songbook goes far beyond standards written by Gershwin or Porter.",
    "story": [
      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

      "\"Amy Bradley is Missing,\" directed by Ari Mark and Phil Lott, explores the unsolved case that has puzzled investigators for nearly three decades. Bradley disappeared from her family's cruise, leaving behind numerous theories but few concrete answers.",
      "\"The Amy Bradley story is something if you've been around the genre, you know about it,\" Mark said. \"It's one of the most baffling mysteries of a disappearance case.\"",
      "The case presents multiple scenarios for what may have happened to Bradley. The film floats several theories: she could have accidentally fallen overboard, committed suicide or been the victim of foul play. Investigators have noted that the sliding door to her balcony was found ajar, raising questions about whether she left voluntarily or was taken against her will.",
      "Mark and Lott said they were drawn to the story after learning that existing coverage barely scratched the surface of the case. After meeting with Bradley's parents, Ron and Iva Bradley, in Virginia, the directors realized the family deserved justice.",
      "\"These are people who are living with such pain every single day,\" Lott said. \"It's a very real hope and possibility every single day that they could bring Amy home.\"",
      "The documentary has generated new tips since its Netflix release, though the directors declined to share details publicly. They emphasized the importance of carefully vetting information and involving law enforcement in any potential leads.",
      "One challenge in the case has been witnesses who claim to have seen Bradley over the years but didn't come forward until long after her disappearance. The directors said many people don't realize the significance of what they witnessed until later connecting it to Bradley's story through media coverage.",

      "Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support.

    "summary": "Prices could tick higher in 2025 as businesses pass tariff costs onto consumers, Cleveland Fed's Beth Hammack tells CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Americans could see inflation tick higher in 2025 as businesses start to pass on the cost of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers through price hikes, Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady in an interview.",
      "So far this year, inflation has remained relatively muted despite President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs, partially because many businesses stockpiled goods and manufacturing parts ahead of the import duties' implementation. Some business facing higher tariffs also chose to hold off on passing cost increases onto consumers as they awaited more clarity around where tariff rates would settle. Additionally, the Trump administration instituted numerous pauses on threatened levies, delaying cost increases for businesses and consumers.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pushing the Fed to cut interest rates, citing subdued inflation numbers and cuts from other major central banks, such as in the U.K. and the European Union. But the Federal Reserve last week maintained its benchmark rate at the same level where it's been parked since December 2024, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell citing the risks of higher inflation due to the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "That's a danger also highlighted by Hammack, who said she believes inflation could reach a 3% annual rate this year, representing a pace that would be 1 percentage point higher than the Fed's goal of a 2% annualized rate.",
      "\"Individual businesses have been trying to hold back on, passing on those [tariff] costs, because they're worried about what it might mean for demand,\" Hammack told O'Grady. \"They've been selling inventory that they'd accumulated early in the year, and so they didn't need to charge for the tariffs on that, but they're coming through those stockpiles.\"",
      "She added, \"They're coming to the point where their margins are getting squeezed and they need to start passing that onto consumers.\"",
      "Many households are still struggling with the cost of living, with half of Americans saying they view grocery prices as a major source of stress in their life right now, outpacing housing cost and health care, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\"Two-speed economy\"",
      "Hammack said the U.S. appears to be in a \"two-speed economy.\"",
      "\"The top part of the income spectrum is doing incredibly well,\" she noted. \"They're feeling a lot of excitement about the stock market, how their 401(k)s are doing, and they're feeling flush with cash.\"",
      "But, she added, low-income households are facing a lot of economic challenges.",
      "\"I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef,\" Hammack said. \"They're buying hot dogs, they're looking at their $400 emergency fund, and it's not able to pay for a new air conditioner or the car repairs that it used to be able to pay for.\"",
      "Price pressures from the Trump administration's tariffs could cause a one-time increase in costs as businesses adjust their prices to cover the import duties, she added. Fed officials are focused on making sure that the price hikes don't become what she calls a \"more persistent inflationary problem.\"",
      "At the same time, Friday's disappointing jobs report shows that the labor market is also facing fresh challenges, with employers hiring fewer workers than expected in July. The Fed's mandate is to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with the central bank turning to interest rate hikes to cool inflation or rate cuts to help the job market.",
      "With both inflation on the rise and the job market experiencing some headwinds, the Fed has a delicate balancing act, she noted.",
      "\"This is a really challenging time for monetary policy makers, because both sides of our mandate are being challenged,\" Hammack said. \"And so the decision of which way to go and how quickly to move is a really difficult one right now.",

      "\"China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,\" China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff.",
      "\"Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.",
      "The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable \u2014 after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the \"Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.\"",
      "\"We don't want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,\" Bessent said.",
      "On Thursday, he called the Chinese \"tough\" negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. \"I believe that we have the makings of a deal,\" Bessent told CNBC.",
      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \"Realizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\" for Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",
      "A CBS News investigation has revealed that\u00a0China is still secretly buying Iranian oil and evading U.S. sanctions by using what's known as a \"dark fleet\" to transfer oil from ship to ship in the middle of the sea.",

      "\"If the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China's consistent official stance,\" said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Mr. Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Mr. Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \"the one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Mr. Trump has made it clear he wants a \"headline-grabbing deal\" with Xi, \"so rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \"strategic solidarity\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\"Beijing simply can't afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \"It's too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\"",
      "A 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that roughly 80% to 90% of the oil exported by Iran went to China. The Chinese economy benefits from the more than 1 million barrels of Iranian oil it imports per day.",

In April, Chinese imports of Russian oil rose 20% over the previous month to more than 1.3 million barrels per day, according to the KSE Institute, an analytical center at the Kyiv School of Economics.",
      "This past week, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India's purchasing of Russian oil. India's Foreign Ministry said Friday its relationship with Russia was \"steady and time-tested.\"",

      "\"People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil,\" Miller said on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" He said the U.S. needs \"to get real about dealing with the financing of this war.\"",

      "Congressional Republicans who passed the budget reconciliation bill left room for states to use waivers to fast-track the national standards. Tara Sklar, a professor leading the University of Arizona's Health Law & Policy Program, said she expects states seeking certain stricter requirements to have a chance of approval, while more lenient ones may face denials.",
      "Federal officials may look favorably on Arizona's plan, Sklar said, as a five-year lifetime Medicaid limit is different from work requirements. Even if the federal government greenlights stricter work requirements than the federal law calls for, those programs are likely to face legal challenges, she added.",
      "The federal law includes an 80-hour-per-month minimum for work or education, with exemptions for certain adults, including people who are medically frail and parents with young, dependent children.",
      "Montana is the first state to draft a waiver application since Congress finalized national work requirements. State lawmakers first approved work requirements \u2014 called \"community engagement\" standards under the state plan \u2014 in 2019, but the state's application stalled through the end of the first Trump term and the Biden administration.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected again, Montana lawmakers lifted the 2025 expiration date of its Medicaid expansion program, making permanent the program that covered more than 76,000 adults in April, with the expectation that the Trump administration would approve work requirements. In mid-July, state officials released their draft plan to make that a reality \"as soon as is practicable.\"",
      "The Montana plan largely aligns with the federal law, but it would create additional exemptions, including for people who are homeless or fleeing domestic violence.",
      "Republican state Sen. Gayle Lammers said work requirements that also protect such people who need Medicaid were a big part of persuading legislators to keep the expansion program. At the time, officials didn't know where the federal government would land on work requirements. And now, Lammers said, it makes sense for Montana to stick to its plan.",
      "\"The state should have a say,\" Lammers said. \"We're very independent, and everyone is different.\"",
      "In South Carolina, state officials are seeking to roll out work requirements for a limited number of newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. South Carolina is one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, and yet the state submitted a request with the federal government in June for a partial Medicaid expansion that includes a work requirement component that largely reflects the new federal standards.",
      "In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, called South Carolina's proposal \"a state-specific solution.\"",
      "The only state with an active work requirement program now wants to scale it back and awaits federal approval to do so. \"Georgia Pathways to Coverage\" expires at the end of September unless CMS greenlights an extension of the program with a key change: requiring enrollees to document once a year that they're working, not monthly. That's a pivot away from the program's initial design but also differs from the new federal rules, which call for checks every six months.",
      "Fiona Roberts, a spokesperson for Georgia's Medicaid agency, said the state is still waiting to hear whether it needs to alter its plan.",
      "So Georgia is among the states in limbo, awaiting guidance from the federal government.",

    "story": [
      "Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said in an interview that aired Sunday that tariff rates are \"pretty much set\" on more than 60 trading partners after President Trump's executive order last week.",
      "\"So these, these tariff rates are pretty much set,\" Greer said in an interview Friday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan. \"I expect I do have my phone blowing up. There are trade ministers who, who want to talk more and see how they can work in a different way with the United States, but I think that we have, we're seeing truly the contours of the president's tariff plan right now with these rates.\"",
      "Hours ahead of the Trump administration's self-imposed deadline for baseline tariffs on Friday, the White House announced tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. All imports will have a 10% tariff rate as of Aug. 7, according to the executive order.",
      "When asked if Mr. Trump will be negotiating the tariff rate down in coming days, Greer answered, \"I don't think they will be,\" but he added these tariff rates are \"set rates pursuant to deals.\"",
      "\"When the president is looking at this, he looks at potential deals, and we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do,\" Greer said. \"And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then talking to his advisors, he makes a call on this.\"",
      "Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline, the Trump administration touted a number of deals for tariffs, including South Korea, the European Union and Britain. But other major U.S. trading partners did not reach deals, including Canada, which Mr. Trump levied a 35% tariff on goods not subject the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Canada is the U.S.' second-largest trading partner.",
      "\"The President's view with with every country, whether it's Canada or Mexico, and regardless of the kind of trade agreement we have in place, is that the net result of the trading system, whether it's our WTO agreements or our existing trade agreements, the net result has been that a lot of the manufacturing has gone overseas, and when that's the net result, you can't continue with that system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"So you know, I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is the President is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have,\" the trade adviser said.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who Brennan interviewed separately on \"Face the Nation,\" said that Bank of America economists have predicted that while the economy will still continue to grow, they are predicting \"less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that.\"",
      "As for the economic impact that tariffs will have on the economy, Moynihan said \"no one really knows, honestly, because this is a different regime than we've been in before.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Aug 2025 09:30:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Nik and Adinah Johnson, who retired in their forties, are part of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early), a movement that looks at work as a means to an end, and where frugality buys freedom from the rat race.",
    "story": [
      "On a recent Sunday morning, at a Bible camp outside of Gainesville, Florida, Nik Johnson got up to preach, not about hellfire and brimstone, but about a very different fire: Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE). \"Ultimately at the end of the day, financial independence really ain't about us,\" he said. \"It's about people that we love and the causes that we care about.\"",
      "This was Camp FI. Its attendees: retirees and aspiring retirees who looked a little on the young side.",
      "When Johnson met his wife, Adinah, some 30 years ago, she knew right away, he was a saver: \"Our first date, he had a coupon,\" she said.",
      "\"I did use a coupon! And I'm not ashamed about it,\" said Nik. \"I knew that if I presented a coupon and she had an issue with it, she was not my soulmate.\"",
      "Adinah's reaction? \"How many other coupons do you have? What's the best deal? Wait a minute, let's see what we could do here!\"",
      "Nik worked in software, while Adinah was in higher ed. And despite modest starting salaries, they managed to pay off their home and save $1.6 million by consuming less, saving more, and putting 300,000 miles on their beloved minivan, Big Red.",
      "Nik said, \"I shared this with Adinah: I always wanted to be to the point that when I got to 50 I didn't want to have to work. And so honestly, I didn't exactly know how to achieve that.\"",
      "Then, one day during the pandemic, Nik was poking around on the Internet and discovered the FIRE Movement, which led him to Camp FI \u2013 a group of hardcore savers and careful spenders who share tips, tricks and philosophical discourse with basically one goal \u2026 to get out of the rat race.",
      "It's all inspired by Peter Adeney, who blogs under the name Mr. Money Mustache. \"American life is so inefficient,\" he said. \"We're all just kind of following each other, what each other does, and not realizing where all of this time and money is slipping through our hands. So, start doing things that are different from what other people do, would probably be the first piece of advice.\"",
      "Adeney retired at age 30, and turned 50 this year. He said, \"I often think that, because I retired so early, I have lived a lot longer than a normal 50-year-old. Like, I feel like I retired 100 years ago, because I've had so many experiences. It's a great antidote to the usual thing, where people say, 'Life goes by too fast. Then, you miss it.'",
      "\"However, it doesn't solve your happiness problems,\" Adeney said. \"One of my friends who's also a blogger says, like, he still had to confront some demons and some emotional issues. And taking away his job just exposed them more, 'cause he could no longer distract himself from them.\"",
      "The key to saving for retirement, according to Adeney, is to figure out what's important to you \u2013 and trim your spending everywhere else.",
      "Vicki Robin is a sort of mythical figure in the FIRE Movement. She is the co-author (with Joe Dominguez) of the 1992 personal finance book, \"Your Money or Your Life.\" She said, \"As you start to elaborate what's important to you, you realize, like, 'I'm gonna minimize the amount of money I spend, 'cause that's my life energy.' And there's some formula that arises in your mind of, like, 'The less I spend, the more life I have.'\"",
      "Robin's philosophy is less about early retirement and more about asking what is \"enough,\" which differs for everyone. But the consensus of the FIRE Movement is that, to retire, you have to save and invest 25 times your yearly expenses, and then live off of a 4% drawdown each year.",
      "Robin said, \"It's just, 'Okay, how can I have enough for a life that's really happy, but no excess, so that I can liberate my time to do what I find I'm called to do, what I care to do?' And, you know, that evolves over time. I have a little phrase that I've said: I buy my freedom with my frugality every day.\"",
      "A frugality which Nik and Adina Johnson say they are now reaping the rewards of, along with their three children: a life less defined by the \"stuff\" they possess, and more by the freedom they enjoy.",
      "Nik said, \"They're gonna always remember this trip to Disney. But they're not gonna remember, you know, that extra pair of tennis shoes I bought my son. My son's not gonna look at me like, 'Hey Dad, remember that blazer you had on? Man, it was awesome!'\"",
      "Asked what these early retirees' day looks like, Adinah replied, \"Well, I have to pick up the kids, and then I have to take my son to football practice. And then whatever grocery shopping I may have needed to do while I was doing this interview, I need to go ahead and get some of that grocery shopping done.\"",
      "\"Doesn't sound like she needs my help for any of that; I'll probably go play golf,\" Nik laughed.",
      "I observed, \"Seems like one of you is more retired than the other one.\"",

      "\"No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media.",
      "He added, \"She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes.\"",

      "McEntarfer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Although Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the latest employment report revision for May and June undermines the data's accuracy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics frequently revises its previous job numbers to reflect new information, while past months' numbers are often revised both upwards and downwards. The previous revision was made in the June jobs report, when the BLS revised April and May's numbers higher.",
      "McEntarfer's firing drew criticism from economists and policy experts, who said the move threatens the integrity of economic data from a trusted federal agency",
      "Mr. Trump \"is firing the messenger because he doesn't seem to like jobs numbers that reflect how badly he's damaged the economy,\" Lily Roberts, managing director for Inclusive Growth at the Center for American Progress, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said in a statement.",

      "Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a social media post that Mr. Trump's dismissal of McEntarfer is \"basically unprecedented and will raise concerns about U.S. data integrity going forward,\" noting that BLS also issues closely watched data on inflation, wages and worker productivity.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers also expressed concern about the firing.",
      "\"The statistics are what they are,\" Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told CBS News. \"It's not the statistician's fault if the numbers are accurate and that they're not what the president had hoped for.\"",
      "In a social media post, Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said she supported the firing, and added that Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as acting commissioner. \"A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,\" she wrote.",
      "McEntarfer was named as the 16th commissioner of Labor Statistics in January 2024, after she was nominated by President Biden in 2023 and confirmed in early 2024 by the Senate.

      "Warren Buffett's\u00a0company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in\u00a0Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll.",
      "Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year.",
      "Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it must record the current value of its massive investment portfolio, even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprised shareholders by\u00a0selling off\u00a0a huge chunk of its Apple stake, which inflated the investment gains then.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies \u2014 major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses \u2014 generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Trump's tariffs.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that.",
      "Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it has had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products.",
      "This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands.",
      "Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft's core collection of processed foods.",
      "Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands.",
      "Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting when he announced that he plans to\u00a0give up the CEO title\u00a0at the end of the year and hand over operations to\u00a0Vice Chairman Greg Abel, but Buffett will remain Chairman.",
      "Berkshire shareholders might be disappointed that the company didn't repurchase any of its shares this quarter, even though the price has fallen more than 12% since just before Buffett announced his retirement.",
      "Many investors are watching Berkshire's BNSF closely after\u00a0rival Union Pacific announced\u00a0a plan to buy Norfolk Southern earlier this week to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. The speculation is that BNSF needs to pursue a merger with Eastern Rail CSX to be able to compete.",
      "But CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it isn't Buffett's style to jump into a deal just because the market thinks he should. Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation.",
      "\"He wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,\" Seifert said. \"I think one of the reasons why that cash hasn't been deployed is that valuations run through the Berkshire M-and-A model tend to be too rich. But if there's a logical case to be made they'll accept it.\"",
      "And BNSF appears to be doing fine right now on its own. The railroad recorded a 19% jump in its operating profit this quarter at $1.47 billion as it cut costs and delivered about 1% more shipments.",

    "summary": "Trade experts say the Trump administration's barrage of new tariffs could raise prices for consumers and cause headaches for businesses.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order hiking tariffs on U.S. imports could drive up consumer prices and prolong uncertainty for millions of businesses, trade experts said.",
      "Materials issued by the White House on Thursday outline new tariff rates for dozens of countries, but details remain scant on how to implement the trade agreements, said Barry Appleton, co-director of the New York Law School Center for International Law.",
      "\"The last thing businesses want to have are unanswered questions. They were looking for certainty, and what we have instead is a gigantic Rubik's Cube,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone has been waiting for 'Liberation Day' to be finished,\" he added, referring to the country-based tariff announcements Mr. Trump first made in early April. \"Instead, with this announcement, we have another perpetuation of what's going on.\"",
      "Under the Trump administration's new import duties, most countries will face a baseline tariff of at least 15%, although other nations will faces levies of more than 40%. The U.S. effective tariff rate is now 17%, according to Fitch Ratings \u2014 the highest in decades.",
      "That could mean pricier garments from Vietnam, shoes and toys from China, chocolate from Switzerland, and coffee from Brazil, according to economists. As a result, the revised U.S. tariffs could cost Americans an average of $2,048 per year, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the National Taxpayers Union, a nonpartisan advocacy organization.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued his tariff strategy is necessary to correct what he views as unfair trading practices and revive American manufacturing, and points to still-fairly-low inflation rates. But many economists warn\u00a0tariffs can lead\u00a0to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth, and some of the president's early trade moves\u00a0rattled financial markets.",
      "The White House has said that Mr. Trump's trade policies benefit Americans.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "On social media, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the tariffs are \"a knockout win over the distorted global trading order that has disadvantaged American workers, farmers, and manufacturers for decades.\"",
      "He added that Trump's foreign trade policy has achieved \"expansive new market access for U.S. exporters, increased tariffs to defend critical industries, and trillions of new manufacturing investments that will create great American jobs.\"",
      "Which products could get pricier?",
      "In the U.S., the products most commonly imported from abroad \u2014 and therefore most likely to see their prices rise because of sharply higher tariffs \u2014 include household appliances, furniture, cars, clothing, sports equipment, toys and cleaning products, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "The price of such goods rose about 1% in June, or more than double the increase in May, according to the investment research firm's analysis of consumption data, a sign that tariffs are starting to seep into the cost of everyday items.",
      "\"The question is really what's not going to go up in price. The costs were being eaten in the profits of companies, but that's not sustainable,\" Appleton said.",
      "Mr. Trump slapped some of the highest tariffs on key trade partners like Canada, a major provider of lumber to U.S. companies. That could lead to higher housing costs, according to Oxford. Some fruits and vegetables also could get pricier this winter as grocery stores leans on imports to stock store shelves, he said.",
      "U.S. automakers including Ford, GM and Stellantis have recently warned that higher U.S. tariffs will reduce their profits by billion of dollars. That is likely to increase new car prices, said Terence Lau, dean of the Syracuse University College of Law and formerly a government affairs executive at Ford.",
      "\"My advice to consumers back in April was that they should wait to buy cars,\" said Lau, who expects dealer prices for 2026 models to rise between 4% and 6%. \"In August, my advice is to buy now.\"",
      "Although many businesses are still selling inventory they imported earlier this year in a bid to avoid higher tariffs, subsequent imports will likely be subject to the newly announced levies when they arrive at U.S. ports, according to trade experts.",
      "\"A lot of businesses front-loaded goods to get them in the door before tariffs were announced. They'll now have to increase their costs as inventories dwindle and businesses start replenishing them,\" Oxford Economics' senior U.S. economist Matthew Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect cost hikes to peak in the second half of the year,\"",
      "Along with facing potentially higher prices, U.S. consumers could face reduced product choices stemming from supply-chain delays, according to economists. That's largely because companies unable to reshore manufacturing to the U.S. are likely to stop importing low-margin goods as they move to control costs.",
      "\"In many cases, tariffs will be so high that we'll create embargoes,\" Martin said. \"That will make it more difficult for retailers and distributors to get things out to market.\"",
      "Rodney Manzo, a supply-chain expert and senior director at Sage, a business management software company, said higher tariffs often end up affecting businesses and consumers in ways beyond the cash register.",
      "\"For the average shopper, the effects don't always show up as a big price hike on the shelf. Instead, it's subtler \u2014 fewer options, smaller quantities and less generous promotions,\" he said. \"Companies are quietly reducing [their stockpiles], reworking product specs or stripping out expensive components to hit margin targets.\"",

      "\"Sadly, employment appears set for a further summer slowdown as firms, facing renewed cost volatility from escalating trade tensions, remain focused on managing labor costs through reduced hiring, performance-based layoffs, restrained wage growth and lower entry-level wages,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said in a report. \"We anticipate job creation will weaken further, remaining below trend in the coming months, with the unemployment rate likely rising toward 4.8% by early 2026.\"",
      "The health care sector saw the biggest gains in July, adding 55,000 jobs. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 12,000 cuts in July.",
      "What it means",
      "Some market analysts said the subpar job growth in July suggests that stepped-up U.S. tariffs on the country's economic partners are weighing on the labor market. President Trump issued an executive order late Thursday that imposes tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"Today's Jobs report is unambiguously soft and a reflection of the trade and tariff impact on economic growth,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"Both the actual report and the big negative revisions are more evidence that the trade policy will slow growth.\"",
      "Beyond the ups and down of the job market, meanwhile, many Americans are struggling in an economy bifurcated between rich and poor.",
      "\"The top part of the income spectrum is doing incredibly well,\" Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady in an interview. \"At the bottom end of the spectrum, what I hear when I'm out in the district is I hear a lot of struggle. I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef. They're buying hot dogs.\"",
      "The latest job numbers could spur Federal Reserve officials to cut interest rates at their next meeting in September, according to economists. The central bank opted this week to\u00a0hold its benchmark rate steady. President Trump has pushed for a rate cut, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that policymakers remain cautious about lowering rates until the impact of tariffs on the economy is clear.",
      "\"With this morning's payroll miss \u2014 and the downward revisions that came with it \u2014 the Fed will again need to balance a slowing job market with inflation which isn't slowing fast enough,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",

      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers. Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to recent college graduates have declined 15%\u00a0over the past year, according to Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z employees. Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",
      "While AI is already starting to reshape how Americans work, for now other factors are having a more immediate impact on the labor market. More than 292,000 positions have been eliminated this year due to cuts linked to the Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), an initiative to reduce federal spending spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found.",
      "\"We are seeing the federal budget cuts implemented by DOGE impact non-profits and health care in addition to the government,\" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "Layoffs are also accelerating in the vast retail sector as tariffs raise the cost of doing business, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Retailers have announced more than 80,000 cuts through July, up nearly 250% compared to the same period last year, the firm found.",
      "\"Retailers are being impacted by tariffs, inflation and ongoing economic uncertainty causing layoffs and store closures. Further declines in consumer spending could trigger additional losses,\" the group said.",

    "summary": "Millions of borrowers in forbearance through the SAVE plan will see interest start accruing on Friday. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who had signed up for a Biden-era repayment plan will start seeing interest accrue to their accounts starting today, Aug. 1, a change that could result in an additional $300 in monthly costs for the typical borrower, according to one analysis.",
      "The Department of Education announced on July 9 that it planned to restart charging interest for borrowers enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created by the Biden administration in 2023 to help lighten the financial burden faced by millions of student loan borrowers.",
      "But two courts last year issued injunctions against the SAVE plan, effectively halting the repayment program. In response, the Biden administration moved all of the SAVE plan's enrollees into zero-interest forbearance, meaning that their loans were temporarily placed on hold and interest stopped accruing.",
      "The Education Department says resuming interest on the loans represents a measure of \"fiscal responsibility,\" according to its July 9 statement. But the monetary impact on the roughly 8 million borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan could be significant, given that a typical borrower could see an increase of $300 per month due to new interest charges, according to a calculation by the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with higher-education debt.",
      "SAVE enrollees can opt to remain in forbearance, which means they won't need to make monthly payments, but \"the most significant impact is that your total loan balance will start growing again\" because interest will resume, Bethany Hubert, a financial aid specialist at lender Earnest, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"If you choose not to make payments, the accruing interest can really balloon your balance, making it much more challenging and expensive to pay back over time.\"",
      "How much will my payment increase?",
      "While the typical borrower could see costs increase by about $300 per month, or $3,500 per year, the specific increase will depend on your loan balance.",
      "Borrowers can check how the resumption of interest on their loans will impact their payments by going to the\u00a0loan simulator\u00a0on the Federal Student Aid website, Hubert said, although she noted that it might not yet include all the recent changes impacting student loans.",
      "Should I change repayment plans?",
      "Borrowers should evaluate the four repayment plans available, which can be found at here at the Federal Student Aid website, Hubert said.",
      "Changing plans will depend on your situation, added Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors, a nonprofit that provides free advice for student borrowers.",
      "Borrowers who are seeking loan forgiveness, which can be earned after repaying a loan for anywhere from 10 years to 25 years, depending on the plan, may want switch because \"the SAVE forbearance doesn't count towards the payments needed to get the balance forgiven under those plans,\" she said.",
      "What about the new Repayment Assistance Plan?",
      "There's also a new repayment plan in the works that borrowers could consider, called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), which is due in 2026 and is part of the \"big beautiful\" tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4.",
      "\"For earners who make less than $10,000, their [monthly] payment will be $10 under RAP,\" Hubert said.",
      "For those with adjusted gross income (AGI) above $10,000 per year, the repayments will be based on 1% to 10% of their income minus $50 in payments each month for each child the borrower has. \"With that in mind, we can estimate that a borrower who has an AGI of $45,000 and no children would have their monthly payment set at $150,\" she added.",
      "RAP payments could carry a higher monthly payment for some borrowers than under the SAVE plan, but the SAVE plan is likely to eventually be eliminated due to the court cases, Mayotte said.",
      "\"At a minimum, I would suggest trying to make payments that cover the monthly interest as it begins to accrue to prevent your balance from growing,\" Hubert added.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-trade-deals-tariffis-deadline/",
    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 09:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is poised to hit dozens of nations around the world with higher tariffs starting next week.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday formally announced higher tariffs against more than 60 U.S. trading partners starting next week \u2014 just hours before the administration's self-imposed midnight deadline.",
      "The president signed an executive order listing out tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. The duties range as high as 41% for Syria and 40% for Laos and Myanmar, while almost no country's imports will face tariffs below 10%.",
      "The new tariffs apply to imports that are \"entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption,\" in seven days, the order said. Mr. Trump had vowed to impose higher tariffs starting just after midnight on Friday, Aug. 1. A White House official told CBS News the extra seven days were intended to give Customs and Border Protection enough time to implement the new tariff rates.",
      "\"[F]or most economies and most of our trading partners, the cost of doing trade tomorrow will be higher than it is today,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at management consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said prior to the release of Thursday's list.",
      "Mr. Trump set the latest deadline for trade agreements in April after announcing \u2014 and later suspending for 90 days \u2014 what he described as \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on more than 90 countries. A July 9 deadline for deals came and went, with the White House again stalling for time. But Mr. Trump had since vowed not to extend the deadline beyond Aug. 1 for most nations.",
      "Almost 70 trading partners are included on Thursday's list, and goods from countries that weren't listed will face 10% tariffs \u2014 the same baseline that Mr. Trump imposed in April.",
      "For some countries, Thursday's tariff list features lower rates than the ones that were threatened on Liberation Day. But other countries' tariffs were adjusted up slightly. For example, Madagascar was threatened with 47% tariffs in April and just 15% tariffs on Thursday, but Switzerland's rate jumped from 31% to 39%.",
      "For the handful of trading partners that have reached agreements with Mr. Trump in recent weeks \u2014 including Japan, South Korea and the European Union \u2014 the new tariff list reflects the terms of those trade deals.",
      "A senior administration official told reporters Thursday the new tariff list separates U.S. trading partners into three buckets. If the United States has a trade surplus with a country \u2014 meaning the U.S. exports more goods to the country than it imports \u2014 that nation's goods will face a 10% tariff rate. If the U.S. has a small trade deficit, imports from that country will generally face 15% tariffs. And countries that the U.S. has larger deficits with face higher tariffs, typically based on either the \"Liberation Day\" rate, a rate hashed out in a trade deal with the U.S. or a rate floated by Mr. Trump in a letter.",
      "Stiff tariffs on Canada",
      "Tariffs on the United States' three largest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 are treated separately.",
      "Duties on Canadian goods will jump from 25% to 35% starting Friday, the White House announced Thursday, following through on a threat from earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump is also threatening tariff hikes for Mexico and China, but the U.S.' southern neighbor got a 90-day extension\u00a0on Thursday, and an Aug. 12 deadline to strike a deal with China is expected to be extended for three months, as well.",
      "In announcing the hike in Canadian tariffs, White House said Canada hadn't done enough to \"arrest, seize, detain or otherwise intercept ... traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs.\"",
      "In a statement released early Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was \"disappointed\" by Mr. Trump's actions.",
      "\"Canada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,\" he said.",
      "Carney added that some industries - including lumber, steel, aluminum and automobiles - are \"heavily impacted by U.S. duties and tariffs. For such sectors, the Canadian government will act to protect Canadian jobs, invest in our industrial competitiveness, buy Canadian, and diversity our export markets.\"",
      "In Beijing, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Friday that, \"China's opposition to the abuse of tariffs is consistent and clear. Tariff and trade wars have no winners. Protectionism is in no one's interests.\"",
      "Amid concerns that the White House's trade agenda was fueling economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers, Trump administration officials this spring pledged to nail down \"90 deals in 90 days.\"",
      "By that measure, his administration has come up far short of its goals. The White House has announced broad bilateral agreements with a handful of nations as well as the 27-member European Union, but those deals have lacked the extensively documented details typical of most trade deals, experts note.",
      "\"It's important to note that we don't even have any deals as deals are commonly understood, except maybe the U.K. agreement, which is still being discussed,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The countries that have yet to strike deals with the U.S., including major trading partners such as Canada and Mexico, account for 56% of American imports, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Shortly after the new tariff list was released, Mr. Trump told NBC News in an interview it's \"too late\" for countries that still haven't struck a trade agreement to avoid the new import duties \u2014 but he's still willing to negotiate after the higher tariffs take effect. He said he believes his trade strategy was going \"very well, very smooth,\" pointing to the revenue brought in by tariffs and the fact that inflation has not spiked.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "Tearing up the rules",
      "Mr. Trump re-entered office in January promising to rewrite the rules of international commerce, which he has long maintained disadvantage the U.S. and hurt American workers. In that effort, he has embraced tariffs as a way to reduce trade deficits with other nations, energize domestic manufacturers, generate federal revenue and gain leverage in foreign policy.",
      "In practice, the White House has struggled to deliver on that ambitious agenda, Daniel Altman, an economist and founder of investment newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There were never enough trade negotiators in all of Washington to conclude all of these details by August 1,\" he said. \"We have some framework agreements that have made the headlines, but as we're finding out a lot of those deals include tariff rates that are pretty much the same as the base rate of 15% that the White House has mooted for the rest of the world.\"",
      "Yet despite the appearance of chaos that has attended some of the rollout of his new tariff regime, Mr. Trump has clearly succeeded in changing the terms of trade with several key economic partners in ways that could favor the U.S. In some cases, that includes winning the elimination or significant reductions in tariffs on American exports going the other way.",
      "Under its deal with the EU, for instance, the U.S. will impose a 15% tax on most of the trading bloc's imports, but the EU has agreed not to charge any levy on imports from the U.S.\u00a0Deals with Japan\u00a0and South Korea impose the same tariff rate on those countries' exports to the U.S.",
      "Other countries that struck trade deals with the U.S. have acceded to higher tariffs in hopes of ensuring good relations with Mr. Trump and avoiding even higher levies. Those include\u00a0Indonesia and the Philippines, which will each face a 19% tariff on their exports. The U.S. will subject imports from\u00a0Vietnam\u00a0to a 20% duty, plus a 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped via other countries.",
      "\"In any other time frame, one would have said that having the EU, Korea, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia and the United Kingdom covers an awful lot of world trade and U.S. trade,\" Alan Wolff, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics and former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "President Trump's tariff agenda is also generating significant revenue. According to the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. in June brought in $27 billion in tariff revenue \u2014 more than three times what it collected in the same period a year ago.",
      "The White House has repeatedly insisted that tariff costs will be borne by foreign countries and that the levies will help spur investment in U.S. manufacturing. Trade experts note that tariffs are typically paid by importers, which often pass on those costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "Global financial markets fell in overnight trading after the White House tariff announcement. In the U.S., stock futures for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Complex were each down 0.9%, while Nasdaq Composite futures fell roughly 1%.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure \u2014 the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE \u2014 ticked higher last month, signaling that President Trump's tariffs are pushing some prices higher.",
      "Prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.8% in the past year, the same as the previous month, which was revised higher.",
      "The figures help illustrate the central bank's reason for\u00a0its decision Wednesday to keep its\u00a0key interest rate steady, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressing that inflation still remains above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the president's new import duties would cause just a one-time rise in prices, or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "\"The Fed got validation this morning with inflation coming in a little higher than expected,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X in an emailed comment. \"There is some evidence of tariff impact in the inflation data, but it remains modest. Health care, housing and utilities continue to be key sources in driving inflation.\"",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than what would be consistent with the 2% target.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook and inflation that remains higher than its 2% annualized goal. The central bank last cut rates in December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's January inauguration.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pressuring Powell to cut rates, arguing that lower rates are justified because inflation remains tame and that other nations have been cutting their benchmark rates this year. Nevertheless, the majority of the Fed's 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, voted on Wednesday to maintain rates in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, although there were two dissenting votes in favor of a cut.",
      "The rise in the PCE's inflation data may lessen the likelihood of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, said Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm.",
      "\"The above-target rise in core prices in June, upward revisions to previous months' data and the sharp rise in core goods inflation will do little to ease the Fed's concerns about tariff-driven inflation,\" Chambers said.",
      "Higher grocery and gas prices",
      "The government's measure of gas prices jumped 0.9% from May to June, while grocery costs rose 0.3%. Many longer-lasting goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",
      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting some of the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",
      "Thursday's report also showed that consumer spending rose 0.3% from May to June, a modest rise that suggests Americans are still spending cautiously. Adjusted for inflation, the increase was just 0.1%, the government said.",
      "Americans' incomes also saw a modest increase, rising 0.3% last month, a rebound after a 0.4% drop in May. Adjusted for inflation and taxes, however, incomes were flat in June.",
      "Consumers have been cautious all year. On Wednesday, the government said the economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a solid showing but one that masked some red flags.",
      "Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year. A sharp drop in imports in the April-June quarter, which followed a surge in the first quarter, provided a big lift to the government's calculation of U.S. gross domestic product.",

    "summary": "A new proposed bill would protect both workers and American consumers from bad experiences with AI.",
    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",

    "story": [
      "Texas Republicans returned to the state Capitol this Monday for the House session \u2014 likely without Democratic lawmakers who have left the state in a bid to block a vote on a heavily GOP-favored congressional map.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott said he'll begin to remove Democratic lawmakers from office if they don't return after dozens of them fled the state in a last-resort attempt to block the redrawing of U.S. House maps that President Trump wants before the 2026 midterm elections, although the legal justification for that is shaky.",
      "State House Democrats went to Illinois or New York on Sunday, and Abbott gave them a 24-hour ultimatum to come home ratcheted up a widening fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but has drawn in Democratic governors who have floated the possibility of rushing to redraw their own state's maps in retaliation. Their options, however, are limited.",
      "At the center of the escalating impasse is Mr. Trump's pursuit of adding five more GOP-leaning congressional seats in Texas before next year that would bolster his party's chances of preserving its slim U.S. House majority.",
      "The new congressional maps drawn by Texas Republicans would create five new Republican-leaning seats. Republicans currently hold 25 of the state's 38 seats.",
      "A vote on the proposed maps had been set for Monday in the Texas House of Representatives, but it cannot proceed if the majority of Democratic members deny a quorum by not showing up. After one group of Democrats landed in Chicago on Sunday, they were welcomed by Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, but declined to say how long they were prepared to stay out of Texas.",
      "\"We will do whatever it takes. What that looks like, we don't know,\" said state Rep. Gene Wu, the Texas House Democratic Caucus leader.",
      "But legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, including in 2021 when many of the same Texas House Democrats left the state for 38 days in protest of new voting restrictions. Once they returned, Republicans still wound up passing that measure.",
      "Four years later, Abbott is taking a far more aggressive stance and swiftly warning Democrats that he will seek to remove them from office if they are not back when the House reconvenes Monday afternoon. He cited a non-binding 2021 legal opinion issued by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, which suggested a court could determine that a legislator had forfeited their office.",
      "He also suggested the lawmakers may have committed felonies by raising money to help pay for fines they'd face.",
      "\"This truancy ends now,\" Abbott said.",
      "In response, House Democrats issued a four-word statement: \"Come and take it.\"",
      "The state of the vote",
      "Lawmakers can't pass bills in the 150-member Texas House without at least two-thirds of them present. Democrats hold 62 of the seats in the majority-Republican chamber and at least 51 left the state, said Josh Rush Nisenson, spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus.",
      "Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows said the chamber would still meet as planned on Monday afternoon.",
      "\"If a quorum is not present then, to borrow the recent talking points from some of my Democrat colleagues, all options will be on the table. . .,\" he posted on X.",
      "Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, said on X that Democrats who \"try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately.\"",
      "Fines for not showing up",
      "A refusal by Texas lawmakers to show up is a civil violation of legislative rules. The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders had the authority to \"physically compel the attendance\" of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served that year. Two years later, Republicans pushed through new rules that allow daily fines of $500 for lawmakers who don't show up for work as punishment.",
      "The quorum break will also delay votes on flood relief and new warning systems in the wake of last month's catastrophic floods in Texas that killed at least 136 people. Democrats had called for votes on the flooding response before taking up redistricting and have criticized Republicans for not doing so.",

    "summary": "The State Department said in a notice that it is launching a \"visa bond pilot program\" that aims to curb overstays for visitors who come to the U.S. for business or tourism.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The State Department is set to roll out a pilot program that may require foreign nationals from certain countries seeking business or tourism visas to post a bond of up to $15,000, according to a public notice set to be published Tuesday.",
      "The notice lays out the details of a 12-month \"visa bond pilot program\" that would allow consular officers to require visa bonds. Under the program, the bonds may be required for travelers from countries that the State Department says have high rates of visa overstays, or where screening and vetting information is considered deficient, according to the document.",
      "The notice does not specify the countries covered by the pilot program, but said the State Department will announce the list at least 15 days before it takes effect. The agency will also provide an explanation of why the bonds are required, according to the listing, which will be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday.",
      "The program will take effect 15 days after the notice is officially published and will run through August 2026, the document states.",
      "The program comes in response to an executive order issued by President Trump on the first day of his second term that sought to stem illegal immigration into the U.S., a major focus of the president's policy agenda. The measure directed the treasury secretary, along with the secretaries of state and homeland security, to take action to implement a visa bond program.",
      "As part of his immigration agenda, the president has sought to roll back humanitarian programs for migrants from certain countries, and signed a proclamation in June banning foreign nationals from a dozen countries from traveling to the U.S. The Trump administration has also targeted immigrants on student visas and taken steps to tighten the rules for visa applicants.",
      "A new tax-and-spending bill signed by Mr. Trump last month also subjects many travelers to the U.S. to a $250 \"visa integrity fee.\"",
      "Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, said the latest measures from the Trump administration will deter travel to the U.S. from foreign countries.",
      "\"Bonds on tourist and business visas will convince most foreigners not to bother coming,\" Nowrasteh said in a statement to CBS News. \"The result will be a decimated tourist industry. Tourists spend over $200 billion annually in the U.S., spending that counts as exports. The administration's proposal will not only undermine much of the tourist industry, but it will counteract the administration's goals to reduce the trade deficit. The Trump administration's talent is proposing and enacting the most punitive, expensive, and unnecessary migration restrictions imaginable.\"",
      "The State Department described the pilot program as a \"tool of diplomacy\" and said it will help inform future decisions regarding the potential use of visa bonds \"to address the national security and foreign policy priorities\" raised in Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "\"The Pilot Program is further designed to serve as a diplomatic tool to encourage foreign governments to take all appropriate actions to ensure robust screening and vetting for all citizens in matters of identity verification and public safety, to create safeguards in [Citizenship by Investment] programs that provide citizenship without any residency in the country, and to encourage specified countries with visa overstays to ensure their nationals timely depart the United States after making temporary visits,\" according to the notice.",
      "Who may be included in the visa bond pilot program?",
      "The State Department did not say which countries with high overstay rates would trigger the visa bond requirement. But an August 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security found that in fiscal year 2023, there were more than 300,000 foreign nationals admitted for business or pleasure who were still in the U.S. after their authorized stay ended.",
      "The pilot program will focus on countries that have high visa overstay rates among those allowed into the U.S. for business or pleasure \u2014 through B-1 or B-2 visas, according to the notice. A B-1 visa is for those temporarily traveling to the U.S. for business activities. A B-2 visa is for foreign nationals who want to come to the U.S. temporarily for tourism or pleasure.",
      "Travelers entering the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program will not have to post a bond, according to the State Department's notice. That program allows residents of more than 40 countries to enter the U.S. for fewer than 90 days without a visa.",
      "While the countries subject to the program will be announced in the future, the list may also be modified on a rolling basis, the State Department said. The countries with the highest overstay rates for people with business and tourism visas in fiscal year 2023 were Chad, Laos, Haiti and Congo, according to the Department of Homeland Security's report.",
      "Only foreign nationals who are applying for B-1 or B-2 nonimmigrant visas, and who are from the countries identified by the State Department, may be required to post a bond of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 as a condition of receiving a visa. The bond can be canceled if the person meets certain criteria, including leaving the U.S. by the date their authorization expires, according to the terms of the program detailed in the notice.",
      "The new requirement for certain foreign nationals seeking to come to the U.S. for business or tourism could have negative consequences for cities that rely on travelers from abroad. A June report from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority found that Sin City experienced an 11% drop in visitation year-over-year, hosting nearly 3.5 million visitors in June 2024 and nearly 3.1 million this June.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Travel Association said the pilot program appears to effect roughly 2,000 applicants, most likely from a few countries with low travel volume to the U.S. But the group is more concerned with the $250 \"Visa Integrity Fee\" included in the tax-and-spending plan, the spokesperson said.",
      "\"If this fee is implemented, the U.S. will have one of, if not the highest, visitor visa fees in the world,\" the spokesperson said. \"If we are to maintain a competitive position in the global travel market, it's critical that U.S. visa policy reflects both national security priorities and the significant economic value of international visitation.\"",
      "David Bier, the Cato Institute's director of immigration studies, called the bond requirement \"draconian.\"",
      "\"Although we can't know for certain the scale of this rule because the administration isn't saying which countries it will apply to, the rule will add what is likely an insurmountable barrier to travel for many applicants who end up being targeted who are often family members of U.S. citizens,\" he said in a statement. \"Its argument that this will pressure governments to somehow force their visa holders to comply with the terms of their visas is incoherent, and it appears to be an admission that it will likely just ban people from coming, not just result in compliance. Most visa overstays leave after some time or end up qualifying for legal status in the United States another way. There is no reason to impose such a draconian rule.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 13:04:08 -0400",
    "summary": "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says possible new locations include Arizona, Nebraska and Louisiana.",
    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says \"Alligator Alcatraz\" will serve as a model for state-run migrant detention centers, and she told CBS News in an interview that she hopes to launch a handful of similar detention centers in multiple airports and jails across the country, in the coming months. Potential sites are already under consideration in Arizona, Nebraska and Louisiana.",
      "\"The locations we're looking at are right by airport runways that will help give us an efficiency that we've never had before,\" Noem said, adding that she's appealed directly to governors and state leaders nationwide to gauge their interest in contributing to the Trump administration's program to detain and deport more unauthorized migrants.",
      "\"Most of them are interested,\" Noem said, adding that in states that support President Trump's mission of securing the southern border, \"many of them have facilities that may be empty or underutilized.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security strategy builds on the opening of a 3,000-bed immigration detention center at a jetport in South Florida last month. Dubbed Alligator Alcatraz by state and federal officials, the makeshift facility will cost an estimated $450 million to operate in its first year. Up and running in just 8 days, the tents and trailers at Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport are surrounded by 39 square miles of isolated swampland, boasting treacherous terrain and wildlife",
      "Last month, President Trump toured the facility, seeing rows of bunk beds lined up behind chain fences and encircled by razor wire. Mr. Trump joked to reporters there that \"we're going to teach them how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison.\" Asked if the temporary facility would be a model of what's to come, the president said he'd like to see similar operations in \"many states.\"",
      "The Arizona's governor's office told CBS News they have not been approached about a state-run facility.",
      "For her part, Noem called the Alligator Alcatraz model \"much better\" than the current detention prototype, which largely contracts out its Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention capacity to for-profit prison companies and county jails. ICE is an agency that falls under DHS. This model relies on intergovernmental service agreements (IGSAs) negotiated and signed between ICE and individual localities. She called the Florida facility \u2013 with an eventual price tag of $245 per inmate bed, per night, according to DHS officials \u2013 a cost-effective option. \"Obviously it was much less per-bed cost than what some of the previous contracts under the Department of Homeland Security were.\"",
      "According to the Office of Homeland Security Statistics, the estimated average daily cost of detaining an adult migrant in fiscal year 2024 was about $165, though the actual cost of detention typically varies based on region, length of stay and facility type.",
      "Still, Noem argued that the new venues, all with close proximity to airports or runways, will help ICE to cut costs by \"facilitating quick turnarounds.\"",
      "\"They're all strategically designed to make sure that people are in beds for less days,\" Noem said, adding that some of the facilities being considered are still undergoing vetting by the department and subject to ongoing negotiations. \"It can be much more efficient once they get their hearings, due process, paperwork.\"",
      "Unlike Alligator Alcatraz, which uses funds from a shelter, food and transportation program run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Noem said the state-based initiative will tap into a new $45 billion funding pool for ICE prompted by President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\", which was signed into law last month. The pool of money is allocated specifically to the expansion of ICE's detention network and will nearly double the agency's bedspace capacity of 61,000 beds, based on cost analysis. As of Saturday, ICE was holding just over 57,000 individuals in its detention network in more than 150 facilities nationwide.",
      "Noem \u2013 who has implemented a department-wide policy across DHS of personally approving each and every contract and grant over $100,000 \u2013 said keeping ICE detention contracts to a duration of under five years is now \"the model we've pushed for.\" For instance, she added, Alligator Alcatraz is a one-year contract that can be renewed.",
      "\"For me personally, the question that I've asked of every one of these contracts is, why are we signing 15-year deals?\" Noem said. \"I have to look at our mission. If we're still building out and processing 100,000 detention beds 15 years from now, then we didn't do our job.\"",
      "The new policy is a departure from earlier agreements made under the Trump administration. In February, ICE signed a 15-year, $1 billion deal with the GEO Group, a private prison company, to reopen Delaney Hall, a two-story, 1,000-bed facility that ranks among the largest detention centers in the Northeast.",
      "Still, Noem said she doesn't feel the U.S. is moving away from a private detention model. \"I mean, these are competitive contracts,\" she said. \"I want everybody to be at the table, giving us solutions. I just want them to give us a contract that actually does the job \u2013 a contract that doesn't put more money in their pockets while keeping people in detention beds just for the sake of that contract.\"",
      "But Alligator Alcatraz has also come under fire from attorneys claiming that both the Trump and DeSantis administrations are holding detainees without charge or access to immigration courts, violating their constitutional rights. Attorneys argued in a legal filing last month that unauthorized migrants held at the Florida-run site have no legal recourse to challenge their detention.",
      "Lawyers and experts have also called into question the very legality of a state-run immigration detention center, given the federal government's authority over immigration enforcement. Opening the detention center in the Everglades under Florida's emergency state powers marked a departure from the federal government's role of housing migrant detainees, an option typically reserved for those who've recently entered the country illegally or those with criminal convictions.",
      "A U.S. district judge last week ordered state and federal officials to provide a copy of the agreement showing \"who's running the show\" at the Everglades immigrant-detention center.",
      "\"Florida does not have the legal authority to detain undocumented immigrants in the absence of a contract with ICE,\" said Kevin Landy, the director of detention policy and planning for ICE under President Barack Obama. \"A state government can't do that.\"",
      "Detainees held at Alligator Alcatraz have also claimed unsanitary and inhumane conditions, including food with maggots, denial of religious rights and limited access to both legal assistance and water. Florida officials have denied the accusations.",
      "Still, tucked away in the Florida Everglades 45 miles west of Miami, if its location sounds treacherous, Noem concedes, that's kind of the point. \"There definitely is a message that it sends,\" the secretary said. \"President Trump wants people to know if you are a violent criminal and you're in this country illegally, there will be consequences.\"",
      "Noem offered that deterrence is an effective strategy based on U.S. gathered intelligence \"from three letter agencies, from other intelligence officials throughout the federal government and in a lot of the Latin American and South American countries\" that indicates \"overwhelmingly, what encourages people to go back home voluntarily is the consequences.\"",
      "\"They see the laws being enforced in the United States,\" Noem said. \"They know when they are here illegally and if they are detained, they'll be removed. They see that they may never get the chance to come back to America. And they're voluntarily coming home.\"",
      "The DHS secretary met with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum in March. \"One of the questions I asked President Scheinbaum when I was in Mexico is, 'Do you have any idea how many people may have come back to Mexico that we may not know about,'\" Noem said.",
      "\"[Sheinbaum] said 500,000 to 600,000 people have come back to Mexico voluntarily since President Trump's been in office,\" Noem continued, explaining that the Mexican president believes her reluctant citizens fear losing the chance to return to the U.S. on a visa or work program.",
      "It's a datapoint she solicits from many of the foreign leaders she meets with, including Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa, who shared a 90-minute lunch with the DHS secretary in Quito, last Thursday. \"I asked him the same question,\" Noem recalled. \"He doesn't have as many illegal immigrants in the United States as in Mexico and Venezuela, but he said he thinks over 100,000 of his citizens have come back to Ecuador. And that's a huge number.\"",
      "Noem reasoned that her Ecuadorian counterpart's rough estimate is based on two factors \u2013 a strengthening Ecuadorian economy and a DHS television campaign launched across Latin and South America, warning prospective migrants not to enter or remain in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"He was very proud of the fact that he's doing better with his economy. So there's jobs,\" Noem recounted. \"But he said, you know, our ads are running in Ecuador. We're telling people that, if you have family in the United States that are there illegally, it's time to come home.\"",

Marc Veasey would be moved out of Tarrant County entirely, which would leave only a small portion of the county represented by a Democrat. All four Houston-area seats were redrawn, with Rep. Al Green's being the most dramatic.",
      "\"They're turning our districts into crazy shapes to guarantee the outcome they want in the 2026 election,\" Democratic state Rep. James Talarico said in a message\u00a0posted to social media. \"If this power grab succeeds, they will hang on to power without any accountability from the voters.\"",
      "Wu said Texas Republicans are \"using is a racist, gerrymandered map, a map that seeks to use racial lines to divide hard working communities who have spent decades building up their power and strengthening their voices, and Governor Abbott is doing this in submission to Donald Trump.\"",
      "Democrats have fought back against the new districts, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries traveling to Austin on Thursday to pledge national support.",
      "\"We are not fighting for the Democratic Party, we are fighting for the democratic process, and the stakes could not be higher. We have to take a stand,\" Talarico added.",
      "Martin said in an appearance Sunday on MSNBC, \"I'm proud of the Texas Dems for actually breaking quorum here. Our democracy is literally under assault by Donald Trump, Greg Abbott and the Republicans, who know that they are on a track to lose the House majority next year. So what do they do? They cheat. They rigged the system. That's all they have left.\"",
      "\"We're certainly going to be standing with folks who will be litigating this in the courts,\" Martin added. \"We will continue to organize on the ground in Texas, and we will continue to support the House Dems, as they have broke quorum right now.\"",
      "This is not the first time Democrats have left the state to deny Republicans a quorum \u2014 and not the first time they have done it to protest redistricting. During the landmark 2005 mid-decade redistricting, Texas Democrats fled during two separate special sessions to stop the redistricting. But the redistricting eventually did go through. And in 2023, Republicans passed legislation that levies a $500-a-day fine on lawmakers who leave the state.",
      "The last significant quorum break in the Texas House was in 2021, when Democrats fled the state to prevent a restrictive voting bill from passing.",
      "Last month, Paxton threatened to assist police in \"hunting down and compelling the attendance\" of any Democratic lawmakers who leave the state to block votes during the special session.",
      "\"If Democrats ignore their duty to their constituents by breaking quorum, they should be found and arrested no matter where they go,\" said Paxton, who is also running for the GOP nomination in next year's Senate race.",
      "Abbott on Sunday said that \"Any Democrat who 'solicits, accepts, or agrees to accept'\" donations to help cover any fines they may be subjected to under Hous rules for skipping votes, \"may have violated bribery laws.\"",
      "Can other states take on redistricting efforts?",
      "As the efforts ramped up in Texas to redraw the maps, other Democrat-led states threatened to do something similar. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been one of the most prominent voices behind this effort, posting on social media after the GOP's new maps for Texas were unveiled that \"California won't sit back and watch this happen.\"",
      "Other governors have joined suit, with some of the Texas House Democrats joining New York Gov. Kathy Hochul for a press conference on Monday about the topic. Hochul said, \"I'm tired of fighting this fight with one hand tied behind my back.\"",
      "Pritzker also said Sunday \"everything has to be on the table.\"",
      "But legally, it will be difficult to pull off in many of these states. Texas is one of a few states that allows the state legislature to set up the congressional maps, and can allow mid-decade redistricting. In California, an independent commissions is in charge of redistricting \u2014 and there is a law in New York banning gerrymandering for political gains. New York's congressional maps went through a number of legal challenges before the final maps were settled on.",
      "Hochul and New York Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie acknowledged it would require a change to the state constitution, but Heastie insisted that \"we're in close conversations about options there, and so I would say we're presenting all options right now.\"",
      "\"It's very difficult to say play fair when your opponents are playing dirty and using every tool in their tool shed toolbox to kind of undermine democracy,\" Heastie said.",
      "As for Illinois, the state legislature draws the map and Democrats control the legislature \u2014 and they cut out two Republican seats when they redrew the maps in 2021. Prior to redistricting, Illinois had 13 Democrats and five Republicans in the House. The state lost a seat due to population loss, and they ended the 2022 elections with 14 Democrats and three Republicans.",

      "\"This morning, I'm making it official. I am running to be your governor of the great state of South Carolina,\" Mace said in an announcement Monday morning at The Citadel, a military college where she became the first woman to graduate from the Corps of Cadets program in 1999.",
      "Mace, 47, first came to Congress in 2021, and has gained recognition as a GOP firebrand in recent months after shifting positions in recent years.",
      "The South Carolina Republican made headlines for leading a GOP effort to restrict restroom use in the Capitol earlier this year after the first transgender person was elected to Congress. And she's regularly sparred with witnesses while serving on the House Oversight Committee, like at a hearing on immigration policies in March, where she accused Democratic mayors of having \"blood on your hands.\"",
      "Mace has previously taken more moderate positions, like urging her GOP colleagues not to go too far on abortion ahead of the 2022 midterms elections where Democrats defied expectations. And she criticized President Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, suggesting he didn't have a future in the party, before ultimately backing his 2024 presidential bid. In 2022, Mace overcame a primary challenge despite Mr. Trump's endorsement of her opponent.",
      "In 2023, Mace was among a group of eight Republicans who voted to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, spurring a proxy fight with the former speaker in her 2024 primary.\u00a0 Mace ultimately defeated her McCarthy-backed challenger.",

      "\"But if I get in, we're starting out front, in the lead, and it's a two-man race,\" Mace added, referencing South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, a Republican who announced a bid for governor last month. \"If I get in I will fight to the finish and I will take out South Carolina's attorney general because he's turned a blind eye on women and on children and on the state for a lot of reasons.

    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "More than a dozen states are seeking their own versions of Medicaid work requirements. But the incoming new federal standards pose new questions.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump signed a law adding work requirements for some Medicaid recipients, he may have undercut lawmakers in at least 14 states who were designing their own plans, according to health industry observers.",
      "Georgia is the only state with a work requirement in place for Medicaid, but several states have been pursuing such a policy for years, only to be blocked by courts or, most recently, the Biden administration. Some seek state-specific touches to the new rules. Others aim to implement work requirements before the federal law takes effect at the end of 2026.",
      "These states' moves and Mr. Trump's massive tax-and-spending law share one demand: To keep their Medicaid health coverage, adults who can work must prove they're logging a minimum number of hours at a job or school, or else qualify for one of the few exemptions.",
      "But now, states that jumped ahead need to ensure their proposals, which require federal approval, don't stray too far from Mr. Trump's law.",
      "\"The statute sets both the floor and ceiling\" for work requirements, said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor with George Washington University.",
      "South Dakota, for example, announced in July that it would not submit an application for work requirements as previously planned amid concerns that the state's laxer rules would not be allowed under the new federal law. The state's Department of Social Services secretary had warned that working on a state proposal while the federal rules are being hashed out could be \"an exercise in futility.\"",
      "Arkansas' plan, on the other hand, is more stringent than the federal law. There are no exemptions to its work requirements in the application, which is pending with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "Arizona's proposal also includes something that's not in the federal law: a ban on \"able-bodied adults\" receiving Medicaid benefits for longer than five years total in their lives.",
      "Arkansas and Arizona government officials said they were working with federal officials to square their plans with the new standards.",
      "Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the department is analyzing how the new federal standards interact with state waivers.",
      "The federal health department must release rules by next June that outline how states are to implement work requirements, according to Elizabeth Hinton, who has been tracking such waivers as part of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "\"We don't exactly know what that will cover,\" Hinton said.",
      "It's unclear how federal officials will respond to the states' requests, she added, but \"we are aware that some folks think there is no wiggle room here.\"",
      "States can tweak their Medicaid programs through what are known as demonstration waivers, which are subject to federal approval. The waivers are designed to test new ideas in policy gray areas.",
      "The states that have filed or plan to file such applications with work requirements include Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah.",
      "Congressional Republicans who passed the budget reconciliation bill left room for states to use waivers to fast-track the national standards. Tara Sklar, a professor leading the University of Arizona's Health Law & Policy Program, said she expects states seeking certain stricter requirements to have a chance of approval, while more lenient ones may face denials.",
      "Federal officials may look favorably on Arizona's plan, Sklar said, as a five-year lifetime Medicaid limit is different from work requirements. Even if the federal government greenlights stricter work requirements than the federal law calls for, those programs are likely to face legal challenges, she added.",
      "The federal law includes an 80-hour-per-month minimum for work or education, with exemptions for certain adults, including people who are medically frail and parents with young, dependent children.",
      "Montana is the first state to draft a waiver application since Congress finalized national work requirements. State lawmakers first approved work requirements \u2014 called \"community engagement\" standards under the state plan \u2014 in 2019, but the state's application stalled through the end of the first Trump term and the Biden administration.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected again, Montana lawmakers lifted the 2025 expiration date of its Medicaid expansion program, making permanent the program that covered more than 76,000 adults in April, with the expectation that the Trump administration would approve work requirements. In mid-July, state officials released their draft plan to make that a reality \"as soon as is practicable.\"",
      "The Montana plan largely aligns with the federal law, but it would create additional exemptions, including for people who are homeless or fleeing domestic violence.",
      "Republican state Sen. Gayle Lammers said work requirements that also protect such people who need Medicaid were a big part of persuading legislators to keep the expansion program. At the time, officials didn't know where the federal government would land on work requirements. And now, Lammers said, it makes sense for Montana to stick to its plan.",
      "\"The state should have a say,\" Lammers said. \"We're very independent, and everyone is different.\"",
      "In South Carolina, state officials are seeking to roll out work requirements for a limited number of newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. South Carolina is one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, and yet the state submitted a request with the federal government in June for a partial Medicaid expansion that includes a work requirement component that largely reflects the new federal standards.",
      "In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, called South Carolina's proposal \"a state-specific solution.\"",
      "The only state with an active work requirement program now wants to scale it back and awaits federal approval to do so. \"Georgia Pathways to Coverage\" expires at the end of September unless CMS greenlights an extension of the program with a key change: requiring enrollees to document once a year that they're working, not monthly. That's a pivot away from the program's initial design but also differs from the new federal rules, which call for checks every six months.",
      "Fiona Roberts, a spokesperson for Georgia's Medicaid agency, said the state is still waiting to hear whether it needs to alter its plan.",
      "So Georgia is among the states in limbo, awaiting guidance from the federal government.",

    "story": [
      "Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said in an interview that aired Sunday that tariff rates are \"pretty much set\" on more than 60 trading partners after President Trump's executive order last week.",
      "\"So these, these tariff rates are pretty much set,\" Greer said in an interview Friday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan. \"I expect I do have my phone blowing up. There are trade ministers who, who want to talk more and see how they can work in a different way with the United States, but I think that we have, we're seeing truly the contours of the president's tariff plan right now with these rates.\"",
      "Hours ahead of the Trump administration's self-imposed deadline for baseline tariffs on Friday, the White House announced tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. All imports will have a 10% tariff rate as of Aug. 7, according to the executive order.",
      "When asked if Mr. Trump will be negotiating the tariff rate down in coming days, Greer answered, \"I don't think they will be,\" but he added these tariff rates are \"set rates pursuant to deals.\"",
      "\"When the president is looking at this, he looks at potential deals, and we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do,\" Greer said. \"And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then talking to his advisors, he makes a call on this.\"",
      "Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline, the Trump administration touted a number of deals for tariffs, including South Korea, the European Union and Britain. But other major U.S. trading partners did not reach deals, including Canada, which Mr. Trump levied a 35% tariff on goods not subject the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Canada is the U.S.' second-largest trading partner.",
      "\"The President's view with with every country, whether it's Canada or Mexico, and regardless of the kind of trade agreement we have in place, is that the net result of the trading system, whether it's our WTO agreements or our existing trade agreements, the net result has been that a lot of the manufacturing has gone overseas, and when that's the net result, you can't continue with that system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"So you know, I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is the President is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have,\" the trade adviser said.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who Brennan interviewed separately on \"Face the Nation,\" said that Bank of America economists have predicted that while the economy will still continue to grow, they are predicting \"less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said Sunday that applications for a fund for rural hospitals will go out in \"early September\" in the wake of Medicaid cuts in President Trump's signature piece of legislation passed by Congress last month.",
      "\"We're putting $50 billion. The president wants this, the Congress wants this,\" Oz said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mr. Trump signed the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" into law last month, which included a number of his second-term priorities from tax cuts to increased spending on border security, defense and energy production. The legislation was paid for in part by significant cuts to health care programs, like Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans.",
      "Among the cuts to Medicaid, the new law will lower provider taxes, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs. Lawmakers sought to supplement the cuts with a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $50 billion for rural hospitals.",
      "Oz said the applications for the fund will start going out in early September. He said the money is designed to help with \"workforce development, right-sizing the system and using technology to provide things like telehealth that can change the world.\"",
      "\"Imagine if we can change the way we think about the delivery of health and make it more about getting people healthy who can thrive and flourish and be fully present in their own lives and as Americans,\" Oz said.",
      "The new law will also make changes to Medicaid work requirements for some able-bodied adults, along with more frequent eligibility checks. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the legislation would result in 10 million Americans losing health coverage under Medicaid over the next decade.",
      "Oz touted the work requirements, saying \"every Democratic president and Republican president has said that the foundation of a healthy welfare system, a social system of support, is work.\"",

      "His website shows him in shirtsleeves talking about his military service and growing up in a coal town. His campaign video features images of the nearby Pennsylvania community of Pottsville, festooned in red, white and blue bunting. His campaign advisers circulate copies of a political advocacy group's endorsement. Crosswell talks about knocking on doors and meeting voters, one of whom Crosswell said is \"struggling and may need to sell her house.\"",
      "But, unlike many congressional candidates, Crosswell has no campaign experience and has never worked in politics.",
      "He's one of several former Justice Department attorneys and officials seeking public office after resigning from an agency they say has been contaminated by politics.",
      "Among the wave of resignations and firings of Justice Department prosecutors, administrators and career staffers who have resigned or been fired in the first six months of President Trump's second term, some want to resume public service, and now they're exploring different avenues to achieve that.",
      "Crosswell, a longtime federal prosecutor, resigned from the Justice Department on Feb. 17, in protest of the controversial department decision to drop the criminal corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams and a purge of the agency's public integrity division.",
      "He has criticized the Justice Department's reductions in its anti-corruption offices.",
      "\"What the administration has done is removed one of the most important guardrails against corruption within the government at all levels: state, local and federal,\" Croswell told CBS News. \"We're now moving into an area where prosecutions would be determined by political loyalty,\" he said.",
      "Crosswell's race is also uniquely important. He's running for the Democratic nomination in one of the most competitive and high-impact House races in the country, Pennsylvania's 7th District, which flipped from Democratic to Republican in 2024. Crosswell has already raised more than $300,000 since announcing his candidacy in June, while the incumbent Republican, Rep. Ryan MacKenzie, has raised over $1.4 million this year.",
      "It's a big change for a longtime career prosecutor, who just months ago was credited by the Justice Department with helping secure the conviction of a former New Mexico state political candidate who'd gone on a shooting spree that targeted the homes of four elected officials.",
      "Croswell, a Marine reservist, is leaning into his biography during his campaign. He told CBS News, \"If you're a Marine and you're a former prosecutor, you are protecting people.\"",
      "Some of his former colleagues are also seeking elected office, and like Crosswell, none have elected experience or a political background, but all of them are openly criticizing recent changes in the Justice Department and talking about why they chose to exit their careers as career prosecutors.",
      "\"It was my dream job\"",
      "Erika Evans quit her Justice Department position in March, leaving what she said was her dream job. She's now seeking the Democratic nomination for the office of city attorney in Seattle.",
      "Speaking with CBS News by phone between campaign stops in Seattle, Evans said, \"The polls are in our favor, and we're feeling good about that.\"",
      "She's the granddaughter of civil rights figure Lee Evans, who was among the 1968 Olympics track stars who raised a fist in the air during a medal presentation. Evans told CBS News the Trump administration's dismantling of the Justice Department's Civil Rights division was among her motivations for leaving.",
      "\"We received emails requiring that we report any colleagues doing diversity work in the office. We had 10 to 14 days to report them or we would get in trouble ourselves,\" Evans said. \"That was pretty disgusting.\" She said she didn't feel safe at the agency, in part because she was the co-chair of a diversity effort.",
      "In a campaign video, Evans pledged to challenge Mr. Trump: \"With your vote, I'll take on Trump and demand the community safety we deserve.\" And her campaign materials also promote Evans' work on civil rights issues.",
      "\"I have only worked in public service my entire career. That's the reason why I became a lawyer \u2014 to represent and serve my community,\" Evans said. \"When I realized that that was not going to be possible any longer with the values that the Trump administration was having for the department, I knew I needed to shift.\"",
      "She said her public criticism of the recent changes in the Justice Department is resonating with voters.",
      "\"We've spoken with thousands of voters and we have been knocking on thousands of doors,\" she said. \"It's been really comforting to hear from our voters who say 'You are so brave to step out and speak out against this.'\"",
      "The Seattle primaries are Tuesday. If Evans wins enough votes, she'd proceed to a general election in November.",
      "\"It really weighed on my heart\"",
      "Hetal Doshi rose through the ranks of the Justice Department over more than a decade of service, including as deputy assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division. She left in January, when Mr. Trump was sworn in, and is now seeking her first elected office as a candidate in next year's election for Colorado attorney general.",
      "Doshi told CBS News the recent changes at the agency \"really weighed on my heart and on my mind.\"",
      "\"State attorneys general are more important than ever before, in filling an enforcement vacuum,\" she said. \"That's why I made the decision to run for office.\"",
      "\"I faced a lot of complicated feelings about my exit,\" Doshi said, \"and that complexity was coming from the fact that I loved what I did on behalf of the American people so much.\"",
      "Despite her lack of campaign experience, Doshi touted robust early fundraising and a statewide campaign infrastructure as she pursues the Democratic nomination for the post. Doshi's campaign materials, including an introductory video, emphasize she's a first-generation American from a working-class family.",
      "Her campaign website includes a video in which Doshi takes aim at Mr. Trump, saying, \"The rule of law is under attack by Donald Trump and politicians who have abandoned patriotism.\" The video includes images of U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Trump surrogate Jeanine Pirro, who was just confirmed as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.",
      "\"It's hard to watch the dismantling of the norms and traditions of the Department of Justice,\" Doshi said in a phone interview with CBS News.",
      "The Justice Department declined a request to comment on Doshi, Crosswell or Evans and their criticism of recent agency changes.",
      "Doshi's campaign lists several of her Justice Department accomplishments and promotes her record. Her campaign materials highlight her federal case work in challenging an airline merger, big tech mergers, concert ticket pricing and a case she said would have impacted grocery prices.",
      "\"I feel much more comfortable in a courtroom than any other place,\" Doshi admitted, but she says campaigning is a form of public advocacy that mirrors her work as a government attorney.",
      "\"It's normally pretty rare for career DOJ attorneys to run for office. They actively steer clear of partisanship at the department,\" said Stacey Young, a former Justice Department attorney who leads the Justice Connection, a networking organization to help former Justice Department employees who have resigned or been fired.",
      "\"It makes perfect sense that for some, serving through elected office, outside the president's chain of command, is a viable alternative,\" Young added.",
      "\"I was just reading the tea leaves\"",
      "Victor Salgado said he decided on Election night last year he'd prepare to leave his job as an attorney in the Public Integrity division of the Justice Department.",
      "He soon began pursuing the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor of Virginia. His campaign and his effort won just about 5% of the vote in the June primary.That was not enough to advance to the November general election,but he still did better than he had\u00a0 expected.",
      "Salgado told CBS News he decided to leave before the expected shakeup inside the Justice Department.",
      "\"I was just reading tea leaves on the type of people that had been close to Mr. Trump, and the people who would eventually come to run the Department of Justice,\" he said. \"I handicapped it at 90% that within the near future of January 20, the Public Integrity section will be dismantled.\"",
      "There were a series of ousters in the agency's public integrity section within the first two months of the Trump administration.",
      "Salgado enjoyed a storied career at the Justice Department, including an agency award for his work on a major cryptocurrency investigation, which led to a CEO's guilty plea in 2023. The department also credited Salgado with \"substantial contributions\" to the successful prosecution of former Rep. George Santos, a New York Republican who was expelled from Congress, pleaded guilty to fraud and began serving a prison sentence last month.",
      "Salgado said he emphasized his Justice Department work during his brief campaign, and as he met with voters and made campaign stops, he referenced the controversies involving the Trump's administration's use of law enforcement in immigration enforcement.",
      "He said the role of political candidate is challenging for career prosecutors.",
      "\"We are not partisan, especially as corruption prosecutors,\" he said. \"Of course, we have political opinions, but all of those get checked at the door.\"",
      "Crosswell's race could become one of the most expensive and highest profile in the nation.\u00a0 He moved back to Pennsylvania, where he grew up, just about 45 minutes outside of Allentown.",
      "In a sign he's cemented his position as a frontline Democratic political candidate, Crosswell is receiving strong criticism from the National Republican Congressional Committee.",
      "\"Carpetbagging Ryan Crosswell parachuted into the Lehigh Valley after working in Biden's corrupt DOJ. Pennsylvanians took out the trash last November when they elected Rep. Ryan Mackenzie and President Trump, and they're not looking back,\" an NRCC spokeswoman said in a statement.",

      "The U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia is a powerful position with a huge staff, budget and portfolio. Her confirmation came days after the Senate approved the nomination of Emil Bove, Mr. Trump's former defense lawyer, to serve on a U.S. appeals court.",

      "\"I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourns to then convene for pro forma session only,\" Thune said.",
      "Senators have 12 votes remaining following Pirro's confirmation, which is why Thune asked for senators to stay in the chamber to expedite votes. There was no objection.",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday praised Republican senators and Thune for fighting to get his appointees approved. In his Truth Social post, Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for \"doing everything possible to DELAY these wonderful and talented people from being approved.\"",

    "story": [
      "Canada-U.S. Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Sunday that \"we're prepared to stick around and do the work needed\" despite having left Washington without a new trade deal amid increased tariffs from President Trump.",
      "\"We believe there's a great deal of common ground between the United States and Canada in terms of building two strong economies that work well together,\" LeBlanc said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The White House announced last week that duties would jump from 25% to 35% on Canadian goods not covered under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, claiming that the U.S.' second-largest trading partner hasn't done enough to address immigration and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. LeBlanc said that while \"we were obviously disappointed by that decision,\" negotiators would \"continue to do the work.\"",
      "LeBlanc said his team left with \"a better understanding of the American concerns in the trading relationship\" and characterizing the meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as \"constructive, cordial conversations.\"",
      "\"We're encouraged by the conversations with Secretary Lutnick and Ambassador Greer, but we're not yet where we need to go to get the deal that's in the best interest of the two economies,\" LeBlanc said.",
      "Mr. Trump announced higher tariffs against more than 60 U.S. trading partners late last week. But Canada is the largest American trading partner included, being the world's largest buyer of American goods and the third-largest seller of goods to the U.S. last year, according to\u00a0Census Bureau\u00a0data. The country bought some $350 billion worth of American goods and sold $412 billion to the U.S. market in 2024.",
      "In an interview for \"Face the Nation\" on Friday, Greer cited Canada's retaliatory tariffs imposed earlier this year under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for the increase, saying, \"if the president's going to take an action and the Canadians retaliate, the United States needs to maintain the integrity of our action, the effectiveness, so we have to go up too.\"",
      "\"Our view is the president is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it,\" Greer said. \"And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have.\"",
      "In a statement released Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was \"disappointed\" by Mr. Trump's actions. He noted that \"Canada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes.\"",
      "On Sunday, LeBlanc said he expects Carney will have a conversation with Mr. Trump \"over the next number of days,\" while noting that the Canadian prime minister has \"built a very business-like, respectful relationship with President Trump.\"",
      "\"We understand and respect totally the president's view in terms of the national security interests. In fact, we share it,\" LeBlanc said. \"And what we've said to our American counterparts is, how can we structure the right agreement where we can both continue to supply one another in a reliable, cost effective way that preserves jobs essential to the American economy? But the same thing is true, obviously in Canada as well.\"",
      "The U.S.-Canada relationship has been strained since Mr. Trump came into office in January and repeatedly suggested that Canada could become the \"51st state.\" Carney emphatically denied this in an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump in May, saying Canada is \"not for sale.\"",

      "I think a lot of these \u2013 well, I know a lot of these, are set rates, pursuant to deals. Some of these deals are announced. Some are not. Others depend on the level of the trade deficit or surplus we may have with the country.",
      "So \u2013 so these \u2013 these tariff rates are pretty much set.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said, at some point, the president's view is maybe a tariff is better than a deal.",
      "Are you saying there are countries that just they have no shot of avoiding a tariff?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Most countries in the world, they just have a tariff assigned to them, right, whether it's\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It'll be the 10 percent or 15 percent.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: \u2026 10 or 15 or the higher-level tariff, because, again, when the president is looking at this, he looks at potential deals.",
      "And we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do. And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then, talking to his advisers, he makes a call on this.",
      "And, you know, sometimes, a country will come back and make additional concessions that \u2013 that make it more appropriate. He's trying to get at the deficit. He's trying to reshore manufacturing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trying to reshore manufacturing, bring manufacturing jobs back to America.",
      "But we just saw in this unemployment data that, while the level is pretty low overall, it's pretty steady and good, manufacturing, in particular, we saw it contract for the fifth straight month in July. Factory employment dropped to lowest levels in five years. What does that data indicate to you about the impact of your tariffs?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I think a lot of companies were waiting to see if the tax bill was going to come through with the expensing for capital goods and things like that.",
      "And so I think now you know a lot of that data comes pre-One Big Beautiful Bill. Now that we have One Big Beautiful Bill, and we have a better sense of where the taxes are going. I think we're going to see a much \u2013 we're going to see more investment. All the \u2013 all the commitments on investment we've seen countries making, that's going to come through.",
      "So I don't \u2013 I don't read tariff policy into that number. I think that is kind of pre-bill policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president just announced that the head of labor statistics is being fired because of the weak jobs report, claiming the data was faked.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers. And so it sounds to me like the president has real concerns, you know, not just based on today's, but everything we saw last year.",
      "You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but, sometimes, you see these revisions go in really extreme ways. And it's \u2013 you know, the president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about Canada, which is our second largest \u2013 largest trading partner.",
      "The president increased tariffs to 35 percent. It applies, though, to just about 10 percent of what Canada sells here. Why bother to do this now in the middle of negotiations?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So \u2013 so, I would say, first of all, early on, the president imposed a 25 percent tariff on Canada, and that was really about fentanyl and border issues, right? It's \u2013 it's a separate regime from the reciprocal tariff.",
      "And what did Canada do in response? You know, they talked about helping at the border. And I'm not \u2013 you know, I'm not a \u2013 the drug czar or anything. But what I do know, as the trade guy, is that Canada retaliated. The only other country in the world who retaliated on tariffs was the Chinese.",
      "And so if the president's going to take an action, and the Canadians retaliate, the United States needs to maintain the integrity of our action, the effectiveness, so we have to go up too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're talking about the things that the former Prime Minister Trudeau put in place, not the current prime minister?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And are \u2013 and are still in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are still in place.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the current prime minister has held off largely on retaliation here. That's the guy you're negotiating with and his team. So what's the strategy here? And aren't you worried that this will hurt the broader free trade deal if you truly do want to renegotiate it next year?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is, the president is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada. And if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I hear you drawing distinctions when you say, I'm the trade guy. I'm not the drug czar.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm the trade guy. I'm not handling these other things.",
      "But the president is kind of blending all these things together, because he cited fentanyl once again when it came to tariff \u2013 to the policy with Canada. He also said on social media: \"Canada's decision to back statehood for Palestine is going to make it hard for us to make a trade deal.\"",
      "How does that have anything to do with financial and trade agreements?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: The president of the United States has his foreign affairs power where he can \u2013 he can manage relations under the Constitution with foreign countries.",
      "Congress delegated to the president the ability to take economic action in response to national emergencies in the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. And, for example, the Treasury Department, they have a number of sanctions where they can actually cut off a country's trade with the United States, prohibit goods, cut them off from our financial system for geopolitical reasons.",
      "So the fact that they can do that, almost certainly the president can do something that's not as expansive and just \u2013 and just put a fee on those goods, which is a \u2013 which is a tariff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Brazil, because the U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil. That means, you know, we sell them more than we buy from them.",
      "So it doesn't seem to be consistent here, when you have the president put 50 percent tariffs on Brazil, one of the highest of any countries. And at the same time, the president is bringing up things that have nothing to do with trade when he's justifying them.",
      "He sent a letter to the current government complaining about the prosecution of his ally Bolsonaro, who is \u2013 who allegedly staged a coup when he lost the last election. The president called it a witch-hunt. This seems politically motivated and not about trade.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: There's a 10 percent tariff on Brazil because we have a surplus with them. That's the reciprocal tariff. And then there's a 40 percent tariff that the president has chosen to do under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: \u2026 like we would do any sanction where we see geopolitical issues.",
      "The president has seen, in Brazil, like he's seen in other countries, a misuse of law, a misuse of democracy, what one might call lawfare. It is normal to use these tools for geopolitical issues.",
      "I mean, sanctions, we've been using them for years with all kinds of countries, including countries we like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You view tariffs and sanctions as the same?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: They're just different in degree. I mean, tariffs are actually lighter than a sanction. A sanction, you're cutting off a country from your financial system. You're prohibiting trade with them. A tariff, you're allowing trade. You're just putting a fee on it. It's a \u2013 it's a lesser step than sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But now you have moved \u2013 you have moved far away from dealing with the deficit.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, the deficit has a 10 percent tariff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now you are talking about politically motivated trade actions here.",
      "I mean, the president sent a letter to President Lula saying the tariffs are due in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on free elections. Why are you trying to influence a criminal trial of an ally of President Trump?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: The president of United States, historically, whether it's a Democrat or Republican, they have used IEEPA to impose sanctions for all kinds of geopolitical reasons in all kinds of countries. Sometimes, it's countrywide. Sometimes, it's specific to certain, you know, individuals, and often foreign leaders and foreign officials.",
      "So this is not \u2013 this is not way outside the market.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to trade, the big deal that is pending out there is, how is the president going to deal with China? There's an August 12 deadline. And if that deadline is not met, you have said tariff levels could snap back to above 80 percent.",
      "Is that deadline going to slide?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So that's what's under discussion right now. I would say that our conversations with the Chinese have been very positive. We have discussions at the staff level, at my level. You know, President Xi and President Trump have had conversations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They said that it's sliding. The Chinese said it's sliding.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's something we're working toward. That's what we talked about. And so\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not there yet?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And so \u2013 so they want to do that. We're working on some technical issues, and we're talking to the president about it.",
      "You know, I think it's going in a positive direction. You know, I'm not going to get ahead of the president. But, you know, I don't think anyone wants to see those tariffs snap back to 84 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you get any commitments in those two days of talks in Stockholm?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So, yes, we did. Yes, we talked about \u2013 and I won't go into detail, because they're, you know, confidential conversations between two \u2013 two governments, but they really focused on rare earth magnets and minerals.",
      "China has put a global control on the world. And so for the United States, we're focused on making sure that the flow of magnets from China to the United States and the \u2013 and the adjacent supply chain can flow as freely as it did before the control. And I would say we're about halfway there.",

      "We will be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.",
      "Good morning, and thank you for being here with us.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN (CEO, Bank of America): It's good to be here again, Margaret. Hope you're doing well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm hoping you can give us some clarity here on what's going on with the economy.",
      "Your Bank of America economists say no rate hikes this year and no recession. Is that still the case after Friday's jobs report?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, it's still the case. And that's a \u2013 less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that.",
      "And \u2013 but they still think we continue to grow. And we're growing at a slow rate, say 1.5 percent this year, a little more next year, and a little more the year after that. But it will take inflation \u2013 for the Fed to get inflation out of the system really through the end of '26 into '27, down to the 2 percent level.",
      "And that's why they have the Fed holding. What they believe is, sort of in the middle of next year, the Fed will start cutting and bring the Fed funds rate closer to what would be a more normal rate, around 3 percent, 3.5 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, even though we saw this really kind of astounding dissent by two members of the Fed\u2026",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 saying, we do need to move on interest rates, your prediction from your economists is that that's not appropriate at this time?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: They don't think it's \u2013 they're going to move. Now, the market says they're going to move in September, maybe twice this year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: The market was at seven times one point this year. Now they're down to two. Then they're down to one. Now they're up to two.",
      "This is going to move around, but the reality is, two things people should really keep in focus. One is, until the inflation is out of the system, the Fed is going to be a little \u2013 very careful. And that's what they said. And then, secondly, the rate we're going to go to is a rate that is more normal than pre-global financial crisis, more of a 3 percent, 3.5 percent rate, which actually means the American economy is probably functioning better, frankly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on that point, \"The Wall Street Journal,\" we were reading in, puts the tariff tax increase as costing $360 billion a year. That's one of the largest tax increases in history, they say.",
      "Do you believe the administration's arguments that it's really only foreigners who are going to pay the cost of this? Do you think economists are overstating the negative impact?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think no one really knows, honestly, because this is a different regime than we've been in before.",
      "And there's \u2013 so they're trying to extrapolate from things from 50 years ago, when economies were a different structure. Our team thinks it's \u2013 has an impact on inflation of about, you know, 30, 40 basis points.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning adding to prices people are paying.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, adding to the inflation rate in the United States.",
      "But we need to back up. What the real impact right now is the new Trump administration coming in had four or five policy areas they were really going to go after, having learned in the four years they had to move very quickly. Those were around trades and tariff, immigration and taxation and deregulation.",
      "What businesses \u2013 and I just was in the Midwest with a bunch of businesses \u2013 they're all trying to do is figure out what the answer will be so they can go ahead and make their plans for '26. So the activity that's slowed down has more to do with people just trying to figure out the answer. It doesn't mean every answer is acceptable, but most answers are.",
      "So what do they have answers on? Obviously, the tax bill getting done. That's a good answer for business, because it makes the rates permanent. What's the second thing they have an answer on? They have an answer now on the range of trade possibilities. And so, as they think about the trade possibilities, they sit there and say, tariffs might not be worse than X. They see some deals getting done, all of which is good work.",
      "What they don't have an answer on is deregulation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, new regulations have stopped, but they are hoping for more deregulation, so that will help their business models going forward.",
      "And then the last is immigration. What will immigration really settle in like? And that's what they tell us. So they're not using their lines of credit. They're not \u2013 the indications from them are, they're being a little more cautious, really waiting for some answers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Businesses aren't hiring either, we saw in this jobs data on Friday. It was the worst three months for job growth since the pandemic.",
      "Your firm, when I was reading the analysis, points to a number of different factors, and one of them is artificial intelligence and the adoption of that impacting hiring. How dramatically is it reshaping the job market?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think this is sort of a question of almost a glass half-full/half-empty type of thing. So the impact\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No pun intended.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, exactly.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Sorry about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: But the impact of technology on human work content as a percentage of productivity has been huge.",
      "In our company, at \u2013 in 2010, when I started with the management team, we had 285,000 people. We have 212,000 people today. That was the impact of technology. We're bigger, more customers, more transactions, more reports to the government, more data, et cetera.",
      "So the impact has always been huge. A.I. gives you a place to go that we've never been able to go before. In other words, they're jobs that take text, think about it, and produce it, many, many jobs in our company, our research team. Now you're able to maybe use a machine to enhance that activity.",
      "So we believe that people who harness A.I. for their benefit are going to be very successful. The \u2013 my teammates who harness A.I. for their benefit are very successful. It's nervous-making for young kids now, saying, will the jobs be there for me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Then I say, look back historically. America has a lot more people working here. And think about the amount of technology that came in over the last 50 years, and we have twice as many people working in this country as we did 50 years ago, twice as many.",
      "And the population has only gone up by about a third. So think about that dynamic as it finds its way through. That's the glass-half-full part of it. But it will have an impact. I don't think it's impacting a lot right now, because many companies are just trying to learn how to use it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Technology is impacted, and A.I. gives it a place to go it hasn't gone so far.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we're talking about all the unknowns and why it's kind of hard to model things right now.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Exactly, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Friday, the president fired, as you know, the head statistician that comes up with these jobs numbers and presents them to the public.",
      "The former head during the first Trump administration came out in her defense\u2026",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 and said, this is \u2013 this is without merit, and it undermines credibility of data.",
      "Are you concerned by this firing? And do you feel there is political pressure here?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think that's more politics. And I know I'm in Washington, D.C., and that's what we're supposed to talk about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Government data is \u2013 is\u2026",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: But the reality \u2013 the reality is, the data\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 hugely important to modeling, as you know.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's 2025. It's 2025. And the data should be able to be \u2013 they use surveys and things like that, which, frankly, just aren't as effective anymore.",
      "So, if you look at the rate of people who respond to their surveys, it's down from 60 percent level to 50 percent level. You know, we don't use surveys as aggressively. We do \u2013 we watch what consumers really do. We watch what businesses really do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: They can get this data, I think, other ways. And I think that's where the focus ought to be. How do we get the data to be more resilient and more predictable and more understandable?",
      "Because what bounces around is restatements. And that was one of the largest restatements going back five or seven years into the pandemic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Five years in the pandemic. That creates doubt around it. And so I think the key is, let's get \u2013 let's spend some money. Let's bring the information together. Let's find where else in the government money is reported.",
      "We report millions and millions of data points to the government every day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "So, that's not \u2013 the issue they're focused on is, the regulators' impact on this industry. And you heard Senator Scott talk about this, this week, this reputation, this after-the-fact look that you banked X, and now, after the fact, you're going to say X didn't turn out to be what you thought.",
      "So we look at it. We look at it based on risk. People may feel those decisions are made for some other reason, but we always make it on what's best for our company, what's best for the client.",

      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: We do business with all those industries.",
      "Individual companies, because of credit decision stuff, that's different. But the reality is, is that, if they gave us clarity for the regulatory thing and avoid the second-guessing, that would be helpful. And I think that's what the president was pointing out, if you listen to him.",

      "How much of a setback was the president's decision to do that while you are still at the table?",
      "MINISTER DOMINIC LEBLANC: So we were obviously \u2013 obviously disappointed by that decision.",
      "We believe there's a great deal of common ground between the United States and Canada in terms of building two strong economies that work well together. That's been the history of the 40-year free trade agreement that goes back to President Reagan. We were pleased the United States is respecting the terms of the USMCA agreement.",
      "That's vital, we think, to the cost of living and affordability certainly in the United States. It's true in Canada as well. So we're continue to do the work. We left always with a better understanding of the American concerns in the trading relationship.",
      "Ambassador Greer, Secretary Lutnick engage with us in constructive, cordial conversations. So we're prepared to stick around and do the work needed. We think, Ms. Brennan, that the economies of both countries are strengthened when we do things together. The trading relationship between Canada and the United States is unlike other partners.",
      "One description which I \u2013 which I thought was very apt, we don't sell things to each other, as much as we build things together. And that's why it's difficult in this relationship when so much is integrated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MINISTER DOMINIC LEBLANC: But we remain very optimistic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 but you heard Ambassador Greer say, Canada \u2013 because Canada retaliated to the initial tariffs all the way back in April, when Prime Minister Trudeau was in office, you're paying the price now, even though you have a new government in place.",
      "If that's the issue, why not make that concession and pull back?",
      "MINISTER DOMINIC LEBLANC: So, Prime Minister Carney, our new prime minister, has, we think, built a very businesslike, respectful relationship with President Trump.",
      "We think that's obviously very important to Canada and we think to the United States. We're dealing with \u2013 take, for example, the steel sector in Canada. It's a strategic importance to national security in Canada, as it is for President Trump and the American economy.",
      "We now have a situation where there's a 50 percent tariff. We're the biggest steel export market for the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MINISTER DOMINIC LEBLANC: We have a 25 percent tariff. There's a 50 percent tariff when we want to sell something into the United States. So, effectively, we're blocked from doing that.",
      "But the national security interests of Canada requires that we have a viable steel and aluminum sector. And my conversations with Secretary Lutnick and others are that therein lies an example where, if we do the right work together \u2013 we have, Ms. Brennan, the toughest rules of any country dealing with Chinese dumping into Canada.",
      "We have melt and pour tracing so that products coming from other countries with Chinese steel can't be dumped into the Canadian market. So we're looking and advancing ideas where we can do that work with the United States, at the same time ensuring that our economy continues to have sectors vital to the economic future of Canada.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MINISTER DOMINIC LEBLANC: But that's not in contradiction to President Trump's national security objectives in the United States, of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to talk to you more about this idea of the so-called fortress North America to take on China and some of the specifics of the dispute on the other side of this commercial break.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return to our conversation with the Canadian minister for U.S.-Canada trade, Dominic Leblanc.",
      "Minister, we were just talking about some of the sectoral tariffs, the metals. American automakers, GM, Ford, Stellantis, they have all said that these tariffs are hurting their profits. The 50 percent metal tariffs, which use Canadian aluminum, the secretary of the Treasury was talking about those just the other day, they're see the impact here in the United States. A bit of a backfire in some ways. Do you see room for maneuver on these? Are they willing to negotiate with you on those tariffs?",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC (Minister for Canada-U.S. Trade): Ms. Brennan, we \u2013 we hope so. And as I say, we're encouraged by the conversations with Secretary Lutnick and Ambassador Greer, but we're not yet where we need to go to get the deal that's in the best interest of the two economies.",
      "But your example is a good one. Canadian aluminum companies massively supply the American market. And by putting a 50 percent tariff on aluminum from Canada, you've increased the price of a whole series of goods. The automobile sector again is an example where there's been deep integration.",
      "We're the biggest customer of U.S.-made automobiles. Heavily, heavily importing into Canada, light and heavy-duty trucks. Fifty percent of the cars that we have finished in Canada and sell to the United States are made up of American parts. So, therein lies a perfect example where instead of tariffing one another, or President Trump, for his national security reasons under his Section 232 tariffs, wants to have a strong domestic steel, aluminum, automobile sector. Well, so does Canada. And we \u2013 we understand and respect totally the president's view in terms of the national security interests. In fact, we share it. And what we've said to our American counterparts is, how can we structure the right agreement where we can both continue to supply one another \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC: In a reliable, cost effective way that preserves jobs essential to the American economy, but the same thing is true obviously in Canada as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, are there any plans for the two leaders to speak? I saw President Trump said your prime minister called him Thursday and they just never connected. I mean are tensions that high? And given the changing justification for the tariffs, do you really feel like you're negotiating with the other side in good faith?",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC: Sure, we do. Of course we do. As I say, the conversations have been informative, constructive, and cordial. I would expect the prime minister will have a conversation with the president over the next number of days. That's certainly my plan again with Secretary Lutnick, recognizing that we think there is an option of striking a deal that will bring down some of these tariffs, provide greater certainty to investment.",
      "We, Ms. Brennan, we passed in Canada our version of the president's one big, beautiful bill, it's called the One Canadian Economy Act, which we think will unlock up to $500 billion of investment in Canada for things like pipelines, port infrastructure, mines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC: All of which offer huge opportunities to American businesses as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013",
      "DOMINIC LEBLANC: So, we think there's a great deal \u2013 a great deal to work on together.",

      "Good morning. Welcome to FACE THE NATION.",
      "DR. MEHMET OZ (Administrator, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got a lot of work ahead. I want to start on drug costs. The president put this 25 percent tariff on India. A big drug producer. The president's trade deal with the E.U. puts a 15 percent tariff on imported medicines from Europe. How do you stop the drugmakers from passing along those costs to people on Medicare and Medicaid?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, the president's letter on Thursday, for most favored nation pricing, is a good example of that. And he's been working on this tirelessly since the first administration.",
      "And just to put this in context for many of the viewers, about two-thirds of bankruptcies in America are caused by healthcare expenses. About a third of people when they go to the pharmacy, they leave empty handed. They can't afford the medication. So, the president has said, enough global freeloading.",
      "We've been covering much of the development costs for new drugs to cure cancer, do other things with lots of other illnesses that are life- threatening. Isn't (ph) it time for the American public to understand that we should not be paying three times more for the exact same medication in the same box, made in the same factory.",
      "So, the president is saying, equalize it out. Let's use a model that worked, for example, for external threats, that's what NATO did. Everyone has to pay a little more. We'll pay extra too. But we won't pay a lot more than everybody else so they actually have to raise their \u2013 their \u2013 if you cut contributions, in this case to an internal threat, which is illness, we'll pay a little less in America that way more Americans can afford these medications and it's a fair system for the entire globe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this was declared in these letters that were sent out to 17 pharmaceutical companies this past week and it calls for extending that to Medicaid drug prices. Is that intended to offset what will be, you know, cuts to Medicaid? And do you know, you know, if the companies are actually going to follow through on this? Like, how do you actually strong arm them into doing it?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, just get the numbers correct. We're putting 200 billion more dollars into Medicaid. So, we're actually investing in Medicaid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At a time when costs are going up. So \u2013",
      "MEHMET OZ: Costs are going up, but there's been a 50 percent increase in the cost of Medicaid over the last five years. So, I'm trying to save this beautiful program, this noble effort to help folks, giving them a hand up. And as you probably gather, if Medicaid isn't able to take care of the people for whom it was designed, the young children, at the dawn of their life, those at the twilight of their life, the seniors, and those who are disabled, living in the shadows as Hubert Humphrey said, then we're not satisfying the fundamental obligation of a moral government.",
      "And this president has said over and over that he believes that it is the wise thing and the \u2013 and the noble thing to help those who are vulnerable. And every great society does that. And we're going to as well.",
      "So, we're going to invest in Medicaid, as is required, but we want an appropriate return on that investment.",
      "One thing that Medicaid patients should not face are drug prices they can't afford.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Because then \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you enforce this with the pharmaceutical companies?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, the \u2013 the pharmaceutical companies, if you sit them down quietly, Margaret, and we've done that, and say, you went into this business at some point because you cared about people. I know there's many out there shaking their heads, but that is actually the truth. People go into healthcare, whether they're pharmaceutical companies or insurance companies or the PBMs or anybody in the space, evidence (ph), the CMS, the most impressive thing to me in my new task that the president's appointed me to is the remarkable quality of the people within the organization. Just unbelievably talented. They went into this job because they care about healthcare and about people.",
      "Somewhere along the lines people forget, they put numbers ahead of patients. And when that happens, then you start running into problems. So, we went to the pharmaceutical companies and we said, you appreciate this is not a fair system. We should not be paying more in America, three times more, for your products than you charge in Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: They get the joke. They understand the reality of this problem. They're engaging with us. We're in the middle of those negotiations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "MEHMET OZ: The president has a unique power to convene. We've done it with dealing with prior authorization, this heinous process where patients feel like they're, you know, trying to get care from a doctor, everything's being done except all of a sudden the \u2013 the arm of insurance comes in and stops the whole process for unknown reasons, for week, sometimes months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Your \u2013 the insurance companies representing 80 percent of the American public got together and they said, because we pushed them, we're going to deal with this. We can do the same, I believe with the pharmaceutical industry, with most favored nation pricing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the changes that are coming because of this new law to Medicaid, which is jointly administered between the feds and the states. There are major reductions to federal healthcare spending here. One of the changes are these work requirements. It's about 20 hours a week, volunteer or work, to qualify for healthcare.",
      "What is the guidance you are giving to states on how to implement this? Because in this economy, things are more complicated. Uber driver, independent contractor, how do they show they work their 20 hours a week?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Last weekend I was at the National Governor's Association, with Secretary Kennedy, who has been a big advocate of work as well. And every Democratic president, and Republican president, has said that the foundation of a healthy welfare system, of a social system of support, is work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but I'm \u2013 but I'm asking how you actually implement that and register it so that people who are working do qualify and they don't get caught up in paperwork because they didn't file something on time, that kind of thing.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Right. As long as we're OK that people should work and would want to work, and it's not just work, it's community engagement. They can go get education, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MEHMET OZ: They can take care of family members.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MEHMET OZ: They can contribute in other ways. But work's a great way of doing it. It can get you out of poverty if you can find jobs and elevate yourself.",
      "There have been efforts to do this in the past, but they haven't been able to achieve what we can achieve because we have technologies now and we have invested already, as soon as the bill was signed, began pilots to try to demonstrate that we can actually do this correctly. We have pilots now in Louisiana and in Arizona.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: In both cases, within seven minutes, you can click on where you're working \u2013 you mentioned Uber. You're an Uber driver. You click that button on your phone. It just takes you to your payroll provider. Let's say it's ADP. We then ask your permission, can we connect with this payroll provider to \u2013 to demonstrate what you've actually been able to work and earn over the past month.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: This also, by the way, confirms your eligibility.",
      "But there's a bigger benefit here. Once you do that, you're in, you're done. However, what if we take it one step further, Margaret? What if we go beyond just proving that you tried to work, to actually saying, you know what, you didn't work enough but we can actually help you by connecting you through employment office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're still figuring out the technology, but isn't there an end of December deadline for a lot of these things to be figured out, and how do you make sure that people don't get kicked off because, in the state of Georgia, which already had work requirements, they have really struggled to make this work.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, a couple of things. It's not the end of December. It's the end of December a year from now. And Georgia is apples and oranges. Georgia had a program only for people under the poverty level and, for those people, if they wanted, they could elect to come into a system to help them get jobs. There have been 50,000 reduction in head count of uninsured people in the overall program in the last five years. Overall, Georgia, 2 million less uninsured people. So, Georgia is using a lot of tactics, and they're going in the right direction.",
      "I would argue that if you have confidence in the American people and their desire to take the offer to try to get a job if we challenge you to that, and, remember, if you're an able-bodied person on Medicaid \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: You're spending 6.1 hours watching television or leisure time. So, you don't want that \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Kafa (ph) Health Policy found 92 percent of adult Medicaid recipients already are working or they have the carve out because they have to have caregivers or they have to do other things.",
      "MEHMET OZ: They're fine. All they have to do is \u2013 there will be a simple app. If you're already carved out, that's super simple. If you're supposed to be \u2013 if you're able-bodied and you're supposed to be working, we want to help connect you to the job market and get you into work. We have twice as many jobs available in America as people seem to want them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MEHMET OZ: The foundation of work is not just about fulfilling eligibility. The goal of healthcare insurance is to catalyze action in the right direction, to get you healthier, to give you agency over your future so you recognize you matter and you should have a job there for \u2013 to go out and change the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "So, there's a drug addiction problem in the country. How are those changes going to impact people who are on Medicaid in states like Kentucky, in states like West Virginia?",
      "MEHMET OZ: In many instances there are carveouts for folks who need \u2013 who have substance use disorder problems. There are programs to support \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do they prove that?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, they can either \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that in the app?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Yes, it will be in app. And the app, again, if we're being \u2013 but this is being developed by the United States Digital Service led by Amy Gleason, who is a wonderful technologist. She and I were with the president and Secretary Kennedy and the head of the \u2013 the czar for A.I. in this country on Wednesday talking about overall how we're going to change the use of health technology in America. We've got to get into 2025 with health technology, as is true in every other sector.",
      "If you're watching the show right now, you could also have been streaming media. You could take an Uber somewhere, ride share. You can do an Airbnb. Technology should make the system more efficient.",
      "We should have confidence that it will also allow us to do what we all agree is possible. If the whole challenge to a work requirement is that you don't have confidence in our ability to accomplish it, that's a separate question, because I do have confidence in the American people and we have confidence we can pull this off.",
      "Look at the passport system, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Right now you can go and get a passport in two weeks without having to go to the post office, send pictures in, all that's gone. It's fixable. Let's use technology.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm still confused on how someone who is in the throes of substance abuse is going to use an app to say I'm in the throes of substance abuse every week to file online, but \u2013",
      "MEHMET OZ: Well, when they go \u2013 when they go in to get their help for their substance abuse treatment, assuming they're going for help on that, they can also get enrolled in \u2013 and those requirements can be fulfilled.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: We want to talk to them in as many ways as possible. It's not going to happen just because we put an app out there. You \u2013 you have social workers, other folk \u2013 elements who care a lot about this population who are coming together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MEHMET OZ: But they have to have some mechanism to report back. That just has not been done well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and this is incredibly detailed, and that's why we wanted to have you on. I have so many more questions for you on rural hospitals and \u2013 and some of the other criticisms. I have to leave it there for now but thank you, Dr. Oz.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Can I give you 30 seconds on rural hospitals? Because this is important.",
      "You have 7 percent of Medicaid money going to rural hospitals. We're putting $50 billion. The president wants this. The congress wants this. It will make a massive dent (ph).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are a lot of questions about how you're going to dole that out and whether you have already made promises. Do you have any specifics for us?",
      "MEHMET OZ: Yes, we \u2013 we \u2013 it's going to be \u2013 they'll get the applications in early September.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "MEHMET OZ: The \u2013 the \u2013 the money is designed to help you with workforce development, right sizing the system and using technology to provide things like telehealth that can change the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "MEHMET OZ: Imagine if we can change the way we think about the delivery of health and make it more about getting people healthy so you can thrive and flourish and be fully present in their own lives and as Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Oz, we'll leave it there.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn to New Mexico's Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. She joins us from Santa Fe.",
      "Governor, two out of five New Mexicans are on Medicaid. You've got a lot of rural hospitals. Have you figured out how to implement everything Dr. Oz just laid out?",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM (D-NM): Absolutely not. There is no real way to implement this. It's more paperwork for everyone. It's more paperwork for federal government, for state governments, for county governments, for local hospitals, for independent providers. And you know what Americans really hate, Margaret? When you go to your primary care physician, and you spend 20 minutes sitting at a chair, not even on the exam table, while they are inputting data into a computer. So, this doesn't make any sense.",
      "We should be a society and a country that is connecting people to healthcare providers. I think the one thing that Dr. Oz represents, that's a fair representation, is, we should be healthier as Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: All right. And we need to be moving out of poverty. We need drug prices, we should talk about that, to come down. So, go after insurance companies. Do manufacturing here. Make sure we can negotiate fair prices. Let states do that. Because I guarantee you, we'll do a better job than the federal government.",
      "And lastly, get people early easy access. Today, more than half, or about half, our small businesses don't even offer healthcare coverage. So, you can get a job, but now what?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, you said, though, in your state, because, as a governor, you're going to have to figure this out.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have reserve cash from some oil and gas revenues, as I understand it, that have been put aside. Doesn't that show it is possible for the federal government to shift more responsibility back to the states? That's the argument conservatives are making.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: They are. And it's temporary. There is no way any state, including this one, which, frankly, I am really proud of, we are in really good financial shape. That takes planning and effort.",
      "You know, our job projections continue to be met and exceed, unlike the federal jobs report, which is going in the opposite direction. So, I don't know where all these jobs are going to be in this anemic economy. I mean, it's so bad, with \u2013 the last time it was this bad, I was in college. And let me tell you, that was a very long time ago.",
      "And so, yes, temporarily, we can do that. But you can't do it over the long haul. The loss minimally to New Mexico over less than a decade is between $12 billion and $13 billion. And when, not if, rural hospitals and local providers close their doors, I can do this better than any other state. The last governor completely canceled behavioral health.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: Six years later, we are still reeling from trying to rebuild. We put a billion dollars into behavioral health just this last legislative session. It is not so easy to rebuild something out of nothing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the $50 billion rural healthcare fund under this Republican law is supposed to give people the \u2013 your \u2013 states like yours the ability to come and say, we need this extra cash. Are you going to have to ask for that?",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: I'm going to ask for every dollar the federal government has put aside anywhere that benefits a New Mexican. So, you've got $50 billion, that's $1 billion for each state if it was even. Do you know how much money it would take to shore up rural hospitals? More than a billion. And to put that in perspective, let me do this. It's a billion just for behavioral health. It's a billion plus just to keep people's coverage. It's another billion for prescription drugs. It's a billion dollars for rural provider delivery investments. And that's only 50 hospitals. You have hundreds of hospitals, hundreds, 400 rural hospitals across America that will shutter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: So, that's the number, at (ph) it is. We are \u2013 how do we pick these rural hospitals? And if you pick a southeastern rural hospital in New Mexico, what about the rural hospital in western New Mexico?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: Economies fail. People have to move away. You don't have any OBGYN care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: That whole area collapses. And they are reducing rural healthcare delivery by about $134 billion. So, the $50 billion is just to make someone, somewhere feel like they recognize that this is a disaster.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: $900 billion out of Medicaid is catastrophic. Straight up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, we ran through a lot of material here. I have more questions for you. But very quickly, can you tell me, you deployed the National Guard to counter unrest in New Mexico. How is that different from what the president did in California?",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: Well, they're not policing. They're doing the back-end work so that trained community policing and members of that training, right, those local police officers, they're on the streets. What we have in this country is a shortage of police officers. What I have in New Mexico is a partnership. So, they're doing all of the \u2013 they answer all of the emergency calls. They handle all the traffic clearance when we've got a crash. And it is working. We're beginning to see more productive fentanyl, drug-dealing high-end arrests than we did without The Guard. And I'm really proud of that work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: This is about partnering and leveraging, not about indiscriminately going after individuals who have not committed serious crimes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Governor, thank you for your time today.",
      "GOVERNOR MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM: You're welcome, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: FACE THE NATION will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

      "Hundreds have been killed near the U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Aid hubs controlled by the Israeli Defense Forces, which denies it fires on desperate crowds. But under global pressure, the IDF aloud more U.N. supplies in this past week, and took us to an aid collection point just inside Gaza to prove they are not deliberately starving Palestinians.",
      "DEBORA PATTA: The IDF has brought us here to demonstrate that, as far as they're concerned, their responsibility for delivering aid stops right here.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Dr. Mehmet Oz, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administrator, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 3, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Change is coming for the country's Medicaid system as part of the enactment of the Big, Beautiful Bill. To help us understand what's ahead, we turn now to the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Dr. Mehmet Oz. Good morning. Welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "DR. MEHMET OZ: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got a lot of work ahead. I want to start on drug costs. The president put this 25% tariff on India, big drug producer. The President's trade deal with the EU puts a 15 percent tariff on imported medicines from Europe. How do you stop the drug makers from passing along those costs to people on Medicare and Medicaid?",
      "DR. MEHMET OZ: Well, the president's letter on Thursday for most favored nation pricing is a good example of that, and he's been working on this tirelessly since the first administration. And just to put this in context for many of the viewers, about two thirds of bankruptcies in America are caused by health care expenses. About a third of people when they go to the pharmacy, they leave empty handed. They can't afford the medication. So the President has said, Enough global freeloading. We've been covering much of the development costs for new drugs to cure cancer, deal with lots of other illnesses that are life threatening. It is in time for the American public to understand that we should not be paying three times more for the exact same medication in the same box, made in the same factories. The president's saying, equalize it out. Let's use a model that's worked, for example, for external threats, that's what NATO did. Everyone has to pay a little more. We'll pay extra too, but we won't pay a lot more than everybody else, so they actually have to raise their contributions, in this case, to an internal threat, which is illness. We'll pay a little less than America that way more Americans can afford these medications, and it's a fair system for the entire globe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So this was declared in these letters that were sent out to 17 pharmaceutical companies this past week, and it calls for extending that to Medicaid drug prices. Is that intended to offset what will be, you know, cuts to Medicaid? And do you know, you know, if the companies are actually going to follow through on this, like, how do you actually strong arm them into doing it?",
      "DR. OZ: Well just get the numbers correct. We're putting 200 billion more dollars into Medicaid. So we're actually investing\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014by the time when costs are going up, so.",
      "DR. OZ: Costs are going up, but there's been a 50 percent increase in the cost of Medicaid over the last five years. So I'm trying to save this beautiful program, this noble effort, to help folks giving them a hand up. And as you probably gather, if Medicaid isn't able to take care of the people for whom it was designed, the young children, the dawn of their life, those are the twilight of their life, the seniors and those who are disabled living in the shadows, as Hubert Humphrey said, then we're not satisfying the fundamental obligation of a moral government.

So we're going to invest in Medicaid as is required, but we want an appropriate return on that investment. One thing that Medicaid patients should not face are drug prices they can't afford.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, how do you enforce this? Pharmaceutical companies\u2014",
      "DR. OZ: Well, the pharmaceutical companies, if you sit them down quietly, Margaret, and we've done that, and say you went into this business at some point, because you cared about people. I know there's many out there shaking their heads, but that is actually the truth. People go into health care, whether they're pharmaceutical companies or insurance companies or the PBMs or anybody in the space. Even at the CMS, the most impressive thing to me in my new task, and the President has appointed me to, is the remarkable quality of people within the organization, just unbelievably talented. They went into this job because they care about health care and about people. Somewhere along the lines, people forget. They put numbers ahead of patients. And when that happens, then you start running into problems. We went to the pharmaceutical companies and we said, you appreciate this is not a fair system. We should not be paying more in America, three times more, for your products than you charge in Europe. They get the joke. They understand the reality of this problem. They are engaging with us. We're in the middle of those negotiations. The President has a unique power to convene. We've done it with dealing with prior authorization, this heinous process where patients feel like they're trying to get care from a doctor. Everything's being done except all of a sudden the arm of insurance comes in and stops the whole process for unknown reasons for weeks, sometimes months. The insurance companies, representing 80 percent of the American public, got together and they said, because we pushed them, we're going to deal with this. We can do the same, I believe, with the pharmaceutical industry, with most favored nation pricing.",

There are major reduction- reductions to federal health care spending here, one of the changes are these work requirements. It's about 20 hours a week, volunteer or work to qualify for health care. What is the guidance you are giving to states on how to implement this? Because in this economy, things are more complicated. Uber driver, independent contractor, how do they show they work their 20 hours a week?",
      "DR. OZ: Last weekend, I was at the National Governors Association with Secretary Kennedy, who has been a big advocate of work as well. Every Democratic president and Republican president has said that the foundation of a healthy welfare system of a social system of support is work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but I'm asking how you actually implement that and register it so that people who are working do qualify, and they don't get caught up in paperwork because they didn't file something on time.",
      "DR. OZ: As long as we're okay that people should work and would want to work, and it's not just work, it's community engagement. They can go get educated, right? They can take care of family members. They can contribute in other ways, but work is a great way of doing and get you out of poverty if you can find jobs and elevate yourself. There have been efforts to do this in the past, but they haven't been able to achieve what we can achieve, because we have technologies now. And we've invested already, as soon as the bill was signed, began pilots to try to demonstrate that we can actually do this correctly. We have pilots now in Louisiana and in Arizona, in both cases, within seven minutes, you can click on where you're working. You mentioned Uber, you're an Uber driver. You click that button on your phone. It just takes you to your payroll provider. Let's say it's ADP. We then ask your permission, can we connect with this payroll provider to demonstrate what you've actually been able to work and earn over the past month? This also, by the way, confirms your eligibility. But there's a bigger benefit here. Once you do that, you're in, you're done. However, what if we take one step further, Margaret? What if we go beyond just proving that you tried the work to actually say, You know what, you didn't work enough, but we can actually help you by connecting you through an employment office?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're still figuring out the technology, but isn't there an end-of-December deadline for a lot of these things to be figured out? And how do you make sure that people don't get kicked off? Because in the state of Georgia, which already had work requirements, they have really struggled to make this work.",
      "DR. OZ: Well, a couple of things. It's not the end of December, it's end of December a year from now, and Georgia is apples and oranges. Georgia had a program only for people under the poverty level, and for those people, if they wanted, they could elect to come into a system to help them get jobs. There have been 50,000 reduction in head count of uninsured people in the overall program in the last five years. Overall, Georgia, 2 million less uninsured people. So Georgia is using a lot of tactics, and they're going in the right direction. I would argue that if you have confidence in the American people and their desire to take to offer to try to get a job, if we challenge you to that. And remember, if you're an able-bodied person on Medicaid, you're spending 6.1 hours watching television or leisure time, so you don't want that\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014Well, KFF Health Policy found 92 percent of adult Medicaid recipients already are working. Or they have the carve out because they have to have caregivers, or they have to do other things.",
      "DR. OZ: They're fine. All they have to do is there'll be a simple app. If you've already carved out, that's super simple. If you're supposed to be if you're able-bodied and supposed to be working, we want to help connect you to the job market and get you into work. We have twice as many jobs available in America as people who seem to want them. The foundation of work is not just about fulfilling eligibility. The goal of health care insurance is to catalyze action in the right direction, to get you healthier, to give you agency over your future, so you recognize you matter, and you should have a job, therefore to go out and change the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there's a drug addiction problem in this country. How are those changes going to impact people who are on Medicaid in states like Kentucky, in states like West Virginia?",
      "DR. OZ: In many instances, there are carve outs for folks who have substance use disorder problems. There are programs--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014How do they prove that?",
      "ADMINISTRATOR OZ: Well, they can\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this in the app?",
      "DR. OZ: Yes, it will be in the app. The app, again, this is being developed by the United States Digital Service, led by Amy Gleason, who is a wonderful technologist. She and I were with the President and Secretary Kennedy and the head of the czar for AI in this country on Wednesday, talking about overall how we're going to change the use of health technology in America. We've got to get into 2025 with health technology, as is true in every other sector. If you're watching the show right now, you could also be streaming media. You could take an Uber somewhere, the rideshare. You could do an Airbnb. Technology should make the system more efficient. We should have confidence that it will also allow us to do what we all agree is possible. If the whole challenge to a work requirement is that you don't have confidence in our ability to accomplish it, that's a separate question, because I do have confidence in the American people, and we have confidence we can pull this off. Look at the passport system, Margaret. Right now, you can go and get a passport in two weeks without having to go to the post office, send pictures, and all that's gone. It's fixable. Let's use technology.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm still confused on how someone who is in the throes of substance abuse is going to use an app to say, I'm in the throes of substance abuse every week, to file on online\u2014",
      "DR. OZ: \u2014When they go in to get their help for their substance abuse treatment, assuming they're going for help on that, they can also get enrolled in, in those requirements, can be fulfilled. We want to talk to them in as many ways as possible. It's not going to happen just because we put an app out there, you, you have social workers and other folk elements who care a lot about this population, who are coming together, but they have to have some mechanism to report back. That just has not been done well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and this is incredibly detailed, and that's why we wanted to have you on. I have so many more questions for you on rural hospitals and some of the other criticisms. I have to leave it there for now. But thank you, Dr. Oz--",
      "DR. OZ: Can I give you 30 seconds on rural hospitals, because this is important. You have 7 percent of Medicaid money going to rural hospitals. We're putting 50 billion dollars the president wants us to, Congress wants to\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are a lot questions on how you're going to duel that out, and whether you have already made promises. Do you have any specifics for us?",
      "DR. OZ: Yes. Wait, wait, it's going to be, they'll get the applications in early September. The money is designed to help you with workforce development, right sizing the system and using technology to provide things like telehealth that can change the world. Imagine if we can change the way we think about the delivery of health and make it more about getting people healthy so they can thrive and flourish and be fully present in their own lives and as Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr Oz, we'll leave it there. We'll be back in a moment."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Dominic LeBlanc, Canadian Minister for U.S.-Canada Trade, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 3, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Canadian Minister for U.S.-Canada trade, Dominic LeBlanc, who joins us this morning from Moncton, Canada. Good morning to you.",
      "MIN. LEBLANC: Good morning, Ms. Brennan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were just here, in Washington, negotiating. And while the talks are officially continuing, you left town without a deal, and you left town with, now, what is a 35% tariff on goods. How much of a setback was the President's decision to do that while you are still at the table?",
      "MIN. LEBLANC: So we were obviously\u2014obviously disappointed by that decision. We believe there's a great deal of common ground between the United States and Canada in terms of building two strong economies that work well together. That's been the history of the 40-year Free Trade Agreement that goes back to President Reagan. We were pleased the United States is respecting the terms of the USMCA agreement. That's vital, we think, to the cost of living and affordability, certainly in the United States, it's true in Canada, as well. So, we're going to continue to do the work. We left, always, with a better understanding of the American concerns in the trading relationship. Ambassador Greer, Secretary Lutnick, engaged with us in constructive, cordial conversations. So we're prepared to stick around and do the work needed. We think, Ms. Brennan, that the economies of both countries are strengthened when we do things together, the trading relationship between Canada and the United States is unlike other partners. One description, without which I thought was very apt; we don't sell things to each other as much as we build things together. And that's why it's- it's difficult in this relationship when so much is integrated. But we remain very optimistic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, you heard Ambassador Greer say Canada\u2014because Canada retaliated to the initial tariffs all the way back in April, when Prime Minister Trudeau was in office, you're paying the price now, even though you have a new government in place. If that's the issue, why not make that concession and pull back?",
      "MIN. LEBLANC: So, Prime Minister Carney, our new prime minister, has, we think, built a very business-like, respectful relationship with President Trump. We think that's obviously very important to Canada, and we think to the United States. We're dealing with, take, for example, the steel sector in Canada. It's a strategic importance to national security in Canada, as it is for President Trump and the American economy. We now have a situation where there's a 50% tariff. We're the biggest steel export market for the United States. We have a 25% tariff. There's a 50% tariff when we want to sell something into the United States. So, effectively, we're blocked from doing that. But the national security interest of Canada requires that we have a viable steel and aluminum sector, and my conversations with Secretary Lutnick and others are that therein lies an example, where if we do the right work together, we have, Ms. Brennan, the toughest rules of any country dealing with Chinese dumping into Canada. We have melt and pour tracing, so that products coming from other countries with Chinese steel can't be dumped into the Canadian market. So, we're looking and advancing ideas where we can do that work with the United States, at the same time, ensuring that our economy continues to have sectors vital to the economic future of Canada. But, that's not in contradiction to President Trump's national security objectives in the United States, of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to talk to you more about this idea of the so-called fortress North America to take on China, and some of the specifics of the dispute on the other side of this commercial break. Please stay with us. We'll have more questions for Minister LeBlanc shortly. We'll you see in a moment.",
      "((COMMERCIAL BREAK))",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation with the Canadian Minister for US-Canada trade, Dominic LeBlanc. Minister, we were just talking about some of the sectoral tariffs, the metals. American automakers, GM, Ford, Stellantis, they have all said that these tariffs are hurting their profits. The 50% metal tariffs, which use Canadian aluminum, the Secretary of the Treasury was talking about those just the other day, they're seeing the impact here in the United States, a bit of a backfire in some ways. Do you see room for maneuver on these? Are they willing to negotiate with you on those tariffs?",
      "MIN. LEBLANC: Ms. Brennan, we hope so. And, as I say, we're encouraged by the conversations with Secretary Lutnick and Ambassador Greer, but we're not yet where we need to go to get the deal that's in the best interest of the two economies. But your example is a good one. Canadian aluminum companies massively supply the American market. And by putting a 50% tariff on aluminum from Canada, you've increased the price of a whole series of goods. The automobile sector, again, is an example where there's been deep integration. We're the biggest customer of U.S. made automobiles. Heavily, heavily importing into Canada light and heavy-duty trucks. 50% of the cars that we finish in Canada and sell to the United States are made up of American parts. So, therein lies a perfect example where, instead of tariffing one another, or President Trump for his national security reasons, under his Section 232, tariffs, wants to have a strong domestic steel, aluminum automobile sector. Well, so does Canada. And we understand and respect totally the President's view in terms of the national security interest. In fact, we share it, and what we've said to our American counterparts is, how can we structure the right agreement, where we can both continue to supply one another in a reliable, cost-effective way that preserves jobs essential to the American economy, but the same thing is true, obviously in Canada as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are there any plans for the two leaders to speak? I saw President Trump said your prime minister called him Thursday, and they just never connected. I mean, are tensions that high? And given the changing justification for the tariffs, do you really feel like you're negotiating with the other side in good faith?",
      "MIN. LEBLANC: Sure, we do. Of course we do. As I say, the conversations have been informative, constructive, and cordial. I would expect the Prime Minister will have a conversation with the President over the next number of days. That's certainly my plan, again with Secretary Lutnick, recognizing that we think there is an option of striking a deal that will bring down some of these tariffs, provide greater certainty to investment. We, Ms. Brennan, we passed, in Canada, our version of the President's One Big, Beautiful Bill. It's called the One Canadian Economy Act, which we think will unlock up to $500 billion of investment in Canada for things like pipelines, port infrastructure, mines, all of which offer huge opportunities to American businesses as well. So, we think there's a great deal- a great deal to work on together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Minister, we'll see if you can get one. We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with Bank of America CEO, Brian Moynihan, good morning, and thank you for being here with us.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Good to be here again, Margaret, hope you're doing well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm hoping you can give us some clarity here on what's going on with the economy. Your Bank of America economists say no rate hikes this year and no recession. Is that still the case after Friday's jobs report?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yeah, it's still the case, and that's a\u2014less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that\u2014but they still think we continue to grow. And we're growing at a slow rate, say, one and a half percent this year, little more next year, and a little more the year after that. But it will take inflation\u2014for the Fed to get inflation out of the system, really through the end of '26 into '27 down to the 2% level. And that's why they have the Fed holding. What they believe is sort of in the middle of next year, the Fed will start cutting and bring the Fed funds rate closer to what would be a more normal rate, around three percent, three and a half percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even though we saw this, really, kind of astounding dissent by two members of the Fed saying, we do need to move on interest rates. Your prediction from your economists is that that's not appropriate at this time.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: They don't think it's\u2014they're going to move. Now, the market says they're going to move in September, maybe twice this year. The market was at seven times one point this year. Now they're down to two\u2014then they're down to one, now they're up to two. This is going to move around, but the reality is, two things people should really keep in focus. One is, until the inflation is out of the system, the Fed is going to be a little\u2014very careful, and that's what they said. And then secondly, the rate we're going to go to is a rate that is more normal than pre-global financial crisis, more of a 3%, 3.5% percent rate, which actually means the American economy is probably functioning better, frankly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on that point, the Wall Street Journal, we were reading in, puts the tariff tax increase as costing $360 billion a year. That's one of the largest tax increases in history, they say. Do you believe the administration's arguments that it's really only foreigners who are going to pay the cost of this. Do you think economists are overstating the negative impact?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think no one really knows, honestly, because this is a different regime than we've been in before. And there's- so they're trying to extrapolate from things from 50 years ago, when economies were different structured. Our team thinks it's- has an impact on inflation of about a, you know, 30, 40 basis points\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning adding to prices people are paying.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yeah, adding to the inflation rate in the United States. But we need to back up. What the real impact right now is the new Trump administration coming in had four or five policy areas they were really going to go after, having learned in the four years, they had to move very quickly. Those were around trades and tariff, immigration and taxation and deregulation. What businesses, and I just was in the Midwest with a bunch of businesses, they're all trying to do is figure out what the answer will be so they can go ahead and make their plans for '26. So the activity that's slowed down has more to do with people just trying to figure out the answer. It doesn't mean every answer is acceptable. Most answers are. So what do they have answers on? Obviously, a tax bill getting done. That's a good answer for business, because it makes the rates permanent. What's the second thing they have an answer on. They have an answer now on the range of trade possibilities. And so as they think about the trade possibilities, they sit there and say, tariffs might not be worse than x. They see some deals getting done, all of which is good work. What they don't have an answer on is deregulation. Yes, new regulations stop, but they are hoping for more deregulation, so that will help their business models going forward. And then the last is immigration. What will immigration really settle in like. And that's what they tell us. So they're not using their lines of credit, they're not- the indications from them are they're being a little more cautious, really waiting for some answers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Businesses aren't hiring, either, we saw in this jobs data on Friday, that was the worst three months for job growth since the pandemic. Your firm, when I was reading the analysis, points to a number of different factors, and one of them is artificial intelligence and the adoption of that impacting hiring. How dramatically is it reshaping the job market?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: I think this is sort of a question of almost a glass half full, half empty type of thing. So the impact\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No pun intended.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Exactly, sorry about that. But the impact of technology on human work content as a percentage of productivity has been huge. In our company- in 2010 when I started with the management team, we had 285,000 people. We have 212,000 people today. That was the impact of technology. We're bigger, more customers, more transactions, more reports to the government, more data, et cetera. So the impact has always been huge. AI gives you a place to go that we've never been able to go before. In other words, they're jobs that take text, think about it, and produce it. Many, many jobs in a company. Our research team, now you're able to maybe use a machine to enhance that activity. So we believe that people harness AI for their benefit are going to be very successful. My teammates who harness AI for their benefit are very successful. It's nervous making for young kids now, saying, will the jobs be there for me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Then I say, look back historically. America has a lot more people working here. And think about the amount of technology came in over the last 50 years, and we have twice as many people work in this country as we did 50 years ago, twice as many, and the population has only gone up by about a third. So think about that dynamic as it finds its way through. That's the glass half full part of it. But it will have an impact. I don't think it's impacting a lot right now, because many companies are just trying to learn how to use it. Technology has impacted, and AI gives it a place to go it hasn't gone so far.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we're talking about all the unknowns and why it's kind of hard to model things right now. Well, Friday, the President fired, as you know, the head statistician that comes up with these jobs numbers and presents them to the public. The former head during the first Trump administration came out in her defense and said this is- this is without merit, and it undermines credibility of data. Are you concerned by this firing, and do you feel there is political pressure here?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think that's more politics. And I know I'm in Washington, DC, and that's what we're supposed to talk about--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Government data is, is\u2014",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: but the reality is, the data\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: hugely important modeling",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's 2025",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: as you know.",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's 2025 and the data should be able to be\u2014 they use surveys and things like that, which, frankly, just aren't as effective anymore. So if you look at the rate of people who respond to their surveys, it's down from 60% level to 50% level. You know, we don't use surveys (unintelligible) we do. We watch what consumers really do. We watch what businesses really do. They can get this data, I think, other ways and I think that's where the focus ought to be. How do we get the data to be more resilient and more predictable and more understandable? Because what bounces around is restatements, and that was one of the largest restatements, going back five or seven years in the pandemic, five years in the pandemic, that creates doubt around it. And so I think the key is, let's get- let's spend some money. Let's bring the information together. Let's find where else in the government money is reported. We report millions and millions of data points to the government every day. The data is out there somewhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Finally, back in January, you were at Davos, President Trump talked about Bank of America.",
      "TRUMP ON TAPE: Many conservatives complained that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America. This conservative- They don't take conservative business. And I don't know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want to respond to the allegation that conservatives are not being allowed to do business with your bank?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: We have 70 million consumers, and we're the biggest small business lender. That's not- the issue they're focused on is the regulators impact on this industry. And you heard Senator Scott talk about this this week. This reputation, this after the fact, look, that you banked x, and now after the fact, you're gonna say x didn't turn out to be what you thought. So we look at it. We look at it based on risk. People may feel those decisions are made for some other reason, but we always make it on what's best for our company, what's best for our client.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are there industries you're uncomfortable doing business with?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: No, we do business with really--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Guns, oil and gas, tobacco, all of it?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: We do business with all those industries. Individual companies because of credit decision stuff, that's different. But the reality is, is that if they gave us clarity from the regulatory thing and avoid the second guessing, that would be helpful, and I think that's what the President was pointing out, if you listen to him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Brian Moynihan, thank you for giving us some insight into the data you are seeing. Face the Nation will be back in a moment. Stay with us."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 3, 2025.",
      "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to New Mexico's Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. She joins us from Santa Fe. Governor, two out of five New Mexicans are on Medicaid. You've got a lot of rural hospitals. Have you figured out how to implement everything Dr. Oz just laid out?",
      "GOV. LUJAN GRISHAM: Absolutely not. There is no real way to implement this. It's more paperwork for everyone. It's more paperwork for federal government, for state governments, for county governments, for local hospitals, for independent providers. And you know what Americans really hate, Margaret? When you go to your primary care physician and you spend 20 minutes sitting at a chair, not even on the exam table, while they are inputting data into a computer. So this doesn't make any sense. We should be a society and a country that is connecting people to healthcare providers. I think the one thing that Dr. Oz represents that's a fair representation, is we should be healthier as Americans. All right. We need to be moving out of poverty. We need drug prices- we should talk about that, to come down. So go after insurance companies. Do manufacturing here. Make sure we can negotiate fair prices. Let states do that, because I guarantee you, we'll do a better job than the federal government. And lastly, get people early, easy access today, more than half, or about half, our small businesses don't even offer health care coverage. So you can get a job. but now what?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, well, you said, though- in your state, because as a governor, you're going to have to figure this out. You have reserve cash from some oil and gas revenues, as I understand it, that have been put aside. Doesn't that show it is possible for the federal government to shift more responsibility back to the states? That's the argument conservatives are making.",
      "GOV. LUJAN GRISHAM: They are and it's temporary. There is no way any state, including this one\u2014which, frankly, I am really proud of, we are in really good financial shape that takes planning and effort. You know, our job projections continue to be met and exceed, unlike the federal jobs report, which is going in the opposite direction. So I don't know where all these jobs are going to be in this anemic economy. I mean, it's so bad. The last time it was this bad, I was in college, and let me tell you, that was a very long time ago. And so yes, temporarily we can do that. But you can't do it over the long haul. The lost minimally to New Mexico over less than a decade is between 12 and $13 billion dollars and when, not if, rural hospitals and local providers close their doors. I can do this better than any other state. The last governor completely canceled behavioral health. Six years later, we are still reeling from trying to rebuild. We put a billion dollars into behavioral health just this last legislative session. It is not so easy to rebuild something out of nothing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the $50 billion Rural Health Care Fund under this Republican law is supposed to give people the\u2014 your\u2014states like yours, the ability to come and say, we need this extra cash. Are you going to have to ask for that?",
      "GOV. LUJAN GRISHAM: I'm going to ask for every dollar the federal government has put aside anywhere that benefits a New Mexican. So you got 50 billion. That's $1 billion for each state, if it was even. Do you know how much money it would take to shore up rural hospitals? More than a billion. And to put that in perspective\u2014let me do this, it's a billion just for behavioral health, it's a billion plus just to keep people's coverage, it's another billion for prescription drugs, it's a billion dollars for rural provider delivery investments, and that's only 50 hospitals. You have hundreds of hospitals. Hundreds. 400 rural hospitals across America that will shutter. So that's the number at it is. We are- how do we pick these rural hospitals? And if you pick a Southeastern rural hospital in New Mexico, what about the rural hospital in western New Mexico. Economies fail. People have to move away. You don't have any OBGYN care. That whole area collapses, and they are reducing rural health care delivery by about 134 billion. So the 50 billion is just to make someone somewhere feel like they recognize that this is a disaster. $900 billion out of Medicaid is catastrophic, straight up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, we ran through a lot of material here. I have more questions for you, but very quickly\u2014can you tell me\u2014you deployed the National Guard to counter unrest in New Mexico. How is that different from what the president did in California?",
      "GOV. LUJAN GRISHAM: Well, they're not policing. They're doing the back end work so that trained community policing, and members of that training, right\u2014those local police officers, they're on the streets. What we have in this country is a shortage of police officers. What I have in New Mexico is a partnership. So they're doing all of the\u2014they answer all of the emergency calls. They handle all the traffic clearance when we've got a crash. And it is working, we're beginning to see more productive fentanyl drug dealing high end arrests than we did without the guard. And I'm really proud of that work. This is about partnering and leveraging, not about indiscriminately going after individuals who have not committed serious crimes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for your time today. 'Face the Nation' will be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that airs on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 3, 2025. This interview was taped on Aug. 1, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by United States Trade Representative, Jamieson Greer. Ambassador, good to have you here.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Great to be here. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the President signed this executive order on Thursday, raises tariff rates on about 70 countries. Should we expect those to be negotiated down in the coming days?",
      "JAMIESON GREER: I don't, I don't think they will be in the coming days. I think a lot of these, well I know a lot of these, are set rates pursuant to deals. Some of these deals are announced,\u00a0 some are not, others depend on the level of the trade deficit or surplus we may have with the country. So, so these, these tariff rates are pretty much set. I expect I do have my phone blowing up. There are trade ministers who, who want to talk more and see how they can work in a different way with the United States, but I think that we have, we're seeing truly the contours of the President's tariff plan right now with these rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I was reading some interviews you had given, and you said at some point the President's view is maybe a tariff is better than a deal. Are you saying there are countries that just, they have no shot of avoiding a tariff?",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Well, I would say that, in fact, most countries in the world, they just have a tariff assigned to them, right? Whether it's\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It'll be the 10 percent or 15 percent.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: 10 or 15 or the higher level tariff. Because, again, when the President is looking at this, he looks at potential deals, and we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do. And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then talking to his advisors, he makes a call on this. And you know, sometimes a country will come back and make additional concessions that, that make it more appropriate. He's trying to get at the deficit. He's trying to reshore manufacturing. And so those are the factors he's looking at when he's looking at when he's determining whether he's just going to have a tariff or he'll take a deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trying to reshore manufacturing, bring manufacturing jobs back to America. But we just saw in this unemployment data that while the level is pretty low overall, it's pretty steady, good. Manufacturing in particular, we saw it contract for the fifth straight month in July, factory employment dropped to lowest levels in five years. What does that data indicate to you about the impact of your tariffs?",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Yeah, I saw that and my own view is that I think a lot of companies were waiting to see if the tax bill was going to come through with the expensing for capital goods and things like that. And so I think now you know a lot of that data comes pre \"One Big Beautiful Bill\". Now that we have \"One Big Beautiful Bill\", and we have a better sense of where the taxes are going, I think we're going to see a much, we're going to see more investment, all the, all the commitments on investment we've seen countries making, that's going to come through. And like you said, it's a relatively small number. So I don't, I don't read tariff policy into that number. I think that is kind of pre-bill policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you believe the executives are making strategic decisions with hiring, but the President just announced that the head of Labor Statistics is being fired because of the weak jobs report, claiming the data was faked.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Well, I think you know, and I saw what the president did, and he also talked about the, just the record from BLS, you know, last year\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Labor Statistics Bureau.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: That's right, yeah, exactly. You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers and so it sounds to me like the President has real concerns. You know, not just based on today's but everything we saw last year. You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways. And it's, you know, the President is the President. He can choose who works in the executive branch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you were just saying you weren't really doubting the data.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: No, I wasn't\u2013 You asked me what I thought about the data\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:",
      "Right.",
      "JAMIESON GREER:\u2013And was it reflected in the tariff policy? The answer is no. I mean, my view is, to the extent that there's some kind of, you know, information about manufacturing jobs, you know, I think that we're going to see a big increase in manufacturing jobs now that we have the \"one big, beautiful bill\" passed, now that we have the expensing going in. And I think that, you know, our manufacturers know that they have a clear and certain path forward on that now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you confident, though \u2013 because you have to deal in legal terms, in details, with facts and data when you are negotiating a legal agreement \u2013 do you trust that if you bring hard data to the president, he takes your counsel, even if it's an inconvenient fact?",
      "JAMIESON GREER: Always, yes. I mean, I've spent the- I spend many hours with the president almost every day, and that's what we're talking about is data. We're looking - and I'm on the trade side, of course - and we're looking at import figures, export figures, investment levels, et cetera. And that's how we're making this decision. So I'm very comfortable with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've seen that Apple estimates, for the full year, tariffs are going to cost them more than a billion dollars. For the automakers - GM, Stellantis, Ford - they all came out and said they are going to take a hit from this.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, so that's exactly the issue, right? We have, over decades, we've had these large manufacturers, advanced manufacturing, that have gone overseas. They've gone to other countries. They've taken advantage of unfair trading practices, and the fact that the US has had low tariffs while other countries haven't, and they've taken advantage of that. That's what businesses do. We're all capitalists. And so if now they have to pay a tariff or build here, the President is creating incentives to bring them back here. That's why GM has announced investments here in the United States, and that's why we have all these companies and countries announcing investment in the US. Because the tariffs create the incentive to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But reductions in profits come at a cost, right? And as CEOs are making decisions, how long do you expect this pain to last for corporate America?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, you know, again, when we look at- you know, when we look at the numbers and the data, we're seeing predictions of more investment here. That's what we want. The President isn't doing this so much for the companies. He's doing it for American workers who have seen their jobs offshored to Mexico, to Vietnam, to China. So when we hear companies having to make hard choices about supply chain changes. We have to do that. I mean the status quo, where we keep making things overseas, because we can do it a little bit cheaper in the short run. That is not preferable to having that investment and employment here in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we haven't seen that reshoring happen.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, we have- we have announced AstraZeneca announced they're going to have a $50 billion investment in pharmaceuticals. GM has announced $5 billion. Hyundai Steel has said they're going to do a $21 billion investment in Louisiana. So this is- this is actually happening. These are things from the company saying it right, and they have to say it. And they have, you know, earnings reports, and they have and- they have filings. They can't just make this stuff up. This is real investment that we're seeing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about Canada, which is our second largest- largest trading partner. The president increased tariffs to 35%. It applies, though, to just about 10% of what Canada sells here. Why bother to do this now in the middle of negotiations?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So I would say, first of all, you know, Canada is subject to 50% tariffs on steel, aluminum. 25% tariffs on autos, and again, the 35% tariff on- on goods that don't follow the rules of USMCA. And, you know, early on, the president posed a 25% tariff on Canada, and that was really about fentanyl and border issues, right? It's- it's- it's a separate regime from the reciprocal tariff. And what did Canada do in response? You know, they talked about helping at the border. And I'm not, you know, I'm not the drug czar or anything. But what I do know, as the trade guy, is that Canada retaliated. The only other country in the world who retaliated on tariffs was the Chinese. And so if the president's going to take an action and the Canadians retaliate, the United States needs to maintain the integrity of our action, the effectiveness. So we have to go up too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're talking about the things that the former Prime Minister Trudeau put in place, not the\u00a0 current Prime Minister--",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: -- And are still in place--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- That are still in place. But the current prime minister has held off, largely, on retaliation here. That's the guy you're negotiating with and his team. So what's the strategy here? And aren't you worried that this will hurt the broader free trade deal if you truly do want to renegotiate it next year.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well- well, the President's view with with every country, whether it's Canada or Mexico, and regardless of the kind of trade agreement we have in place, is that the net result of the trading system, whether it's our WTO agreements or our existing trade agreements, the net result has been that a lot of the manufacturing has gone overseas, and when that's the net result, you can't continue with that system. So you know, I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is the President is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN : So I hear you drawing distinctions when you say I'm the trade guy, I'm not the drug czar.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm the trade guy. I'm not handling these other things. But the President is kind of blending all these things together, because he cited fentanyl once again when it came to tariffs-\u00a0 to the policy with Canada. He also said on social media, Canada's decision to back statehood for Palestine is going to make it hard for us to make a trade deal. How does that have anything to do with financial and trade agreements?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So, so- so, first of all, the president United States has his foreign affairs power where he can- he can manage relations under the Constitution with foreign countries. Second of all, you know, Congress delegated to the president the ability to take economic action in response to national emergencies in the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. And for example, the Treasury Department, they have a number of sanctions where they can actually cut off a country's trade with the United States, prohibit goods, cut them off from our financial system for geopolitical reasons. So the fact that they can do that- almost certainly the President can do something that's not as expansive and just- and just put a fee on those goods, which is a- which is a tariff. So if you--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But can and should are different things, right? And- and I'm asking this--",
      "JAMIESON GREER: --But to- to go- but- but listen, if you're going to sanction somebody and essentially prohibit trade, you almost certainly can do something that's softer, which is to allow the trade and just put a tariff on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Brazil, because the U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil. That means, you know, we sell them more than we buy from them. So it doesn't seem to be consistent here, when you have the President put 50% tariffs on Brazil, one of the highest of any countries. And at the same time, the President is bringing up things that have nothing to do with trade when he's justifying them. He sent a letter to the current government complaining about the prosecution of his ally, Bolsonaro, who is- who allegedly staged a coup when he lost the last election. The President called it a witch hunt. This seems politically motivated and not about trade.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, two things. First of all, there's a 10% tariff on Brazil because we have a surplus with them. That's the reciprocal tariff. And then there's a 40% tariff that the President has chosen to do under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, like we would do any sanction where we see geopolitical issues. The President has seen in Brazil, like he's seen in other countries, a misuse of law, a misuse of democracy, what one might call lawfare. It is normal to use these tools for geopolitical issues. I mean, sanctions, we've been using them for years with all kinds of countries, including countries we like--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You view tariffs and sanctions as the same?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: They're just different in degree. I mean, tariffs are actually lighter than a sanction- a sanction, you're cutting off a country from your financial system. You're prohibiting trade with them. A tariff, you're allowing trade. You're just putting a fee on it. It's a- it's a lesser",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But now",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: step than sanctions--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You- you have moved far away from from dealing with the deficit. Now--",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: --Well the deficit has a 10% tariff--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --you are talking about politically motivated trade actions here. I mean, the president sent a letter to President Lula, saying that tariffs are due in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on free elections. He also, at the same time, sanctioned the Supreme Court justice overseeing Bolsonaro's trial. Why are you trying to influence a criminal trial of an ally of President Trump?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So, so, so the president of United States, historically, whether it's a Democrat or Republican, they have used IEEPA to impose sanctions for all kinds of geopolitical reasons in all kinds of countries. Sometimes it's countrywide, sometimes it's specific to certain, you know, individuals and often foreign leaders and foreign officials. So this is not, this is not way outside the market. If anything, the President could have gone farther in the type of sanction that was used. Instead he just used a tariff instead of cutting them off from the financial system altogether.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you were fully on board with it. It sounds like.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: With the president of the United States? My boss? Of course I am--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But with intervening in criminal trials--",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: --when the President--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- through trade policy.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: When the President sees lawfare going on, he's going to impose a sanction through IEEPA that's been delegated by Congress. That's his job as the president. He's elected to assess the Foreign Affairs situation in the United States and take appropriate action. There's just no question that it's both from a legal perspective, it's completely permissible. And from a policy perspective, that's what he's elected to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to trade, the big deal that is pending out there is how is the president going to deal with China? There's an August 12 deadline, and if that deadline is not met, you have said tariff levels could snap back to above 80%. Is that deadline going to slide?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So that's what's under discussion right now. I would say that our conversations with the Chinese have been very positive. We have discussions at the staff level, at my level, you know, President Xi and President Trump have had conversations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They said that it's sliding. The Chinese said it's sliding.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: That's something we're working toward. That's what we talked about--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not there yet.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: And so, so they want to do that. We're working on some technical issues, and we're talking to the president about it, you know, I think it's going in a positive direction. You know, I'm not going to get ahead of the President, but, you know, I don't think anyone wants to see those tariffs snap back to 84%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you get any commitments in those two days of talks in Stockholm?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So yes, we did. Yes, we talked about, and I won't go into detail, because they're, you know, confidential conversations between two, two governments, but they really focused on rare earth magnets and minerals. You've probably heard some about that, that China has put a global control on the world, and so for the United States, we're focused on making sure that the flow of magnets from from China to the United States and the- and the adjacent supply chain can flow as freely as it did before the control, and I'd say we're about halfway there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Greer, thank you for your time today.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back."

    "story": [
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended President Trump's decision to fire a key official responsible for employment reports, telling CBS News on Friday that Mr. Trump has \"real concerns\" about the accuracy of federal economic data.",
      "Greer spoke to \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" hours after the monthly jobs report showed a hiring slowdown in July and revised down earlier reports for May and June. Mr. Trump reacted by firing Commissioner of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer, claiming \u2014 without evidence \u2014 Friday's jobs numbers were \"RIGGED.\"",
      "\"You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers, and so it sounds to me like the president has real concerns,\" Greer told CBS News, adding that Mr. Trump's issues with government labor data extend beyond Friday's report.",
      "\"You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways,\" said Greer.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics' reports are based on surveys of households and businesses. It's common for the agency to revise prior months' figures up or down as more data comes in. The May and June revisions \u2014 which cut the number of new jobs by a combined 258,000 \u2014 were the largest downward change in employment figures since 1979, excluding pandemic-era jobs reports, though that doesn't mean the data was manipulated, as Mr. Trump claims.",
      "Greer defended Mr. Trump's right to fire McEntarfer, an economist who was nominated to the post by former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"The President is the President. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "The firing drew staunch criticism, with McEntarfer's predecessor William Beach \u2014 who was first nominated in Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 calling it \"groundless\" and a \"dangerous precedent.\"",
      "\"This rationale for firing Dr. McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers,\" Beach said in a statement.",
      "Friday's report showed the economy added 73,000 jobs in July, below the 115,000 predicted by economists. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, up from 4.1% a month earlier.",
      "Greer predicts \"big increase in manufacturing jobs\"",
      "The jobs report also showed a slight drop in manufacturing jobs last month. Mr. Trump's tariff hikes are intended in part to boost American manufacturing \u2014 though critics warn some U.S.-based factories that rely on foreign-made inputs will be hurt by tariffs.",
      "When asked about July's manufacturing data, Greer \u2014 one of Mr. Trump's trade negotiators \u2014 told CBS News he doesn't \"read tariff policy into that number.\"",
      "Instead, Greer argued that the numbers reflect conditions prior to the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act that passed through Congress last month. He argued businesses were \"waiting to see\" if some of the bill's tax provisions would pass, including parts that GOP lawmakers believe will encourage more business investment.",
      "\"I think that we're going to see a big increase in manufacturing jobs now that we have the 'one big, beautiful bill' passed,\" Greer said. \"And I think that \u2026 our manufacturers know that they have a clear and certain path forward on that now.\"",

    "summary": "The EPA has decided to revoke a key scientific finding it published 16 years ago that six greenhouse gases are a threat to public health.",
    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency has decided to revoke a key scientific finding it published 16 years ago that six greenhouse gases are a threat to public health and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act.",
      "Known as the \"endangerment finding,\" it is the 2009 scientific basis for which the EPA has regulated greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, as well as other sources of climate pollution, but Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on a conservative podcast Tuesday that the agency is revoking the finding, calling it, \"the largest deregulatory action in the history of America.\"",
      "Since it was signed by then-Administrator Lisa Jackson in 2009, the finding has been used by the EPA to regulate sources of climate change-causing pollution from cars, power plants and other sources of transportation like planes, as well as oil and gas operations.",
      "But Tuesday, the EPA issued a press release saying if the draft to revoke the finding is finalized, it would \"repeal all resulting greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, thereby reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family while decreasing the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver.\"",
      "During his appearance on the \"Ruthless Podcast,\" Zeldin criticized the endangerment finding, saying it put too many regulatory restrictions on transportation and stationary sources of greenhouse gas pollution.",
      "\"There are people, who in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,\" he said.",
      "Zeldin also said regulating climate pollution costs Americans too much money. If the proposed finding is finalized, it \"is expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards,\" according to the EPA press release.",
      "But the EPA's own regulatory impact report says limiting emissions for cars and trucks is expected to generate more than $2.1 trillion in net benefits over the next 30 years, including $820 billion in fuel savings and $1.8 trillion in public health and climate benefits.",
      "Repealing the finding comes at a time when climate change impacts appear to be reaching new heights as 2024 was the hottest year on record, and natural disasters are growing more intense, destructive and deadly. Since 2010, there have been 246 billion-dollar disasters striking every U.S. state, causing more than $1.7 trillion in damages, and killing more than 7,700 people, according to archived data from NOAA.",
      "\"For the EPA to repeal the 2009 finding borders on criminal negligence,\" said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, in a statement. \"The science was clear in 2009 and has become much stronger and clearer since: climate disruption is a large and growing problem; it is caused primarily from our use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide and methane; and it is a deadly problem.\"",
      "Legality of the endangerment finding",
      "In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollution that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, but it tasked the EPA with making a scientific finding about whether the gases harm public health.",
      "Two years later, the EPA published the endangerment finding, relying on extensive scientific evidence and public input to definitively state that greenhouse gases, which cause climate change, threaten health and the welfare of current and future generations.",
      "\"I think it's the most impactful thing I worked on in my career,\" said a former EPA employee who was a key author on the 2009 endangerment finding and requested anonymity because of current contractual obligations with the federal government.",
      "\"This body of scientific evidence met the endangerment test of the Clean Air Act,\" they told CBS News. \"It has stood the test of time and the science has only gotten stronger.\"",
      "The EPA's new proposal aims to question the agency's ability to set standards for car emissions, according to the press release. The full draft of the rule is not yet accessible on the EPA website or federal register to review.",
      "The release also said the EPA will \"update scientific data and challenge the assumptions\" of the 2009 finding with\u00a0a study\u00a0from the Department of Energy's 2025 Climate Work Group, which was not peer-reviewed, but says greenhouse gases \"appear to be less damaging economically than commonly believed.\"",
      "Plenty of conservative groups and attorneys general have tested the legality of the finding and were pleased with Tuesday's announcement.",
      "\"Over the last four years, conservative state attorneys general were the last line of defense in fighting back against the Biden administration's federal overreach and green new scam agenda,\" said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in a statement.",
      "The finding has previously been challenged in court, most recently in 2023, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit upheld the finding and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.",
      "The EPA highlighted subsequent Supreme Court rulings since the finding was signed in 2009 and said, in its press release, those cases \"have significantly clarified the scope of EPA's authority under the CAA,\" indicating the agency may be open to testing whether today's court has an appetite to revisit and overturn the 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act by the EPA.",
      "\"The administration's move to jettison these standards flies in the face of the Supreme Court's landmark decision directing the EPA to follow the science,\" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. \"If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court.\"",
      "Impacts of the endangerment finding",
      "Since it was signed in 2009, the most crucial impacts of regulating greenhouse gasses have been to the U.S. transportation sector, which if it were its own country, would be the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, according to the European Commission and data from the EPA.",
      "New passenger vehicles today emit 24% less climate pollution than they did in 2011, the year before the first tailpipe regulations went into effect, according to the EPA's own estimates. The EPA tightened the tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks in 2024, which was expected to cut 7.2 billion tons of climate pollution by 2055 and save $13 billion in annual health benefits.",
      "But according to the EPA's press release, if the proposed draft is finalized it will, \"undo the underpinning of $1 trillion in costly regulations (and) save more than $54 billion annually,\" although no regulatory analysis has been provided to confirm those numbers.",
      "In addition to removing regulations on cars, the EPA has already jettisoned similar rules to limit emissions for power plants, has encouraged the development of fossil fuel-based energy and has promised to rollback dozens of additional environmental regulations that hamper the development of American energy and manufacturing.",
      "\"Trump's EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution. Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs,\" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

      "The flash \u2014 dubbed a \"megaflash,\" or a single continuous long horizontal flash that can initiate up to hundreds of cloud-to-ground strikes \u2014 happened on Oct. 22, 2017, according to a research report published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. While the storm that day had previously been analyzed by scientists, new satellite technology recently documented the megaflash exceeding 500 miles.",
      "The previous world record recognized by the World Meteorological Organization was a megaflash on April 29, 2020, extending 477 miles across the southern United States and the Gulf of Mexico, the researchers said.",
      "While the 2017 megaflash may be the longest in horizontal distance, it did not have the longest duration. Researchers estimated that it lasted just over 7 seconds. The current WMO-recognized record for longest duration megaflash occurred over Argentina and Uruguay in June 2020 and was about 17 seconds.",
      "Researchers hope the technology that identified the 2017 megaflash will continue to help them evaluate more storms.",

      "Meet the potato's unexpected ancestor: the tomato.",
      "That's right, a fruit. Potatoes and tomatoes don't look alike, smell alike or taste alike, but in a study published Thursday in the journal Cell, scientists said that the potato evolved from a tomato ancestor around 9 million years ago.",
      "\"We've finally solved the mystery of where potatoes came from,\" corresponding author Sanwen Huang of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences said in a news release.",
      "The origin of the modern potato has puzzled scientists for years. In terms of appearance, potatoes resemble a species from Chile called Etuberosum, with one crucial difference: Etuberosum don't produce the starch-rich tubers. That's where the tomato comes in.",
      "While tomatoes don't have tubers, the ancient tomato did provide a crucial gene that, when mixed with the genetics of Etuberosum, told the modern potato to form tubers, according to the researchers. The SP6A gene from the tomato parent tells the potato plant to make tubers, while the IT1 gene from Etuberosum assists in controlling the growth of the underground stems that form tubers. Both pieces were needed to create the potato that's known and loved today.",
      "\"Our findings show how a hybridization event between species can spark the evolution of new traits, allowing even more species to emerge,\" Huang said.",
      "The research team analyzed 450 genomes from cultivated potatoes and 56 of the wild potato species during the study.",

      "The earthquake was \"on what we call the Pacific Ring of Fire. This is a region around the entire Pacific Rim renowned for significant earthquakes,\" Simon Boxall, lecturer in oceanography at the University of Southampton, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Earth is made up of these sort of geology plates, these geophysical plates, and the Earth where these plates rub, where they sort of join, we get stresses building up, and then every so often we get a sudden release of pressure and part of the seabed flips up,\" Boxall said. \"And so it's that flip that causes the tsunami. And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"",
      "Boxal said the tsunami generated by this earthquake was \"not huge. It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground.\"",
      "Two magnitude 9.1 earthquakes - the Tohoku earthquake in 2011 in Japan and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake in Indonesia - caused massive tsunamis that killed thousands of people.",

      "While a magnitude 9.1 quake \"might seem not so far off from the magnitude 8.8 \u2026 in terms of energy, it's three times stronger,\" Sethanant said.",
      "\"Imagine the 8.8 is, as I drop a rock in the lake, and you see the ripples. That's the energy,\" Sethanant said. \"Imagine you have that rock like three times bigger. So, in terms of the earthquake movement magnitude, the energy of the 2011 and 2004 earthquakes in Sumatra and in Japan, it's actually three to four times bigger. ...

      "The leak was discovered in 2019. The Russians believe its related to metal fatigue. NASA managers think it's more complicated than that. In any case, cosmonauts aboard the station have made multiple attempts to plug the leaks, but they have persisted.",
      "Earlier this summer, NASA held up the launch of the Axiom 4 flight to the space station due to indications a hatch used to seal off the leaking compartment was also leaking. They now have confirmed the hatch can, in fact, be sealed when needed to protect the integrity of the station's primary air supply.",
      "\"The rest of the station is leak tight,\" said Bill Spetch, NASA's ISS integration operations manager. \"We continuously monitor that, and everything else shows that we are really tight on our leak rate on the rest of ISS, no evidence of any other cracks or any other places.\"",

      "Liftoff from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, originally set for 12:09 p.m. EDT Thursday, was scrubbed 67 seconds before liftoff due to cloud buildups over the launch complex. The launch was timed for roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the Falcon 9 rocket into alignment with the space station's orbit \u2014 a requirement for rendezvous missions.",
      "\"Hold, hold hold, we are standing down for a violation of weather rules,\" a SpaceX controller said on the countdown net. A few moments later, \u00a0a controller told the crew, \"bad luck on weather there. We just got clipped by a cumulus cloud right over the pad. So we ended up scrubbing for weather\"",
      "Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman replied: \"Too bad. But we'll be ready next time.\"",
      "The next launch opportunity is at 11:43 a.m. Friday, weather permitting, setting up a docking at the International Space Station at 3 a.m. Saturday. But forecasters said conditions were expected to worsen slightly, with concern focused on possibly high winds and waves in the Atlantic Ocean along the ascent trajectory where the crew might have to splash down in a launch abort.",
      "Cardman originally expected to fly to the space station last fall, but she and Crew 9 crewmate Stephanie Wilson were bumped from the flight to free up two seats to bring Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams back to Earth after an extended stay in space.",
      "Wilmore and Williams flew to the orbital lab complex last June in the first piloted flight of a Starliner. But their stay in space was extended because of Starliner propulsion system problems. NASA managers eventually opted to bring them down earlier this year aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, using the seats given up by Cardman and Wilson.",
      "\"If I think about it only as an individual, and how it affected me, yes, of course, it was an unexpected change,\" Cardman said. \"But space flight is not about me or about any individual. It's about what we can do together. None of us can do this by ourselves.",
      "\"Now I have the opportunity to train with this wonderful, amazing crew. Life is a journey. It takes many turns, and I'm just grateful to be here.\"",
      "Cardman's co-pilot for the Crew 11 mission is NASA's Michael Fincke, a 58-year-old three-flight veteran who trained to fly aboard Boeing's Starliner as did Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. In the wake of the problems encountered last year during the Starliner test flight, and the expected long delay before it's launched again, both ended up assigned to Crew 11.",
      "The fourth crew member is Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, a space rookie. Like his crewmates, he also expected to fly aboard another spacecraft, in his case, a Russian Soyuz.",
      "But he ended up assigned to Crew 11 as part of a joint U.S.-Russian seat-swap program intended to ensure at least one representative of each country is always on board the ISS even if one crew ferry ship has to depart in an emergency, taking all of its crew members with it. Platonov is the seventh cosmonaut to fly aboard a Crew Dragon under theagreement.",
      "Fincke said the crew is more than ready for launch.",
      "\"Space has been calling my name ever since I returned from my last mission in 2011,\" he posted on the social media platform X. \"Our crew is ready. Let's do this! Go Falcon, Go Dragon, Go Crew-11!\"",
      "Their ride to the station \u2014 the Crew Dragon Endeavour \u2014 is making its sixth flight, a new record for NASA and SpaceX.",
      "Steven Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program, said SpaceX is working to certify Crew Dragons for up to 15 flights. The SpaceX ferry ships currently are certified for five flights, but Stich said a detailed analysis of Endeavour's flight history, performance and test results allowed NASA to clear the ship for a sixth flight.",
      "\"Our focus here is to really get to this particular launch, to make sure that we have everything cleared for six flights, and then down the road, we may have a little bit more work to do depending on the specific vehicle and how many flights it is.",
      "\"The overall goal was 15 flights, and we've gotten there on many components. Now we're just down to a handful that really are there (confirmed good) for only six flights.\"",
      "Catching up with the space station",
      "It will take the Crew Dragon 16 hours to catch up with the station early Saturday. After passing about 1,200 feet directly below the outpost, Endeavour will loop up, cross in front of the lab and then on up to a point directly above the forward Harmony module's space-facing port. From there, it will move straight down for docking.",
      "The crew will be welcomed aboard by Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese station commander Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, who were launched to the station on March 14. Also on hand will be Soyuz MS-27/73S cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky along with NASA's Jonny Kim, launched from Kazakhstan on April 8.",
      "Also on board: clothing and personal items for Cardman that were launched last year before her expected Crew 9 flight. Included in those personal items were birthday cards, including one from her father, a physicist, who passed away last August just before NASA bumped Cardman from Crew 9.",
      "She will celebrate her next birthday, turning 38, in October.",
      "\"My parents knew that I would be on the space station for my birthday last year, we thought, so they sent a few items in advance so that I could feel at home while I was up there. And now I'll have the chance to see them,\" Cardman told CBS News.",
      "\"My whole history, the people who have brought me to where I am today, I think it's going to feel really special to feel that connection to my dad, to my parents on my birthday in space.\"",
      "Cardman and her crewmates are replacing the Crew 10 fliers, who plan to undock around Aug. 6, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast to close out a 145-day mission. Highlights included a spacewalk by McClain and Ayers and a non-stop schedule of research and station maintenance.",
      "\"I'm kind of looking forward to doing nothing for a couple of days,\" McClain joked when asked what she looked forward to the most about returning to Earth. Onishi said he was looking forward to seeing his family again, \"and also taking a hot shower on the ground!\"",
      "Added Ayers, who said she'll miss the opportunity to photograph Earth from the vantage point of space: \"In addition to what Anne and Tak said, I'm actually looking forward to a big, juicy burger on the beach.\"",
      "Planning for months in orbit",
      "It's not yet known how long Crew 11 will be on board the space station.",
      "Up to this point, long-duration crews, U.S. and Russian, have typically spent around six months in orbit. But starting with the Soyuz MS-27/73S mission, the Russians have switched to eight-month stays. NASA may follow suit starting with the Crew 12 mission next year.",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal 2026 would reduce NASA funding by nearly 25 percent while directing the agency to scale back work aboard the ISS in favor of more aggressive planning for eventual crewed missions to Mars.",
      "NASA managers are now considering lengthening crew stays and possibly reducing Dragon crews from four to three and perhaps just two, one American and one Russian. A reduced crew would need fewer resupply missions, saving additional money. But it would sharply reduce the amount of research that could be carried out.",
      "No final decisions have been made.",
      "\"When we launch ... we have a six-month mission duration that we baseline,\" said Stich. \"We can extend the mission in real time as needed as we better understand the reconciliation bill and the appropriations process and what that means relative to the overall station manifest.\"",
      "For her part, Cardman said she would welcome an additional two months in orbit.",
      "\"I can't wait to be in space, and two extra months would be a gift,\" she said. \"Yes, we're baselined for six months right now, with the ability to extend that pending further analysis. For me, it would be an absolute privilege to stay for even longer.\"",

The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers. Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to recent college graduates have declined 15%\u00a0over the past year, according to Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z employees. Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",
      "While AI is already starting to reshape how Americans work, for now other factors are having a more immediate impact on the labor market.

He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

      "The move reflects Recruit Holdings' focus on using AI to transform how job-seekers look for work and how employers handle recruitment. As part of that effort, the company will fold Glassdoor operations into Indeed, the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong is stepping down.",
      "\"[W]hen we think about HR industry, which is $300 billion-plus industry, but it includes like 60% or 65% of human labor manual cost. It's very difficult to find that big industry with such a high percentage of human labor manual cost,\" Idekoba said in May at a JPMorgan Chase technology conference. \"And so what we believe is, basically, how can we simplify hiring with using AI and technology and data to reduce manual work. That's what we are focusing on.\"",
      "He added that about one-third of the company's new programming code is written by AI, and that he expects that figure to jump to one-half. \"It's going to be 50% pretty soon,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Texas Republicans returned to the state Capitol this Monday for the House session \u2014 likely without Democratic lawmakers who have left the state in a bid to block a vote on a heavily GOP-favored congressional map.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott said he'll begin to remove Democratic lawmakers from office if they don't return after dozens of them fled the state in a last-resort attempt to block the redrawing of U.S. House maps that President Trump wants before the 2026 midterm elections, although the legal justification for that is shaky.",
      "State House Democrats went to Illinois or New York on Sunday, and Abbott gave them a 24-hour ultimatum to come home ratcheted up a widening fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but has drawn in Democratic governors who have floated the possibility of rushing to redraw their own state's maps in retaliation. Their options, however, are limited.",
      "At the center of the escalating impasse is Mr. Trump's pursuit of adding five more GOP-leaning congressional seats in Texas before next year that would bolster his party's chances of preserving its slim U.S. House majority.",
      "The new congressional maps drawn by Texas Republicans would create five new Republican-leaning seats. Republicans currently hold 25 of the state's 38 seats.",
      "A vote on the proposed maps had been set for Monday in the Texas House of Representatives, but it cannot proceed if the majority of Democratic members deny a quorum by not showing up. After one group of Democrats landed in Chicago on Sunday, they were welcomed by Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, but declined to say how long they were prepared to stay out of Texas.",
      "\"We will do whatever it takes. What that looks like, we don't know,\" said state Rep. Gene Wu, the Texas House Democratic Caucus leader.",
      "But legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, including in 2021 when many of the same Texas House Democrats left the state for 38 days in protest of new voting restrictions. Once they returned, Republicans still wound up passing that measure.",
      "Four years later, Abbott is taking a far more aggressive stance and swiftly warning Democrats that he will seek to remove them from office if they are not back when the House reconvenes Monday afternoon. He cited a non-binding 2021 legal opinion issued by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, which suggested a court could determine that a legislator had forfeited their office.",
      "He also suggested the lawmakers may have committed felonies by raising money to help pay for fines they'd face.",
      "\"This truancy ends now,\" Abbott said.",

      "The state of the vote",
      "Lawmakers can't pass bills in the 150-member Texas House without at least two-thirds of them present. Democrats hold 62 of the seats in the majority-Republican chamber and at least 51 left the state, said Josh Rush Nisenson, spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus.",
      "Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows said the chamber would still meet as planned on Monday afternoon.",
      "\"If a quorum is not present then, to borrow the recent talking points from some of my Democrat colleagues, all options will be on the table. . .,\" he posted on X.",
      "Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, said on X that Democrats who \"try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately.\"",
      "Fines for not showing up",
      "A refusal by Texas lawmakers to show up is a civil violation of legislative rules. The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders had the authority to \"physically compel the attendance\" of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served that year. Two years later, Republicans pushed through new rules that allow daily fines of $500 for lawmakers who don't show up for work as punishment.",
      "The quorum break will also delay votes on flood relief and new warning systems in the wake of last month's catastrophic floods in Texas that killed at least 136 people. Democrats had called for votes on the flooding response before taking up redistricting and have criticized Republicans for not doing so.",

    "story": [
      "Americans could see inflation tick higher in 2025 as businesses start to pass on the cost of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers through price hikes, Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady in an interview.",
      "So far this year, inflation has remained relatively muted despite President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs, partially because many businesses stockpiled goods and manufacturing parts ahead of the import duties' implementation. Some business facing higher tariffs also chose to hold off on passing cost increases onto consumers as they awaited more clarity around where tariff rates would settle. Additionally, the Trump administration instituted numerous pauses on threatened levies, delaying cost increases for businesses and consumers.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pushing the Fed to cut interest rates, citing subdued inflation numbers and cuts from other major central banks, such as in the U.K. and the European Union. But the Federal Reserve last week maintained its benchmark rate at the same level where it's been parked since December 2024, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell citing the risks of higher inflation due to the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "That's a danger also highlighted by Hammack, who said she believes inflation could reach a 3% annual rate this year, representing a pace that would be 1 percentage point higher than the Fed's goal of a 2% annualized rate.",
      "\"Individual businesses have been trying to hold back on, passing on those [tariff] costs, because they're worried about what it might mean for demand,\" Hammack told O'Grady. \"They've been selling inventory that they'd accumulated early in the year, and so they didn't need to charge for the tariffs on that, but they're coming through those stockpiles.\"",
      "She added, \"They're coming to the point where their margins are getting squeezed and they need to start passing that onto consumers.\"",
      "Many households are still struggling with the cost of living, with half of Americans saying they view grocery prices as a major source of stress in their life right now, outpacing housing cost and health care, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\"Two-speed economy\"",
      "Hammack said the U.S. appears to be in a \"two-speed economy.\"",
      "\"The top part of the income spectrum is doing incredibly well,\" she noted. \"They're feeling a lot of excitement about the stock market, how their 401(k)s are doing, and they're feeling flush with cash.\"",
      "But, she added, low-income households are facing a lot of economic challenges.",
      "\"I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef,\" Hammack said. \"They're buying hot dogs, they're looking at their $400 emergency fund, and it's not able to pay for a new air conditioner or the car repairs that it used to be able to pay for.\"",
      "Price pressures from the Trump administration's tariffs could cause a one-time increase in costs as businesses adjust their prices to cover the import duties, she added. Fed officials are focused on making sure that the price hikes don't become what she calls a \"more persistent inflationary problem.\"",
      "At the same time, Friday's disappointing jobs report shows that the labor market is also facing fresh challenges, with employers hiring fewer workers than expected in July. The Fed's mandate is to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with the central bank turning to interest rate hikes to cool inflation or rate cuts to help the job market.",
      "With both inflation on the rise and the job market experiencing some headwinds, the Fed has a delicate balancing act, she noted.",
      "\"This is a really challenging time for monetary policy makers, because both sides of our mandate are being challenged,\" Hammack said. \"And so the decision of which way to go and how quickly to move is a really difficult one right now.",

      "The pilot program will focus on countries that have high visa overstay rates among those allowed into the U.S. for business or pleasure \u2014 through B-1 or B-2 visas, according to the notice. A B-1 visa is for those temporarily traveling to the U.S. for business activities. A B-2 visa is for foreign nationals who want to come to the U.S. temporarily for tourism or pleasure.",
      "Travelers entering the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program will not have to post a bond, according to the State Department's notice. That program allows residents of more than 40 countries to enter the U.S. for fewer than 90 days without a visa.",
      "While the countries subject to the program will be announced in the future, the list may also be modified on a rolling basis, the State Department said. The countries with the highest overstay rates for people with business and tourism visas in fiscal year 2023 were Chad, Laos, Haiti and Congo, according to the Department of Homeland Security's report.",
      "Only foreign nationals who are applying for B-1 or B-2 nonimmigrant visas, and who are from the countries identified by the State Department, may be required to post a bond of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 as a condition of receiving a visa. The bond can be canceled if the person meets certain criteria, including leaving the U.S. by the date their authorization expires, according to the terms of the program detailed in the notice.",
      "The new requirement for certain foreign nationals seeking to come to the U.S. for business or tourism could have negative consequences for cities that rely on travelers from abroad. A June report from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority found that Sin City experienced an 11% drop in visitation year-over-year, hosting nearly 3.5 million visitors in June 2024 and nearly 3.1 million this June.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Travel Association said the pilot program appears to effect roughly 2,000 applicants, most likely from a few countries with low travel volume to the U.S. But the group is more concerned with the $250 \"Visa Integrity Fee\" included in the tax-and-spending plan, the spokesperson said.",
      "\"If this fee is implemented, the U.S. will have one of, if not the highest, visitor visa fees in the world,\" the spokesperson said. \"If we are to maintain a competitive position in the global travel market, it's critical that U.S. visa policy reflects both national security priorities and the significant economic value of international visitation.\"",
      "David Bier, the Cato Institute's director of immigration studies, called the bond requirement \"draconian.\"",
      "\"Although we can't know for certain the scale of this rule because the administration isn't saying which countries it will apply to, the rule will add what is likely an insurmountable barrier to travel for many applicants who end up being targeted who are often family members of U.S. citizens,\" he said in a statement. \"Its argument that this will pressure governments to somehow force their visa holders to comply with the terms of their visas is incoherent, and it appears to be an admission that it will likely just ban people from coming, not just result in compliance. Most visa overstays leave after some time or end up qualifying for legal status in the United States another way. There is no reason to impose such a draconian rule.\"",

    "story": [
      "The manhunt for a military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at a bar in Montana stretched into a fourth day Monday.",
      "Police are looking for Michael Paul Brown, 45, who is wanted for allegedly shooting the four people inside The Owl Bar in the small town of Anaconda before fleeing in a white pickup, which he ditched at some point. Law enforcement now believes Brown abandoned that vehicle and stole a different one that had camping gear, shoes and clothes in it.",
      "Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen told reporters on Sunday that Brown was believed to still be armed and dangerous. A\u00a0reward of up to $10,000 has been offered for any information that leads to his arrest.",
      "\"This is an unstable individual who walked in and murdered four people in cold blood for no reason whatsoever. So there absolutely is concern for the public,\" Knudsen said.",
      "Authorities released a photo of the suspect said to be taken as he fled after the shooting: Gaunt, barefoot and wearing nothing but black shorts, he is seen walking down what appears to be a flight of outdoor concrete steps. But because the vehicle authorities believe Brown may have stolen had shoes and clothes in it, it's possible he's now clothed, authorities said.",
      "Investigators are considering all possible options for Brown's whereabouts, the attorney general said. That includes scouring the woods where Brown hunted and camped while he was a kid. But Knudsen noted that during peak tourist season in western Montana, some law enforcement officials would have to return to their local jurisdictions for their regular responsibilities.",
      "The search involves deputies traversing the rugged mountainous area west of Anaconda, both on the ground and by air. It included multiple local, state and federal agencies. As law enforcement scours the wild terrain, the woods southwest of Anaconda have been closed to the public by the National Forest System.",
      "Anaconda-Deer Lodge Police Chief Bill Sather said Saturday that businesses in the area could open, but he urged caution.",
      "The victims were identified as Daniel Edwin Baillie, 59; Nancy Lauretta Kelly, 64; David Allen Leach, 70, and 74-year-old Tony Wayne Palm. They were all from Anaconda.",
      "Knudsen said the investigation has led them to believe Brown, who lived next door, was a regular at the bar and knew the victims.",
      "\"This is a small, tight-knit community that has been harmed by the heinous actions of one individual who does not represent what this community or Montanans stand for,\" said Lee Johnson, administrator of the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation.",
      "Kristian Kelley, the daughter of Nancy Kelley, told CBS News her mother \"was a wonderful nurse, and she had a gift for taking care of people at the hospital. She was always very kind and good-hearted to her patients. She loved animals.\"",
      "\"She just retired and just kind of did [bartending] to have something to do on a day or two. Just to be out and about,\" she said.",
      "Anaconda, about 25 miles northwest of Butte, is home to roughly 9,000 people. Hemmed in by mountains, it was founded by copper barons who profited from nearby mines in the late 1800s. A smelter stack that is no longer operational looms over the valley.",
      "The Owl Bar's owner, David Gwerder, told The Associated Press he was not aware of any conflict between Brown and the victims.",
      "\"He knew everybody that was in that bar. I guarantee you that,\" Gwerder said. \"He didn't have any running dispute with any of them. I just think he snapped.\"",
      "Brown's niece, Clare Boyle, told AP her uncle has struggled with mental illness for years. She said she and other family members repeatedly sought help.",
      "\"This isn't just a drunk/high man going wild,\" she said in a Facebook message. \"It's a sick man who doesn't know who he is sometimes and frequently doesn't know where or when he is either.\"",
      "Kristian Kelley told CBS News she knows who Brown is, but her mother \"had never mentioned him.\"",
      "\"He was somebody that needed some serious resources. He had some mental health issues as well as PTSD from being in the military,\" Kelley said. \"I've never known him to be violent. He was a person who would tell pretty strange stories and different things like that.\"",
      "Robert Wyatt, 70, said he was neighbors with one of the victims, David Allen Leach, at a public housing complex for elderly people and people with disabilities.",
      "\"Everybody is nervous\" since Friday, Wyatt said.",
      "Leach was deaf and kept mostly to himself, Wyatt said, and he only recalls Leach having a family visit once almost a year ago. But Leach was always happy to help his neighbors with chores like moving furniture.",
      "\"If you needed help, Dave would help,\" Wyatt said. \"He was a good neighbor.\"",
      "David Jabarek, 70, said that a mass shooting in a place as small as Anaconda is baffling to many. He said that he regularly saw both the shooter and the victims over the course of the 20 years that he has lived in Anaconda.",
      "\"We only have 9,000 people, so it's like, what the hell just happened? Everybody knows everybody here,\" he said.",
      "Jabarek was headed to Owl Bar less than 30 minutes before the shooting happened, at around 10:15 a.m. On an impulse, he went to run an errand nearby instead. When he came back to the area, he saw the bar was surrounded by police.",
      "\"If I'd have been in there when I was supposed to be, you wouldn't be talking to me. Somebody be talking to you about me,\" he said.",
      "The close call is now keeping Jabarek up at night. But he said that he isn't afraid of the prospect of Brown returning.",
      "\"Everybody around here has two dozen firearms in their house, and right now they're within hands reach,\" Jabarek said.",
      "Brown served in the Army as an armor crewman from 2001 to 2005 and deployed to Iraq from early 2004 until March 2005, according to Lt. Col. Ruth Castro, an Army spokesperson. Brown was in the Montana National Guard from 2006 to March 2009, Castro said, and left military service at the rank of sergeant.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

      "Democratic state legislators fled Texas on Sunday in an attempt to deny a quorum to Republicans hoping to vote on a new congressional map that heavily favors the GOP even more than current districts.",
      "\"For two weeks, while families in the Hill Country mourned the loss of over 130 Texans in catastrophic floods, Democrats fought to make their relief the legislature's top priority. Instead, Governor Abbott and Republican leadership used the tragedy as political cover,\" Texas House Democrats said in a statement Sunday.",
      "\"... Governor Abbott has turned the victims of a tragedy into political hostages in his submission to Donald Trump. We will not allow disaster relief to be held hostage to a Trump gerrymander. As of today, this corrupt special session is over,\" the statement said.",
      "Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said in a statement, \"For too long, Donald Trump and Republicans have tried to get away with rigging the system, breaking the rules, and scheming to hold onto power. It's time to fight back.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday night said the lawmakers had until 3 p.m. Monday, when the Texas House is set to reconvene, to return.",
      "\"For any member who fails to do so, I will invoke Texas Attorney General Opinion No. KP-0382 to remove the missing Democrats from membership in the Texas House,\" Abbott said in a statement.",
      "\"The absconded Democrat House members were elected to meet and vote on legislation\u2014not to prevent votes that may not go their way,\" Abbott wrote. \"Every session, legislators\u00a0on both sides of the aisle\u00a0find themselves on the losing side of a legislative vote. And every session, most of those legislators find a way to disagree agreeably and behave like adults, rather than going AWOL.\"",
      "In response, Texas House Democrats issued a four-word statement: \"Come and take it,\" a reference to a statement of defiance on an old Texas battle flag.",
      "Abbott was citing a non-binding 2021 legal opinion from Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton that suggested a court could determine that a legislator had forfeited his or her office.",
      "Republicans unveiled the new maps\u00a0last week as part of a mid-decade redistricting in an attempt to protect the GOP's razor-thin U.S. House majority. President Trump said in July that he believes Republicans could win five more seats in Texas with different districts.",
      "Abbott included redistricting to be addressed in a special legislative session, along with other high-profile topics like approving disaster relief for the deadly Texas floods and a THC ban.",
      "\"For weeks, we've been warning that if Republicans in Texas want a showdown \u2014 if they want to delay flood relief to cravenly protect Donald Trump from an inevitable midterm meltdown \u2014 then we'd give them that showdown,\" Martin said.",
      "Both houses of the Texas legislature are controlled by Republicans, but if most Democratic lawmakers leave the state, they could deny the state House and Senate the two-thirds quorum that they need to vote on the new congressional maps.",
      "At least 51 Texas Democrats have fled the state for Chicago. Politico was first to report the lawmakers had left the state.",
      "\"We're not here to have fun. We're not here because this is easy, and we did make a decision to come here today \u2014 we did not make a decision lightly,\" Texas House Minority Leader Gene Wu said after arriving in Illinois. \"But we come here today with absolute moral clarity that this is absolutely the right thing to do to protect the people of the state of Texas.\"",
      "Republicans in Texas currently hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats. The party hopes the new maps could bring that number up to 30, and all of those new 30 seats were won by Mr. Trump in November by at least 10 points.",
      "The five seats come from redrawing Rio Grande Valley districts \u2014 where Mr. Trump has made gains in what were once Democratic strongholds \u2014 and combining Reps. Lloyd Doggett and Greg Cesar's districts in Austin. In North Texas, Rep. Julie Johnson's suburban 32nd District would be reshaped to stretch from the Dallas area to rural Republican strongholds, and Rep. Marc Veasey would be moved out of Tarrant County entirely, which would leave only a small portion of the county represented by a Democrat. All four Houston-area seats were redrawn, with Rep. Al Green's being the most dramatic.",
      "\"They're turning our districts into crazy shapes to guarantee the outcome they want in the 2026 election,\" Democratic state Rep. James Talarico said in a message\u00a0posted to social media. \"If this power grab succeeds, they will hang on to power without any accountability from the voters.\"",
      "Wu said Texas Republicans are \"using is a racist, gerrymandered map, a map that seeks to use racial lines to divide hard working communities who have spent decades building up their power and strengthening their voices, and Governor Abbott is doing this in submission to Donald Trump.\"",
      "Democrats have fought back against the new districts, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries traveling to Austin on Thursday to pledge national support.",
      "\"We are not fighting for the Democratic Party, we are fighting for the democratic process, and the stakes could not be higher. We have to take a stand,\" Talarico added.",
      "Martin said in an appearance Sunday on MSNBC, \"I'm proud of the Texas Dems for actually breaking quorum here. Our democracy is literally under assault by Donald Trump, Greg Abbott and the Republicans, who know that they are on a track to lose the House majority next year. So what do they do? They cheat. They rigged the system. That's all they have left.\"",
      "\"We're certainly going to be standing with folks who will be litigating this in the courts,\" Martin added. \"We will continue to organize on the ground in Texas, and we will continue to support the House Dems, as they have broke quorum right now.\"",
      "This is not the first time Democrats have left the state to deny Republicans a quorum \u2014 and not the first time they have done it to protest redistricting. During the landmark 2005 mid-decade redistricting, Texas Democrats fled during two separate special sessions to stop the redistricting. But the redistricting eventually did go through. And in 2023, Republicans passed legislation that levies a $500-a-day fine on lawmakers who leave the state.",
      "The last significant quorum break in the Texas House was in 2021, when Democrats fled the state to prevent a restrictive voting bill from passing.",
      "Last month, Paxton threatened to assist police in \"hunting down and compelling the attendance\" of any Democratic lawmakers who leave the state to block votes during the special session.",
      "\"If Democrats ignore their duty to their constituents by breaking quorum, they should be found and arrested no matter where they go,\" said Paxton, who is also running for the GOP nomination in next year's Senate race.",
      "Abbott on Sunday said that \"Any Democrat who 'solicits, accepts, or agrees to accept'\" donations to help cover any fines they may be subjected to under Hous rules for skipping votes, \"may have violated bribery laws.\"",
      "Can other states take on redistricting efforts?",
      "As the efforts ramped up in Texas to redraw the maps, other Democrat-led states threatened to do something similar. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been one of the most prominent voices behind this effort, posting on social media after the GOP's new maps for Texas were unveiled that \"California won't sit back and watch this happen.\"",
      "Other governors have joined suit, with some of the Texas House Democrats joining New York Gov. Kathy Hochul for a press conference on Monday about the topic. Hochul said, \"I'm tired of fighting this fight with one hand tied behind my back.\"",
      "Pritzker also said Sunday \"everything has to be on the table.\"",
      "But legally, it will be difficult to pull off in many of these states. Texas is one of a few states that allows the state legislature to set up the congressional maps, and can allow mid-decade redistricting. In California, an independent commissions is in charge of redistricting \u2014 and there is a law in New York banning gerrymandering for political gains. New York's congressional maps went through a number of legal challenges before the final maps were settled on.",
      "Hochul and New York Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie acknowledged it would require a change to the state constitution, but Heastie insisted that \"we're in close conversations about options there, and so I would say we're presenting all options right now.\"",
      "\"It's very difficult to say play fair when your opponents are playing dirty and using every tool in their tool shed toolbox to kind of undermine democracy,\" Heastie said.",
      "As for Illinois, the state legislature draws the map and Democrats control the legislature \u2014 and they cut out two Republican seats when they redrew the maps in 2021. Prior to redistricting, Illinois had 13 Democrats and five Republicans in the House. The state lost a seat due to population loss, and they ended the 2022 elections with 14 Democrats and three Republicans.",

      "\"We believe this grant will now keep Musk as CEO of Tesla at least until 2030 and removes an overhang on the stock,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note. The grant will motivate Musk to lead the company through an \"inflection point,\" as Tesla transitions to an AI-first company, he added.",
      "Equal to 2018 pay package",
      "The electric vehicle maker said in a regulatory filing on Monday that Musk must first pay Tesla $23.34 per share of restricted stock that vests, which is equal to the exercise price per share of the 2018 pay package that was awarded to the company's CEO.",

      "In a December ruling 2024 ruling, Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick reaffirmed an earlier ruling that Tesla must revoke Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package.

    "story": [
      "Noah Lyles landed the day's biggest blow on the track, passing Kenny Bednarek for the win, then looking his way to talk some trash.",
      "Bednarek's answer was a two-handed shove in the back after the finish line, some more heated words and a challenge for a rematch that can't come soon enough. Video captured the tense moments after the race.",
      "U.S. track championships turned physical Sunday, with Lyles and Bednarek getting involved in a shoving and shouting match as they crossed the finish line of a hotly contested 200-meter final at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon.",
      "\"Like I've said before, Noah's gonna be Noah,\" Bednarek said. \"If he wants to stare me down, that's fine.\"",
      "Lyles reeled in Bednarek and crossed in 19.63 seconds for a .04-second victory that sets up a rematch at world championships, on Sept. 19 in Tokyo.",
      "The best action in Round 1 came after the finish line. There was jawing, the shove and, then, Lyles turning around, backpedaling, reaching his arms out and bouncing up and down like a boxer before lobbing a few more choice words at Bednarek.",
      "Their argument bled into the start of what is normally a celebratory NBC winner's interview.",
      "\"I tell ya, if you've got a problem, I expect a call,\" Bednarek said, as the network's Lewis Johnson moved the mic between the runners.",
      "Lyles replied: \"You know what, you're right. You're right. Let's talk after this.\"",
      "Though they shook hands during that tense post-race, Bednarek was fired up well after the sprinters had left the track.",
      "\"The grand summary is, don't do that to me,\" he said. \"I don't do any of that stuff. I think it's not good character right there. That's pretty much it. At the end of the day, he won the race. I've got to give him props. He was the better man today.\"",
      "The win itself was no big surprise for Lyles, the three-time defending world champion who will have to get past Bednarek to make it four in Tokyo. Bednarek was asked what Lyles said as he turned around and gloated after securing his fifth national title at his favorite distance.",
      "\"What he said doesn't matter, it's just what he did,\" Bednarek said. \"Unsportsmanlike (expletive) and I don't deal with that. It's a respect factor. ... He's fresh. Last time we lined it up, I beat him, so that's all I can say. Next time we line up, I'm going to win. That's all that matters to me.\"",
      "Asked to expand on his role in the tiff, Lyles was less forthcoming: \"On coach's orders, no comment.\"",
      "As CBS Sports' Robby Kalland notes, the interaction was not a surprise given Lyles' reputation.",
      "\"It's not a shocking interaction given Lyles' history of riling up opponents and even athletes in other sports beyond track and field,\" Kalland writes. \"In this case, he had the performance to back up his talk and this will only serve to spice up their next meeting on the track.\"",
      "As is common in a year after the Olympics \u2014 and in an era after Usain Bolt \u2014 track is a sport desperately in need of some energy. Who else to provide it than Lyles, the sport's most engaging character this side of Sha'Carri Richardson, who was arrested Sunday for allegedly assaulting her boyfriend.",
      "Up to now, track media and the runners themselves have tried to generate rivalries between Lyles and Erriyon Knighton (fizzled), or Lyles and Letsile Tebogo (beat him in the Olympics last year) or, of course, between Lyles and NFL receiver Tyreek Hill (In June, Lyles called off a race between himself and Hill after months of trash talk between the two sports stars.).",
      "Turns out, they probably should have looked at the lane next to him. Bednarek has won silver and beaten Lyles the last two times they've lined up in the 200 at the Olympics, even though Lyles has had issues at both \u2014 in Tokyo with his mental health, then in Paris with COVID.",
      "Bednarek referenced some long-simmering issues between the two.",
      "\"It's just some personal stuff that we've got to handle,\" he said.",
      "But when asked for something, anything, about this burgeoning rivalry, Lyles demurred, instead focusing on what a difficult year this has been for him after an injury in April kept him out of spikes until June.",
      "\"If they ain't gonna beat me now, they ain't gonna beat me ever,\" Lyles said.",
      "Bednarek isn't so sure of that.",
      "The 200 final was Bednarek's fifth race of the week, counting the three heats of the 100 meters, where he won the final Friday. Lyles, who has an automatic spot at worlds in that event as the defending champion, only ran one heat of the 100.",
      "\"We'll go fresh and we'll see what happens,\" Bednarek said. \"Because I'm very confident I can beat him. That's all I can say.\"",
      "Last year, Lyles won gold in the men's 100-meter sprint at the 2024 Paris Olympics in a finish so close even the announcers didn't know who won the race. After the official times came in, Lyles was determined to have crossed the finish line just a hair ahead of Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, with the men posting respective times of 9.784 and 9.789 seconds.",

    "summary": "A sea star wasting disease\u200b sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska, devastating more than 20 species and continuing today.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 07:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "China is standing firm against U.S. demands that it stop buying oil from Russia and Iran.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia.",
      "\"China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,\" China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff.",
      "\"Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.",
      "The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable \u2014 after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the \"Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.\"",
      "\"We don't want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,\" Bessent said.",
      "On Thursday, he called the Chinese \"tough\" negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. \"I believe that we have the makings of a deal,\" Bessent told CNBC.",
      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \"Realizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\" for Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",
      "A CBS News investigation has revealed that\u00a0China is still secretly buying Iranian oil and evading U.S. sanctions by using what's known as a \"dark fleet\" to transfer oil from ship to ship in the middle of the sea.",
      "When Mr. Trump unveiled a sweeping plan for tariffs on dozens of countries in April, China was the only country that retaliated. It refused to give in to U.S. pressure.",
      "\"If the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China's consistent official stance,\" said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Mr. Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Mr. Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \"the one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Mr. Trump has made it clear he wants a \"headline-grabbing deal\" with Xi, \"so rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \"strategic solidarity\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\"Beijing simply can't afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \"It's too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\"",
      "A 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that roughly 80% to 90% of the oil exported by Iran went to China. The Chinese economy benefits from the more than 1 million barrels of Iranian oil it imports per day.",
      "After the Iranian parliament floated a plan to shut down the Strait of Hormuz in June following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, China spoke out against closing the critical oil transit route.",
      "China also is an important customer for Russia, but is second to India in buying Russian seaborne crude oil exports. In April, Chinese imports of Russian oil rose 20% over the previous month to more than 1.3 million barrels per day, according to the KSE Institute, an analytical center at the Kyiv School of Economics.",
      "This past week, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India's purchasing of Russian oil. India's Foreign Ministry said Friday its relationship with Russia was \"steady and time-tested.\"",
      "Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and a top policy adviser, said Mr. Trump has been clear that it is \"not acceptable\" for India to continue financing the Ukraine war by purchasing oil from Russia.",
      "\"People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil,\" Miller said on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" He said the U.S. needs \"to get real about dealing with the financing of this war.\"",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, is pushing for sanctions and tariffs on Russia and its financial backers. In April, he introduced a bill that would authorize the president to impose tariffs as high as 500% not only on Russia but on any country that \"knowingly\" buys oil, uranium, natural gas, petroleum products or petrochemical products from Russia.",
      "\"The purpose of this legislation is to break the cycle of China \u2014 a communist dictatorship \u2014 buying oil below market price from Putin's Russia, which empowers his war machine to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians,\" Graham said in a June statement.",
      "The bill has 84 co-sponsors in the 100-seat Senate. A corresponding House version has been introduced, also with bipartisan support.",
      "Republicans say they stand ready to move on the sanctions legislation if Mr. Trump asks them to do so, but the bill is on hold for now.",

      "The families of the hostages were protesting in Tel Aviv, urging Israel's government to push harder for the release of their loved ones. Witkoff, who was greeted with some applause and pleas for assistance, joined them for a closed meeting.",
      "Videos shared online showed Witkoff arriving as families chanted \"Bring them home!\" and \"We need your help.\"",
      "The Hostages of Missing Families Forum confirmed the meeting, which came a week after Witkoff quit ceasefire talks, blaming Hamas' intransigence and pledging to find other ways to free the hostages and make Gaza safe.",
      "After the meeting, the Forum released a statement saying that Witkoff had given them a personal commitment that he and President Trump would work to return the remaining hostages.",
      "\"We will get your children home and hold Hamas responsible for any bad acts on their part. We will do what's right for the Gazan people,\" Witkoff said in the meeting, according to the Forum.",
      "Michal Iluz, father of slain hostage Guy Iluz, said Witkoff spoke about the deal \"that is going to be all or nothing.\"",
      "\"We told him that nothing is not ok for us,\" Iluz said.",
      "Of the 251 hostages who were abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023, around 20 are believed to be alive in Gaza. Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the second-largest militant group in Gaza, released separate videos of individual hostages this week, triggering outrage among hostage families and Israeli society.",
      "Israeli media haven't broadcast the videos, calling them propaganda, but the family of 21-year-old Rom Braslavski allowed the release of a photograph showing him visibly emaciated in an unknown location. After viewing the video, Tami Braslavski, his mother, blamed top Israeli officials and demanded they meet with her.",
      "\"They broke my child, I want him home now,\" Braslavski told Ynet on Thursday. \"Look at him: Thin, limp, crying. All his bones are out.\"",
      "Protestors called on Israel's government to make a deal to end the war, imploring them to \"stop this nightmare and bring them out of the tunnels.\"",
      "Another video released by Hamas showed hostage Evyatar David looking so skeletal his family said they fear he only has a few days left to live.",
      "\"Do the right thing and just do it now,\" said Lior Chorev, chief strategy officer of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.",
      "Witkoff's meeting with the families came a day after he and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee toured one of the privately run U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's distribution sites in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.",
      "\"We received briefings from (the IDF) and spoke to folks on the ground. GHF delivers more than one million meals a day, an incredible feat!\" Huckabee said in a social media post.",
      "The GHF's four distribution sites, which are in zones controlled by the Israeli military, have become flashpoints of desperation, with mass crowds of people gathering outside but who have then come under fire from Israeli forces or been trampled in the resulting crush.",
      "On Saturday, hospitals in Gaza reported the killing of more than a dozen people, eight of them food-seekers, by Israeli fire.",
      "Near a GHF distribution site, Yahia Youssef, who had come to seek aid Saturday morning, described a panicked scene now grimly familiar. After helping carry out three people wounded by gunshots, he told the Associated Press he looked around and saw others lying on the ground bleeding.",
      "\"It's the same daily episode,\" Youssef said.",
      "In response to questions about several eyewitness accounts of violence at the northernmost of the Israeli-backed American contractor's four facilities, GHF said \"nothing (happened) at or near our sites.\"",
      "\"We weren't close to them (the troops) and there was no threat,\" Abed Salah, a man in his 30s who was among the crowds close to the GHF site near Netzarim corridor, said. \"I escaped death miraculously.\"",
      "From May 27 to July 31, 859 people were killed near GHF sites, according to a United Nations report published Thursday. Hundreds more have been killed along the routes of food convoys.",
      "GHF says its armed contractors have only used pepper spray or fired warning shots to prevent deadly crowding.\u00a0Israel's military has said it has only fired warning shots at people who approach its forces, though on Friday said it was working to make the routes under its control safer. Israel and GHF have said that the toll has been exaggerated.",
      "Israel's military did not immediately respond to questions about the deaths near the aid sites. Its top general, meanwhile, warned Saturday that \"combat will continue without rest\" if hostages weren't freed. Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said Israel's military would adapt to \"place Hamas under increasing pressure.\"",
      "The war in Gaza began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel's retaliatory offensive\u00a0has killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between militants and civilians and operates under the Hamas government. The U.N. and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties.",

    "summary": "For the past week, these bands of young Catholics from around the world have poured into Rome for their special Jubilee celebration.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of thousands of young Catholics poured into a vast field on Rome's outskirts Saturday for the weekend highlight of the Vatican's 2025 Holy Year: an evening vigil, outdoor slumber party and morning Mass celebrated by Pope Leo XIV that marks his first big encounter with the next generation of Catholics.",
      "Leo arrived by helicopter as the sun set over the Tor Vergata field and immediately boarded his open-topped popemobile for long loops through the flag-waving, cheering pilgrims. They had already been partying there for hours, setting up campsites for the night as misting trucks and water cannons spritzed them to cool them down from the 85F temperatures.",
      "\"It is something spiritual, that you can experience only every 25 years,\" said Francisco Michel, a pilgrim from Mexico. \"As a young person, having the chance to live this meeting with the pope, I feel it is a spiritual growth.\"",
      "For the past week, these bands of young Catholics from around the world have poured into Rome for their special Jubilee celebration, in a Holy Year in which 32 million people are expected to descend on the Vatican to participate in a centuries-old pilgrimage to the seat of Catholicism.",
      "The young people have been traipsing down cobblestoned streets in color-coordinated T-shirts, praying the Rosary and singing hymns with guitars, bongo drums and tambourines shimmying alongside. Using their flags as tarps to shield them from the sun, they have taken over entire piazzas for Christian rock concerts and inspirational talks, and stood for hours at the Circus Maximus to confess their sins to 1,000 priests offering the sacrament in a dozen different languages.",
      "History's\u00a0first American pope\u00a0was presiding over the vigil Saturday night. He was then returning to the Vatican for the night and coming back for another popemobile romp and Mass on Sunday morning.",
      "A mini World Youth Day, 25 years later",
      "It all has the vibe of a World Youth Day, the Catholic Woodstock festival that St. John Paul II inaugurated and made famous in Rome in 2000 at the very same Tor Vergata field. Then, before an estimated 2 million people, John Paul told the young pilgrims they were the \"sentinels of the morning\" at the dawn of the third millennium.",
      "Officials had initially expected 500,000 youngsters this weekend, but Leo hinted the number might reach 1 million.",
      "\"It's a bit messed up, but this is what is nice about the Jubilee,\" said Chloe Jobbour, a 19-year-old Lebanese Catholic who was in Rome with a group of more than 200 young members of the Community of the Beatitudes, a France-based charismatic group.",
      "She said, for example, that it had taken two hours to get dinner at a KFC overwhelmed by orders on Friday night. The Salesian school that offered her group housing is an hour away by bus. But Jobbour, like many in Rome this week, didn't mind the discomfort: It's all part of the experience.",
      "\"I don't expect it to be better than that. I expected it this way,\" she said, as members of her group gathered on church steps near the Vatican to sing and pray Saturday morning before heading out to Tor Vergata.",
      "There was one tragedy before the vigil began. The Vatican confirmed that an Egyptian 18-year-old woman, identified as Pascale Rafic, died during the pilgrimage, reportedly of cardiac arrest. Leo met on Saturday with her group and extended his condolences to her family.",
      "Romans inconvenienced, but tolerant",
      "Those Romans who didn't flee the onslaught have been inconvenienced by the additional strain on the city's notoriously insufficient public transport system. Residents are sharing social media posts of outbursts by Romans at kids flooding subway platforms and crowding bus stops, which have delayed and complicated their commutes to work.",
      "But other Romans have welcomed the enthusiasm the youngsters have brought. Premier Giorgia Meloni offered a video welcome, marveling at the \"extraordinary festival of faith, joy and hope\" that the young people had created.",
      "\"I think it's marvelous,\" said Rome hairdresser Rina Verdone, who lives near the Tor Vergata field and woke up Saturday to find a gaggle of police outside her home as part of the massive, 4,000-strong operation mounted to keep the peace. \"You think the faith, the religion, is in difficulty, but this is proof that it's not so.\"",
      "Verdone had already made plans to take an alternate route home Saturday afternoon, which would require an extra half-mile walk, because she feared the \"invasion\" of kids in her neighborhood would disrupt her usual bus route. But she said she was more than happy to make the sacrifice.",
      "\"You think of invasion as something negative. But this is a positive invasion,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The Los Angeles wildfires and severe spring thunderstorms are just a few of the natural disasters that have contributed to more than $131 billion in global losses for the first half of 2025, according to a new report from the insurance company Munich Re.",
      "Overall losses so far in 2025 were slightly lower than the same time period in 2024, but still above long-term averages.",
      "By this time last year, overall losses were slightly higher at $155 billion, adjusted for inflation. The first half of 2024 included an earthquake in Japan on New Year's Day, coupled with severe thunderstorms in the United States that spawned more than 1,250 tornadoes.",
      "Of the $131 billion in overall losses for 2025, $80 billion was insured, which is the second-highest amount for the first half of any year since recordkeeping began in 1980. The first half of 2011 is the only year where insured losses have been higher, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami in Japan.",
      "The L.A. wildfires have been the costliest natural disaster this year and are estimated to have caused $53 billion in overall losses, with $40 billion insured.",
      "Climate change played a role in the wildfires by increasing the fire weather index conditions, making them more intense and destructive, according to scientists.",
      "\"We need to face it that the losses have been on the rise and make it clear that climate change plays an ever increasing role,\" said Tobias Grimm, chief climate scientist at Munich Re.",
      "As more people move into high-risk climate areas and weather events grow more extreme due to climate change, the damages will likely keep climbing, Grimm said.",
      "Another major global disaster in 2025 was the March 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar that killed an estimated 4,500 people and caused $12 billion in losses, very little of which was insured.",
      "Weather disasters like wildfires and storms have caused 88% of overall losses and 98% of insured losses, according to Munich Re. Earthquakes accounted for 12% of overall losses and 2% of insured losses in 2025 so far.",
      "In seven out of the last eight years, the industry has seen more than $100 billion in insured losses, Grimm said.",
      "\"Usually the second half of the year is more costly,\" he said, due to the bulk of the hurricane season starting in August and concluding in November.",
      "With hurricanes and wildfires being the costliest disasters on-record, the need to adapt and mitigate these climate impacts is necessary to address rising insurance costs, according to Grimm and other company experts.",
      "\"The best way to avoid losses is to implement effective preventive measures, such as more robust construction for buildings and infrastructure to better withstand natural disasters,\" Thomas Blunck, a member of the Board of Management of Munich Re, said in a statement. \"Such precautions can help to maintain reasonable insurance premiums, even in high-risk areas. And most importantly: to reduce future exposure, new building development should not be allowed in high-risk areas.\"",

      "Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley discusses the legal battle over\u00a0 President Donald Trump's use of tariffs on 'The Ingraham Angle.'",
      "A federal court fight over President Donald Trump\u2019s authority to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court for review, legal experts told Fox News Digital, in a case that has already proved to be a pivotal test of executive branch authority.",
      "At issue in the case is Trump's ability to use a 1977 emergency law to unilaterally slap steep import duties on a long list of countries doing business with the U.S.",
      "In interviews with Fox News Digital, longtime trade lawyers and lawyers who argued on behalf of plaintiffs in court last week said they expect the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in a matter of \"weeks,\" or sometime in August or September \u2013 in line with the court's agreement to hear the case on an \"expedited\" basis.",

      "Importantly, that timing would still allow the Supreme Court to add the case to their docket for the 2025-2026 term, which begins in early October. That could allow them to rule on the matter as early as the end of the year.",
      "Both Trump administration officials and lawyers for the plaintiffs said they plan to appeal the case to the Supreme Court if the lower court does not rule in their favor. And given the questions at the heart of the case, it is widely expected that the high court will take up the case for review.",
      "In the meantime, the impact of Trump's tariffs remains to be seen.",
      "Legal experts and trade analysts alike said last week's hearing is unlikely to forestall the broader market uncertainty created by Trump's tariffs, which remain in force after the appeals court agreed to stay a lower court decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade.",
      "Judges on the three-judge CIT panel in May blocked Trump's use of IEEPA to stand up his tariffs, ruling unanimously that he did not have \"unbounded authority\" to impose tariffs under that law.",

      "\"I don't know if I walked out of that hearing thinking that either the government is going to prevail, or that this is dead on arrival,\" Pickard told Fox News Digital. \"I think it was more mixed.\"",

      "\"I want to be very clear that I'm not in any way, shape or form, predicting what the Federal Circuit will do \u2013 I leave that for them,\" one lawyer for the plaintiffs told reporters after court, adding that the judges, in his view, posed \"really tough questions\" for both parties.",
      "Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who helped represent the 12 states suing over the plan, told Fox News Digital they are \"optimistic\" that, based on the oral arguments, they would see at least a partial win in the case, though he also stressed the ruling and the time frame is fraught with uncertainty.",
      "In the interim, the White House forged ahead with enacting Trump's tariffs as planned.",
      "Pickard, who has argued many cases before the Court of International Trade and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, noted that the oral arguments are not necessarily the best barometer for gauging the court's next steps \u2013 something lawyers for the plaintiffs also stressed after the hearing.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "Hackers are actively exploiting a new zero-day bug in Microsoft's SharePoint Server software. The same software is used by key U.S. government agencies, including those tied to national security.",
      "The vulnerability affects on-premise versions of SharePoint, allowing attackers to break into systems, steal data and quietly move through connected services. While the cloud version is unaffected, the on-premise version is widely used by major U.S. agencies, universities and private companies. That puts far more than just internal systems at risk.",

      "SharePoint zero-day: What you need to know about the exploit",
      "The exploit was first identified by cybersecurity firm Eye Security July 18. Researchers say it stems from a previously unknown vulnerability chain that can give attackers full control of vulnerable SharePoint servers without needing any credentials. The flaw lets them steal machine keys used to sign authentication tokens, meaning attackers can impersonate legitimate users or services even after a system is patched or rebooted.",
      "According to Eye Security, the vulnerability appears to be based on two bugs demonstrated at the Pwn2Own security conference earlier this year. While those exploits were initially shared as proof-of-concept research, attackers have now weaponized the technique to target real-world organizations. The exploit chain has been dubbed \"ToolShell.\"",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How the SharePoint vulnerability lets hackers access Microsoft services",
      "Once inside a compromised SharePoint server, hackers can access connected Microsoft services. These include Outlook, Teams and OneDrive. This puts a wide range of corporate data at risk. The attack also allows hackers to maintain long-term access. They can do this by stealing cryptographic material that signs authentication tokens. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is urging organizations to act. It recommends checking systems for signs of compromise and isolating vulnerable servers from the internet.",
      "Early reports confirmed about 100 victims. Now, researchers believe attackers have compromised more than 400 SharePoint servers worldwide. However, this number refers to servers, not necessarily organizations. According to reports, the number of affected groups is growing rapidly. One of the highest-profile targets is the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Microsoft confirmed it was targeted but has not confirmed a successful breach.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "What you should do about the SharePoint security risk",
      "If you're part of a business or organization that runs its own SharePoint servers, especially older on-premise versions, your IT or security team should take this seriously. Even if a system is patched, it could still be at risk if machine keys were stolen. Administrators should also rotate cryptographic keys and audit authentication tokens. For the general public, there's no action needed right now since this issue doesn't affect cloud-based Microsoft accounts like Outlook.com, OneDrive or Microsoft 365. But it's a good reminder to stay cautious online.",

      "3. Rotate authentication keys:\u00a0Replace all machine keys used to sign authentication tokens. These may have been stolen and can allow ongoing access even after patching.",
      "4. Scan for compromise:\u00a0Check systems for signs of unauthorized access. Look for abnormal login behavior, token misuse or lateral movement within the network.",
      "5. Enable security logging: Turn on detailed logging and monitoring tools to help detect suspicious activity going forward.",
      "6. Review connected services: Audit access to Outlook, Teams and OneDrive for signs of suspicious behavior linked to the SharePoint breach.",
      "7. Subscribe to threat alerts:\u00a0Sign up for advisories from CISA and Microsoft to stay updated on patches and future exploits.",
      "8. Consider migration to the cloud: If possible, transition to SharePoint Online, which offers built-in security protection and automatic patching.",
      "9. Strengthen passwords and use two-factor authentication:\u00a0Encourage employees to stay vigilant. Even though this exploit targets organizations, it's a good reminder to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and use strong passwords. Create strong passwords for all your accounts and devices, and avoid using the same password for multiple online accounts.

      "What you need to know about Facebook's recent account removals",
      "Meta says it deleted around 10 million accounts in the first half of 2025, mostly for impersonation, spam behavior and fake engagement. This is part of a broader effort to promote original content and clean up the platform and prioritize original content. The accounts were taken down for impersonating large content producers, according to the company, which shared the update in a blog post aimed at creators.",

These actions include reducing how widely Meta shows their content and temporarily disabling access to monetization features. If Meta's systems detect duplicate videos, the platform will prioritize the original version and limit the reach of the copies.",
      "The company is also experimenting with ways to credit original creators more clearly, such as adding links back to the source video. To help creators maintain visibility and reach, Meta recommends focusing on original content, avoiding third-party watermarks and making substantial edits when using material from other sources.

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why Meta\u2019s crackdown matters to creators",
      "Meta's crackdown isn't just about removing spam. It directly affects how content is ranked, shown and monetized. For creators, especially smaller ones trying to expand an audience, originality now plays a bigger role than ever. If your content is flagged as unoriginal or spammy, Facebook may stop showing it in people's feeds. That can tank your reach and, in some cases, cut off access to monetization tools like in-stream ads or bonus programs.",
      "On the flip side, creators who focus on making unique content or thoughtfully transforming existing media have a better shot at standing out. Meta says it's adjusting its algorithms to boost authentic voices. That could help original creators gain more traction if they play by the new rules.",
      "Facebook app on a smartphone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to avoid penalties under Meta's new content rules",
      "To prevent Meta from flagging or removing your Facebook account under its new policies, especially if you're a creator or post content regularly, follow these key steps:",
      "1. Post original content. Share content you created yourself, whether it's photos, videos, text or anything else. Meta is more likely to penalize accounts that mostly rely on reposted or recycled material.",
      "2. Transform content if you reuse it.\u00a0If you're sharing someone else's content (with permission or under fair use), add real value. Think reaction videos, voiceover, commentary or edits that change the context or experience. Simply stitching clips together or slapping on a watermark won't cut it.",
      "3. Avoid impersonation and spam tactics.\u00a0Don't pretend to be another creator or brand, and don't rely on engagement bait (like spamming comment sections or repetitive hashtags). Meta is actively removing accounts that engage in fake interactions.",
      "4. Avoid using visible third-party watermarks. If your video shows clear signs of being recycled from another app, such as a TikTok watermark, Meta may flag it. Upload clean versions without logos or branding from other platforms.",

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson warns of a new scam targeting travelers and discusses Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sharing the company's 'personal superintelligence' plan.",
      "With the rise of social media use in children, many people, especially parents, are worried about their online safety.",
      "The concern is not unwarranted, as it's no secret that thousands (maybe even millions) of predators lurk on these platforms. Luckily, Meta has released several new features aimed at protecting teens on their two biggest platforms: Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Meta's initiative aims to create a safer online environment in two ways. The first way targets accounts that display predatory behavior, and the second makes it easy for teens to spot and report suspicious activity.",
      "META AI\u2019S NEW CHATBOT RAISES PRIVACY ALARMS",
      "Teens can now see safety tips, block options and the account's join date. (Meta)",
      "Teens will now be safer on Meta platforms",
      "Meta's latest update has improved the direct messaging protections on its platforms. Specifically, teens will now get safety tips to check who's messaging them. For instance, a huge red flag is when a child is contacted on social media by a recently created account (a tactic used to hide identities, bypass restrictions, and scam people). To help teens immediately spot this, Meta will show them the date the account was created.",
      "Furthermore, the platform will make it easier for teens to block and report accounts. They will be able to cut all communication and notify Meta of inappropriate behavior with a single click. This will give these kids the power to quickly protect themselves and others when they don't feel safe.",
      "In addition, Meta is testing new AI-powered tools to detect when users may be misrepresenting their age. If the system flags an account as likely belonging to a teen, it will automatically shift that user into a Teen Account to apply appropriate safety restrictions. This proactive use of AI helps ensure that minors receive protections even if they try to bypass age limits.",
      "Meta has also made behind-the-scenes algorithm changes to reduce the visibility of content that may attract predators. For example, Instagram will stop recommending child-focused, adult-managed accounts to adults who have shown suspicious behavior. This move is designed to limit exploitative discovery before any direct interaction can occur.",
      "New block and report option in DMs. (Meta)",
      "Meta has removed thousands of predatory accounts",
      "In a transparent move, Meta revealed it had removed more than 600,000 accounts for predatory behavior across Instagram and Facebook. That is a staggeringly high number and just goes to show how much children were at risk.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What's more? Meta caught about 135,000 of them sexualizing children red-handed. They either left comments or requested images that sexually exploit them on other adult-operated accounts. The removal of these accounts shows that Meta is ready to take an active stand against these threats before someone becomes a victim.",
      "Location Notice lets people know when they\u2019re chatting with someone who may be in a different country. (Meta)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you're a parent or a guardian, you can breathe a little sigh of relief that Meta is making great strides to make your child more digitally literate. If they understand how scammers operate, they become more resilient and masters of their online safety.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "However, it's still your responsibility to stay informed about what your teen is up to online. Use these updates as a chance to openly talk about online safety with your young ones, especially when it comes to reporting inappropriate content.",
      "Nudity protection feature. (Meta\u00a0)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Protecting teens online is a high priority, and it's great that Meta is showing a growing commitment toward this. Preventing the exploitation and abuse of children is something that all platforms should be proactive about. These updates and removal of accounts are just the beginning steps to creating a space where children feel safe. It's important to acknowledge that there will always be risks on these platforms, but giving teens the tools to fight back is extremely welcome.",

      "You might already know that Facebook\u2019s biggest strength isn\u2019t the social media platform itself, but the user data it collects.",
      "The data we hand over without thinking twice is what this multibillion-dollar company uses to generate revenue. It sells that data to advertisers, who then try to make money off you by showing ads in the hope that you\u2019ll buy their products. I\u2019ll admit, sometimes the ad platform can be beneficial by connecting small businesses to potential buyers.",
      "However, since Facebook allows almost anyone to advertise with minimal moderation, it often leads to dangerous scams. Security researchers have found that a persistent malvertising campaign is plaguing Facebook, leveraging the reputations of well-known cryptocurrency exchanges to lure victims into a maze of malware.",

      "An iPhone with Facebook login screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the Facebook crypto scam works",
      "Bitdefender Labs reports that a malicious ad campaign has been running on Facebook for several months. The attackers use deceptive ads that imitate popular cryptocurrency brands like Binance, TradingView, ByBit and MetaMask. To make the scams seem legitimate, the ads often feature familiar faces such as Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or Zendaya.",
      "When users click the ads, they land on fake websites that look nearly identical to the real ones. These sites prompt visitors to download a so-called \"desktop client.\" That download serves as the entry point for a sophisticated malware system.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Instead of delivering malware directly, the fake site launches a silent server on the victim's device. This server then connects with a back-end channel to receive malicious instructions. The method makes it harder for traditional security tools to detect the attack.",
      "To avoid exposure, the attackers also use advanced filtering and tracking tools. If a user doesn't arrive through specific Facebook ad links, the website may show harmless content instead. The site also checks for automated tools or sandbox environments designed to catch threats. In some cases, it even blocks access unless the user opens it in Microsoft Edge, showing blank pages in other browsers.",
      "Screenshot showing a malicious Facebook ad. (Bitdefender)",
      "How hackers use fake Facebook pages to spread malware",
      "Bitdefender researchers found hundreds of Facebook accounts involved in promoting the campaign, sometimes posting over 100 ads in a single day. While many of these ads are taken down quickly, they often rack up thousands of views before disappearing.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "One Facebook page perfectly imitated TradingView\u2019s official account, including fake comments, posts and imagery, except for the redirect links that led to the malicious clone. The victims targeted tended to be men interested in technology and finance, and some ads specifically honed in on users in Bulgaria and Slovakia, showing how attackers fine-tune their campaigns based on geography and demographics.",

      "6 ways to avoid Facebook crypto malware scams",
      "As this Facebook scam shows, cybercriminals are getting more creative and more convincing by the day. These tips can help you stay a step ahead.",
      "Scammers have become masters of visual deception. They replicate branding, use celebrity endorsements and mimic official pages to give their ads an air of legitimacy. In the Facebook malvertising campaign, attackers used names like Binance and faces like Elon Musk to earn trust instantly. Instead of clicking on ads, it's safer to visit the company's official website directly by typing the URL yourself. Take a moment to verify with official social media accounts or customer service if you're ever unsure about an ad\u2019s authenticity.",
      "In these attacks, users were tricked into downloading what appeared to be desktop apps for trusted services but were actually malware installers. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "Interestingly, the attackers in this campaign used browser filtering to avoid detection, even prompting users to reopen the site specifically in Microsoft Edge. Using a secure browser like Firefox or Brave can help, and keeping it up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. Tools like content blockers or script filters can also help stop malicious behavior before it starts.",
      "Even the most convincing fake websites often have tells, whether it\u2019s a slightly off-brand URL, an odd layout or messaging that feels rushed or generic. A secure URL should begin with \"https://\" and match the official domain name. If a site urges you to act quickly, promises high returns or asks for personal information up front, take a step back. These emotional pressure tactics are a hallmark of modern scams.",
      "Two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) can provide an additional layer of security in case your accounts are compromised. Even if you accidentally fall for a scam and your login credentials are stolen, 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to access your account without the second verification step.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, using a personal data removal service can reduce your risk of being targeted in the first place. These services continuously scan data broker sites and request removals on your behalf, helping to keep your contact info, location history, and interests out of the hands of advertisers and potentially scammers. Given how this campaign leveraged Facebook data to target users interested in crypto and tech, the less data available about you online, the harder it is for attackers to personalize their scams.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Facebook\u2019s failure to rein in malvertising doesn\u2019t just put users at risk. It undermines the entire point of its ads platform. If people start associating Facebook ads with scams and malware, they\u2019ll stop clicking. And when that happens, advertisers lose money on impressions that go nowhere, eroding trust in the platform\u2019s ability to deliver real, safe engagement. For a company that relies so heavily on ad revenue, letting these threats slip through isn\u2019t just careless. It\u2019s self-destructive. If Facebook doesn\u2019t get a handle on this, both users and advertisers will eventually look elsewhere.",

This method is so inconspicuous that anyone glancing at your phone will think you're jotting down groceries or ideas, not exchanging private messages. It's subtle, smart and makes the most of what's already on your device. Just remember that when your quiet conversation is over, tidy up behind you.

In a notification letter, the French brand says the breach occurred Jan. 26, 2025, but wasn\u2019t discovered until more than three months later, on May 7.",
      "\"The House of Dior recently discovered that an unauthorized external party accessed some of the data we hold for our Dior Fashion and Accessories customers. We immediately took steps to contain this incident,\" the company told CyberGuy in a statement.",

      "The company, part of the LVMH luxury group, clarified that no payment or financial data was stored in the affected systems.",
      "\"No payment information, including bank account or payment card information, was contained in the database accessed,\" the company said, adding that law enforcement has been notified, and third-party cybersecurity experts were brought in to investigate.",

      "The incident mirrors a previously reported breach involving Dior customers in South Korea and China. At the time, Dior did not mention any impact in the U.S., but the timeline aligns. Moreover, its sibling brand Louis Vuitton, also owned by LVMH, recently disclosed similar breaches affecting customers in the U.K., Turkey and South Korea.",

      "Dior has not confirmed how many U.S. customers were affected or the full scale of the breach. However, BleepingComputer reports that the same attack targeted Dior and Louis Vuitton. Investigators have tentatively linked the breach to the ShinyHunters extortion group, which reportedly accessed the data through a compromised third-party vendor.",

      "Why lithium-ion batteries need a second life",
      "From your phone to electric vehicles and even power grids, lithium-ion batteries are everywhere. They offer unmatched energy density and can scale to meet large infrastructure demands. However, there's a catch. Even with optimal use, these batteries wear out after a few thousand charge cycles. When they die, they leave behind components such as nickel, cobalt, and manganese, materials that are expensive and environmentally damaging to mine. Without a solid plan for recycling, the clean energy revolution could create a very dirty problem.",
      "The problem with traditional battery recycling",
      "Standard recycling methods aren't quite up to the task. They're energy-intensive, generate significant emissions, and often fail to recover materials in usable form. This means many recycled batteries can't be turned into new, high-performing ones. As a result, manufacturers continue to mine for raw materials, causing further environmental harm. That's why scientists have been searching for a better way to close the loop.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "This reduces our dependence on destructive mining operations, lowers emissions, and makes battery manufacturing more resilient to global supply shocks. Even better? These recycled batteries perform just as well as new ones. Unlike traditional methods that recover raw metals but degrade performance, this upcycling process regenerates high-value cathodes with next-gen chemistry, turning old batteries into components even better aligned with today's EV and storage systems.",
      "Image of a lithium battery\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you rely on a smartphone, drive an EV, or use a laptop daily, this research affects you. The push toward clean energy is not just about wind turbines and solar panels. It's about making the entire system, including batteries, more sustainable. Right now, most of us toss old devices without thinking about where the battery ends up. But that battery contains valuable metals, metals that are expensive to mine and harmful to extract.",
      "This new method from WPI means future batteries in your devices could be made from sustainably recycled materials, without sacrificing performance. That helps keep costs down, reduces toxic waste, and shrinks your personal carbon footprint. These high-performance recycled batteries could soon power electric vehicles, solar-powered homes, and even the devices in your pocket, bringing sustainability directly into your life. Plus, as governments and companies invest in battery-powered everything, innovations like this help ensure there are enough materials to go around, without ripping more resources out of the ground.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This innovation could become a cornerstone of the circular battery economy, where old batteries fuel new technology without harming the planet. WPI's approach doesn't just tackle waste. It redefines how we think about energy storage in a world that urgently needs sustainable solutions.",

      "Imagine your standard diesel rig pulling onto the highway. Nothing looks unusual until you notice something new sandwiched between the truck and trailer. Revoy's innovation is a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a massive battery pack.",
      "The dolly carries a 575-kilowatt-hour battery, putting it in the same class as fully electric semis. But here's the clever part: it doesn't just trail along. It pushes the truck forward using its own powered axle, giving the diesel engine a break and saving fuel. All of this happens without modifying the truck or trailer.",
      "It connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch using a smart kingpin. It also plugs into the existing air and electrical lines between the cab and trailer. No hardwiring. No overhaul. Revoy designed it for fast installation, just minutes, no tools required.",
      "Illustration of how the Revoy dolly connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch. (Revoy)",
      "Electric truck conversion adds smart driving features",
      "This isn't just about range. Revoy's dolly also turns any diesel rig into a smarter, safer machine. Using embedded sensors and cameras, the dolly monitors blind spots and feeds real-time data to a driver's smartphone app. It enhances lane stability, helps correct steering in crosswinds, and delivers regenerative braking that recharges the battery. It also enables automated reversing, especially useful for tight yards and docks.",
      "The best part? Drivers don't need to learn anything new. There's no extra dashboard. The truck drives as it always has, just with extra power, extra control, and extra safety.",
      "EV battery swapping makes truck charging fast and easy",
      "Charging has always been a weak point in electric freight. Even the fastest chargers take 30 minutes or more to top off a truck battery. Revoy dodges that altogether. Instead of plugging in, truckers pull into a Revoy swap station and exchange their depleted dolly for a freshly charged one. The process takes about five minutes, which is faster than refueling a diesel tank.",
      "The first swap stations are already live in Texas and Arkansas, with more coming soon. As the network grows, so does the vision of truly hybrid diesel-electric freight. And if the route doesn't include a Revoy station? No problem. The truck simply runs on diesel alone and drops off the dolly at the last location passed.",
      "Illustration of a Revoy swap station. (Revoy)",
      "Electric conversion for trucks without upfront costs",
      "Worried about capital expense? Revoy's business model removes the barrier entirely. Truckers and fleet operators don't purchase the dolly; they lease it per mile. That means zero capital investment and no maintenance headaches.",
      "The system is designed to pay for itself. Revoy estimates savings of over $5,000 per truck annually, mostly through reduced fuel consumption. In some cases, fleets have reported 3 to 5 times better fuel efficiency.",
      "And weight isn't an issue for most operators. While the dolly adds mass, most truckloads fill trailers by volume, not weight. Revoy says over 60% of loads qualify, making this a practical fit for the majority of long-haul routes.",
      "Can this electric truck add-on work worldwide?",
      "Revoy built its dolly system for U.S.-style single-trailer rigs, but the idea could scale globally. Countries like Australia, with vast, sun-drenched highways, could easily support dolly-swap stations powered by solar energy. Imagine swapping a charged dolly in the Outback instead of waiting an hour for a charger.",
      "Canada and other countries with twin-trailer B-Doubles would require a modified version, but the core concept remains powerful: electrify trucks without replacing them. The technology is modular. The logistics are scalable. The potential is massive.",
      "A big rig on the road using a high-tech electric dolly. (Revoy)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Electric trucks\u00a0are still years away from becoming mainstream. But this electric add-on is already solving the biggest problems today. It's fast. It's smart. It works with the trucks that are already on the road. Instead of overhauling the entire trucking industry, this system works with what exists right now. You don't need a brand-new truck. You just need a smarter way to power it.",

      "'Outnumbered' discusses President Donald Trump's Supreme Court victory allowing him to massively reduce the size of the Department of Education.",
      "Three years after leaving a sleepy Seattle suburb to run the school district in Fairfax County, Va., outside the nation\u2019s capital, Michelle Reid earns more money than the U.S. president and gets a car allowance. Now she wants a taxpayer-funded personal bodyguard.",
      "In new job posting\u00a0No. 25212BR on BrassRing, an online recruitment platform, the Fairfax County public schools superintendent is advertising for an \"Executive Protection Agent,\" based at the school district\u2019s C-suite headquarters on Gatehouse Road in Falls Church, Va. The deadline for applicants is Aug. 5.",
      "SCANDAL-PLAGUED SCHOOL DISTRICT REFERRED TO DOJ AFTER ANOTHER TRANSGENDER LOCKER ROOM CONTROVERSY",
      "The new job would earn between $84,552 to $143,880, according to the\u00a0FCPS pay scale for a \"Unified Scale-Schedule B/Grade 006\" job, paying far more than the\u00a0starting salary of about $58,000 that a new teacher gets in the school district.",
      "\"The Executive Protection Agent is responsible for ensuring the personal safety, security and operational continuity of the division superintendent across school campuses, public events, official travel, and private residences,\" the job description reads.",
      "Fairfax County Public Schools Division Superintendent Michelle Reid. (Fairfax County Public Schools)",
      "The new position comes at a time when public school officials, like Reid, are facing heightened accountability in the post-COVID era over curriculum, contracts, budgets and \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" policies. In 2021, the Biden administration targeted parents for charges of alleged \"domestic terrorism\" for raising concerns at school board meetings, but new email records\u00a0have revealed the allegations were overblown and politicized.",
      "Since taking over on July 1, 2022, Reid has come under fire for allegedly covering up scandals over improprieties in football recruiting, the withholding of National Merit awards from students and, most recently, defying Department of Education orders regarding Title IX protections for girls in sports and schools. The Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights\u00a0just announced that Fairfax County Public Schools and four other northern Virginia school districts, including Loudoun County Public Schools, violated TItle IX protections by discriminating against students on the basis of sex.",
      "Last November, the all-Democratic school board voted unanimously to\u00a0renew Reid\u2019s four-year contract and increased her annual salary to $424,146 from\u00a0$380,000, more than the salary of New York City\u2019s education chancellor. Board members also gave her a $12,000 annual car allowance. In contrast, the U.S. president\u00a0earns $400,000 annually.",
      "Over her tenure, Reid has been notoriously suspect of leaks, which occurred this week with frustrated school district personnel anonymously raising the alarm bell over the new bodyguard position. The job description notes three times that applicants must demonstrate \"discretion,\" noting in one mention that applicants \"must demonstrate a high level of discretion and maintain strict confidentiality in all aspects of the role.\"",
      "A third grade teacher conducts a lesson in a classroom at a Fairfax County public school in Virginia. (@fairfaxcountypublicschools/Instagram)",
      "The hiring of a personal bodyguard for a school superintendent is unusual, say experts. The 12th-largest school district in the U.S., Fairfax County Public Schools\u00a0includes 180,714 students in 223 schools, according to the U.S. Education Department\u2019s National Center for Education Services.",
      "Meanwhile, the third-largest school district in the country, Chicago Public Schools, is about double the size as Fairfax County Public Schools, serving 322,809 students in 643 schools, according to the\u00a0latest data, and its superintendent, also called its chief executive officer, doesn\u2019t have a personal bodyguard.",
      "School district spokeswoman Mary Ann Ferguson said, \"Chicago Public Schools does not employ a personal bodyguard position for our superintendent/CEO.\"",
      "Talk of the new job has angered local parents and school district staffers.",
      "\"Queen Reid demands all the luxuries suitable to her station. It's all 'equity for thee, but not for me,\u2019\" said Stephanie Lundquist-Arora, a local mother who has\u00a0challenged Reid on numerous district policies.",
      "\"They are basically asking for a personal bodyguard for the superintendent,\" and that \"is not a normal or customary position.\" - Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services",
      "Unlike a teacher, the new bodyguard job doesn\u2019t require a bachelor\u2019s degree, but rather any \"combination of education and experience equivalent to a bachelor's degree in criminal justice, security management, or a related field.\"",
      "In the ad, Reid stipulates the job demands \"exceptional flexibility,\" with an \"unpredictable\" schedule, \"driven by the superintendent's daily activities and security needs.\"",
      "The ad notes: \"Must be available for irregular hours, including early mornings, evenings, weekends, holidays, travel, and extended on-call duty.\"",
      "The job requires \"knowledge of protective intelligence, behavioral analysis, and threat mitigation strategies,\" not to mention \"skill in surveillance detection, open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools, and incident reporting.\"",
      "Reid has a few other requirements that frame the job as a clear bodyguard detail: \"Ability to remain calm and make sound decisions under pressure, especially in sensitive or high-risk situations.\"",
      "Reid seeks an applicant with \"experience in threat assessment and protective intelligence, a \"focus on conducting investigations and executive protection\" and \"completion of executive protection training.\"",
      "Steven Brasley, media outreach specialist in the district's Office of Communications, insisted nothing was out of the ordinary.",
      "\"Fairfax County Public Schools has long provided a security presence for the superintendent at public\u2011facing events, as part of the broader safety framework implemented by the Office of Safety and Security,\" Brasley said.",
      "The Office of Human Resources, led by William Solomon, and Chief of Safety and Security Brian Lambert, recently \"collaborated\" on a \"new Executive Protection Agent position description,\" Brasley added.",
      "Brasley said the role \"formalizes responsibility for executive protection \u2014 including personal security for the superintendent during various activities \u2014 while also supporting a wider array of responsibilities within the Office of Safety and Security that support the entire school division.\"",
      "The school district\u2019s official explanation didn\u2019t include any reference to specific threats Reid faces.",
      "Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, based in Cleveland, Ohio, said, \"They are basically asking for a personal bodyguard for the superintendent,\" and that \"is not a normal or customary position.\"",
      "He noted, \"The job description is one of the shortest I have ever seen for any school security department job,\" adding the job boils down to a \"one-liner,\" looking for \"executive protection\" at work, public events, travel and \"private residences.\"",
      "Trump said, \"It does not reference other duties which one would expect if, indeed, the job extends to other tasks. There is not even the typical \u2018and other duties as assigned\u2019 on the posted job description, which could encompass other tasks beyond the executive protection of the superintendent.\"",
      "Brasley said the new job \"is designed to bolster FCPS\u2019s work,\" \"identifying, assessing and mitigating risks of targeted violence against students, staff and schools.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "There is no mention of \"students, staff and schools\" in the job description.",
      "Brasley said that protection of the superintendent is \"a component\" of the role,\" but the role \"participates in larger security and investigative initiatives across the district, such as the ongoing implementation of a new emergency response system and weapons screening.\"",
      "There is also no mention of a \"new emergency response system or weapons screening\" in the job posting.",

      "When much of the world had written off northern Gaza as unreachable, 30-year-old east-Jerusalem resident Sarah Awaidah and her team carved out a lifeline. Under the umbrella of Mena Aid, a regional partner coalition operating through the Multifaith Alliance (MFA), and in coordination with Israeli authorities, she built a system that moved hundreds of trucks of food and supplies into Gaza \u2013 bypassing Hamas and private contractors who had turned hunger into a business.",
      "The result: more than 100,000 families fed. The cost: her own safety. \"I never imagined that creating a safe, independent humanitarian route would become the reason my life might end,\" Sarah Awaidah told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that took place in a safe house in Israel.",

      "Operating through Mena Aid, Awaidah\u2019s team designed an alternative route to deliver food and essential supplies.",
      "In Israel, a trusted logistics company transported the goods from the port of Ashdod to the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings.

But I stood firm. I made sure he, and people like him, never got near it.

      "Aid workers delivered food to Gazans in the northern part of the enclave last week. (Multifaith Alliance)",

That\u2019s something the media rarely shows \u2013 the dignity and patience of the people.\"",
      "In the past month alone, her group has delivered 75 trucks and has another 112 on the way from Ashdod. Each day, she focuses on the mission, even as the threats grow.",
      "\"What broke me most wasn\u2019t the threats from strangers \u2013 it was realizing that people close to me were part of it,\" she said. \"It\u2019s easier to fight enemies from the outside. But when it comes from your own circle, it cuts deeper. Still, that only confirms we\u2019re doing something right. If they\u2019re losing their minds over this, it means the mechanism we built works. It means it\u2019s secure.

      "When asked whether President Donald Trump would call upon federal agents to arrest the Texas lawmakers who have left state jurisdiction, an administration official told NBC News: \u201cAbbott can handle his own state.\u201d",
      "The clash stems from Abbott\u2019s decision to call a special session of the Legislature this summer to address, among other topics, redistricting. Trump has pushed for a rare mid-decade redistricting, which the president has said would allow Republicans to pick up five more seats and pad their slim majority in the U.S. House ahead of next year\u2019s national elections, when Democrats will try to flip the chamber.",
      "The proposed map released by a Republican state lawmaker last week opened a path toward a five-seat GOP gain, shifting boundaries around major cities and in South Texas to create 30 districts that Trump carried by double-digits in last fall\u2019s presidential election. Texas Republicans currently control 25 of the state\u2019s 38 congressional seats.",
      "Democrats have decried the move as a power play and criticized Republicans for moving on the redistricting bill before responding legislatively to the devastating floods this summer that killed more than 100 people in Kerr County, outside of San Antonio.",
      "Democratic state Rep. Ann Johnson of Houston, speaking Sunday evening after arriving at a news conference at a strip mall about 30 miles west of Chicago, said the redistricting bill is only happening because Trump is \u201cafraid of the electorate next November.\u201d",
      "\u201cNobody wants this mid-redistrict draw. Nobody is asking for this. There is one human that wants this, and that is Donald Trump,\u201d Johnson added. \u201cAnd Abbott has turned over the state of Texas to try to serve his purpose. This does no good for the people of Texas. In fact, it takes away the voice of millions of Texas.\u201d",
      "But while many Republicans acknowledge the politics of the situation, they point to their party\u2019s significant majority in the Legislature and control of Texas\u2019 statewide offices as justification. Republican state Rep. Cody Vasut told NBC News over the weekend that he evaluated the map by asking himself the question: \u201cDoes this improve the political performance of Republicans in Texas?\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019ve seen all of these blue states overperform with their maps and Texas is underperforming, that puts Republicans at a distinct disadvantage nationwide,\u201d added Vasut, who chairs the state House redistricting committee.",
      "What happens next?",
      "The full scope of the Democrats\u2019 plans aren\u2019t clear. Texas\u2019 special legislative session cannot last more than 30 days, but Abbott could continue to call new ones indefinitely.",
      "While Pritzker has asked his staff to give the runaway Democrats logistical support, and the high-profile nature of the fight could help them raise funds to extend their trip, eventually one side has to cave.",
      "\u201cDemocrats are looking to this as a messaging opportunity more than as a political or legal or legislative strategy,\" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. \"The options they have are pretty limited, so the best they can hope for is to use this as a spotlight moment to shine a light on some of the issues that they have with the Republicans in Texas and Donald Trump.\"",
      "State Rep. Gina Hinojosa, a Democrat representing Austin who helped to organize a similar Democratic walkout in 2021 in response to election legislation, told NBC News last week that the effort four years ago was \u201cwildly successful\u201d because it led to Republicans removing parts of the legislation \u2014 though the bills eventually became law.",
      "\u201cWe could have never anticipated that the amount of publicity we brought onto Republicans would have shamed them into taking out those most egregious parts \u2014 so here\u2019s what I know: I know we\u2019ll fight with everything we\u2019ve got. This is situational. We\u2019ll take it day by day, see what our best play is,\u201d she said.",
      "Texas state Reps. Armando Walle and Ana Hernandez, who both represent Houston-area districts, were the only two Texas state House members to come to Boston. They had been planning to attend the National Conference of State Legislatures\u2019 annual summit there. After the quorum break was announced, \u201cwe decided that it was a great opportunity to spread the word to our colleagues across the state, across the country,\u201d Walle said on the sidelines of the summit.",
      "The pair will fly to Chicago after the summit and will consider the logistics of travel plans beyond the special session that\u2019s already been called \u201cday by day,\u201d Hernandez said.",
      "Responding to the threats of arrest by Texas Republican officials, Walle reiterated the refrain used by his fellow Texas Democrats.",
      "\u201cCome and take it,\u201d he said.",
      "A group of state Senate Democrats, who also came to Boston for the summit, told NBC News that while they\u2019d remain in the city through Wednesday, their future plans weren\u2019t yet determined.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how long we can do this, but you know, we don\u2019t win every battle,\u201d state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how this comes out, but to not fight this is simply not an option.\u201d"

      "HOUSTON \u2014 Daniel Savala leans back in a cloth armchair, raises his right hand and swears before God that what he\u2019s about to say is the truth.",
      "Looking into the camera, the Pentecostal missionary speaks in slow, measured sentences, describing how, for decades, he gained the trust of college students who came to his ivy-draped bungalow in search of spiritual guidance. Using scripture, he convinced them they could open up about uncomfortable topics like pornography and masturbation. Then he would strike, touching their penises and pressuring them to touch his, all under the guise of bringing them closer to Jesus.",
      "\u201cI knew that I was wrong,\u201d Savala says in the video, filmed by a lawyer in 2023. \u201cBut I did it anyway.\u201d",
      "Religion, he says, was the tool of his deception. \u201cPeople can just see that spiritual part of your life without seeing the whole of who you are.\u201d",
      "And the person he truly was?",
      "\u201cManipulative,\u201d he says matter-of-factly. \u201cCunning.\u201d \u201cSinister.\u201d",
      "In the two years since Savala recorded that confession at his home in Houston, lawyers, activists and whistleblowers have worked to untangle how a convicted sex offender with an eighth-grade education managed to convince scores of pastors and young Christians to put their faith in him \u2014 and why church officials repeatedly failed to stop him.",
      "For more on this story, watch \"Hallie Jackson NOW\" at 5 p.m. ET on NBC News Now.",
      "In police reports, lawsuits, online forums and interviews with NBC News, dozens of boys and young men have described how Savala spun his own twisted version of the Gospel. He taught them that seeing each other naked in his backyard sauna was essential to becoming true brothers in Christ \u2014 or, as he put it, \u201cnudity is unity.\u201d For those struggling with lustful temptation, he offered a counterintuitive solution: group masturbation, sometimes while listening to Christian worship music. He pushed some of his disciples further; in lawsuits, signed statements and criminal filings, at least 10 have accused him of sexually abusing them.",
      "\u201cHe would say things like, \u2018Hey, you know it\u2019s OK to masturbate,\u2019\u201d said Joseph Cleveland, who says Savala groomed and sexually abused him for a decade beginning in 2004, when he was 15. \u201c\u2018Because we\u2019re brothers, we can do it together.\u2019\u201d",
      "The pastors who shepherded hundreds of high school and college students to Savala\u2019s home were part of Chi Alpha, a Christian ministry that evangelizes on university campuses. Students seek out Chi Alpha to connect with God and each other, through small Bible studies and rollicking worship services \u2014 and, for more than 30 years, through Savala. Generations of Chi Alpha leaders hailed him as a spiritual savant who could answer life\u2019s deepest mysteries.",
      "The boys and young men who devoted themselves to Savala called him \u201cPapa Daniel,\u201d \u201cGod\u2019s vagabond\u201d and \u201cthe holiest man alive.\u201d At his direction, teams of students built the backyard sauna that became the site of his alleged crimes. So wrapped up in his teachings, his followers often didn't see themselves as victims until years or decades later. At least one of the college students Savala sexually exploited later became a pastor and brought his own boys to learn from his master inside his darkened sauna.",
      "The reward for that minister\u2019s devotion: Like Savala, he now faces the possibility of life in prison.",
      "Savala\u2019s ministry collapsed in early 2023 when several men came forward, some anonymously, to accuse him and some of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of sexual abuse and exploitation, triggering a wave of criminal charges, lawsuits and pastor dismissals. Savala was arrested, and at least six Chi Alpha pastors, leaders and students who studied under him were charged with sexual abuse.",
      "The revelations rocked Chi Alpha and the Pentecostal denomination that runs it, the Assemblies of God, which has nearly 3 million members at 13,000 churches across the U.S. As Savala, 69, awaits trial in Waco, Texas, Assemblies of God leaders have sought to distance themselves from the lay minister, repeatedly asserting that Savala was not employed by Chi Alpha and has never been credentialed to preach in the denomination.",
      "But an NBC News investigation, based on interviews and a review of emails, court records, photographs and social media posts, shows that Savala was deeply entrenched in Chi Alpha, with some leaders crediting him for the ministry\u2019s rapid growth in recent decades. The reporting reveals that Assemblies of God leaders \u2014 all the way up to the denomination\u2019s national superintendent \u2014 were warned repeatedly about Savala\u2019s troubling history but did not cut off his influence. These failures allowed more children and young men to be abused, the reporting shows.",
      "It wasn\u2019t the first time officials with the Assemblies of God, the world\u2019s largest Pentecostal denomination, have been accused of mishandling sex abuse allegations. In May, an NBC News investigation revealed how church leaders dismissed repeated abuse allegations against a charismatic children\u2019s pastor named Joe Campbell in the 1980s, allowing him to remain in ministry for years as more alleged victims came forward.",
      "Do you have a story to share about the Assemblies of God\u2019s handling of sex abuse allegations? Email reporter Mike Hixenbaugh.",
      "Chi Alpha had a clear opportunity to break ties with Savala in 2012, when authorities in Alaska charged him with sexually abusing boys as a youth minister in the 1990s. Instead, ministry leaders in Texas rallied to his defense, sending a staff member to Alaska to pay his bail and \u2014 after Savala pleaded guilty to sexual abuse of a minor \u2014 organizing a letter-writing campaign to ask the judge for leniency. After a stint in jail, Savala went right back to hosting Chi Alpha students at his home in Houston.",
      "In the decade that followed, at least half a dozen people contacted Assemblies of God officials in Texas and at the denomination\u2019s national headquarters in Springfield, Missouri, alerting them that Chi Alpha was exposing students to a sex offender. These whistleblowers wrote emails, made phone calls and spoke up at internal meetings. Again and again, they were dismissed or ignored, NBC News found.",
      "\u201cHiddenness is the ally of abuse,\u201d said Anthony Scoma, a pastor who resigned an Assemblies of God leadership position in Texas after he said senior denomination officials failed to act on his warnings about Savala in 2023. \u201cThe Bible talks about shining light into dark places. But leadership in the Assemblies of God says, \u2018Oh, don\u2019t shine light into our dark places.\u2019\u201d",
      "Rather than reckon with how church leaders welcomed a sex offender into the fold, Savala\u2019s accusers say the Assemblies of God has taken a defensive stance, refusing to release an internal investigation and relying on nondisclosure agreements to keep the story from spreading.",
      "Critics, including several current and former Assemblies of God pastors, say this response exposes a church leadership culture that\u2019s more concerned with avoiding legal liability than protecting the vulnerable. They\u2019re calling on the Assemblies of God to commission an independent review of its handling of sex abuse allegations nationwide to ensure nothing like this happens again.",

      "But former Labor Statistics officials say that the commissioner typically doesn\u2019t have a role in preparing the monthly jobs report.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way for that to happen,\u201d William Beach, who was   nominated by Trump to serve as BLS commissioner in the last half of Trump's first term, said Sunday in an interview on CNN.",
      "\u201cThe commissioner doesn\u2019t do anything to collect the numbers. The commissioner doesn\u2019t see the numbers until Wednesday before they\u2019re published. By the time the commissioner sees the numbers, they\u2019re all prepared. They\u2019re locked into the computer system,\u201d Beach continued.",
      "So how does the BLS collect data for the jobs report?",
      "The process for preparing the monthly jobs report, formally known as the \u201cEmployment Situation Summary,\u201d starts with a survey of American households.",
      "The Current Population Survey goes out to about 60,000 households across the country, including about 2,000 trained employees interviewing people. The sample of households surveyed changes periodically and no household is surveyed more than four months in a row.",
      "\u201cEach month, one-eighth of the sample is interviewed for the first time, one-eighth for the second time, and so on. This rotation scheme has been in use since July 1953 and strengthens the reliability of estimates of month-to-month change as well as estimates of year-to-year change,\u201d the bureau says in its website.",
      "The BLS also conducts a survey of government agencies and businesses, asking them for information about their workforce, hours worked and earnings data from their payroll records. That data is collected by BLS over the phone and digitally. After data from companies and agencies are submitted, BLS analysts review the data. All of the information submitted to the BLS is treated with strict confidentiality.",
      "Federal law authorizes the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect and process this information.",
      "Asked to provide evidence for Trump\u2019s claims of impropriety,  National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that revisions made to prior months were \u201cthe evidence.\u201d",
      "Trump also said the revisions were evidence of someone manipulating the data, \u201cI assume in the hopes of getting \u2018Kamala\u2019 elected.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat you saw on Friday was the effect of trying to do a better job, getting more information,\u201d Beach said, referring to the revisions.",
      "Erica Groshen, commissioner of the agency from 2013 through 2017, concurred and said revisions are not the sign of any manipulation.",
      "\u201cThe important thing is to realize that revisions are not a bug. They\u2019re a feature, right? The BLS tries three different times to get employers to report how many jobs they have and sometimes the employers can\u2019t report it right away. So, the BLS imputes the number from behavior of other people, other companies like them, and history,\u201d Groshen said on CNN on Friday.",
      "\u201cAnd [BLS] puts out the first monthly number because there\u2019s a lot of good information in it, but it\u2019s not complete. And then a month later it goes back and asks those employers again. They have another chance. And if they made a mistake, they have a chance to correct their mistakes. And it goes back a third time to make sure that they got it right,\u201d she added.",
      "While response rates to the Bureau\u2019s surveys have been declining, researchers recently found that revisions and falling response rates did not reduce the reliability of the jobs and inflation reports.",
      "This style of surveying has been in use by the agency for seven decades. Despite the old-fashioned style of surveying households through the mail and in-person interviews, the first-release estimates of jobs added or lost each month has been getting more and more accurate over time, according to Yale Budget Lab Director Ernie Tedeschi.",
      "Once data is gathered from companies, government agencies and businesses and reviewed by analysts, it is prepared and formatted for the monthly jobs report. That final report includes the number of jobs added that month, revisions for prior months, the unemployment rate and additional stats on jobs added or lost in a variety of industries across the economy.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses this general method of data collection for other reports, too. Those include monthly inflation figures and productivity reports.",
      "Commissioners at the Bureau of Labor Statistics are nominated by presidents, confirmed by the Senate and often serve across administrations. For example, the commissioner nominated by President George W. Bush also served under President Barack Obama. Beach, nominated by  Trump, also served under President Joe Biden. And the fired commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, who was nominated by Biden, continued to serve under Trump.",
      "With questions about data reliability now front of mind, JPMorgan\u2019s chief U.S. economist, Michael Feroli, said Sunday that there really is no substitute for high quality nonpartisan data from the federal government. \u201cHaving a flawed instrument panel can be just as dangerous as having an obediently partisan pilot,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cMoreover, one should not be under the illusion that the proliferation of private sector \u2018big data\u2019 indicators over the past decade can substitute for high quality federal data,\" he said. \"In almost all cases these indicators are benchmarked to the federal data, as private sector data are very rarely nationally representative.\u201d"

      "The shooting:",
      "Authorities allege Brown opened fire in the Owl Bar on Friday morning using a personal rifle and then fled the scene.",
      "Brown lived next door, apparently alone, and was a regular at the bar, Knudsen said.",
      "\"I think it\u2019s likely that he knew the bartender and these patrons, which makes this even more heinous,\" Knudsen said in a news conference Friday.",
      "The Montana Department of Justice released a photo of Brown on Saturday that depicted him wearing just boxer shorts and running away.",
      "Knudsen said that the photo was taken \"relatively soon\" after the shooting. Brown then allegedly went to another location not far from the bar and disposed of his clothes and some personal belongings. Authorities believe he then secured new clothes from a stolen vehicle that was loaded with camping equipment, Knudsen said.",
      "\"At this point, we have every reason to believe the suspect is fully clothed, shoes on his feet, able to get around,\" Knudsen said Sunday.",
      "Law enforcement officers briefly pursued Brown in that vehicle, but pulled back when they realized he was most likely armed, Knudsen said. Brown was not in the vehicle when law enforcement finally arrived.",
      "Knudsen told NBC News that after finding the car, it led law enforcement to deduce Brown was \"very likely up in the mountains, hiding in the timber, in the cover somewhere.\"",
      "That car chase was the last law enforcement contact with Brown.",
      "\"There was some confusion because there were two white vehicles that were involved,\" Knudsen said Sunday. \"There were some federal assets that were involved in that pursuit, but I believe that was the last law enforcement contact with roughly noon.\"",
      "Anaconda, about 25 miles west of Butte and adjacent to the Continental Divide, is part of a consolidated government with Deer Lodge County in southwest Montana. The city and county have fewer than 10,000 residents combined.",
      "The search",
      "Local, state and federal partners are now searching for Brown, who remains at large.",
      "Officials have focused the multiagency search on the area off Stumptown Road and expanded it to Barker Lake and the surrounding area.",
      "At one point, over 250 boots were on the ground Saturday in the search, Knudsen said. The effort includes canine detection units, as well as infrared and heat detection technology used by air, drones, and personnel conducting searches of camping and hunting sites.",
      "On Monday, the U.S. Marshals announced a $10,000 reward for information on Brown's whereabouts. A hotline was also set up at 1-877-926-8332.",
      "Knudsen said Sunday that the law enforcement response will shift a little bit in Anaconda as some personnel return to their home bases and the effort turns into a \"fugitive location operation.\"",
      "He noted it\u2019s possible Brown could have died by suicide, \"but we are acting under the assumption that he is alive, well, armed and extremely dangerous.\"",
      "There is also concern that Brown could return to town, Knudsen said.",
      "An Army vet who struggled with mental health issues",
      "Brown was known to local law enforcement, had a criminal record, and had access to firearms, Knudsen said.",
      "He was described by people who knew him as having mental health issues.",
      "Shane Charles, who grew up with him in Anaconda and owns another bar, previously told NBC News that Brown struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "\"Mike was a great guy when he was on his meds. He did have some mental health problems,\" Charles said.",
      "Brown\u2019s niece, Clare Boyle, also said he struggled with mental health issues, according to The Associated Press.",
      "\"This isn\u2019t just a drunk/high man going wild,\" she wrote in a Facebook post cited by the AP. \"It\u2019s a sick man who doesn\u2019t know who he is sometimes and frequently doesn\u2019t know where or when he is either.\"",
      "He served in the Army, leaving in 2009 with the rank of sergeant. Brown was an armor crewman from January 2001 to May 2005, and in the Montana National Guard from April 2006 to March 2009. He was deployed to Iraq from February 2004 to March 2005.",
      "The victims",
      "Nancy Lauretta Kelley, 64, was a recently retired oncology nurse who started working part-time at the Owl Bar around a year and a half ago, her daughter Kristian Kelley told NBC News.",
      "She had worked as a nurse for around 30 years and picked up the bartending job to \"fill some of her time,\" Kelley said.",
      "Kelley recalled hearing about the shooting through a text from a friend, and called her mother, but didn\u2019t get an answer. She then headed to Anaconda and soon discovered that her mother was one of the victims.",
      "Kelley said that she knew Brown and that he was someone in the community who would share \"a little bit wild stories\" from his time in the military.",
      "\"Maybe they were pretty incredible, so I don\u2019t know, but I think a lot of them were embellished,\" she said. \"And maybe he believed them. I\u2019m not sure, but he definitely was somebody that needed care.\"",
      "The shooting came as a shock to Kelley, who described Anaconda as a small but safe place.",
      "\"We didn\u2019t even lock our cars outside, you know, or the house, and it\u2019s, I mean, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s dangerous here at all,\" she said. \"But when people don\u2019t receive services, you know, in rural areas, sometimes this is what happens.\"",
      "David Allen Leach, 70, was deaf and lived at a public housing complex for elderly people and people with disabilities.",
      "\"He was a good neighbor,\" Robert Wyatt told The Associated Press. He recalled Leach as always happy to help neighbors with chores like moving furniture.",
      "\"If you needed help, Dave would help,\" Wyatt said.",
      "The families of Baillie and Palm couldn't be immediately reached for comment."

      "The Supreme Court froze the move while it considers the legality.",
      "Netanyahu and his supporters accuse Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara of exceeding her powers by blocking decisions by the elected government, including a move to fire the head of Israel\u2019s domestic security agency, another ostensibly apolitical office. She has said there is a conflict of interest because Netanyahu and several former aides face a series of criminal investigations.",
      "Critics accuse Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, of undermining judicial independence and seeking to concentrate power in the hands of his coalition government, the most nationalist and religious in Israel\u2019s history. Netanyahu denies the allegations and says he is the victim of a witch hunt by hostile judicial officials egged on by the media.",
      "An attempt by Netanyahu\u2019s government to overhaul the judiciary in 2023 sparked months of mass protests, and many believe it weakened the country ahead of Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack later that year that triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.",

      "Millions of people across the Upper Midwest and the Northeast are under air quality alerts Monday, as smoke from wildfires in Canada drift over the region.",
      "Hazy skies are expected in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, northern Indiana, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Delaware and Maine, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Almost 200 wildfires are burning out of control in Canada, including 81 in Saskatchewan, 159 in Manitoba and 61 in Ontario. Figures from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center indicate that more than 16.5 million acres have been scorched so far this year in what will likely be the country\u2019s second-worst wildfire season on record.",
      "A high-pressure system parked over the Midwest is  trapping the smoke in place, causing air quality issues to linger for several days, according to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.",
      "The air quality index Monday across 14 states in the Midwest and the Northeast ranged from \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cunhealthy\u201d for the general public.",
      "Wildfire smoke is of particular concern because it contains small particles that are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter \u2014 around 4% of the diameter of an average strand of human hair. This type of air pollution is dangerous because the particles are small enough to reach deep inside the lungs, which can exacerbate or increase the risk of asthma, lung cancer and other chronic lung diseases.",
      "Exposure to high levels of air pollution can also cause inflammation and weaken the immune system. Infants, children, seniors and pregnant women are especially vulnerable to unhealthy air quality conditions.",
      "Studies have shown that climate change is fueling conditions for more frequent and intense wildfires. Warmer temperatures can dry out vegetation, which can increase the likelihood of wildfires igniting and spreading rapidly.",
      "Cities affected by poor air quality Monday include Milwaukee; Detroit; Buffalo and Albany in New York; Boston and New York City. Many alerts will remain in effect through Tuesday, according to the weather service.",
      "In the West, several wildfires are causing separate air quality issues in the region. More than 65,000 acres have been scorched in California's Los Padres National Forest, where hot and dry conditions have fanned the growth of the Gifford Fire.",
      "In Colorado, the air quality index showed \"moderate\" readings Monday across large swaths.",
      "\u201cIf smoke is thick or becomes thick in your neighborhood you may want to remain indoors,\u201d the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said in its advisory. \u201cThis is especially true for those with heart disease, respiratory illnesses, the very young, and older adults.

    "story": [
      "ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 By the time Susie Wiles took the stage here at the state Republican Party\u2019s biggest event of the year, it was clear who the star of the show was \u2014 and, equally as important, who was not.",
      "Wiles, President Donald Trump\u2019s longtime adviser and his current chief of staff, was at the event to receive the party\u2019s \u201cStatesman of the Year\u201d award, its highest honor.",
      "\u201cI find it amazingly wonderful that almost every speaker has talked about voter registration and grassroots,\u201d she told the audience of party dignitaries. \u201cIt is the backbone of what we do and why we do it and why we win.\u201d",
      "As the evening went on, speaker after speaker hailed Wiles, with one calling her the \u201cmost powerful woman in the world.\u201d Along with her keynote address, the main portion of the weekend convention was dominated by figures in Trump\u2019s inner circle \u2014 some of whom had, like Wiles, previously worked for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis before publicly falling out with him.",
      "The lineup underpinned how abruptly the Florida GOP appears to have moved on from DeSantis, the man who had for the past five years been, by far, its most prominent figure and also was once named the party\u2019s \u201cStatesman of the Year.\u201d",
      "After DeSantis\u2019 dominating 2022 re-election bid, he quickly turned to flirting with a run for president, a move that left his power in Florida Republican circles nearly unchecked as most in the party were eager to hand the governor victories to boost his chances of getting the Republican nomination.",
      "But DeSantis lost to Trump, who also calls Florida home. And over the weekend here, it became clear that not only has Trump taken over the Republican Party at the national level, but the state party has also fully gotten on board.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, this is Donald Trump\u2019s \u2014 not Ron DeSantis\u2019 \u2014 GOP,\u201d an adviser to the Florida GOP said. \u201cAnyone who thinks otherwise has not paid attention since Iowa. Voters are ready to move forward and not focus on figures of the past.\u201d",
      "\u201cFlorida will continue to be the national standard bearer, with or without Ron DeSantis,\u201d the person added.",
      "That sentiment was palpable over the weekend at the Rosen Shingle Creek hotel that hosted the Florida GOP event.",
      "Along with Wiles, Trump deputy chief of staff James Blair, a  former DeSantis administration official, addressed the audience, as did Tony Fabrizio, Trump\u2019s top pollster, who was joined on stage by Chris LaCivita, the co-manager of Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign.",
      "Not only was the Trump theme overwhelming at the event, the feeling of the party moving on was made more acute because many who were given prime speaking slots were those with whom DeSantis has had public feuds in the past \u2014 most notably Wiles. LaCivita also spent much of the early phases of the 2024 presidential campaign attacking DeSantis, including calling him a \u201csad little man.\u201d",
      "DeSantis did give a well-received speech at the event, but was given a 2 p.m. speaking time, which was well before the main dinner speeches that featured the Trump-heavy lineup.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure he was not thrilled by it,\u201d said a former DeSantis adviser who remains an ally of the governor. \u201cHe had to notice, it was hard not to. But I would point to his polling numbers. He\u2019s still a very popular figure with Florida Republicans.\u201d",
      "In July, a poll from the University of North Florida (UNF) had DeSantis\u2019 approval marginally rating higher than Trump\u2019s, 83% to 82%, with both remaining overwhelmingly popular with Republican voters in the state.",
      "But along with his diminished presence at the state party event where he was once the star, DeSantis for the first time since first being elected in 2018 received significant pushback from the state\u2019s Republican-dominated Legislature earlier this year on an immigration measure \u2014 a move that sent clear signals that his stock with Florida Republican leaders is dropping.",
      "His status in his own state will also continue to be challenged in the 2026 midterms, as he struggles to find a candidate he can support to replace him as governor.",
      "The current front-runner is Rep. Byron Donalds, who was quickly endorsed by Trump and has amassed an early war chest of more than $22 million. Many of DeSantis\u2019 supporters have publicly attacked Donalds, who has not yet returned fire, and there is little expectation that DeSantis will endorse his campaign.",
      "The most prominent name to consider getting in the race has been DeSantis\u2019 wife, Casey DeSantis, but after months of speculation, she does not appear poised to make any announcement in the near future.",
      "Polling had Casey DeSantis and Donalds neck and neck, but after Trump\u2019s endorsement, Donalds quickly cut into what was once her dominating lead.",
      "\u201cCasey DeSantis was an early favorite when we asked about this in fall of 2023 with 22%, ahead of Donalds with 9%, and 40% undecided, but after Trump\u2019s endorsement of Donalds and as we get closer to August 2026, DeSantis\u2019 lead has all but disappeared,\" Michael Binder, head of UNF\u2019s polling department, said in late July. It\u2019s \"now inside the margin of error for this poll,\u201d he said."

      "The bulk of the 50-plus Democrats who left the state are in Illinois, where they\u2019ve been welcomed by Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker. Others are in Boston and in Albany, New York, where Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, in response to Texas, is pushing for a change in state law to allow redistricting in future years. In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is threatening to boot the state Democratic lawmakers from office or send law enforcement to force them to return to the state.",
      "Because House business requires a quorum, 51 out of the state\u2019s 62 Democratic House members can, by remaining out of state, prevent the Republican-led state House from moving forward with legislation.",
      "Those absences deprived the House of its quorum, a reality confirmed quickly after legislators gaveled in Monday afternoon.",
      "Republican Speaker Dustin Burrows admonished the dozens of Democrats who fled the state as having \"abandoned their post and turned their backs on the constituents they swore to represent.",
      "\"They've shirked their responsibilities under the direction and pressure of out-of-state politicians and activists who don't know the first thing about what's right for Texas,\" he said.",
      "\"Leaving the state does not stop this House from doing it's work. It only delays it,\" he added.",
      "Now, Texas Republican leaders will have to decide what to do next, as they have during various \u201cquorum breaks\u201d for more than 150 years.",
      "Republican lawmakers immediately, under House rules, locked the chamber doors and moved for the sergeant at arms to \"send for\" the absconded lawmakers \"under warrant of arrest, if necessary.\" House rules also say that the speaker must grant written permission of any lawmaker who wishes to leave while they work to establish a quorum. Burrows announced he was providing all of the members present Monday permission to leave and adjourned the chamber until Tuesday.",
      "This time, Abbott has also raised the prospect of not only sending law enforcement after the Democrats but, asserting untested and tenuous legal authority, pushing courts to declare their seats vacant and call for new elections to fill them. Abbott has also suggested that Democrats who are fundraising to support their quorum break may be committing felony bribery. (The Legislature enacted a $500-a-day punishment for breaking quorum after a similar Democratic effort in 2021.)",
      "\u201cI will use my full extradition authority to demand the return to Texas of any potential out-of-state felons,\u201d Abbott said in a statement Sunday.",
      "When asked whether President Donald Trump would call upon federal agents to arrest the Texas lawmakers who have left state jurisdiction, an administration official told NBC News: \u201cAbbott can handle his own state.\u201d",
      "The clash stems from Abbott\u2019s decision to call a special session of the Legislature this summer to address, among other topics, redistricting. Trump has pushed for a rare mid-decade redistricting, which the president has said would allow Republicans to pick up five more seats and pad their slim majority in the U.S. House ahead of next year\u2019s national elections, when Democrats will try to flip the chamber.",
      "The proposed map released by a Republican state lawmaker last week opened a path toward a five-seat GOP gain, shifting boundaries around major cities and in South Texas to create 30 districts that Trump carried by double-digits in last fall\u2019s presidential election. Texas Republicans currently control 25 of the state\u2019s 38 congressional seats.",
      "Democrats have decried the move as a power play and criticized Republicans for moving on the redistricting bill before responding legislatively to the devastating floods this summer that killed more than 100 people in Kerr County, outside of San Antonio.",
      "Democratic state Rep. Ann Johnson of Houston, speaking Sunday evening after arriving at a news conference at a strip mall about 30 miles west of Chicago, said the redistricting bill is only happening because Trump is \u201cafraid of the electorate next November.\u201d",
      "\u201cNobody wants this mid-redistrict draw. Nobody is asking for this. There is one human that wants this, and that is Donald Trump,\u201d Johnson added. \u201cAnd Abbott has turned over the state of Texas to try to serve his purpose. This does no good for the people of Texas. In fact, it takes away the voice of millions of Texas.\u201d",
      "But while many Republicans acknowledge the politics of the situation, they point to their party\u2019s significant majority in the Legislature and control of Texas\u2019 statewide offices as justification. Republican state Rep. Cody Vasut told NBC News over the weekend that he evaluated the map by asking himself the question: \u201cDoes this improve the political performance of Republicans in Texas?\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019ve seen all of these blue states overperform with their maps and Texas is underperforming, that puts Republicans at a distinct disadvantage nationwide,\u201d added Vasut, who chairs the state House redistricting committee.",
      "What happens next?",
      "The full scope of the Democrats\u2019 plans aren\u2019t clear. Texas\u2019 special legislative session cannot last more than 30 days, but Abbott could continue to call new ones indefinitely.",
      "While Pritzker has asked his staff to give the runaway Democrats logistical support, and the high-profile nature of the fight could help them raise funds to extend their trip, eventually one side has to cave.",
      "\u201cDemocrats are looking to this as a messaging opportunity more than as a political or legal or legislative strategy,\" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. \"The options they have are pretty limited, so the best they can hope for is to use this as a spotlight moment to shine a light on some of the issues that they have with the Republicans in Texas and Donald Trump.\"",
      "State Rep. Gina Hinojosa, a Democrat representing Austin who helped to organize a similar Democratic walkout in 2021 in response to election legislation, told NBC News last week that the effort four years ago was \u201cwildly successful\u201d because it led to Republicans removing parts of the legislation \u2014 though the bills eventually became law.",
      "\u201cWe could have never anticipated that the amount of publicity we brought onto Republicans would have shamed them into taking out those most egregious parts \u2014 so here\u2019s what I know: I know we\u2019ll fight with everything we\u2019ve got. This is situational. We\u2019ll take it day by day, see what our best play is,\u201d she said.",
      "Texas state Reps. Armando Walle and Ana Hernandez, who both represent Houston-area districts, were the only two Texas state House members to come to Boston. They had been planning to attend the National Conference of State Legislatures\u2019 annual summit there.

      "The company has come under fire from some social media users for its \u201cSydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\u201d campaign. Critics on X and TikTok have described the ad as promoting \u201ceugenics\u201d for its wordplay on genetics.",
      "Voices on the right celebrated the ad as a win against \"woke\" representation in media. Trump added to that chorus Monday in a Truth Social post Monday, calling it \u201cthe \u201cHOTTEST\u201d ad out there.\" Shares of American Eagle then surged; they closed more than 23% higher.",
      "The ad campaign uses a play on words to describe Sweeney\u2019s \u201cgreat genes.\u201d \u201cGenes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color,\u201d Sweeney says in the ad. \u201cMy jeans are blue.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, claiming that last week\u2019s jobs report \u201cwas rigged\u201d without providing any evidence.",
      "But former Labor Statistics officials say that the commissioner typically doesn\u2019t have a role in preparing the monthly jobs report.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way for that to happen,\u201d William Beach, who was   nominated by Trump to serve as BLS commissioner in the last half of Trump's first term, said Sunday in an interview on CNN.",
      "\u201cThe commissioner doesn\u2019t do anything to collect the numbers. The commissioner doesn\u2019t see the numbers until Wednesday before they\u2019re published. By the time the commissioner sees the numbers, they\u2019re all prepared. They\u2019re locked into the computer system,\u201d Beach continued.",
      "So how does the BLS collect data for the jobs report?",
      "The process for preparing the monthly jobs report, formally known as the \u201cEmployment Situation Summary,\u201d starts with a survey of American households.",
      "The Current Population Survey goes out to about 60,000 households across the country, including about 2,000 trained employees interviewing people. The sample of households surveyed changes periodically and no household is surveyed more than four months in a row.",
      "\u201cEach month, one-eighth of the sample is interviewed for the first time, one-eighth for the second time, and so on. This rotation scheme has been in use since July 1953 and strengthens the reliability of estimates of month-to-month change as well as estimates of year-to-year change,\u201d the bureau says in its website.",
      "The BLS also conducts a survey of government agencies and businesses, asking them for information about their workforce, hours worked and earnings data from their payroll records. That data is collected by BLS over the phone and digitally. After data from companies and agencies are submitted, BLS analysts review the data. All of the information submitted to the BLS is treated with strict confidentiality.",
      "Federal law authorizes the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect and process this information.",
      "Asked to provide evidence for Trump\u2019s claims of impropriety,  National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that revisions made to prior months were \u201cthe evidence.\u201d",
      "Trump also said the revisions were evidence of someone manipulating the data, \u201cI assume in the hopes of getting \u2018Kamala\u2019 elected.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat you saw on Friday was the effect of trying to do a better job, getting more information,\u201d Beach said, referring to the revisions.",
      "Erica Groshen, commissioner of the agency from 2013 through 2017, concurred and said revisions are not the sign of any manipulation.",
      "\u201cThe important thing is to realize that revisions are not a bug. They\u2019re a feature, right? The BLS tries three different times to get employers to report how many jobs they have and sometimes the employers can\u2019t report it right away. So, the BLS imputes the number from behavior of other people, other companies like them, and history,\u201d Groshen said on CNN on Friday.",
      "\u201cAnd [BLS] puts out the first monthly number because there\u2019s a lot of good information in it, but it\u2019s not complete. And then a month later it goes back and asks those employers again. They have another chance. And if they made a mistake, they have a chance to correct their mistakes. And it goes back a third time to make sure that they got it right,\u201d she added.",
      "While response rates to the Bureau\u2019s surveys have been declining, researchers recently found that revisions and falling response rates did not reduce the reliability of the jobs and inflation reports.",
      "This style of surveying has been in use by the agency for seven decades. Despite the old-fashioned style of surveying households through the mail and in-person interviews, the first-release estimates of jobs added or lost each month has been getting more and more accurate over time, according to Yale Budget Lab Director Ernie Tedeschi.",
      "Once data is gathered from companies, government agencies and businesses and reviewed by analysts, it is prepared and formatted for the monthly jobs report. That final report includes the number of jobs added that month, revisions for prior months, the unemployment rate and additional stats on jobs added or lost in a variety of industries across the economy.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses this general method of data collection for other reports, too. Those include monthly inflation figures and productivity reports.",
      "Commissioners at the Bureau of Labor Statistics are nominated by presidents, confirmed by the Senate and often serve across administrations. For example, the commissioner nominated by President George W. Bush also served under President Barack Obama. Beach, nominated by  Trump, also served under President Joe Biden. And the fired commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, who was nominated by Biden, continued to serve under Trump.",
      "With questions about data reliability now front of mind, JPMorgan\u2019s chief U.S. economist, Michael Feroli, said Sunday that there really is no substitute for high quality nonpartisan data from the federal government. \u201cHaving a flawed instrument panel can be just as dangerous as having an obediently partisan pilot,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cMoreover, one should not be under the illusion that the proliferation of private sector \u2018big data\u2019 indicators over the past decade can substitute for high quality federal data,\" he said. \"In almost all cases these indicators are benchmarked to the federal data, as private sector data are very rarely nationally representative.\u201d"

Brown then allegedly went to another location not far from the bar and disposed of his clothes and some personal belongings. Authorities believe he then secured new clothes from a stolen vehicle that was loaded with camping equipment, Knudsen said.",
      "\"At this point, we have every reason to believe the suspect is fully clothed, shoes on his feet, able to get around,\" Knudsen said Sunday.",
      "Law enforcement officers briefly pursued Brown in that vehicle, but pulled back when they realized he was most likely armed, Knudsen said. Brown was not in the vehicle when law enforcement finally arrived.",
      "Knudsen told NBC News that after finding the car, it led law enforcement to deduce Brown was \"very likely up in the mountains, hiding in the timber, in the cover somewhere.\"",
      "That car chase was the last law enforcement contact with Brown.",
      "\"There was some confusion because there were two white vehicles that were involved,\" Knudsen said Sunday. \"There were some federal assets that were involved in that pursuit, but I believe that was the last law enforcement contact with roughly noon.\"",
      "Anaconda, about 25 miles west of Butte and adjacent to the Continental Divide, is part of a consolidated government with Deer Lodge County in southwest Montana. The city and county have fewer than 10,000 residents combined.",
      "The search",
      "Local, state and federal partners are now searching for Brown, who remains at large.",
      "Officials have focused the multiagency search on the area off Stumptown Road and expanded it to Barker Lake and the surrounding area.",
      "At one point, over 250 boots were on the ground Saturday in the search, Knudsen said. The effort includes canine detection units, as well as infrared and heat detection technology used by air, drones, and personnel conducting searches of camping and hunting sites.",
      "On Monday, the U.S. Marshals announced a $10,000 reward for information on Brown's whereabouts. A hotline was also set up at 1-877-926-8332.",
      "Knudsen said Sunday that the law enforcement response will shift a little bit in Anaconda as some personnel return to their home bases and the effort turns into a \"fugitive location operation.\"",
      "He noted it\u2019s possible Brown could have died by suicide, \"but we are acting under the assumption that he is alive, well, armed and extremely dangerous.\"",
      "There is also concern that Brown could return to town, Knudsen said.",
      "An Army vet who struggled with mental health issues",
      "Brown was known to local law enforcement, had a criminal record, and had access to firearms, Knudsen said.",
      "He was described by people who knew him as having mental health issues.",
      "Shane Charles, who grew up with him in Anaconda and owns another bar, previously told NBC News that Brown struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "\"Mike was a great guy when he was on his meds. He did have some mental health problems,\" Charles said.",
      "Brown\u2019s niece, Clare Boyle, also said he struggled with mental health issues, according to The Associated Press.",
      "\"This isn\u2019t just a drunk/high man going wild,\" she wrote in a Facebook post cited by the AP. \"It\u2019s a sick man who doesn\u2019t know who he is sometimes and frequently doesn\u2019t know where or when he is either.\"",
      "He served in the Army, leaving in 2009 with the rank of sergeant. Brown was an armor crewman from January 2001 to May 2005, and in the Montana National Guard from April 2006 to March 2009. He was deployed to Iraq from February 2004 to March 2005.",
      "The victims",
      "Nancy Lauretta Kelley, 64, was a recently retired oncology nurse who started working part-time at the Owl Bar around a year and a half ago, her daughter Kristian Kelley told NBC News.",
      "She had worked as a nurse for around 30 years and picked up the bartending job to \"fill some of her time,\" Kelley said.",
      "Kelley recalled hearing about the shooting through a text from a friend, and called her mother, but didn\u2019t get an answer. She then headed to Anaconda and soon discovered that her mother was one of the victims.",
      "Kelley said that she knew Brown and that he was someone in the community who would share \"a little bit wild stories\" from his time in the military.",
      "\"Maybe they were pretty incredible, so I don\u2019t know, but I think a lot of them were embellished,\" she said. \"And maybe he believed them. I\u2019m not sure, but he definitely was somebody that needed care.\"",
      "The shooting came as a shock to Kelley, who described Anaconda as a small but safe place.",
      "\"We didn\u2019t even lock our cars outside, you know, or the house, and it\u2019s, I mean, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s dangerous here at all,\" she said. \"But when people don\u2019t receive services, you know, in rural areas, sometimes this is what happens.\"",
      "David Allen Leach, 70, was deaf and lived at a public housing complex for elderly people and people with disabilities.",
      "\"He was a good neighbor,\" Robert Wyatt told The Associated Press. He recalled Leach as always happy to help neighbors with chores like moving furniture.",
      "\"If you needed help, Dave would help,\" Wyatt said.",
      "The families of Baillie and Palm couldn't be immediately reached for comment."

    "story": [
      "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\u2019 ex-girlfriend Virginia Huynh, who was set to testify in the hip-hop mogul\u2019s federal trial but dropped out before the proceedings started, has written a letter to a New York judge urging his release on bail.",
      "Huynh was identified as \u201cVictim-3\u201d in the federal government\u2019s sprawling indictment against Combs, 55, who was acquitted in early July of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges but convicted on two counts of interstate prostitution.",
      "In the letter, Huynh \u2014 publicly identifying herself by name for the first time \u2014 wrote that she wanted to \u201cshare my observations about [Combs\u2019] character and to respectfully request that the Court permit his release on bond while the case proceeds.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe it is important for the Court to have a full picture of who he is beyond the allegations,\u201d Huynh said in the one-page letter, which was filed by Combs\u2019 legal team Sunday.",
      "Huynh wrote that her relationship with Combs was \u201cnot always perfect,\u201d beset by \u201cups and downs\u201d and \u201cmistakes.\u201d But in time, she wrote, he \u201cmade visible efforts to become a better person and to address the harm he had caused.\u201d",
      "By the end of their relationship, she added, \u201che embodied an energy of love, patience and gentleness that was markedly different from his past behavior.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo my knowledge,\u201d Huynh told Judge Arun Subramanian, \u201che has not been violent for many years, and he has been committed to being a father first.\u201d",
      "She said that she does not view Combs as \u201ca danger to me or to this community,\u201d and that his children \u201cdepend on him for emotional and financial support.\u201d",
      "\u201cAllowing him to be at home will also support the healing process for all involved,\u201d Huynh wrote in closing. \u201cI respectfully ask that you consider these factors when deciding his eligibility for release.\u201d",
      "Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York, declined to comment on Huynh\u2019s letter. In a letter to Subramanian last month, prosecutors argued that Combs should not be given bail because he is a flight risk and a danger to the community.",
      "In the days before Combs\u2019 trial started, U.S. government prosecutors said they were struggling to get in touch with \u201cVictim-3\u201d and her attorney. She ultimately did not testify in the blockbuster seven-week trial.",
      "The jurors in the case heard testimony from two of Combs\u2019 other ex-girlfriends: R&B singer Casandra \u201cCassie\u201d Ventura and a woman referred to by the pseudonym \u201cJane.\u201d The prosecution called more than 30 other witnesses, including former assistants.",
      "Ventura testified about the alleged abuse she experienced during her 10-year on-and-off relationship with Combs. She accused him of physical and sexual assault, and jurors were shown hotel security video of Combs beating her in a hallway in 2016.",
      "Combs, who pleaded not guilty, faced five criminal counts: one count of racketeering conspiracy; two counts of sex trafficking by fraud or coercion; and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Subramanian denied Combs\u2019 bail request on the day the jury\u2019s verdict came in, saying it would be impossible for the Bad Boy Records founder to prove that he does not pose a danger.",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/what-to-buy-tariff-price-increases-rcna221683",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 14:37:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Brands are already raising prices, so experts recommend buying tech, household basics, clothing and baby gear before costs go up even more.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s almost impossible to avoid tariff-related price hikes while shopping. A universal 10% tariff on all countries has been in effect since April, and over 100 countries could soon face higher reciprocal tariffs if they don\u2019t reach a trade agreement with the U.S. before Aug. 1.",
      "Since the trade war is expected to heat up even more in the coming weeks, don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re suddenly paying more for clothes, tech, household basics and groceries. That said, there\u2019s still time to save \u2014 tariffs only apply to imported goods, so prices on products currently in U.S. warehouses aren\u2019t currently shooting up. Once that supply runs out, however, many brands will have no choice but to raise prices, including those that already did a first round of hikes earlier this year.",
      "Below, I spoke with experts about what they recommend buying before tariffs have a significant impact on your shopping cart. They also responded to frequently asked questions about tariffs and shared tips for saving money.",
      "Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.",
      "What to buy as tariff-related price hikes roll out",
      "We don\u2019t know what the exact impacts of tariffs will be, but one thing is for sure: almost everything you buy is getting more expensive, says Dr. Ross Steinman, a professor of consumer psychology at Widener University. That doesn\u2019t mean you should panic buy \u2014 it does, however, mean that now is the best time to purchase anything on your wishlist or that you\u2019ve been saving up for. It\u2019s crucial to focus on higher-cost items produced abroad, like tech, appliances, furniture and cars, as well as clothing, shoes and household basics like groceries and cleaning supplies, says Vipin Porwal, the CEO and a consumer savings expert at Smarty.",
      "A few things to keep in mind: First, as I said above, tariffs only apply to imported goods, so the price of products currently in U.S. warehouses aren\u2019t shooting up.  But it\u2019s only a matter of time before that stock runs low and companies have to import more goods, which will be subject to the new tariff rates. We\u2019re also already seeing brands across industries raise prices or warn customers about impending hikes, including big names like Nike, Black+Decker and Fabletics. And with the threat of higher duties looming, companies that already raised prices could do so again.",
      "Also, remember that even if a product is manufactured in the U.S., tariffs are causing companies to face higher production costs. They often import materials like fabric, batteries and microchips from foreign countries, so expect increased prices on American-made goods, too.",
      "Below, I rounded up examples of products you should consider buying before more tariff-related price hikes roll out. They\u2019re all manufactured in places subject to universal tariffs or higher country-specific duties.",
      "Basics and groceries",
      "Tide Pods Liquid Laundry Detergent (76-Count)",
      "During a recent earnings call, Procter & Gamble\u2019s CEO said shoppers will start seeing price hikes from its brands this summer, including Tide, which has manufacturing plants in the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These laundry detergent pods have a color protector, odor fighter and stain remover inside. They dissolve quickly in cool or warm water, according to Tide.",
      "Bounty Paper Towels",
      "Procter & Gamble also owns the paper goods brand Bounty, which, similar to Tide, makes its products across the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These paper towels are absorbent so you can quickly soak up messes. Rolls come pre-measured, letting you tear off small or large sheets along the perforated lines.",
      "Kosterina Original Extra Virgin Olive Oil",
      "Kosterina harvests Koroneiki olives in Greece to make this extra-virgin olive oil. Before the price of this pantry staple increases due to the 15% tariff imposed on countries part of the European Union, consider buying a couple of bottles. The EVOO, which I use for sauteing, roasting and making dressings, has a buttery, peppery flavor.",
      "Technology",
      "Apple AirPods 4 with ANC",
      "Apple makes most of its hardware in China and produces devices like iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and AirPods in India and Vietnam. NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz, who tested Apple\u2019s AirPods 4 for two months, says they\u2019re a small, comfortable pair you can rely on daily. \u201cThese are the best earbuds for anyone who hates the feeling of rubber eartips clogging their eardrums,\u201d he says. \u201cThey also have new features like dust and water resistance, and adaptive audio, which automatically switches between noise cancellation modes.\u201d",
      "JBL Clip 5",
      "The JBL Clip 5, which is made in China, is our team\u2019s go-to Bluetooth speaker \u2014 the audio quality is impressive for the device\u2019s size, and its built-in carabiner clip lets you attach it to bags, bikes, beach umbrellas, bathroom towel rods and more. You can use the speaker for up to 12 hours before needing to recharge it, according to the brand. The Clip 5 is also dust- and water-resistant.",
      "Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy-Con",
      "While Nintendo didn\u2019t raise the price of the Switch 2 prior to its launch in June, the company, which makes most of its products in Asia, marked up related accessories. It also said \u201cother adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are possible in the future, depending on market conditions.\u201d",
      "The original Switch is beloved among the NBC Select staff, and if it\u2019s on your wishlist, we recommend buying it soon \u2014 its price could increase at any point, and it\u2019s more readily available compared to the frequently out-of-stock Switch 2. This handheld gaming console has two detachable Joy-Con controllers and three play modes: TV, handheld and tabletop. It\u2019s also designed with built-in motion controls that immerse you in games.",
      "Google Pixel Watch 3",
      "Most Google Pixel products are made in China and Vietnam, like the Pixel Watch 3, which won an NBC Select Wellness Award. Rabinowitz says it\u2019s Google\u2019s best smartwatch yet, although it\u2019s only compatible with Android phones (which are also likely to increase in price soon). It has fitness tracking features, including the ability to automatically log workouts and build custom runs. The water-resistant watch has a 24-hour battery life, according to the brand, and collects data about your sleep.",
      "Clothes and shoes",
      "Gap Organic Cotton VintageSoft T-Shirt",
      "I buy basics from Gap every time they\u2019re on sale, including this 100% cotton T-shirt, which is made in India. The shirt has a soft, loose feel, short sleeves and a crewneck. It runs true-to-size, in my experience. I typically wear it tucked into a pair of jeans, and in the colder months, I throw a cardigan over it.",
      "501\u00ae Original Fit Men's Jeans",
      "These Levi\u2019s jeans, available in men\u2019s and women\u2019s sizes, are produced in China, but the brand makes and sources apparel from across the world. \u201cI\u2019ve been wearing a pair of Levi\u2019s 501\u2019s for over 6 years now,\u201d says NBC Select editor Jordan Bowman. \u201cI love the classic, straight fit because it works for almost every outfit, and the cut is honestly timeless. There\u2019s a reason these are one of most iconic pairs of denim of all time.\u201d",
      "Lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Leggings",
      "Lululemon, which makes and sources products from across the world, raised prices on a small portion of its merchandise this summer. According to an earnings call, the hikes were \u201cmodest\u201d and \u201cstrategic.\u201d The brand didn\u2019t specify exactly what products increased in price, or whether customers should expect additional increases in the future. Lululemon\u2019s Wunder Train High-Rise Leggings are my all-time favorite pair for high-intensity workouts like running, as well as strength training. They have two side pockets, a hidden pocket in the waistband and a waistband drawcord.",
      "Adidas Samba OG Sneaker",
      "Adidas, which primarily makes its shoes in Asia and Germany, will eventually raise prices on its U.S. products, according to the brand, which did not disclose how much increases will be or what items will be affected. These are some of Adidas\u2019 most classic sneakers for men and women. The Samba has a leather upper, synthetic fabric lining and grippy rubber outsole.",
      "Birkenstock Arizona",
      "Birkenstock, which makes products at its factories in Germany, plans to raise prices globally to offset tariffs at some point before September. The brand\u2019s Arizona slip-on sandal for men and women has two adjustable straps and a cork footbed. There\u2019s also a deep heel cup to keep your foot secure, as well as a raised toe bar to encourage the natural gripping motion of your feet, according to the brand.",
      "Under Armour Charged Surge 4 Sneaker",
      "During a recent earnings call, Under Armour, which sources products from countries like Vietnam, Jordan and Indonesia, shared that it\u2019s increasing prices on its apparel, shoes and accessories. We\u2019ve tested lots of Under Armour\u2019s activewear and sneakers over the years. The Charged Surge 4, available in men\u2019s and women\u2019s sizes, is a basic shoe that\u2019s great for walkers, runners and gym goers. It has a cushioned midsole to support feet and a grippy rubber outsole to stabilize you on various surfaces. The sneaker is also made with mesh to keep feet cool.",
      "Home and kitchen",
      "Ninja AF101 Air Fryer",
      "SharkNinja already raised prices on a handful of products in response to tariffs, and will continue to, according to a statement from the company\u2019s CEO during a recent earnings call. Almost every NBC Select staff member has a Ninja appliance in their kitchen, most of which are manufactured in China and Southeast Asia. While we love using the Creami to make frozen treats, we rely most on Ninja\u2019s basic kitchen gadgets, like blenders, air fryers and coffee machines. This air fryer is recommended by NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who appreciates that it\u2019s big enough to feed a few people,  yet compact enough to keep in her small kitchen. The appliance is easy to operate, and you can use it to air fry, roast, reheat and dehydrate ingredients. Its detachable parts are dishwasher-safe, according to the brand.",
      "Dyson Ball Animal 3 Extra Upright Vacuum",
      "We recommend Dyson\u2019s vacuums, which are made in countries like China and Malaysia, because they have superior suction and make cleaning all types of floors a breeze. If you have one on your wishlist, now is the time to buy \u2014 Dyson\u2019s vacuums are hundreds of dollars, so potential price increases could put them out of your budget. The Ball Animal 3 Extra upright vacuum is designed to clean large homes with pets. It has a detangling brushhead, three cleaning modes and a built-in filtration system, plus it comes with multiple accessories, including a pet grooming tool.",
      "Sproos! Handheld Showerhead with Filter Set",
      "In the spring, Sproos notified customers that it planned on holding prices steady for the time being. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on increases, which we haven\u2019t seen yet \u2014 that means now is the best time to invest in one of the brand\u2019s filtered showerheads. This set comes with a handheld fixture that has a replaceable filter and three spray modes. Everything you need for installation is included, including steel pliers and step-by-step instructions.",
      "Ikea Kallax Shelf Unit",
      "Ikea\u2019s furniture and home goods are centered around Swedish and Scandinavian designs, but they\u2019re manufactured worldwide. Rabinowitz\u2019s favorite Ikea piece is this shelf, which he has a larger version of. \u201cThis storage shelf has moved with me across three apartments in New York City \u2014 it\u2019s outlasted couches, mattresses, bed frames and TV stands,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to wow anyone aesthetically, but it is extremely practical.\u201d",
      "Casper Original Hybrid Mattress",
      "Many brands, including Casper, assemble their mattresses in the U.S.. Still, they import materials like fabrics, foam and springs from overseas \u2014 that could lead to increased production costs for companies, and, in turn, increased prices for shoppers.",
      "NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio recommends Casper\u2019s Original Hybrid Mattress if you need to upgrade soon. \u201cI bought this mattress in 2021 and it still feels brand new years later,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s semi-firm, which is perfect for my husband and I since we tend to have different preferences. I\u2019m really picky about my mattresses because I\u2019m a very hot sleeper, but this one manages to feel fairly cool and doesn\u2019t trap heat, in my experience.\u201d",
      "Baby gear",
      "Uppababy Aria Infant Car Seat",
      "The cost of baby gear like strollers and car seats, much of which is produced overseas, is up 20% on average since January, according to BabyCenter, a digital parenting resource. Uppababy raised prices across most of its products a few months ago, so if you\u2019re in the market for one of the brand\u2019s strollers, car seats, high chairs, changing backpacks or bouncers, buy it before another round of hikes happen. Rabinowitz used the brand\u2019s Aria car seat to travel with his newborn, and he still uses the brand\u2019s Vista V2 stroller with his now 1-year-old. He recommends buying from Uppababy if you\u2019re looking for high quality pieces and peace of mind as a parent.",
      "Coterie Monthly Diaper Box",
      "Coterie already increased the price of its monthly diaper box by $5, and the price of its 4-pack of wipes by $3, per auto-review shipment. In an email to customers, the brand cited \u201cglobal economic factors and rising material costs\u201d as the reason for the hike.",
      "Rabinowitz started buying the brand\u2019s diapers when his baby was born last year. \u201cUsing Coterie\u2019s diapers make me feel good as a parent because they work really well and don\u2019t have ingredients that I\u2019m skeptical of, like a lot of plastic and perfumes,\u201d says Rabinowitz. \u201cThe subscription is easy to use and very flexible \u2014 if I\u2019m scheduled to get diapers in five weeks but I need them in two, I can move up my shipment date.\u201d",
      "Bugaboo Butterfly 2 Travel Stroller",
      "Similar to Uppababy, Bugaboo raised prices across its baby gear earlier this year. Select products were impacted, but the brand didn\u2019t specify which ones \u2014 if you have your eye on something, buy it before its price goes up. NBC senior photo editor Becca Delman, a soon-to-be mom of three, highly recommends Bugaboo\u2019s compact travel stroller. \u201cThe Butterfly 2 works so well for my 10-month old and 3.5-year old,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s lightweight, I can fold it with one hand and it\u2019s easy to clean. The lay-flat feature is also great for my new baby when he arrives in November.\u201d",
      "Will retailers raise prices due to tariffs?",
      "Yes, in addition to individual brands, some retailers plan to start pricing their merchandise higher due to tariffs. Here are a few we know about right now:",
      "Walmart: Walmart started rolling out price hikes this summer, although the retailer didn\u2019t share details about what types of products will be impacted or what the rollout will look like.Target: Target has recently reported lower earnings and ended its price matching policy, signs that it will likely raise prices due to tariffs in the future.

      "Tariffs are taxes on imported goods. If a company brings foreign goods into the U.S., it must pay the U.S. government a percentage of those goods.",
      "Tariff rates are constantly changing as the U.S. government negotiates deals with its trading partners globally. In addition to the tariffs below, all of which are currently in effect, numerous countries could soon be subject to high reciprocal tariffs once a pause expires on Aug. 1. China and Mexico are also in ongoing talks with the U.S. about tariffs \u2014 China's pause on duties expires on Aug. 12 and Mexico's pause expires at the end of October.",

      "Tariffs will eventually raise prices for U.S. consumers, but so far, the impact is muted, says Ales. Generally speaking, prices haven\u2019t changed much across industries since duties first went into effect in April \u2014 that won\u2019t be the case forever though. \u201cCompanies did a lot of stocking up in advance of tariffs, creating an inventory that\u2019s almost like a shock absorber to prevent some of the price changes,\u201d says Ales. \u201cBut eventually, that inventory runs out, and as companies get used to this new landscape, they\u2019ll begin to sit down and figure out how to adjust to it.\u201d",
      "Since tariffs are higher under the current Trump administration, brands need to find ways to pay increased duties while continuing to make a profit. Raising prices on their products, or adding an additional fee at checkout, is a route many will take. \u201cThe tariff needs to be absorbed by someone \u2014 is it the business or the consumer?,\u201d says Steinman. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly, but most likely, there will be some absorption occurring at the consumer level.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn terms of prices and costs going up, it appears that it\u2019s going to be almost universal,\u201d says Steinman. \u201cRight now, it seems like it\u2019s not going to be specific to any one category or industry.\u201d That said, price hikes will likely be the most noticeable among categories like groceries, vehicles and auto parts, clothing, shoes, electronics, appliances, furniture and home goods, says Porwal.",
      "There\u2019s no standard amount by which tariffs will raise prices on consumer goods, says Tala Akhavan, the COO of Pietra, an AI-powered sourcing platform that works with e-commerce brands. Companies large and small are approaching price hikes individually and using different strategies to adjust to their new reality. For example, some are splitting the burden of increased duties between customers and themselves, others are fully eating costs and finding new manufacturers, and a select few are putting all tariff fees onto customers, says Akhavan. The strategy a brand takes plays a large part in how much it increases its prices by.",
      "Long story short: consumers should expect to pay more for goods right now, says Akhavan. \u201cSo far, brands that are raising prices seem to be keeping them that way. There\u2019s so much opacity around how the tariff situation is going to play out, and as a bit of insurance, brands are keeping their prices elevated, especially since they\u2019re accepting the volatility around tariffs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say where tariffs are going to land in the long term, but for the most part, I don\u2019t see a world where we go back to exactly where we were.\u201d",
      "Yes, tariffs are likely to increase prices on products manufactured in the U.S. as well as overseas, says Ales. Many domestically-made goods rely on imported materials, packing and machinery, all of which cost more now.",

    "story": [
      "The unsolved fatal shootings of four teenage girls inside of a yogurt shop in Austin, Texas, more than three decades ago are getting a renewed spotlight in a new HBO docuseries.",
      "The first episode of \"The Yogurt Shop Murders\" premiered on Aug. 3, and shows how the unsolved murders of Eliza Thomas, Jennifer Harbison, Sarah Harbison and Amy Ayers in 1991 have continued to traumatize those close to the case.",
      "The series features archival footage from Austin filmmaker Claire Huie, who sat for interviews for the doc and described her work making a film about the case, though she never finished it.",
      "\"The yogurt shop murders was like a ghost story that people told,\" Huie said in the first episode. \"It was always told in hushed tones: 'This happened here.' Partly because nobody has all the details, also because it was never solved. This case was so big in Austin, it was exciting to work on a film about it, even if I didn't really know what I was doing.\"",
      "Investigators, the victims' families and the two men who served time for the crime \u2014 though their murder convictions were overturned and the murder charges against them were dismissed in 2009 \u2014 were also interviewed in the series.",
      "\"For one, it's been 30 years, seven months and five days and I still can't believe it,\" Bob Ayers, the father of victim Ayers said in the first episode of the doc.",

      "What is 'The Yogurt Shop Murders' About?",

      "The store was set on fire after the girls were killed, which damaged key evidence in the case, in addition to water damage from when firefighters arrived to put out the blaze, the Austin American-Statesman reported at the time.",
      "More than eight years after the killings, four people were arrested in connection with the teenagers' deaths in 1999, though only two of them were brought to trial: Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott.",
      "Springsteen and Scott were tried separately. Springsteen was convicted of murder in 2001, and Scott was convicted of murder in 2002, according to the Austin American-Statesman.",
      "Springsteen was sentenced to death and Scott was sentenced to life in prison, according to the Austin American-Statesman.",
      "A few years later, Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled Springsteen and Scott were unfairly denied the chance to cross-examine each other, and overturned their convictions, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "A judge later released both men on bond, and in 2009, prosecutors moved to dismiss all charges against Springsteen and Scott.",
      "Judge Mike Lynch dismissed the murder charges against the two men on Oct. 28, 2009, according to the AP. The murders of Jennifer and Sarah Harbison, Ayers and Thomas are still unsolved.",

      "\"And then 17 years earlier, a mother is in the Philadelphia airport and she tragically loses her child,\" she continues. \"It's how all these women's lives come together and collide, but it is a story that explores connection and the feeling of being seen \u2014 and not seen \u2014 when you are a teenager and when you're an adult, and it is about that yearning to belong.\"",
      "Nanami Strenner says the opening pages of the book were inspired by times she's been in foreign airports with her own daughter, and her fears of the worst case scenario.",
      "\"I've been in that situation so many times with my own daughter ... and I just remember being in really far flung countries where sometimes the people there didn't speak English, and I couldn't speak their language,\" Nanami Strenner says. \"It would be the most terrifying thing that she would get away from me and I wouldn't be able to do anything.\"",
      "\"I allowed myself to consider the worst case scenario in that which is what led me to the beginning of the novel,\" she adds. \"What if I was powerless and I didn't have language, and I had no means and ... I was in this situation where I was completely rendered helpless and unable to find the most precious thing in my life?\"",
      "Nanami Strenner says she began to get the idea for the full novel when she looked on how much time she's spent in airports in her own life, growing up in England before living in Japan, Vietnam and more, before landing in Philadelphia before the pandemic.",

      "\"This is the most disciplined I've ever been in my life, and it's sort of not been fully repeated since,\" she jokes.",
      "One of the themes Nanami Strenner hopes readers explore after finishing \"My Other Heart\" is the question of nature versus nurture.",
      "\"From a parental point of view, that\u2019s really interesting, because we know so much more now about the impact of parents on children as they grow up,\" she says. \"But also, ideal nature versus how everything else has shaped us, I think that\u2019s a really interesting idea. That\u2019s actually at the center of the book too.\"",
      "\"Kit, for example, is a product of the society that she\u2019s brought up in, but she knows the nature inside is slightly different, because she\u2019s had this ambiguity about her background,\" she continues. \"And I think that\u2019s something that people could really sink their teeth into.\"",

      "\u201c(Trauma) seems to be a theme for me, and I\u2019m not really sure why,\u201d Hewitt says. \u201cI seem to gravitate towards it. Or it seems to be my universal lesson. So I embrace it.\u201d",

      "\"I really did think about her a lot when I was narrating this,\" Hewitt says. \"My job in this was to not be on top of the story, or overdo the story, but to really just service these people's stories and endings, however sad they might be.

      "While she didn't explicitly seek out stories of trauma, she's found power in each story's message. And she describes connecting to these roles, specifically to women \"strong in their broken pieces,\" like it's a purpose, a calling.",
      "\"I think trauma has been seen as a weakness,\" Hewitt says. \"And I think my goal ... in being the narrator of this show and showing how these people have continued to live life because they got the chance to\u00a0\u2014 you know, trauma can also be a strength.\"",
      "\"I think it is a beautiful, beautiful vulnerability to be able to say, 'I have trauma, and I make it work for me every day,'\" she adds. \"'Trauma and I hold hands, and we walk right on through it.' ... Hopefully I'm able to show, yes, they get knocked down, but they also get right back up.\""

The \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\" star played Mary Todd Lincoln after Escola's departure in June until Monsoon's shows in August.",
      "\"I just truly believe the writing is so good that as long as you know what you're doing when it comes to comedy, you can come in and really own this role completely independently from the past performances,\" she says."

You let fear or lack of trust on that first step,\u2019 because y\u2019all I\u2019m not going to let social media do me, because if that were to happen and I fell, I would not be able to live that down for the next 20 years.\u201d",
      "Williams said the only aspect of the reunion performance she didn't like was her lack of trust in the steps, citing her experience starring in \u201cDeath Becomes Her\u201d for over a year between performances in Chicago and on Broadway in New York City.",

      "\u201cThe two roommates tried to accept the doll\u2019s spirit and please it only to have it reciprocate maliciousness and violent intent,\u201d the NESPR website says.",

      "A representative from the NESPR did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Rife's post about purchasing Ed and Lorraine Warren's home.",
      "What's Next for the Annabelle Doll?",
      "The Annabelle doll notably left the Warren house this year for the \u201cDevils on the Run Tour.\u201d The nationwide tour showed the Warrens\u2019 work and displayed Annabelle.",
      "During the tour, Dan Rivera, a paranormal investigator and handler for the Annabelle doll, died at 54 on July 13 in a Pennsylvania hotel. Adams County Chief Deputy Coroner Scott Pennewill noted \u201cnothing suspicious\u201d surrounded Rivera\u2019s death.",
      "Pennewill confirmed the Annabelle doll was not present at the scene, adding that Rivera was found alone. Rivera\u2019s cause of death has not been released, and at time, Pennewill said Rivera\u2019s autopsy results would likely be available within 60 to 90 days.",
      "The Annabelle doll is scheduled to appear at the Maine Paranormal & Horror Convention in Augusta on Sept. 6 and 7, per NESPR's website.",
      "After buying the Warrens\u2019 home, Rife and Castee, the doll\u2019s new \u201clegal guardians,\u201d said they plan to host \u201covernight stays and museum tours so you yourself can experience and learn all the haunted history surrounding this amazing place.\u201d",
      "In a livestream announcing their purchase, Castee walked through the museum for his social media followers and said he wants people to visit to capture any paranormal events to aid in research."

      "An attempt by Netanyahu\u2019s government to overhaul the judiciary in 2023 sparked months of mass protests, and many believe it weakened the country ahead of Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack later that year that triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a prominent watchdog group, said it filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court following Monday\u2019s vote. It said more than 15,000 citizens have joined the petition, calling the dismissal \u201cillegal\u201d and \u201cunprecedented.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the group accused the government of changing dismissal procedures only after failing to legally remove Baharav-Miara under the existing rules. It also cited a conflict of interest related to Netanyahu\u2019s ongoing trial.",
      "\u201cThis decision turns the role of the attorney general into a political appointment,\u201d the group said. \u201cThe legal battle will continue until this flawed decision is overturned.\u201d"

      "Israel announced last Sunday it would pause military activity in some areas to allow more aid into Gaza following international outrage over widespread starvation and deaths from malnutrition caused by the Israeli military\u2019s offensive and aid restrictions.",
      "But humanitarian organizations say the amount of aid that has entered the enclave is not enough, and without more food, growing numbers of Palestinians will die from hunger.",
      "NBC News takes a look at how much aid has entered Gaza in the week since Israel announced the new system, and how that stacks up to the needs of the population.",
      "A tally of aid",
      "Humanitarian aid is entering Gaza in three ways: airdrops, distribution by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and through the United Nations and other aid organizations\u2019 using the newly formed \u201chumanitarian corridors\u201d the Israeli military put in place last week.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which began distributing aid  in the enclave in late May, has been widely condemned for the hundreds of people killed, often by Israeli soldiers, near its aid sites, and for its limited distribution.",
      "Last Sunday, GHF distributed around 1 million meals and at least another 1.2 million from Monday to Wednesday, and 1.3 million on Thursday. GHF did not appear to publish the number of meals distributed on Friday, but on Saturday said it released at least 1.7 million meals.",
      "In a population of roughly 2 million people, that averages out to around half a meal to just under a full meal per person per day.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military branch responsible for overseeing aid into Gaza, said Sunday that a total of 1,200 aid trucks had entered the enclave over the past week and that the same number had been collected by the United Nations and other aid organizations. It said that \"hundreds of trucks remain inside Gaza\" and were still waiting to be picked up.",
      "Before Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza began, around 500 trucks carrying aid were entering the enclave daily, according to the British Red Cross and other organizations.",
      "The below graph shows how the amount of aid entering Gaza soared during the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas before it stopped during Israel's blockade, with only a trickle entering in the months after it was lifted.",
      "Asked for the number of trucks allowed into Gaza and collected by humanitarian groups on Friday and Saturday, COGAT did not immediately respond.",
      "While COGAT has shared information about trucks entering Gaza and being collected by aid groups on its social media pages over the past week, it has not updated its online dashboard for aid into Gaza since Monday, despite international focus on the matter.",
      "According to the World Food Program, only about two-thirds of the amount of food the U.N. organization has requested Israeli authorities allow into Gaza had been approved as of Thursday since the Israeli military began tactical pauses.",
      "How Israeli restrictions caused the hunger crisis",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza drastically worsened in March after Israel imposed a blockade barring the entry of aid into Gaza, in the midst of its ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "Israel lifted the crippling blockade in May, but for months, it has allowed only a limited amount of aid to enter the enclave, most of which has been distributed by the U.S.- and Israel-backed group known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "COGAT did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accusation that the amount of aid entering Gaza is not enough. It has previously accused humanitarian groups, including the United Nations, of exacerbating hunger by failing to collect and distribute aid to Palestinians fast enough.",
      "However, humanitarian organizations have said efforts to distribute the limited aid they\u2019ve been able to get into Gaza has been hampered by Israeli restrictions. They\u2019ve also emphasized that even after Israel vowed to lift some restrictions last Sunday, the amount of aid entering the enclave remains limited.",
      "Meanwhile WFP has said it needs faster approvals and clearances to move trucks inside Gaza safely, as well as for Israeli military members to adhere to the \u201cestablished rules of engagement,\u201d including having no armed presence or shooting near humanitarian convoys, food distributions and operations.",
      "What is needed?",
      "\u201cThis is not an adequate response,\u201d Jeanette Bailey, the International Rescue Committee\u2019s global practice lead and director of research for nutrition, said in a phone interview on Wednesday.",
      "A gradual entry of aid \u201chere or there,\u201d she said, \u201cis not going to be adequate to prevent us from entering into a full-blown famine where the numbers of deaths go way, way up.\u201d"

      "Blondie, a tourist favorite, was hunted down after being lured and baited out of Gwayi Conservancy, near Hwange National Park, according to the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting (CBTH), an advocacy organization based in the U.K.",
      "While lion hunting is not illegal in Zimbabwe, Blondie\u2019s killing was because he was under the country\u2019s minimum age of 6, according to Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves, the organization\u2019s founder.",
      "\u201cBlondie was a father, a leader, a national treasure, not a plaything for a rich Westerner with a gun,\u201d Gon\u00e7alves said. \u201cGovernments must act now.\u201d",

      "Africa Geographic\u2019s CEO, Simon Epsley, said the organization was \u201cdismayed and angered\u201d at the killing.",
      "\u201cThat Blondie\u2019s prominent collar did not prevent him from being offered to a hunting client confirms the stark reality that no lion is safe from trophy hunting guns,\u201d he said.",
      "Collars are used to track the animals, limit wildlife-human conflict and support conservation.",
      "Zimbabwean law allows a maximum of 100 lions above the age of 6 to be hunted each year in the country, where safaris and big game hunting are important sources of income.",
      "A spokesperson for the Zimbabwe Parks Agency, the government hunting regulator, denied that Blondie\u2019s killing had broken the law because he was older than 6.",
      "\u201cThis allegation that these people are saying the lion was less than 6 years? We don\u2019t know that. Was there any DNA which was taken to prove that the lion was less than 6 years? The answer is definitely no,\u201d Tinashe Farawo told NBC News.",
      "This claim was backed up by Michael Blignaut, co-owner of Victoria Falls Safari Service, the company allegedly behind the killing of Blondie.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately at this time I cannot comment,\u201d he told NBC News via the WhatsApp messaging service. \u201cI wanna assure you the hunt was done ethically and it was legal.\u201d",
      "The identity of the hunter, who presumptively paid thousands of dollars to kill the lion, has not been released.",
      "But Farawo denied that anything illegal happened, and said these sorts of hunts paid for conservation efforts.",

      "In 2015, Minnesota dentist Walter James Palmer sparked outrage when he admittedly killed Cecil the Lion after paying $50,000 for the experience.",
      "At the time, Palmer said he had the correct permits, worked with local guides, and had no reason to question the legitimacy of the hunt until after it was over.",
      "Zimbabwean authorities charged Theo Bronchorst, a professional hunter who allegedly took Palmer on the hunt, but later dropped them. Cecil was also being tracked by researchers at the University of Oxford\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit.",

      "Plastic production is on course to triple by 2060, less than 10% of it is recycled, and around 8,000 megatons now pollute the planet, according to a review of recent studies published Sunday by The Lancet.",
      "This causes harm at every stage of its lifecycle: from the extraction of fossil fuels and production, to its use by humans and eventual disposal into the environment, the British publication said.",
      "\u201cPlastics are a grave, growing, and under-recognised danger to human and planetary health,\u201d it said. \u201cPlastics cause disease and death from infancy to old age\u201d and are \u201ccontributing to climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss.\u201d",
      "These harms \u201cfall disproportionately upon low-income and at-risk populations,\u201d it added.",
      "This is the latest dire warning by experts about the ubiquity and threat posed by plastic, which journal called \u201cthe defining material of our age.\u201d After decades of scientists warning about plastic being found in the oceans and rivers, microplastics are now being discovered inside humans \u2014 including in breast milk and brain tissue.",
      "Sunday\u2019s release marked the start of a new monitoring system called \u201cThe Lancet Countdown on health and plastics,\u201d which it says will track political attempts to combat the problem.",
      "It was launched to coincide with the latest and final round of talks in Geneva, Switzerland, where 175 countries are trying to forge the world\u2019s first Global Plastics Treaty.",
      "Campaigners hope the talks, starting Tuesday through Aug. 14, will result in mandatory targets for reducing plastic production. A group of countries, including China, Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia, have so far opposed these measures, instead lobbying for increased plastic recycling instead.",
      "According to The Lancet, such petrochemical giants are a \u201ckey driver\u201d of spiraling plastic production, as they pivot their businesses toward plastic in response to the global decline in demand for fossil energy.",
      "Different plastics are made from up to 16,000 chemicals, which \u201center the human body via ingestion, inhalation, and dermal absorption,\u201d often from food and drink containers and packaging, the study said.",
      "Unborn babies, infants and young children are \u201cespecially at risk,\u201d with harms including miscarriage, physical malformations, reduced cognitive function and diabetes, it said. For adults, the risks include cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer.",
      "\u201cGiven the considerable gaps in knowledge of plastic chemicals, it is reasonable to conclude that the full extent of these chemicals\u2019 harms to health is underestimated and that the burden of disease currently attributed to them is undercounted,\u201d it added.",
      "The Lancet quoted one study estimating the global costs of these diseases as $1.5 trillion.",
      "\u201cIt is now clear that the world cannot recycle its way out of the plastic pollution crisis,\u201d The Lancet said. \u201cControl of the plastics crisis will require continuing research coupled with the science-driven interventions \u2014 laws, policies, monitoring, enforcement, incentives, and innovations.\u201d"

      "Yu was part of the Chinese team that took bronze in the women\u2019s 4x200-meter freestyle relay, with the United States winning silver and Australia winning gold. Though she did not compete in the final, she received a medal because she swam in the qualifying race.",
      "\u201cI was really excited to join the relay. It felt great,\u201d Yu told reporters Thursday. \u201cThe World Championships are fun, and I hope to swim faster.\u201d",
      "The Chinese prodigy began swimming around age 6 just to beat the heat in her home province of Hebei. She said she never thought about becoming a professional athlete until a coach approached her at a swimming pool one day.",
      "\u201cAt the time, I thought: why not give training a try?\u201d Yu told Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency, in May.",

      "Hailed as the world\u2019s greatest swimmer her age, Yu has been compared to phenoms such as Canada\u2019s Summer McIntosh, who won four golds in Singapore including the 400-meter medley. Though Yu came in fourth, she is already swimming that event about 15 seconds faster than McIntosh was at the same age.",
      "Her stunning performance before she\u2019s even a teenager has many wondering how she might shape competitive swimming in the years to come.",
      "But some Chinese sports fans and commentators have urged the public not to overhype the preteen rising star.",
      "Yu\u2019s sudden fame may expose her to \u201cdisproportionate\u201d pressure that could keep her from achieving her full potential, the state-backed digital news outlet Shanghai Observer said in an editorial Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe must let this 12-year-old grow her splash slowly into a wave,\u201d it said, adding that there is \u201cno need to rush into hero worship.\u201d",
      "The warning hinted at a shift in how China promotes its elite athletes in the wake of persistent doping allegations and what has been criticized as a \u201ctoxic\u201d fan culture.",
      "Success at the highest levels of sport has been central to China\u2019s construction of national identity, with the government focused on  dominating medal tables at the Olympics and other events.",
      "But the push for gold medals also puts a lot of stress on the countries\u2019 star athletes, as does the intensity of public scrutiny.",
      "Organized sports fandom first emerged around 2016 when Chinese social media users, jaded by sex scandals that had tarnished the wholesome image of pop stars they previously adored, began following Olympic athletes instead, said Zhang Bin, a veteran sports commentator in China.",
      "The new fans brought \u201csophisticated strategies\u201d from the entertainment industry, setting off \u201cfandom wars\u201d among different groups that tried to outdo each other in supporting their athletes, Zhang said.",
      "China\u2019s extreme sports fan culture, which can include fan mobs, cyberbullying of athletes and heckling behavior at sports events, was especially visible around the Paris Olympics last year.",
      "When gold-medal-winning diver Quan Hongchan returned to her hometown, visitors flocked to her home for days. Some livestreamed with their phones while others flew drones, and travel agencies even started offering tours of her village.",
      "Pan Zhanle, an Olympic champion swimmer, was praised for disbanding his official fan group after his success at the Paris Games overwhelmed him with a surge of new followers.",
      "The Chinese government has been cracking down, with its cyberspace watchdog saying in April that it had shut down over 3,700 social media accounts with illegal or noncompliant content aimed at Chinese athletes.",

      "\u201cThat last 100 was pretty stressful,\u201d Ledecky said. \u201cLani was and Summer was right there.\u201d",
      "Ledecky clocked in at 8:05.62, Pallister at 8:05.98 and McIntosh 8:07.29. It was by far the closest worlds win of Ledecky's seven in the 800 free.",
      "A disappointed McIntosh said she didn\u2019t swim as well as she wanted to, but will turn the page and concentrate on her next race, in the 400 individual medley.",
      "\"So it's just the beginning and I know I have lots of time in my career to do better at it,\" she told the CBC.",
      "McIntosh vowed to use Saturday's disappointment as fuel for future 800-meter efforts.",
      "\"I really wanted to swim my own race and I didn't do that,\" said McIntosh, who congratulated Ledecky and called her an \u201cinspiration of mine.\u201d",
      "\"I think what I did tonight actually makes me want to keep doing it more, to see how much better I can get at it because I know I can be way faster than I was tonight.\"",
      "The suburban Washington, D.C., native Ledecky said she's now looking forward to some time off, time with loved ones and a few dips in the pool she swam in as a youngster.",
      "\"I'm looking forward to that,\" she said. \"It's home to me but I'm with the people that I love, around the pool.\"",
      "The niece of New York Islanders co-owner Jon Ledecky has also been dominating the 800 free at the Olympics, having won gold in this race at the 2012 Games in London, 2016 in Rio, 2021 in Tokyo and last summer near Paris.",
      "She\u2019s the only woman to win the same individual event at four Olympics, in any sport. The only other swimmer to pull off such a four-peat was American legend Michael Phelps, who took the 200 individual medley in 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016.",
      "At age 28, Ledecky was the field's oldest swimmer, and she outdueled her youngest and most fierce competitor, the 18-year-old Toronto native McIntosh.",
      "Ledecky\u2019s air of 800 invincibility was dented last year when a 17-year-old McIntosh beat the American at the Southern Zone South Sectional Championships in Orlando, Florida, on Feb. 8.",
      "The Canadian prodigy opted against swimming in the 800 in France to concentrate on other events. She took gold in the 200 butterfly, 200 individual medley and 400 individual medley to become one of the breakout stars of last summer.",
      "If McIntosh takes on the 800 free in Los Angeles, Saturday\u2019s race offered a tantalizing preview of what could be in store for 2028."

      "Weeks of rising anger over Palestinians starving due to Israel's offensive and aid restrictions had reached all the way to the White House, with President Donald Trump lamenting the sight of emaciated children on the brink of starvation.",
      "On Friday, his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, entered Gaza in a rare visit by high-level U.S. officials to the besieged enclave.",
      "Accompanied by the Israeli military, Witkoff visited an aid distribution site in southern Gaza run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, where hundreds of Palestinians waited desperately behind barbed wire for food.",
      "\u201cIncredible feat!\u201d Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, who accompanied Witkoff, said in a post on X on Friday, after touring GHF's operations and speaking to \"folks on the ground.\"",
      "Palestinians and others inside Gaza have criticized the visit as a public relations stunt for GHF, whose aid distribution process has been marked by chaos, looting and deadly shootings, often by Israeli soldiers, that have killed hundreds of hungry Palestinians seeking aid.",
      "\u201cIt was a PR stunt, a controlled visit supervised and dictated by the Israeli military,\u201d Ellie Burgos, an American critical care nurse volunteering at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, told NBC News' crew on the ground. \u201cWhat they saw was not the reality.\u201d",
      "Burgos had earlier called for Witkoff to visit Gaza, urging him to witness the conditions on the ground for himself, but felt his limited tour did little to change the situation on the ground.",
      "\u201cFood is still incredibly difficult to find, people are still being shot at aid distribution sites, and violence continues,\u201d she said.",
      "On the day of the visit, at least 92 people were killed on Friday across Gaza, including 51 people who were seeking aid, Dr. Mohammed Saqr, director of nursing at Nasser Hospital, told NBC News.",
      "Mohamed Saddak, 47, who was hoping to collect food for his family of nine, told NBC News' crew that tanks had advanced toward him and others as they sought to receive aid.",
      "\u201cThey are constantly shooting at us,\u201d he said, \u201cfiring from tanks, and sometimes by drones.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News on the shootings at aid sites following Witkoff's visit.",
      "Israeli officials continued to deny claims of widespread hunger inside Gaza, though in a sign of shifting discourse, top U.S. officials have begun to acknowledge the crisis.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got little kids who are clearly starving to death,\u201d Vice President JD Vance told reporters on Monday.",
      "In a post on X, Witkoff said the visit's purpose was to give Trump a \"clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza.\"",
      "After Gaza, Witkoff on Saturday visited Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, where families of Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas were demanding that the Israeli government secure a deal to release the remaining hostages. Fifty hostages remain in Gaza, about 20 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "According to a statement by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, Witkoff told them, \u201cWe will get your children home and hold Hamas responsible for any bad acts on their part.\u201d He added, \u201cWe will do what\u2019s right for the Gazan people.\u201d",
      "The protests came after a video of an Israeli hostage in Gaza, Rom Braslavski, was released by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad on Thursday. A day later, Hamas released a video of another Israeli hostage, Evyatar David, showing him alive but frail. It is unclear when the videos were filmed.",
      "\u201cWe cannot endure even one more minute without bringing him home,\u201d Braslavski\u2019s cousin Adam Hajaj said in a statement. \u201cThis video tore my family apart!\u201d",
      "Huckabee, meanwhile, hailed GHF's distribution of over a million meals a day, which at Gaza's population of roughly 2 million people averages to half a meal per person per day.",
      "GHF stepped in to distribute food in the weeks after Israel lifted its nearly three-month total blockade on all food and supplies entering the enclave. But the aid GHF distributed, alongside some limited quantities by other international organizations, fell far short of the needs of the population. Last Sunday, Israel said it was expanding aid access into Gaza after outrage mounted over the widespread starvation and surging deaths from malnutrition.",
      "GHF runs four aid sites in Gaza, and even though it claims independence from any government, it runs the sites inside Israel's militarized zone with the backing of the Israeli military.",
      "Witnesses and aid agencies have decried the aid delivery process, which, according to the U.N., has resulted in deaths of nearly 1,400 people while collecting aid, including 859 in the vicinity of the GHF sites.",
      "The Israeli military and the GHF have acknowledged that some shots have been fired but said only as warnings.",
      "\u201cUS-backed Israeli forces and private contractors have put in place a flawed, militarized aid distribution system that has turned aid distributions into regular bloodbaths,\u201d New York-based Human Rights Watch said Friday.",
      "Burgos' colleague, Dr. Tom Adamkiewicz, urged the diplomats to see \"what\u2019s happening to the children, the families, to these young boys and women and men that are being basically shot at like rabbits.\""

    "story": [
      "BOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Former Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe was sentenced Friday to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery in a historic case that gripped the South American nation and tarnished the conservative strongman\u2019s legacy.",
      "The sentence, which Uribe said will be appealed, followed a nearly six-month trial in which prosecutors presented evidence that he attempted to influence witnesses who accused the law-and-order leader of having links to a paramilitary group in the 1990s.",
      "\u201cPolitics prevailed over the law in sentencing,\u201d Uribe said after Friday\u2019s hearing.",
      "Uribe, 73, has denied any wrongdoing. He faced up to 12 years in prison after being convicted Monday.",
      "His attorney had asked the court to allow Uribe to remain free while he appeals the verdict. Judge Sandra Heredia on Friday said she did not grant the defense\u2019s request because it would be \u201ceasy\u201d for the former president to leave the country to \u201cevade the imposed sanction.\u201d",
      "Heredia also banned Uribe from holding public office for eight years and fined him about $776,000.",
      "Ahead of Friday\u2019s sentencing, Uribe posted on X that he was preparing arguments to support his appeal. He added that one must \u201cthink much more about the solution than the problem\u201d during personal crises.",
      "The appeals court will have until early October to issue a ruling, which either party could then challenge before Colombia\u2019s Supreme Court.",
      "The former president governed from 2002 to 2010 with strong support from the United States. He is a polarizing figure in Colombia, where many credit him for saving the country from becoming a failed state, while others associate him with human rights violations and the rise of paramilitary groups in the 1990s.",
      "Heredia on Monday said she had seen enough evidence to determine that Uribe conspired with a lawyer to coax three former paramilitary group members, who were in prison, into changing testimony they had provided to Ivan Cepeda, a leftist senator who had launched an investigation into Uribe\u2019s alleged ties to a paramilitary group.",
      "Uribe in 2012 filed a libel suit against Cepeda in the Supreme Court. But in a twist, the high court in 2018 dismissed the accusations against Cepeda and began investigating Uribe.",
      "Martha Pe\u00f1uela Rosales, a supporter of Uribe\u2019s party in the capital, Bogota, said she wept and prayed after hearing of the sentence. \u201cIt\u2019s an unjust sentence. He deserves to be free,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Sergio Andr\u00e9s Parra, who protested against Uribe outside the courthouse, said the 12-year sentence \u201cis enough\u201d and, even if the former president appeals, \u201chistory has already condemned him.\u201d",
      "During Uribe\u2019s presidency, Colombia\u2019s military attained some of its biggest battlefield victories against Latin America\u2019s oldest leftist insurgency, pushing the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia into remote pockets and forcing the group\u2019s leadership into peace talks that led to the disarmament of more than 13,000 fighters in 2016."

    "story": [
      "As deaths from starvation in the Gaza Strip continue to rise, experts say there\u2019s no easy way out of the crisis due to the medical complexity of treating severe malnutrition.",
      "More than 160 people \u2014 at least 90 of them children \u2014 have died of malnutrition since the war began, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry.",
      "The world\u2019s leading body on hunger, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), says that nearly all of Gaza is suffering a food security crisis or worse, and more than half of the population is in the \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201ccatastrophe\u201d phase of starvation \u2014 which means recovering isn\u2019t as simple as giving starving people food.",
      "Rather, giving food to people experiencing such an extreme degree of starvation could kill them, experts say.",
      "\u201cIf you do what the body wants to do, which is to just drink and eat as much as possible the minute you see food, you can actually create these permanent imbalances that can cause things like heart failure or organ damage, because the body had to adapt to get to that starvation mode,\u201d NBC News medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel, an internal medicine doctor, said.",
      "At the most severe stages of starvation, even giving a person water can push their body into failure, Patel said.",
      "What happens to the body when it\u2019s starving?",
      "Humans can generally go without any food or water for several days because the body finds a way to adapt in order to survive. First by feeding off of so-called glycogen stores \u2014 a starchy substance from carbohydrates that\u2019s stored in the liver and muscles. The body stores about 1,700 to 2,200 calories\u2019 worth of energy as glycogen.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the first thing your body goes for that can get you through without eating or any water for about several days, in some cases, maybe a little longer,\u201d Patel said.",
      "Once those glycogen stores are depleted, the body starts to break down fat for energy, but when that\u2019s gone, it turns to muscle. This is what causes the body to shrink and the starving person to assume a gaunt, hollow-cheeked look.Eventually the brain doesn\u2019t have the energy it needs to function, leading to irritability, mood swings and trouble concentrating.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to even just make sound judgments,\u201d Patel said. \u201cYou can see people have psychotic illusions. You can see people hearing things. All of that is basically the body\u2019s way of surviving.\u201d",
      "Most starving people die from infections as their immune system shuts down. Eventually, the heart will be affected, causing a person\u2019s blood pressure and pulse to drop. If they don\u2019t die from infection, the heart will shut down, doctors said.",
      "The more vulnerable parts of the population are likely to suffer the most. \u201cChildren \u2014 specifically infants \u2014 pregnant women, the elderly and people with certain kinds of chronic illness are the risk groups that we need to pay special attention to,\u201d said Dr. Irwin Redlener, a clinical professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.",
      "How is starvation treated?",
      "Patel said a good analogy to giving food to a starving person is a downpour after a drought. The land desperately needs water, but because it\u2019s so dry it repels water instead of absorbing it, leading to flash flooding. \u201cRefeeding\u201d after starvation needs to be managed clinically and by medical professionals.",
      "\u201cWhen a person has reached a state of starvation, the body undergoes extreme metabolic changes,\u201d she said. \u201cGiving too much food \u2014 or the wrong kind \u2014 too quickly can trigger a dangerous shift in fluids and electrolytes known as refeeding syndrome, which can be fatal if not carefully managed.\u201d",
      "\u201cA bag of flour \u2014 some of the only food aid that has gotten in recently \u2014 won\u2019t save anyone because it has none of the essential nutrients,\u201d said Dr. Nour Alamassi, a doctor and the medical team lead for Project HOPE, an international nongovernmental organization focused on global health and humanitarian aid.",
      "\u201cToo many carbs can actually be life-threatening for anyone with Severe Acute Malnourishment (SAM), and even for the average person in Gaza who has not had a regular diet in many months, it is very difficult to digest,\u201d Alamassi, who is caring for children and pregnant women in Gaza, wrote in an email.",
      "Ideally, doctors told NBC News, there would be enough medical staff to monitor the refeeding process for each person for a period stretching from weeks to even months. Children would be stabilized with fortified milks, which contain the nutrients that a malnourished child needs, and something called ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF), which are energy-dense, easy to digest and carefully balanced in the nutrients children need to start to recover. Doctors would draw blood to monitor sodium and potassium levels \u2014 if these electrolytes are too low or too high, it can be deadly.",
      "But the situation on the ground in Gaza is far from ideal. There are not enough doctors, not enough supplies and not the right supplies, experts say.",
      "\u201cThe aid blockade has prevented us from accessing the medications and nutrition supplies that are necessary to treat these people,\u201d Alamassi said. \u201cWe recently ran out of High Energy Biscuits (HEB) in our clinics, which really limits our ability to help patients. We hope to get more in the coming days, but each day without these supplies can make a major difference for a patient\u2019s outcome.\u201d",
      "What are the long-term effects of starvation?",
      "Even if refeeding is successful, people who survive starvation can experience physical and psychological effects for the rest of their lives, experts said. The damage, especially for young and very old victims, is permanent.",
      "In children, malnutrition can cause delays in both physical and cognitive development. Physically, they\u2019re more likely to have weakened immune systems, leading to a harder time recovering from infections. Malnourished children are also more likely to experience stunted growth, which can affect their height, muscle mass and bone density and even delay puberty, experts said.",
      "Cognitively, children can suffer from permanent brain damage due to iron and zinc deficiencies, affecting their ability to learn and problem solve.",
      "Alamassi said the hunger crisis in Gaza is affecting \u201can entire generation of children who will suffer lifelong consequences.\u201dThe recovery of adults from very severe malnutrition is not only possible, but likely, Redlener said.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s done right, most adults, unless they\u2019re really at a terminal stage of undernutrition, the refeeding will result in restoration of everything \u2014 a far different story than the ability for a young child with prolonged malnutrition, where it\u2019s often impossible to get a full recovery,\u201d he said.",
      "Patel said even people with a history of malnutrition are monitored over years to make sure their bodies are functioning properly.",
      "\u201cAs they age and develop, different parts of the body pull on memories of that nutrition depletion,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the question we all have to ask ourselves is, how long are we going to be able to do this without having adequate support on the ground?\u201d"

      "The Toronto native and daughter of 1984 Canadian Olympic swimmer Jill Horstead is committed to swimming the 800 in Los Angeles and Saturday's splash against Ledecky could serve as a tantalizing preview of that potential Olympics clash.",
      "Ledecky has shown no signs of slowing down. Earlier this week, she scooped up gold in the 1,500 free, in addition to that 400 free bronze and silver in the 4x200 free relay.",
      "McIntosh has already bagged three world golds this week in that 400 free, 200 IM and 200 fly."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, made an extremely rare visit to Gaza on Friday amid the spiraling hunger crisis in the enclave under Israel's deadly offensive and aid restrictions.",
      "The pair visited an aid distribution site in Rafah run by the controversial U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has for months overseen the majority of aid distribution in the enclave under a new system launched in May.",
      "\"Today, we spent over five hours inside Gaza,\" Witkoff said in a post on X. He said they spent that time \"level setting the facts on the ground, assessing conditions,\" and meeting with GHF and other agencies.",
      "\"The purpose of the visit was to give @POTUS a clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza,\" he said.",
      "Huckabee said in a separate post that he had joined Witkoff on the visit to \"learn the truth\" about aid sites run by GHF. He said they also received briefings from the Israeli military and \"spoke to folks on the ground.\" It was not immediately clear whom he was referring to.",
      "In a post on X sharing images of the delegation in Gaza, he hailed the number of meals distributed by GHF \u2014 \"more than one million meals a day\" as an \"incredible feat.\"",
      "GHF has been predominantly responsible for the distribution of aid in Gaza since late May, when Israel said it would allow a basic amount of humanitarian supplies into the enclave after lifting a crippling blockade that barred the entry of food and other vital items for more than two months.",
      "Israel on Sunday announced measures to allow more aid into Gaza amid mounting global outrage over rising deaths from starvation. Since then, GHF has continued to distribute about 1.2 million meals a day, according to data shared by the organization. In a population of roughly 2.1 million people, that equates to just over half a meal per person per day on average.",
      "Humanitarian groups have said the aid that has so far been allowed into Gaza over the past week is not enough to stave off famine in the enclave.",
      "They have also condemned incidents in which hundreds of Palestinians have been killed while trying to reach aid in the weeks since the new distribution system came into effect.",
      "Since late May, more than 1,300 Palestinians have been killed while seeking food, with 859 deaths \"in the vicinity\" of GHF sites and 514 along the routes of food convoys,\" the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, or OHCHR, said in a news release Thursday. It said most of the killings were committed by the Israeli military.",
      "Witkoff and Huckabee made the trip as part of an effort by Washington to secure a plan to see more food delivered to Gaza as deaths from starvation in the enclave continue to rise, according to the White House.",
      "It was not clear how arrangements for the visit, including the meetings with local Palestinians in Gaza, were being arranged, with Israel having maintained strict control over access to Gaza throughout the war, barring international media and foreign officials from entering the territory independently.",
      "Basem Naim, a senior political official for Hamas, condemned the visit, writing in a statement addressed to Witkoff: \"Gaza is not Animal Farm that needs a theatrical personal visit to take some pictures in front of the #Death_Factories that your American companies manage in collaboration with the fascist army of Israel.\"",
      "The trip comes as a growing number of Palestinians continue to die from starvation despite months of warnings from humanitarian groups about the impact of Israel\u2019s offensive and the strict aid restrictions it has upheld.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Witkoff and Huckabee would brief Trump \"immediately after their visit to approve a final plan for food and aid distribution into the region.\"",
      "She said more details would be forthcoming once the plan was \"approved and agreed on by the president of the United States.\"",
      "Their visit to Gaza comes after Witkoff traveled to Israel and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Thursday to address the dire humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave.",
      "Trump said earlier this week that \"real starvation\" was taking place, citing images he had seen on TV in a break with Netanyahu, who has denied there is starvation in the enclave and sought to blame Hamas for the crisis."

    "story": [
      "Russia claimed Thursday to have captured a key Ukrainian town after more than 16 months of intense fighting and unleashed a deadly seven-hour drone assault on Kyiv that offered no hint of its agreeing to President Donald Trump's demands to end its war.",

      "It was not immediately possible to independently verify either side's statements.",
      "Dva Mayora, a Russian pro-war channel with 1.2 million subscribers on the messaging service Telegram, said the capture \"goes against Trump's political dancing.\"",

      "But Sergey Markov, a former adviser to Putin who is now a pro-Kremlin commentator, said the town had \"no strategic significance\" and instead illustrated \"how this war can go on for many more years.\"",
