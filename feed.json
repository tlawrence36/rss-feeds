    "summary": "If Neko Case had one word to describe her first solo album in seven years, it would be &ldquo;formidable.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "If Neko Case had one word to describe her first solo album in seven years, it would be \u201cformidable.\u201d",
      "If Neko Case had just one word to describe her first solo album in seven years, she would settle on \u201cformidable.\u201d",
      "Fair enough. Writers have twisted themselves into knots trying to describe Case's sound \u2014 \u201cgothic Americana\u201d is one iteration \u2014 yet it's generally a thrill ride through shifting tones and tempos, anchored by her vivid imagery and titanic voice.",
      "On the \u201cNeon Grey Midnight Green\u201d album, Case was intent on inviting a large number of musicians to join her, and their power is evident. She employs a 16-piece orchestra. Add in 10 other listed players (including herself) and that makes for 26 musicians on the album-ending song \u201cMatch-Lit\u201d alone.",
      "\u201cI wanted to remind people of what it sounded like to have a large group of people playing together,\u201d Case said. \u201cThat doesn't mean I have anything against synthesizer string sections or horn sections, because those things sound cool when you use them in the right way. And having a whole orchestra is cost prohibitive, especially now. I really wanted to do it because I didn't think I'd have the chance to do it again.\u201d",
      "Maybe it\u2019s not a wall of sound, but the swirling strings on \u201cWreck,\u201d for example, take her music to a joyful place. Listen carefully for the harp.",
      "It wasn't writer's block that kept Case out of the picture for a few years. The pandemic was an interruption for everybody. The Vermont-based singer also records and tours with the band The New Pornographers. She has written the music for an upcoming stage adaptation of \u201cThelma & Louise.\u201d And she also wrote a memoir, \u201cThe Harder I Fight the More I Love You,\u201d published earlier this year.",
      "The book describes a harrowing upbringing, mostly in the Pacific Northwest by parents who conceived her as teenagers and were unprepared and uninterested in raising her. Case says at one point, she was told her mother had died, only to have her show up again a year and a half later with no explanation.",
      "Case was essentially on her own by the time she was a teenager. Music, to a great extent, saved her.",
      "The on-again, off-again relationship with her mother is off. \u201cI don't even know anything about my mother anymore,\u201d Case said.",
      "Pain doesn't disappear, though. \u201cFrom her I learned to be cruel,\u201d Case sings in new song \u201cAn Ice Age.\u201d \u201cI learned the look that goes right past the ones who love you as if there's no one standing there.\u201d",
      "What will be interesting in coming months, as she prepares to take new songs on the road, is whether opening her life to the world with the memoir will draw more people to her music. Her management has seen preliminary signs that it has, but Case isn't sure.",
      "Colin Dickerman, editor-in-chief at Grand Central Publishing and editor of Case's book, has a hunch that it will. From reading reviews of the memoir, he knows it attracted fans who wanted to learn more about the writer of songs they loved. But it also reached people who were interested in the story about overcoming adversity and subsequently said they would check out her music.",
      "\u201cI think it really did reach a bigger audience,\u201d Dickerman said.",

      "Two of Case's new songs honor friends, both musicians, who died recently. One is for Dexter Romweber of the Flat Duo Jets, whose songs inspired her to make music before he later became a friend and collaborator. Dallas Good, late singer of The Sadies, who played with Case early in her career, is the inspiration for \u201cMatch-Lit.\u201d",
      "The latter, a detailed description of what happens when a match is lit, illustrates Case's often intriguing pathways to songs; she memorably once wrote from the point of view of a tornado. \u201cI don't do it purposely to try and be weird,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm just a noticer, a chronic noticer.\u201d",
      "Sometimes it's up to the listener to determine what a song means to them, rather than try to figure out what Case specifically meant.",
      "\u201cThere's a bit of, not withholding, but leaving space for people to come into the song and wear it like it's theirs and for them to make associations about their own lives, to make it about themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the songs that meant a lot to me, or did when I was younger. I want the listener to feel invited into it.\u201d",
      "On \u201cRusty Mountain,\u201d Case sings about how writing love songs is mostly \u201can exercise in futility for me.\u201d Slowly it dawns on you that you're listening to a love song. Similarly, \u201cWreck\u201d \u2014 with the memorable line \u201cI'm a meteor shattering around you\u201d \u2014 suggests Case protests a bit too much.",
      "\u201cThere's all different kinds of love on there,\u201d she said. \u201cI think pretty much every song, save maybe one, is a love song \u2014 about music or musicians or specific people here or there. There are love songs about other things, rather than just heterosexual love, which is the thing people write about most of all.",
      "\u201cIt's difficult to avoid cliches when you're writing love songs,\u201d she said, \u201cand the people who are good at it are so good at it that you're like, \u2018why bother?\u2019 I always think about Louie Armstrong singing, \u2018If I Could Be With You,\u2019 and I think, \u2018is there a better love song than that?\u2019 I don't think so. Or his version of \u2018I Can\u2019t Give You Anything But Love.' The bar of people who write love songs is so high that I kind of feel daunted by it.\u201d",
      "She knows enough people who are gay or gender-nonconforming who don't hear love songs they can relate to. That's a challenge she accepts.",
      "\u201cIt made me want to make sure there was room for people, no matter who these people were, to wear the song like a punk rock vest and to feel held onto and comforted,\u201d she said.",

      "Brett Goldstein might want to break your heart. Or at least give you a proper ugly cry.",
      "In the new film \u201cAll of You,\u201dstreaming on Apple TV+ Friday, audiences are presented with a sticky conundrum: What if your soulmate, and your best friend, were different people?",
      "Reactions might differ about the choices Simon (Goldstein) and Laura (Imogen Poots) make in the film, which is a kind of rom-com-dram, if you will. But one thing Goldstein has noticed is that a lot of people who see it think that it\u2019s about them.",
      "\u201cI think everyone has this friendship,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s someone in their life that is not their partner that they have a connection that feels more than friends, but what is that? What is love? And does it take away from the other? We just wanted to explore all of that over time.\u201d",
      "The idea came out of a getting to know you conversation with William Bridges, an Emmy winner for \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d whose episodes include \u201cUSS Callister.\" He co-wrote the film with Goldstein, and directed. At the time of the chat, Goldstein was single. Bridges was not. And Goldstein asked him if the woman he was seeing was \u201cthe one.\u201d It got them thinking about the idea of a soulmate test, something that could just take all the guesswork, all the bad dates, all the lost time, out of the equation.",
      "\u201cAll of You\u201d begins with a moment of truth as Simon accompanies Laura, his best friend from university, on her way to take the test. He even pays for it, and soon enough she\u2019s off making plans with a husband to be.",
      "Though the film has a bit of a science fiction element to it, it\u2019s decidedly less dystopian than a \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d Some, like Laura, take the test. Some, like Simon, try to do it the old-fashioned way. But many are left wondering if they made the right choice. The film is told linearly, but skips over months and sometimes years in the saga of Laura and Simon.",

And I don\u2019t think you can vilify a person for sort of having them. It\u2019s just when they follow through it obviously complicates things.\u201d",

      "While movie fans might bemoan the lack of the Nora Ephron-style romantic comedies of the 1990s on our screens, modern movies are grappling with the state of relationships in serious, satirical and genre-skewing ways, with films like \u201cMaterialists,\u201d\u201cSplitsville,\u201d \u201cAll of You\u201d and more. The distinction, Bridges said, is perhaps audiences today are craving stories not about aspirational, unattainable romance, but about love \u2014 however complicated and messy it might be.",
      "\u201cWe have seen the movie where somebody runs to the train station at the end and confesses undying love and the movie ends and the idea is they live happily ever after. But I\u2019m not quite sure that that\u2019s the experience of love that a lot of people have,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cI think they\u2019re looking for love stories rather than romance stories.\u201d",

      "Attorneys for the family of the a man who died after riding a roller coaster at Universal Orlando Resort believe he hit his head on a restraint",
      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Attorneys for the family of a man who died last week after riding a roller coaster at Universal Orlando Resort's newest theme park said Monday that they believe he smacked his head on a restraint during downward thrusts and was unconscious for most of the ride.",
      "The attorneys for the family of Kevin Rodriguez Zavala, 32, said the fact that he had a spinal disability from birth and used a wheelchair played no role in his death, and he had no medical issues before getting on the Stardust Racers ride at Epic Universe. At a news conference in Orlando, the lawyers also took issue with a top Universal executive last weekend saying in a note to employees that \u201cinternal findings\u201d showed the ride worked as it should have.",
      "\u201cThey are quick to say that, \u2018Well, the ride functioned as it was supposed to. Everything works properly.\u2019 Well, just because it didn\u2019t malfunction does not lead us to believe that there were not safety issues because we know something caused him to die,\u201d said famed civil rights attorney Ben Crump, whose law firm is representing the family.",
      "Zavala's family described him as a theme park enthusiast and a gamer with friends worldwide from gaming. He treasured his independence and drove and cooked for himself. He also worked as an employment counselor for people with disabilities, helping them land jobs and then checking on them once they started working. His parents said they never treated him any differently than his sister and brother because of his disability.",
      "\u201cHe was an extraordinary young man,\u201d said his father, Carlos Rodriguez.",
      "Karen Irwin, Universal Orlando Resort\u2019s president, said in her note that the internal findings showed ride systems functioned normally, equipment was intact and Universal workers followed the proper procedures. Investigators with the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said last Friday that their initial findings align with that of the theme park.",

      "Natalie Jackson, another of the family's attorneys, said they believe Zavala suffered repeated head strikes based on what witnesses have said. The family's attorneys said they have opened a line of communication with Universal officials, as the family seeks a full investigation into what happened and desires that the ride remain shuttered until there's an understanding of how Zavala died. They also are hiring a team of experts in ride design, safety, manufacturing and operations to guide their own investigation.",

      "Lear deBessonet, the new artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, has chosen \u201cRagtime\u201d as her first show",
      "NEW YORK -- When Lear deBessonet, the incoming artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, was thinking about what should be her first show as its new leader, she landed on something sweeping, very American \u2014 and some unfinished business.",
      "She had just directed an off-Broadway concert version of \u201cRagtime\u201d \u2014 a big, soaring musical celebrating early 20th-century America \u2014 that had wowed critics despite being a bare-boned production with some actors reading from their scripts. Might it fit the bill if she filled it out?",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re hoping is to make work that\u2019s going to be meaningful in people\u2019s lives, and I really felt that it was. And that it was in a way that wasn\u2019t finished,\u201d the Tony Award-nominated director says. \u201cIt really warranted the full flourishing of the idea.\u201d",
      "She gets her wish this fall as 33 actors buoyed by an 28-piece orchestra announce her arrival with a full-throated Broadway revival of the stage version of E.L. Doctorow\u2019s bestselling novel. Previews begin Friday; opening night is Oct. 16.",
      "\u201cRagtime'' is the story of three distinct groups of characters navigating their way through the turbulent racial and economic times of 1906 in New York City \u2014 a Jewish immigrant with his young daughter, a well-to-do white family and a Black piano player.",
      "\u201cBecause \u2018Ragtime\u2019 has, in fact, so many stories with multiple protagonists, there is an opportunity for people to connect with it in many different ways that reflect their own history, their own family\u2019s history, their own experience,\u201d she says.",
      "Tony Award-nominee Joshua Henry leads the cast and views it as the perfect musical for this moment. \u201cHow we see each other, how we hear each other is right now at the forefront,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI think \u2018Ragtime\u2019 puts the spotlight on how we have been successful and not successful doing that in the past, and I feel that\u2019s going to help us move forward.\u201d",
      "The revival is part of a slate of shows that deBessonet is crafting for the multi-Tony Award-winning, three-theater complex on the Lincoln Center campus, one that has built a reputation for new plays and sumptuous revivals of great musicals.",
      "\u201cThe work we make here I want it to be something that anyone of any background \u2014 whether they are visiting New York City or were born here \u2014 could come in and feel restored to humanity, feel connected to other people,\u201d she says. \u201cPart of why I\u2019m such a passionate advocate for the theater as an art form is, I really believe, it\u2019s a place where we can gather across difference.\u201d",
      "DeBessonet this season is also bringing over the London hit \u201cKyoto,\u201d a political thriller about the climate accords, and a revival of \u201cThe Whoopi Monologues\u201d with Kerry Washington and Kara Young. There also will be a family holiday opera and a comedy series in its rooftop off-Broadway venue.",

      "Cuban teenagers Fabio and Diego Abreu are part of a new wave of musicians revitalizing Cuba\u2019s music scene",
      "HAVANA -- Cuban teenagers Fabio and Diego Abreu seem shy at first, but the moment they step on stage, they become confident, filling a concert hall in downtown Havana with a hypnotic form of traditional jazz.",
      "The Abreu brothers, aged 19 and 17, are part of a new generation of musicians revitalizing Cuba\u2019s music scene. They are filling a void left by established performers who have emigrated or stayed abroad as the island endures one of its most dire economic crises in decades. Their rise is also fueled by the opening of small, private venues for their shows and the relatively recent spread of internet access on the island, which they use for promotion.",
      "\u201cWe do what we like and we\u2019re fortunate enough to make a living from what we love, which is music,\u201d 19-year-old Fabio Abreu said shortly before a concert at the F\u00e1brica de Arte Cubano, a sprawling cultural center housed in a former factory that now operates as an art gallery, music venue and nightclub.",
      "And it's not just good old traditional jazz like that of the Abreus. Young musicians in Cuba are experimenting with everything, mixing traditional Cuban music like timba and salsa with newer, more daring sounds like electronic music and hip hop.",
      "The Cuban music scene is both complex and interesting, said Michel Hern\u00e1ndez, a writer and journalist specialized in music. \u201cThe recent migration of major Cuban artists \u2014 many with established careers \u2014 has created a void that is now being filled by a new generation of musicians,\u201d he said.",
      "The emerging scene is highly hybrid, he said, blending rock, pop and electronic music with traditional Afro-Cuban music styles such as \u201cson,\u201d which is the root of salsa. The phenomenon has led to the rise of new genres, including the highly commercial \u201creparto,\" a genre that originated in Havana\u2019s working-class neighborhoods and is known for its explicit lyrics.",
      "In addition to new sounds, many of these artists are now performing in small, private bars that have opened over the last decade. And lacking a formal record industry, young Cuban artists rely heavily on social media and the internet \u2014 a tool only widely available on the island since late 2018. They also depend on music videos, some of which are made with very low production budgets, that are shared between phones.",
      "One of them is Melanie Santiler, a 23-year-old pop singer and songwriter who has gained a following among young people. She credits online videos for much of her success. Her Instagram account boasts 248,000 followers, while her YouTube channel has 73,000.",
      "\u201cWe emerging musicians are the ones carrying the flag and shaping the future of Cuban music,\" she said. \u201cFor me, this is a decisive moment.\u201d",

      "Scarlett Johansson makes her directorial debut with \u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d starring June Squibb",
      "There is a lovely story of friendship, grief and starting over at the heart of \u201cEleanor the Great.\u201d The film, directed by Scarlett Johansson in her feature debut, gets tangled in a plot contrivance that is, at best, unnecessary and at worst, loathsome.",
      "That\u2019s the problem with the elevator pitch mentality, though. A story about a 90-something trying to make friends in a new city might sound a little too simple, a little too straightforward. What if she does so by pretending to be a Holocaust survivor? I\u2019m not kidding.",
      "Eleanor is played by June Squibb (the great). At 94-years-old, she has moved from Florida to New York after the death of her best friend and roommate Bessie (Rita Zohar). Her daughter, Lisa (Jessica Hecht), and grandson, Max (Will Price), have taken her into their small Manhattan apartment, but they only seem interested in getting Eleanor into an assisted living arrangement. Lisa especially treats her mother's presence like an inconvenience, a problem to fix, and Eleanor starts looking elsewhere for companionship.",
      "The thing is Eleanor had a great life in Florida, living with her platonic best friend in a little apartment. The script, Tory Kamen\u2019s first produced screenplay, smartly introduces this idyllic moment first. It is a distinct joy to watch the two nonagenarians go about their daily activities, from velcroing their shoes to doing their exercises on the beach.",
      "Squibb recently had a version of this in the delightful \u201cThelma,\u201d but there she was alone, a widow determined to hold onto her independent living situation. Here, Bessie and Eleanor help each other, whether it\u2019s waking up on time, or standing up for the other at the local supermarket when their preferred brand of kosher pickles isn\u2019t on the shelf and the teenage employee dares to suggest that \u201call pickles taste the same.\u201d Then Bessie suddenly dies, and Eleanor is left with no choice but to start over.",
      "It\u2019s hard to make new friends anywhere, at any age, but perhaps even more so in drizzly, cold New York. When a friendly woman at the Jewish Community Center asks Eleanor if she\u2019s here for \u201cthe group,\u201d Eleanor doesn\u2019t question it. Yes, she says with a relieved smile. When it becomes clear that this group is for Holocaust survivors, she does try to leave, but everyone encourages her to stay and suddenly she\u2019s telling Bessie\u2019s story of losing her brother in Poland as her own. The script has already established Eleanor as a bit of a liar \u2014 but they\u2019re the small kinds, the white lies that, she says, aren\u2019t hurting anyone.",

      "Nina has recently lost her mother and finds solace in this relationship. It\u2019s here where you can start to see how the rest of the movie is going to play out, how the lie will go on too long and be exposed at a terrible time, leading to inevitable feelings of betrayal and humiliation. And it is very, very hard to watch Squibb in distress. Rather than celebrate the performance you want to lash out at the script that put her in this situation in the first place. That may not be fair but it\u2019s also true.",
      "The story becomes less of a character study of the strange ways in which grief manifests and more about the escalating hijinks of a lie that takes on a wild life of its own. Soon Eleanor is speaking to Nina\u2019s journalism peers in an on-the-record, taped conversation, telling another of Bessie\u2019s stories. Then, Nina\u2019s distant father ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ), a local news anchor, decides Eleanor\u2019s is a great human-interest story for his show.",
      "There is a thread about the merits of preserving memory, but it\u2019s introduced a little too late and too flimsily to justify all that came before it. Johansson directs the proceedings simply, like a classic New York character drama, allowing the performances to shine over the filmmaking, but who she is as a filmmaker remains to be seen. Squibb and Kellyman, both terrific, are the real reasons to seek out \u201cEleanor the Great.\u201d The film may trip over its own contrivances but their performances will leave you moved.",
      "\u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d a Sony Pictures Classics release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csome language, thematic elements and suggestive references.\u201d Running time: 98 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Paul Thomas Anderson spent about 20 years writing \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d After two decades, it\u2019s never felt more relevant.",
      "The epic action thriller, inspired by Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cVineland,\u201d hits theaters Friday. With a running time of 2 hours and 50 minutes, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d wastes no time immersing audiences in its politically charged world.",
      "The revolution will not be televised, but it will be placed at the front and center of Anderson\u2019s film. The director isn\u2019t there to make his audience comfortable, star Teyana Taylor says, as he zeros in on themes of immigration, racism and systemic corruption showcased at their most absurd.",
      "\u201cI feel like PTA calls out a lot of things that are trying to get swept under the rug,\u201d Taylor told The Associated Press, referring to the director by his nickname. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I respect. This is really waking, shaking and baking some s---. Like, you gotta shake the table.\u201d",
      "Taylor\u2019s character, Perfidia Beverly Hills, is a member of the Weather Underground-inspired French 75 revolutionary group. From the film\u2019s first scene, we see the French 75 take matters into their own hands, liberating undocumented detainees, destroying corrupt political offices and launching their own form of justice, one right after the other. The group is peppered with members portrayed by musicians-turned-actors like Dijon Duenas, Alana Haim, and Shayna McHayle and notable actors like Regina Hall and Wood Harris.",
      "\u201cI mean, this movie is based on some of the revolutionaries and anarchists of the late '60s, the Weathermen that were fighting for civil rights, environmentalism too at the time, capitalism, Vietnam,\u201d star Leonardo DiCaprio told the AP. \u201cBut it\u2019s about the implosion of that too, about the extremes that people go to for their own ideology.\u201d",
      "DiCaprio portrays Bob Ferguson, known in the French 75\u2019s initial scenes as Ghetto Pat, known for his knowledge of explosives and undying devotion to both Perfidia and the revolution. Together, Perfidia and Pat seem unstoppable, until the racist and xenophobic Col. Steven Lockjaw (Sean Penn) sets out end the group to fuel his rise to power.",
      "\u201cAnd this is a movie, fast-forward, in today\u2019s day and age, where you see this sort of systematic breakdown that comes from it, if it\u2019s not done with grace and purity and consistently, the whole sort of\u2014 our revolution is dismantled and our past comes back to haunt us,\u201d said DiCaprio. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I love that Paul did. He shows extremity on both sides of the spectrum and how no one seems to be communicating or getting things done in the right way nowadays.\u201d",
      "The film jumps 16 years into the future. Perfidia has disappeared and DiCaprio\u2019s character lives under a new alias in a sanctuary city as a paranoid, stoner dad with his teenage daughter, Willa (newcomer Chase Infiniti). Everything is seemingly mundane until Lockjaw reappears, forcing the father-daughter duo on the run.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of moments where I was like, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m gonna be able to do this, but thankfully I had amazing scene partners and a great support system to kind of assure me that I was here to do my job and I knew exactly that I could do it,\u201d Infiniti said.",
      "\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is Anderson\u2019s most expensive project to date and shot entirely in VistaVision \u2014 a decades-old format that's been revived in recent years by movies like \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",

      "Miles Mykkanen has come a long way since his musical theater dreams shifted to opera at Juilliard",
      "NEW YORK -- Miles Mykkanen grew up wanting to sing and dance on Broadway, but he was turned down by the musical theater programs he applied to for college. So he had to \u201csettle\u201d for studying opera at the Juilliard School at Lincoln Center.",
      "\u201cAt 18, when your sights are set on 42nd Street and then you\u2019re getting called to 65th Street, it was weirdly a letdown,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut after a few hours I kind of slapped myself and said \u2018Miles, pull yourself together.\u2019\u201d",
      "That was 16 years ago, and he has since pulled himself together to such an extent that at age 34 he\u2019s just opened the Metropolitan Opera season in a leading role in a new opera, \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.\u201d",
      "With a libretto by Gene Scheer and score by Mason Bates, the opera is based on the novel by Michael Chabon. Mykkanen portrays Sammy Clay, a Jewish kid growing up in World War II-era Brooklyn who teams with his cousin, Czech refugee Joe Kavalier, to create a comic strip hero modeled on Superman.",
      "He\u2019ll also be back at the Met in the spring in another modern opera, Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho\u2019s \u201cInnocence.\u201d He plays the Bridegroom, a part he first sang in 2024 when San Francisco Opera gave the work\u2019s U.S. premiere.",
      "Mykkanen had sung at the Met before, mostly attracting little attention in small parts, though his haunting rendition of the Holy Fool in Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cBoris Godunov\u201d in 2021 drew critical acclaim.",
      "\u201cBut this season is so ideal,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cAll of a sudden my schedule came together, and I thought, my God, where did this all come from.\u201d",
      "When the Met was casting \u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d it was Michael Heaston, the artistic administrator, who thought of Mykkanen for the role of Sammy.",
      "\u201cI first became acquainted with Miles when he was still a student at Juilliard, and he immediately impressed me,\u201d Heaston said. \u201cHe is a singer who can straddle genres, that rare artist who can sing a heartfelt operatic aria in one moment and then turn on a dime to a classic tune from the American Songbook.",
      "\u201cWhen I looked at Mason\u2019s score and considered the vocal and acting demands alike, it seemed tailor-made for Miles.\u201d",
      "Mary Birnbaum, who taught Mykkanen acting at Juilliard, said she\u2019s not surprised at his sudden rise to prominence.",
      "\u201cHonestly it\u2019s what I thought he would do all along,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very American sound, and it\u2019s appealing and it\u2019s lush. But also he\u2019s bold as an actor \u2026 and he makes material look better for being in it.\u201d",
      "By coincidence, both his roles this season are people who have something to hide. \u201cThey are characters with two huge secrets that are kind of gnawing away at them,\u201d Mykkanen said.",

      "\u201cInnocence\u201d deals with the lingering effects of a school shooting 10 years later, and as secrets are peeled away, the Bridegroom\u2019s role in the horrific events is gradually exposed.",
      "Mykkanen relishes the very different musical challenges the two roles provide. Saariaho\u2019s score for \u201cInnocence,\u201d he said is composed with a kind of \u201cmathematical\u201d precision. \u201cWhen I first cracked it open, it was overwhelming because of the time signatures, the key signatures. You\u2019re trying to figure out, what was she thinking, how do you put this all together?\u201d",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d written in a style that uses what Bates calls \u201csymphonic electronica,\u201d has been easier to learn. \u201cI almost feel it\u2019s starting to carve a new genre in opera,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cSomething American opera has been trying to find in the last decade or so. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to stay to say it\u2019s musical theater, but at times it\u2019s very colloquial.\u201d",
      "Mykkanen grew up in the remote Ironwood region of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, where both his parents were high school band directors. Though he displayed a talent for singing at a young age, it was show music rather than opera that inspired him. When his parents found him a classical voice teacher, \u201cFor me it was a means to an end, to develop my voice so I could sing on the Broadway stage.\u201d",
      "Though his career now takes him all over the U.S. and to Europe, Mykkanen still calls the Ironwood region home. In 2020, he launched an arts festival called Emberlight that has grown into a two-month summer program of live performance, film, art shows and talkbacks with visiting artists.

      "Pamela Anderson has embraced a makeup-free lifestyle at 58, attending fashion shows and film premieres with a bare face",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Pamela Anderson has nothing against makeup. It's just that she's been there, done that in her younger years. That's why now, at 58, she's attending fashion shows and film premieres with a blissfully bare face.",
      "It's a look, especially for older women, that serves to plague and perplex. Do we chase youth (and relevancy) with a full face, or do we foster radiant skin and march on makeup free?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be the prettiest girl in the room,\u201d Anderson told Vogue ahead of a recent show she attended during Paris Fashion Week. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just freedom. It\u2019s like a relief.\u201d",
      "Down here in the non-celebrity world, is it just as easy and comfortable to go makeup free? Some proponents of the look, along with style and beauty experts, weigh in.",
      "Women, particularly older women, are not universally giving up makeup, but Anderson, Alicia Keys and other celebrities who have publicly shown off bare faces have certainly inspired some to cast it off.",
      "Working women, however, acknowledge difficulties doing that on the job \u2014 especially in traditional, less creative work spaces.",
      "\u201cI do still think that there are some politics associated with it. More around feeling and looking polished,\u201d said Deborah Borg, the chief of human resources for a creative-leaning company that has roughly 25,000 employees.",
      "She said she's seen more women come into work makeup-free since COVID, and thinks the pandemic significantly altered the workplace dynamic.",
      "Borg, 49, gave up makeup four years ago, save an occasional swipe of her bold, signature red lipstick. At Dalya, a cozy clothing shop in New York's trendy Soho neighborhood, she lent herself as a model to demonstrate how to help one's bare skin glow and how to use attire and accessories to accentuate the look.",
      "Makeup artist Rebecca Robles counseled Borg and others with mature skin to think hydration when choosing products to make the most of their bare faces.",
      "Robles recommends a five-step workday routine: A gentle cleanser that doesn't strip the skin; a vitamin C serum to brighten and mitigate fine lines; a moisturizer with sun protection; a separate broad-spectrum sunscreen for an extra boost (don't forget to apply that to the ears); and a glossy lip balm for a bit of added polish.",
      "No mascara? No problem. Use a lash curler to offer a bit of pop to the eye, Robles said. And gently brush brows into place to complete the look.",
      "Find products with hyaluronic acid and ceramides, Robles suggests, and always swipe up with skincare products. Minimize tugging and pulling on the skin.",
      "\u201cWhen your skin is glowing, one thing that\u2019s really fun to keep in mind is that light reflects off that moisture in the skin and can help blur out any fine lines or enlarged pores. So it\u2019s win-win,\u201d Robles said.",
      "She advised that each product should sit for a minute or two before the next step is applied.",
      "Borg emphasized the ease of her morning routine since going makeup free. She used to spend about 30 minutes just on makeup. Now, she does hair and face in half that time.",

      "First, with clothes, \"use a lot of color. I call it our filter,\u201d Tincher said.",
      "Secondly, play with texture; it determines how light will be reflected. \u201cSo if you have something more matte, that is going to create a more soft lighting on you. If you have more silk satin, like say something like a blouse, it\u2019s going to be more like a laser beam,\u201d she said.",
      "Finally, accessorize. Tincher said added touches like lapel pins, earrings and necklaces can provide a finished polish \u2014 especially if that polish is still expected at work. A considered style can offset judgments about going makeup free, she said.",
      "\u201cThink of your outfit as the big picture. When you walk in, what is the statement that it\u2019s making? It\u2019s not just about one part of you, it\u2019s your whole presence in a room,\u201d she said.",

      "Makeup, she said, \u201cfelt like prison.\u201d She stopped gradually, giving up foundation first. But still, she's not above applying a bit of mascara on special occasions.",

      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers for music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs urged a New York federal judge Monday to sentence him early next month to no more than 14 months in prison for his conviction on two prostitution-related charges, meaning he'd go free almost immediately if the judge agreed.",

      "In their submission, Combs' lawyers argued that a jury sent a loud message to the judge by exonerating him of the most serious charges.",
      "\u201cPut simply, the jury has spoken. Its verdict represents an \u2018affirmative indication of innocence,\u2019\u201d the lawyers said.",
      "\u201cHe has served over a year in one of the most notorious jails in America \u2014 yet has made the most of that punishment. It is time for Mr. Combs to go home to his family, so he can continue his treatment and try to make the most of the next chapter of his extraordinary life,\u201d they added.",
      "Prosecutors, who will submit their recommendations prior to the Oct. 3 sentencing, have already said they\u2019ll urge Combs stay imprisoned substantially longer than the four to five years they originally thought.",
      "Defense lawyers, though, wrote in their submission Monday that prosecutors \u201chave lost all perspective.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Combs\u2019s career and reputation have been destroyed,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHis life outside of jail has been systematically dismantled.\u201d",

      "His seven children, they said, have faced \u201cdevastating consequences,\u201d including lost business opportunities in acting, television, fashion and concerts, with some of them being included in some of the nearly 100 civil lawsuits filed against Combs since his arrest.",

      "The North American box office has slowed down after a strong September.",
      "Neither a Jordan Peele-produced horror nor a Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell romantic drama were enough to continue the September hot streak at the movies. After back-to-back weekends that had films majorly overperforming, first \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rights\u201d followed by the anime \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Infinity Castle,\u201d the North American box office slowed significantly.",
      "Overall ticket sales were down nearly 50% from last weekend, with the holdover champion \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d edging out the newcomer \u201cHim\u201d for first place, according to studio estimates Sunday. Crunchyroll and Sony Pictures\u2019 \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d added $17.3 million over the weekend, bringing its total to $104.7 million, which makes it the highest grossing anime film ever in North America.",
      "The football horror \u201cHim\u201d opened in second place with an estimated $13.5 million in ticket sales. Universal Pictures opened \u201cHim\u201d in 3,168 North American theaters, where the audience was 52% male and 65% over the age of 25. Internationally, it earned $400,000.",
      "Produced by Peele\u2019s Monkeypaw and directed by Justin Tipping, \u201cHim\u201d is about a promising young quarterback (Tyriq Withers) who is invited to train with a veteran (Marlon Wayans) at an isolated compound.",
      "\u201cHim\u201d scored with neither critics (it carries a 29% on Rotten Tomatoes) nor audiences, who gave the film a C- CinemaScore. In his review for The Associated Press, film writer Jake Coyle wrote that the film \u201cwas made with the potent premise of bringing the kind of dark, satirical perspective that characterizes a Monkeypaw production to our violent national pastime. But that promise gets fumbled in an allegorical chamber play that grows increasingly tedious.\u201d",
      "\u201cHim\u201d was also nearly upstaged by another horror, \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rights,\u201d which made an estimated $13 million in its third weekend. With a global total of $400 million, it\u2019s now the biggest film in the Conjuring universe.",
      "They are two of three horror movies in this weekend's top 10, including \u201cWeapons.\u201d According to data firm Comscore, this year that genre alone has generated $1.1 billion in domestic box office receipts, just several million short of the 2017 record driven by \u201cIt\u201d and \u201cGet Out.\u201d",
      "\u201cHorror movies have been on a bit of a hot streak,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore's head of marketplace trends. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a record-breaking year.\u201d",
      "In addition to \u201cDemon Slayer,\u201d Sony had a new film this weekend as well: The original romance \u201cA Big Bold Beautiful Journey,\u201d starring Robbie and Farrell, but that fizzled with audiences, earning only $3.5 million from 3,300 locations.

      "Fatal shark bites are vanishingly rare, with less than 50 unprovoked shark bites on humans worldwide in 2024, according to the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History.

They performed the work by dragging samples of the materials behind boats and allowing white and tiger sharks to bite the samples.",
      "The bites from such large sharks can still cause internal and crushing injuries, but the materials showed effectiveness beyond a standard neoprene wetsuit, the scientists said. The research found that the bite-resistant materials \u201ccan reduce injuries sustained from shark encounters,\u201d said Flinders professor Charlie Huveneers, a member of the Southern Shark Ecology Group at Flinders and a study co-author.",

      "The measure was part of the tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July. Initially, a judge said reimbursements must continue, but a federal appeals court this month said the government could halt the payments while a court challenge to the provision moves ahead.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's administration has extended Georgia's Pathways to Coverage program for 15 months",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's program that provides health insurance to some low-income adults that document work or other activities has been extended for 15 months by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp announced Thursday that the federal government approved that the Pathways to Coverage program will continue as part of the state-federal Medicaid program through December 2026. The five-year pilot program had been scheduled to expire next week, but Kemp argued Georgia should get more time because the program only started after a court battle with President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, which tried to shut it down.",
      "Georgia's program has been closely watched because Republicans mandated similar work requirements throughout the country as part of the tax and budget overhaul signed into law by Trump. Starting in 2027, some adults who seek Medicaid coverage must first show they are working, taking classes or performing community service for at least 80 hours a month.",
      "The Georgia program, which has similar work or activity requirements, has enrolled far fewer people than originally projected, covering 9,175 people as of August. It has spent twice as much on administrative costs than on providing actual health care. The Kemp administration had projected it would cover 25,000 people in its first year and up to 100,000 eventually.",
      "Critics warn the Georgia experience shows that millions will lose coverage under the Trump law because the administrative process will make it too difficult for them to document their work. Republicans have defended the low enrollment, saying Medicaid should be temporary for people who can get insurance through an employer.",
      "Pathways is Kemp's answer to pressure to expand Medicaid to cover all adults who earn less than 138% of federal poverty line wages, as originally envisioned under President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul. Georgia is one of 10 Republican-led states that refused to expand coverage. Instead, Kemp launched Pathways, offering coverage to people who earn up to the poverty line \u2014 $15,650 a year. Georgia\u2019s traditional Medicaid program still covers poorer children, disabled adults, poor people in nursing homes and a few other very poor adults.",
      "Under the extension, Georgia will offer health coverage to parents and guardians of children younger than six without any additional work requirement. The state will also let beneficiaries report qualifying work or activity hours only once a yearly, instead of monthly. Some beneficiaries had said the monthly reporting process was glitchy and hard to use. Insurance will also start on the first day of the month that an application is received, meaning hospitals and doctors will have an incentive to help uninsured patients apply in hopes of getting paid for care already delivered. Right now, coverage doesn't start until after someone is approved.",

The administrative portion declined more recently, from 96.5% in fiscal year 2023 to 58.8% in fiscal year 2024. It is expected to drop more in 2025.",

In a Thursday statement, Warnock said that \u201cthe only thing Pathways is incredibly effective at is barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer.\"",

      "At a ceremony in Greenland 's capital of Nuuk on Wednesday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen will offer their official apologies for their governments' roles in the mistreatment of Greenlandic Indigenous girls and women who were given invasive contraception by the Danish health authorities against their will, with cases dating back to the 1960s.",
      "\u201cWe cannot change what has happened, but we can take responsibility and we can create the conditions for reconciliation with the past,\u201d Frederiksen said in a statement released Monday, adding the Danish government intends to establish a reconciliation fund to financially compensate victims.",
      "Last month, Denmark and Greenland already published apologies for their roles in the mistreatment of the women and girls just ahead of the publication of an independent investigation into the abuse.",
      "The event comes at a difficult time with U.S. President Donald Trump exploiting divisions between Denmark and Greenland as it seeks U.S. influence, even jurisdiction over the territory.",
      "Meanwhile, Denmark has sought to placate the independence movement in Greenland but historical abuses committed by the former colonial power have tainted their efforts at a rapprochement.",
      "Greenland, which remains part of the Danish realm, was a colony under Denmark\u2019s crown until 1953, when it became a province in the Scandinavian country. In 1979, the island was granted home rule, and 30 years later Greenland became a self-governing entity.",
      "The forced contraception of Indigenous women and girls was part of centuries of Danish policies that dehumanized Greenlanders and their families.",

      "While the report covered the experiences of 354 women who spoke with investigators, Danish authorities say more than 4,000 women and girls \u2014 reportedly half the fertile women in Greenland at the time \u2014 received IUDs between the 1960s and mid-1970s. It\u2019s not known how many of those cases lacked consent.",

      "The alleged purpose of the forced contraception was to limit population growth in Greenland by preventing pregnancies.

The 2024 increases was not as steep as in other years \u2014 cases were up by less than 2% from 2023. But health experts say no cases should be happening, and any growth is worrisome.",
      "\"The continued rise in congenital syphilis is a distressing indication that we are not doing enough to protect pregnant women and newborns,\" said Elizabeth Finley, interim executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, in a statement.",
      "About 1.5 million chlamydia cases, 543,000 of gonorrhea, and more than 190,000 of syphilis were diagnosed and reported last year. Each was lower than the year before, and the more than 2.2 million total cases represented a 9% decline from 2023.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Seven Indigenous groups in Ecuador\u2019s Amazon have denounced a government plan to offer dozens of blocks of land for oil exploration, saying it threatens their ancestral lands and violates constitutional protections.",
      "The criticism targets a plan from the Ministry of Energy and Mines in August to auction the rights for 49 oil and gas projects worth more than $47 billion.",
      "Officials say the \u201chydrocarbon roadmap\u201d is a strategy to modernize Ecuador\u2019s oil industry, attract foreign capital and boost production. Their plan includes contract renegotiations and new licensing rounds that the government says comply with existing legal frameworks.",
      "Indigenous groups say 18 of the proposed oil blocks overlap their territories \u2014 an area roughly the size of Belgium.",
      "Leaders from the Andwa, Shuar, Achuar, Kichwa, Sapara, Shiwiar and Waorani peoples say their communities were not consulted and accuse the government of ignoring court rulings that struck down earlier consultations as unconstitutional.",
      "\u201cThe government is pushing ahead with plans to auction 18 oil blocks in our ancestral territories without free, prior and informed consent. That is a constitutional and international right the state is violating,\u201d said Nemo Guiquita, a Waorani leader with the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon.",
      "Several recent moves by President Daniel Noboa have alarmed environmentalists and Indigenous leaders who say the country\u2019s green reputation is unraveling.",
      "Noboa's administration has moved to scrap Ecuador's independent Environment Ministry. He also supported a law passed by the National Assembly that lets private and foreign entities co-manage conservation zones that critics say weakens protections and threatens Indigenous land rights.",
      "\u201cThere have been protests, lawsuits and companies forced to withdraw in the past, but now they are once again offering up Amazon oil fields,\" Guiquita said. \"We are resisting, and we call on the international community to oppose this expansion and help protect the Amazon and our rights.\u201d",

      "Earlier this week, the IFRC said it is appealing for 20 million Swiss francs ($25 million) to help contain the outbreak and aiming to reach 965,000 people with urgent assistance. It warned that health facilities are overwhelmed and lack the resources to provide care, with clean water and protective equipment running critically low.",
      "According to the IFRC, the only treatment centre in the Bulape health zone, where the epicenter of the outbreak has been declared and the majority of cases are concentrated, is already at 119% capacity.",
      "Health officials are particularly concerned about the impact of U.S. funding cuts, especially since the U.S. has a history of supporting Congo\u2019s past Ebola outbreaks, including a 2021 effort when the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, provided up to $11.5 million to support efforts across Africa.",
      "IFRC\u2019s Nzisa Mbalu said it is still early to fully assess the level of donor support for the Ebola response, adding that the organization has so far allocated 1.75 million swiss francs ($2.2 million) in emergency funds to respond to the outbreak.",

      "While the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, climate change and other crises got much of the focus in the U.N.'s marathon week of speeches and meetings, the topic of drugs turned up from Trump's and Petro's tough talk to side events on such themes as gender-inclusive drug policy and international cooperation to fight organized crime.",
      "Some 316 million people worldwide used marijuana, opioids and/or other drugs in 2023, a 28% rise in a decade, according to the most recent statistics available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. The figures don\u2019t count alcohol or tobacco use.",

      "NEW YORK -- Infection rates from drug-resistant \u201cnightmare bacteria\u201d rose almost 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists.",
      "Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in an article published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said.",
      "Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.",
      "\u201cThe rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,\u201d said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.",
      "It's likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said.",
      "That may play out in doctors\u2019 offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat \u2014 like urinary tract infections \u2014 could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report\u2019s authors.",
      "Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise \u2014 unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn\u2019t kill the germs made them stronger.",
      "In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to \u201c nightmare bacteria \u201d resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.",
      "Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.",
      "They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.",
      "The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 \u2014 an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 \u2014 an increase of 460%, the authors said.",

      "North Carolina Republican legislators have introduced criminal justice measures to toughen bail rules and evaluate offenders for mental health issues",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Republican legislators are poised this week to approve criminal justice measures designed to toughen bail rules, restrict magistrates' powers and evaluate offenders' mental health after the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte commuter train. The bill also could help get the death penalty carried out again in the ninth-largest U.S. state.",
      "Senate and House Republicans unveiled legislation that their leaders previously signaled would surface when the General Assembly reconvened on Monday after nearly two months away from Raleigh.",
      "The Aug. 22 death of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska \u2014 her attack caught on camera \u2014 and subsequent charges against a suspect who had previously been arrested more than a dozen times caused public outrage. An array of Republicans, President Donald Trump among them, have attempted to blame Zarutska's death on Charlotte-area leaders and Democratic state officials for what they call soft-on-crime policies.",
      "The Senate approved the legislation 28-8 late Monday, with many Democrats absent from the otherwise party-line vote. The bill now goes to the House, where a vote is likely Tuesday.",
      "Any final measure would then go to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein\u2019s desk. Stein, the former attorney general, has suggested pretrial release changes and greater emphasis on mental health are needed in light of Zarutska's death.",
      "But the measure took a different direction \u2014 away from bipartisan support \u2014 when Senate Republicans approved an amendment that could in the future open the door to other forms of capital punishment beyond lethal injection, which is currently the state\u2019s sole method. North Carolina last carried out an execution in 2006.",
      "The stabbing suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., could received a death sentence if convicted of first-degree murder in state court or a federal count filed against him.",
      "Brown, whose criminal record included serving more than five years in prison after pleading guilty to robbery using a deadly weapon, had been charged in January in Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, with misusing the 911 system, a misdemeanor, according to court records.",
      "But a magistrate \u2014 a nonelected local court official who often determines if a defendant can be released while awaiting trial \u2014 released him on a written promise to return for court. And it took more than six months for a court to order a mental evaluation for him. Brown\u2019s mother told Charlotte-area television that she had sought an involuntary psychiatric commitment this year after he became violent at home.",
      "GOP Sen. Ralph Hise said the legislation has nothing to do with winning political points, but rather is a response to the failure of the criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cWe need a criminal justice system that protects society from individuals. I believe these are many great steps in this bill,\u201d Hise said.",
      "The measure, named \u201cIryna\u2019s Law,\u201d would prohibit cashless bail for certain crimes and eliminate some of the discretion that magistrates and judges have for pretrial release decisions.",
      "For example, first-time defendants accused of a violent offense could only be released on a secured cash bond or receive house arrest with electronic monitoring. Such house arrest and monitoring would be the only option for some repeat defendants.",
      "The bill also attempts to ensure that more suspects are subject to psychological examinations before their potential release. Defendants accused of a violent crime and committed involuntarily in recent years to a mental health facility would be subject to a psychological evaluation.",

      "The line of contact has grown by roughly 200 kilometers (120 miles) over the past year, and Ukrainian forces are averaging between 160 and 190 combat engagements every day with Russia\u2019s bigger army, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a review of the battlefield situation.",
      "At the same time, Russian tactics have switched since the start of the summer from costly large-scale offensives to deploying small assault groups in a new approach that Syrskyi called the \u201cthousand cuts\u201d tactic.",
      "His version of events could not be independently verified, and Russian officials made no immediate comment.",
      "Russian forces have been trying to engulf Ukraine with sheer weight of numbers and relentless barrages of drones, missiles, artillery and devastating glide bombs. Though they have slowly pushed Ukrainian defenders back in rural areas, the Russian army has failed to conquer cities that constitute defensive strongholds.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump, whose efforts to bring an end to the war have made no progress, said Tuesday that he believed Ukraine could turn the tide and win back all the territory it has lost to Russia, equivalent to around 20% of its land.",
      "Syrskyi said Russia is launching large numbers of small assault groups of about four to six soldiers who use the cover of the terrain to penetrate the front line and then strike Ukrainian rear areas, disrupting supply lines and troop rotations. However, those small groups become cut off and are trapped by encircling Ukrainian forces, he said in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.",
      "Syrskyi told reporters that Russian forces are firing roughly twice as many artillery shells as Ukrainian units.",
      "But he claimed that a recent Ukrainian push against Russian positions has regained control of 168 square kilometers (65 square miles) of land.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s long-range strike program, meanwhile, has inflicted heavy damage on Russian military and industrial assets in recent weeks, he said.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s newly created Unmanned Systems Forces, which use increasingly sophisticated drones, carried out 85 strikes on targets inside Russia in less than two months \u2014 33 against military sites and 52 on plants that produce weapons, ammunition, engines, rocket fuel and drones, according to Syrskyi.",

      "KARACHI, Pakistan -- Pakistan has vaccinated about 9 million adolescent girls against the virus that causes cervical cancer, as part of a continuing national campaign that has overcome early setbacks fueled by skeptics online, the health minister said Friday.",
      "Health Minister Mustafa Kamal said the campaign that began Sept. 15 is aiming to vaccinate 13 million girls aged 9 to 14 against the human papillomavirus, or HPV, which causes most cervical cancers. He said the program so far achieved 70% of its goal.",
      "The program has overcome what Kamal said were baseless rumors spread by some parents that the vaccine could cause infertility. He gave the vaccine to his own daughter live on stage at an event in Karachi this week to build confidence.",
      "\u201cBy the grace of God, administering the vaccine to my daughter publicly had a huge impact,\u201d Kamal told The Associated Press. \u201cFrom the fifth day of the campaign, refusal rates began dropping and acceptance climbed to 70\u201380% in some districts.\u201d",

      "Intrusions into NATO\u2019s airspace blamed on Russia reached an unprecedented scale this month, raising questions about whether the Kremlin is trying to test the alliance\u2019s willingness and ability to respond to a direct attack or divert its attention and resources from the war in Ukraine.",
      "Russia has been encroaching on its NATO neighbors' airspace for decades, then either denying it happened or brushing it off as unintentional. But since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, such incursions have carried a bigger threat, none more so than when drones swarmed into Poland two weeks ago and caused NATO to scramble jets to shoot them down.",
      "Estonia said Russian fighter jets flew into its territory last week and remained there for 12 minutes \u2014 an incursion Estonia\u2019s foreign minister described as \u201cunprecedently brazen\u201d but that Russia denied happened. And Romania and Latvia reported that single Russian drones violated their airspace this month.",
      "With Moscow making slow but steady progress on the battlefield in Ukraine and holding a strong hand should it decide to talk peace, its recent forays into NATO airspace also raise questions about why it would risk triggering a direct military confrontation with the alliance.",
      "Here's a look at what's been happening and what Russia's motives might be:",
      "None of the intrusions of NATO airspace has had the scope of what happened in Poland on Sept. 10, when authorities say about 20 Russian drones flew deep over the countryside before being shot down by NATO jets or crashing on their own. It marked the first direct military engagement between the alliance and Russia since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Russia denied that it targeted Poland, and its ally Belarus claimed the drones' signals had been jammed by Ukraine, which borders Poland. But European leaders have cast it as a deliberate provocation, pointing to last week's violation of Estonian airspace and other recent incidents as further proof of some broader scheme orchestrated by Moscow.",
      "Before invading Ukraine in 2022, the Kremlin demanded that NATO drop any plans to offer Kyiv membership in the alliance and roll back troop deployments near Russia's borders, including in the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, small former Soviet republics that joined NATO and the EU in the early 2000s. NATO rejected the demands.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin also warned NATO to not allow Kyiv to strike deep inside Russia with Western-supplied longer-range weapons, threatening that Moscow could respond by targeting military facilities in NATO countries that enable such attacks. Doing so would carry huge risks, including for Moscow, as it could spark a direct conflict between Russia and NATO, which has a huge edge in conventional weapons.",
      "Some experts view the recent uptick in NATO airspace incursions as an attempt by Russia to see how the alliance reacts so that it can exploit any fissures or indecision. And some believe Russia is hoping to divert NATO\u2019s attention and resources from supporting Ukraine to defending its own territory.",
      "\u201cMaybe their calculation was that now the European countries have to send something additionally to Estonia regarding the air defense assets, and that means they cannot send it to Ukraine,\u201d Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said. \u201cRussia is trying to tear us out from Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Mark Galeotti, an expert in Russian politics who heads the Mayak Intelligence consultancy, thinks the intrusions are part of a \u201ccoercive signaling\u201d aimed at discouraging NATO members from offering robust security guarantees to Kyiv, including the possible deployment of their troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. Moscow has warned that it won't accept any NATO troops in Ukraine.",

      "Edward Lucas, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said Russia might be trying to highlight NATO\u2019s weaknesses to try to \u201cplant the corrosive question in allies\u2019 minds: Are you willing to go to war with Russia on behalf of the Baltic states?\u201d",
      "\u201cRussia does not need to defeat NATO militarily if it can defeat it politically,\u201d Lucas wrote in an analysis. \u201cIf alliance members do not believe that other members will come to their aid when they are attacked, they feel isolated.\u201d",
      "Russia specifically might have wanted to gauge the reaction of NATO's biggest member, the U.S., said Max Bergmann, head of Europe, Russia, and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",

They may escalate even more.\u201d",
      "After its drone swarm incident, Poland triggered a NATO mechanism that allows any member to demand a full meeting if it believes its territorial integrity, political independence or security is threatened. Soon after, the alliance launched an operation to bolster its air defenses along its eastern flank.",
      "NATO held discussions again Tuesday in response to the Russian fighter jets that flew into Estonian airspace and warned Moscow that it would any and all means to defend against further breaches.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump, who initially stunned allies by saying the Russian drones\u2019 intrusion into Polish airspace \u201ccould have been a mistake,\u201d sent a tougher message Tuesday, answering affirmatively when asked whether NATO should shoot down intruding Russian aircraft. He demurred, though, when prodded if the U.S. would step in to back the alliance in such case.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand jury convicted a man of murder and arson Friday for setting the fire at the boarding house where he lived that killed five fellow tenants.",
      "The jury at the High Court in Wellington reached the verdicts against Esarona David Lologa after less than three days of deliberations, rejecting the defense of insanity argued by Lologa\u2019s lawyers.",
      "Lologa, 50, had been granted name suppression throughout the five-week trial, but the order was lifted when he was convicted.",
      "Prosecutors accepted Lologa had schizophrenia when he twice set fires inside the 92-bed hostel over one night in May 2023. They said he lit the fatal blaze not because of his mental illness but because he wanted to seek a transfer to other accommodation.",
      "Lologa's lawyers didn't deny that their client lit the fires, but they said he was not guilty by reason of insanity. In New Zealand, this meant the jury must accept the defendant was incapable of understanding that his actions were wrong.",
      "His lawyers said there was no evidence that he'd set the fires because he wanted to live elsewhere, but prosecutors said Lologa had told people he didn't like living at the boarding house, which was called Loafers Lodge, and wanted to move elsewhere.",
      "Lologa first set a couch in a communal area ablaze late one evening, prompting an evacuation of the building. After residents put out the fire, he returned and placed cushions and a blanket in a cupboard before setting them alight.",
      "He left the building without raising the alarm or calling emergency services. During the trial, the court heard recordings of desperate phone calls to the fire department from people trapped inside and accounts from tenants, including one man who jumped from a window to escape the blaze.",
      "In a police interview played for the jury, the man denied setting the fires, despite officers telling him he had been seen on security camera footage doing so, RNZ reported.",
      "Some of the boarding house residents included social services clients and older, disabled and otherwise vulnerable people, as well as nurses working at a nearby hospital. The burned-out building remains standing in the district of Newtown, near the central city of New Zealand\u2019s capital.",
      "The residents who died included colorful and well-known Wellington identities. Michael Wahrlich was a veteran busker who juggled tennis balls and Liam Hockings\u2019 daily foot tours of the area made him a familiar face to locals. The other three victims were Kenneth Barnard, Peter O\u2019Sullivan and Melvin Parun.",

Many Islamic scholars say that vaccines with gelatin stabilizers can be used under religious law, as can other medical products with pig-derived ingredients, under certain conditions.",

      "The authors of the analysis at the Royal United Services Institute in London obtained around 800 pages of documents, including contracts and lists of equipment to be supplied by Moscow to Beijing, from the Black Moon hacktivist group.",
      "The group, which previously published some of the documents online, does not identify its members but describes itself in a manifesto as opposed to governments that carry out aggressive foreign policy. The authors of the RUSI report shared some of the documents with The Associated Press and say they appear to be genuine, although parts of the documents may have been omitted or altered. AP is unable to independently verify their authenticity.",
      "The mix of completed and apparent draft Russian documents reference meetings between Chinese and Russian delegations \u2014 including visits to Moscow \u2014 and payment and delivery timelines for high-altitude parachute systems and amphibious assault vehicles. They suggest that Russia has begun work on the products to be delivered but don\u2019t contain direct evidence from the Chinese side that Beijing has paid any money or received any equipment.",
      "While the authors argue the equipment could be used to invade Taiwan, under Xi Jinping China has embarked upon a broad modernization program of its armed forces with the goal of transforming it into a \u201cworld-class\u201d military by 2050.",
      "High ranking U.S. officials have suggested Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered his military to be prepared for a possible invasion of Taiwan as early as 2027. Beijing claims the self-governing democracy is rightfully a part of China and has not ruled out seizing the island by force.",
      "The documents don't mention Taiwan directly, but the RUSI analysis suggests the deal would help China gain advanced parachuting capabilities that it would need to mount an invasion, potentially speeding up a timeline.",
      "It\u2019s not certain that China has decided to invade Taiwan, but access to Russian equipment and localized training in China means Beijing will be better equipped for a potential invasion, Danylyuk said.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese school of airborne landing is very young,\u201d he said, suggesting Moscow\u2019s assistance could help speed up China\u2019s airborne program by about 10 to 15 years.",
      "Russia's Kremlin, and China and Taiwan\u2019s defense and foreign ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cThe greatest value of the deal\u201d to China is likely in the training and procedures for command and control of parachute forces, because Russia has \"combat experience,\u201d whereas China doesn't, write Oleksandr Danylyuk and Jack Watling.",
      "The analysts say Russia\u2019s aim is to develop as a military supplier to China and fund its war in Ukraine. But Danylyuk also suggested to AP that Moscow may want to draw Beijing into a conflict with Washington over Taiwan, distracting the U.S. from Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "While Beijing\u2019s military capabilities largely surpass Moscow\u2019s, the analysis says China has gaps which Russia can fill. Russia has a long history of airborne forces dating back decades, knowhow the authors say China needs.",
      "Song Zhongping, a military commentator in Beijing, said China had superior equipment, but \u201cRussia has more combat experience.\"",
      "\u201cRussia and China have their own relative strengths in paratrooping,\u201d Song said. They \"conducted joint air, sea patrols and drills, which indicates they are learning from each other\u2019s strengths to address their own weaknesses.\"",

      "PARIS -- Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy faces up to 10 years in prison if a Paris court convicts him of secretly using funds from the Libyan government of late dictator Moammar Gadhafi to finance his presidential campaign in 2007.",
      "The verdict is expected on Thursday. If convicted, the 70-year-old Sarkozy would be the first former French president found guilty of accepting illegal foreign funds to win office.",
      "Sarkozy, who was elected in 2007 but lost his bid for reelection in 2012, has denied all wrongdoing during a three-month trial earlier this year that also involved 11 co-defendants, including three former ministers.",
      "Despite multiple legal scandals that have clouded his presidential legacy, Sarkozy remains an influential figure in right-wing politics in France and in entertainment circles, by virtue of his marriage to singer and model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy.",
      "Sarkozy can appeal a guilty verdict, which would suspend the sentence pending the appeal. Prosecutors have argued for a seven-year prison sentence.",
      "The accusations trace their roots to 2011, when a Libyan news agency and Gadhafi himself said that the Libyan state had secretly funneled millions of euros into Sarkozy\u2019s 2007 campaign.",
      "In 2012, the French investigative outlet Mediapart published what it said was a Libyan intelligence memo referencing a 50 million-euro funding agreement. Sarkozy denounced the document as a forgery and sued for defamation.",
      "French magistrates later said that the memo appeared to be authentic, though no conclusive evidence of a completed transaction was presented at the three-month Paris trial.",
      "Investigators also looked into a series of trips to Libya made by people close to Sarkozy when he served as interior minister from 2005 and 2007, including his chief of staff.",
      "In 2016, Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine told Mediapart that he had delivered suitcases filled with cash from Tripoli to the French Interior Ministry under Sarkozy. He later retracted his statement.",
      "That reversal is now the focus of a separate investigation into possible witness tampering. Both Sarkozy and his wife, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, were handed preliminary charges for involvement in alleged efforts to pressure Takieddine. That case has not gone to trial yet.",
      "Takieddine, who was one of the co-defendants, died on Tuesday in Beirut, Lebanon, his lawyer Elise Arfi said. He was 75. He had fled to Lebanon in 2020 and did not attend the trial.",
      "Sarkozy was tried on charges of passive corruption, illegal campaign financing, concealment of the embezzlement of public funds and criminal association. Prosecutors alleged that Sarkozy had knowingly benefited from what they described as a \u201ccorruption pact\u201d with Gadhafi\u2019s government.",

      "LONDON -- Apple wants the European Union to repeal its digital competition rule book, saying the regulations are cumbersome and are delaying new features for Europeans such as live translation for AirPods.",
      "The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive branch, said Thursday that's not going to happen.",
      "\u201cThere is absolutely no intention from the Commission\u2019s side to repeal the DMA,\u201d said Commission spokesman Thomas Regnier, referring to the Digital Markets Act.",
      "The iPhone maker outlined its complaints the day before in a response to a consultation on the DMA, a sweeping set of rules designed to stop Big Tech companies from dominating markets.",
      "The company said \"the DMA should be repealed\" or scaled back, saying it\u2019s undermining innovation and eroding privacy and security.",
      "Apple has long opposed the law and was one of the first companies to be fined after the rules took effect last year, with a 500 million euro ($587 million) penalty in an app store case.",
      "Apple said Europeans are being left behind the rest of the world because it has to spend more time trying to figure out how to get new features to comply with the rule book.",
      "\u201cThe DMA requires Apple to make certain features work on non-Apple products and apps before we can share them with our users,\u201d the company said in a blog post. \u201cUnfortunately, that requires a lot of engineering work, and it\u2019s caused us to delay some new features in the EU.\"",
      "For example, under the DMA, the live translation feature that Apple unveiled earlier this month for use with AirPods would also have to work with wireless earbuds from other brands. The feature uses an iPhone's on-device AI to translate when other languages are spoken around the person using them. Apple says it needs more work to make sure conversations, which are processed on the device, stay private if used with non-Apple products.",

      "\u201cToday, there is only one real thing to say: Sorry,\u201d Frederiksen said in Danish, after Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen delivered a somber address in Greenlandic. \u201cSorry for the wrong that was done to you because you were Greenlanders. Sorry for what was taken from you, and for the pain it caused.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of you have been fighting for years for justice and for us to listen, for us to take responsibility, and we\u2019re doing that now: Denmark and Greenland together,\" Frederiksen said, lamenting \"a chapter in our shared history that should never have been written.\u201d",

It\u2019s not known how many of those cases lacked consent.",

State broadcaster CCTV said the typhoon made landfall along the coast of Hailing Island in Yangjiang city at about 5 p.m., packing maximum winds near the center of 144 kph (89 mph). Violent winds battered trees and buildings, with torrential rain lowering visibility, video from Xinhua showed.",
      "The typhoon is forecast to keep moving west, prompting the suspension of some train services in the Gunagxi region on Thursday. Chinese officials allocated tens of millions of dollars for relief efforts.",
      "Schools, factories and transportation services were initially suspended in about a dozen cities, but a few of them distant from the landfall location were preparing to resume work as winds weakened.",
      "The fierce winds, brought by Ragasa, once a super typhoon, woke Hong Kong residents in the early hours, and many went online to describe scenes like a kitchen ventilation fan being blown down and a crane swaying.",
      "Strong winds blew away parts of a pedestrian bridge\u2019s roof and knocked down hundreds of trees across the city. A vessel crashed into the shore, shattering a row of glass railings along the waterfront. Areas around some rivers and promenades were flooded, including cycling lanes and playgrounds. At several promenade restaurants, furniture was scattered chaotically by the winds. 90 injured people were treated at hospitals.",

      "Hong Kong and Macao, a nearby casino hub, canceled schools and flights, with many shops closed. Hundreds of people sought refuge in temporary centers in each city. Streets in Macao turned into streams with debris floating on the water. Rescue crews deployed inflatable boats to save those who were trapped. The gambling city's local electricity supplier suspended its power supply in some flooded, low-lying areas for safety. As the winds eased, some waded into flooded streets to catch fish.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s observatory said Ragasa had maximum sustained winds near the center of about 195 kph (120 mph) and skirted around 100 kilometers (62 miles) to the south of the city. Hong Kong categorizes cyclones with sustained winds 185 kph or stronger as super typhoons to make residents extra vigilant about intense storms.",
      "The observatory said Ragasa is the strongest tropical cyclone in the northwestern Pacific and South China Sea region so far this year. Preliminary analysis showed it also ranks as the second-strongest one in the South China Sea region since the observatory's record-keeping began in 1950, tying with typhoons Saola in 2023 and Yagi in 2024, it said.",

      "Iran has begun rebuilding missile-production sites targeted by Israel during its 12-day war in June",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran has begun rebuilding missile-production sites targeted by Israel during its 12-day war in June, satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press show, but a key component is likely still missing \u2014 the large mixers needed to produce solid fuel for the weapons.",
      "Reconstituting the missile program is crucial for the Islamic Republic, which believes another round of war with Israel may happen. The missiles are one of Iran\u2019s few military deterrents after the war decimated its air defense systems \u2014 something that Tehran long has insisted will never be included in negotiations with the West.",
      "Missile experts told AP that obtaining the mixers is a goal for Tehran, particularly as it prepares for possible United Nations sanctions to be reimposed on the country later this month. The sanctions would penalize any development of the missile program, among other measures. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian is due to address the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.",
      "Known as planetary mixers, the machines feature blades that revolve around a central point, like orbiting planets, and offer better mixing action than other types of equipment. Iran could purchase them from China, where experts and U.S. officials say they've purchased missile fuel ingredients and other components in the past.",
      "\"If they\u2019re able to reacquire some key things like planetary mixers, then that infrastructure is still there and ready to get rolling again,\u201d said Sam Lair, a research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies who studied Iranian missile sites.",
      "Iran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to questions about the country's efforts to rebuild its missile program.",
      "Solid-fuel missiles can be fired faster than those using liquid fuel, which must be loaded just before launch. That speed can make the difference between launching a missile and having it destroyed in a launcher \u2014 something that happened during the war with Israel.",
      "Iran has solid-fuel missile manufacturing bases at Khojir and Parchin, two sites just outside Tehran, as well as at Shahroud, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) northeast of the capital. Even before the most recent war, all of those sites came under Israeli attack in October 2024 during hostilities between the countries.",
      "Attacks during the war in June appeared aimed at destroying buildings that housed the mixers, which are needed to ensure the missile fuel is evenly combined, according to experts. Other sites struck by Israel included manufacturing facilities that likely could be used to make the mixers.",
      "Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC taken this month and analyzed by AP show construction at both the Parchin and Shahroud facilities.",
      "At Parchin, mixing buildings appear to be under repair, Lair said, and similar rebuilding is happening at Shahroud involving mixing buildings and other structures.",
      "The speed at which Iran is rebuilding shows the importance Tehran puts on its missile program. Iran's bombed nuclear sites so far have not seen the same level of activity.",
      "During the war, Iran fired 574 ballistic missiles at Israel, according to the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National Security of America, which has a close relationship with the Israeli military. In two exchanges of fire before the war, Iran launched another 330 missiles, the think tank said.",
      "The Israeli military had estimated Iran's total arsenal at around 2,500 missiles, meaning that over a third of its missiles were fired.",
      "Before the war, Iran was on track to be able to produce more than 200 solid-fuel missiles a month, said Carl Parkin, a summer fellow at the James Martin Center. That drew Israeli strikes to missile-building facilities.",
      "\u201cIsrael\u2019s targeting indicates that they believed mixing was a bottleneck in Iran\u2019s missile production,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Iran is able to overcome their mixing limitations, they\u2019ll have all the casting capacity that they need to start producing at high volumes again.\u201d",

      "Meanwhile, Iran's Revolutionary Guard likely supplied a planetary mixer to an underground ballistic missile construction facility in Syria near the town of Masyaf, some 170 kilometers (105 miles) north of the capital, Damascus, near the Lebanese border.

Iran's government has provided no detailed readout on what Pezeshkian said to Chinese President Xi Jinping, and China's state-run media offered no indications that Tehran asked for help.",

      "The many conferences on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly\u2019s annual gathering of world leaders offer a unique forum for companies and philanthropies to help shape an uncertain future",
      "NEW YORK -- A passing comment in a hotel hallway at one of the many conferences on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly's annual high-level meetings this past week may have turned into a solution.",
      "A global antipoverty nonprofit executive, recently returned from Zambia, mentioned that a hospital there had just one incubator, warmer and resuscitator for the fifty-some babies born daily.",
      "The conversation could've ended there with an empathetic response. But in this case, leaders of a corporate-nonprofit alliance providing medical equipment to those in need heard the story. And in this case, Children International President Susana Eshleman said help may come by year's end.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very encouraging and inspiring to be here,\" she said. \"It feels like a shot in the arm sometimes when the work that we\u2019re doing is hard and the global situation, given all the recent developments, is particularly hard.\u201d",
      "In a year marked by significant foreign aid pullbacks from the U.S. and other wealthy countries, the exchange provides a glimpse into the unique connective tissue that still draws foundations, nonprofits, corporations and international actors to what attendees call UNGA week.",
      "The meetings at Manhattan ballrooms and intimate townhouse dinners solidify relationships and hasten coordination, made even more impactful by the sheer number of parties. This year, attendees described more pragmatic, focused and galvanizing discussions than before, placing a greater emphasis on the roles companies and philanthropies must play in shaping an uncertain future.",
      "Conversations, in private and on stages, would generally open with the impact of aid cuts on a particular organization, but quickly move to the group's pivots and current needs. Former President Bill Clinton began the Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting with a list of the world's issues currently worrying him. But he ended it with the message: \u201cBe caught trying.\u201d",
      "Philanthropists' interest in engaging with the private sector was evident in some of the heaviest hitters\u2019 announcements.",
      "At his global forum on Wednesday in The Plaza Hotel, billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg unveiled a new partnership with the African Development Bank Group to bring more investment to the continent.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s certainly no shortage of challenges to discuss over there,\u201d said Bloomberg, referencing the U.N. headquarters. \u201cBut the truth is, in a world that\u2019s more interconnected and fast-moving than ever, the biggest problems can\u2019t be solved by national governments alone.\u201d",
      "At the Clinton Global Initiative, which retooled this year's meeting to focus on working groups, ballrooms across the New York Hilton Midtown were packed with hundreds of front line workers, policy experts, foundation donors and NGO representatives divided into groups of 10 to discuss specific problems and potential solutions.",
      "The working groups yielded numerous new initiatives, ranging from a social enterprise fund from Kiva Microfunds alongside corporate foundations to a new Global Network for National Service.",
      "At Rockefeller Foundation headquarters, former heads of state, major foundations\u2019 leaders and global health experts gathered around a table Monday to reimagine international development systems weakened by foreign aid cuts.",
      "The Rockefeller Foundation committed $50 million to the effort. Rajiv Shah, the foundation\u2019s president, said that includes upgrading a critical famine early warning system, created by the U.S. Agency for International Development, and diversifying its financing so no one political party can take it away.",
      "The Clinton Health Access Initiative announced its partnership with Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Unitaid, and Wits RHI to provide Gilead Sciences\u2019 HIV prevention drug lenacapavir in 120 low- and middle-income countries. The Gates Foundation announced a similar deal with Indian pharmaceutical manufacturer Hetero Labs.",
      "Bill Gates also announced the foundation would pledge $912 million to the Global Fund\u2019s replenishment campaign to fight AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.",
      "But, for all the talk of non-governmental funders' importance, philanthropic leaders emphasized they cannot do it alone. Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said he hopes their commitment to the Global Fund spurs the U.S. and other countries to step up.",
      "\u201cThere is no possible way any philanthropy, any combination of philanthropies, can fill the gap,\" Suzman said Wednesday.",

Some advocates trod lightly between rallying their cause and avoiding any missteps that might suggest opposition to U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. Concerns about obtaining visas prompted some to travel with fewer staff than usual.",

      "Matt Freeman, executive director of Stronger Foundations for Nutrition, said previous UNGA weeks have been filled with concurrent events where advocates fight for the same limited audience. He sensed a stronger spirit of collective action this year.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s been really heartwarming,\" he said. \"Because you could imagine in a moment of scarcity that everyone\u2019s elbows become sharper and they\u2019re fighting for the pie.\"",
      "Kitty van der Heijden, the deputy executive director of partnerships at the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, said her week on the sidelines had been a mix of disappointment and excitement. She said UNICEF, which faces at least a 20% cut in revenue next year, will cut staff and look for other ways to save money.",

      "\u201cWe should definitely come back again,\u201d says Jess Jones, a 34-year-old marine biologist from Edinburgh, Scotland. \u201cThe vibe and the welcome that we got there was really nice.\u201d",
      "That the festival occurred at all is a tribute to the area\u2019s natural beauty, and the resilience of its people.",
      "Signs of progress are mixed with still-visible scars from Helene in this town about 24 miles (39 kilometers) east of Asheville. Most of Old Fort\u2019s shops have reopened, even as workers continue clawing away at a debris pile downtown and some homes remain unlivable.",
      "Like other businesspeople in this tourist-dependent mountain region, bike shop owner Chad Schoenauer has been banking on a strong fall leaf-peeping season to help get him back on track after Helene. But many seem to assume Old Fort is still a wasteland.",
      "\u201c\u2018Oh, I didn\u2019t know that you were open,\u2019\u201d he says is a typical reaction.",
      "When Helene swept through, Old Fort was well on its way to remaking itself as an outdoor destination, especially after furniture manufacturer Ethan Allen laid off 325 workers when it converted its factory there into a distribution center in 2019.",
      "\u201cWhen the Ethan Allen layoff happened, local leaders started coming together and saying, `How do we use these beautiful natural assets that we have to diversify the manufacturing economy?\u2019\u201d says Kim Effler, president and CEO of the McDowell Chamber of Commerce.",
      "Named for a Revolutionary War-era stockade, the town decided to become a world-class destination for hiking, running, horseback riding and, most notably, mountain biking.",
      "\u201cWe have a red clay that makes some of the best trails in the country,\u201d FloatLife founder Justyn Thompson says. \u201cThe trails are epic.\u201d",
      "In 2021, the G5 Trail Collective \u2014 a program led by the nonprofit Camp Grier outdoors complex \u2014 got the U.S. Forest Service to agree to 42 miles (68 kilometers) of new multi-purpose trails. The effort began paying dividends almost immediately.",
      "\u201cFor every trail that we were able to open, we saw a new business open up in town,\u201d says Jason McDougald, the camp\u2019s executive director.",
      "The collective had just completed the 21st mile (34th kilometer) of trail when Helene, in Schoenauer\u2019s words, hit \u201cthe reset button\u201d by washing away trails and damaging businesses.",
      "When the storm blew through on Sept. 27, 2024, the Catawba River converged with the normally placid Mill Creek, leaving much of downtown under several feet of muddy water.",
      "Schoenauer, who opened his Old Fort Bike Shop in 2021, says it took two days before he could make it to town to assess damage to the business housed in a refurbished 1901 former general store.",
      "\u201cI was numb coming all the way here,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd as soon as I got off the exit, I started crying.\u201d",
      "The water rose more than 3 feet (1 meter) inside the shop, leaving behind a 10-inch (25-centimeter) layer of reddish-brown mud. The beautiful heart pine floors buckled.",

      "The company has sent about 84 million pounds (38 million kilograms) of shrimp to U.S. ports this year, according to data from Import Genius, a trade data analysis company. It supplies about 6% of foreign shrimp imported in the U.S.",
      "This month, FDA officials detected cesium 137 in one sample of cloves exported by PT Natural Java Spice, which sends spices to the U.S. and other countries. Records show the company sent about 440,000 pounds ( 200,000 kilograms) of cloves to the U.S. this year.",
      "No food that triggered alerts or tested positive has been released for sale in the U.S., FDA officials emphasized.",

      "The Transportation Department will immediately tighten up the requirements for non-citizens to get commercial drivers licenses after three fatal crashes this year that officials say were caused by immigrant truck drivers who never should have received licenses.",
      "The nationwide audit of these licenses began after a fatal U-turn crash in Florida that killed two people caused by a truck driver who officials said was in the country illegally. But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said fatal crashes caused by truck drivers who shouldn\u2019t have had licenses were also found in Texas and Alabama earlier this year.",
      "Duffy also threatened to revoke $160 million in federal funding for California because investigators found that one in four of the 145 commercial drivers licenses for non-citizens issued since June that they reviewed should have never been issued under the current rules. That state has 30 days to audit its program and come up with a plan to comply or it will lose funding.",
      "Duffy said the current rules aren\u2019t strict enough and a number of states aren\u2019t following them. The audit found licenses that were issued improperly in California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, and Washington.",
      "\u201cWe have a government system designed to keep American families on the road safe. But that system has been compromised,\u201d Duffy said.",
      "Previously, Duffy threatened to pull some federal funding from California, Washington and New Mexico for failing to enforce English proficiency requirements for truckers that went into effect this summer. The Transportation Department is still reviewing the responses from those states.",
      "All states must pause issuing commercial drivers licenses to non-citizens until they can comply with the new rules.",
      "Officials said the new rules would mean that roughly 190,000 of the 200,000 non-citizens that currently hold one of these commercial licenses should never have received one, but the rules aren't retroactive so those drivers won't lose their licenses. Only drivers who have either an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa will now be eligible to get a commercial driver's license. Just having an employment authorization document won't be enough.",
      "The Florida crash drew outrage from President Donald Trump and Duffy and inspired a political fight between the governors of Florida and California. It also put Sikh truck drivers in the crossfire because the truck driver in the Florida crash is a member of that faith.",
      "On August 12, Harjinder Singh made the illegal turn from northbound lanes of Florida\u2019s Turnpike about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of West Palm Beach, the Florida Highway Patrol said. A minivan that was traveling behind him was unable to avoid the truck\u2019s trailer, which blocked the northbound lanes.",
      "Two passengers in the minivan died at the scene and the driver died at a hospital. Singh and a passenger in his truck were not injured.",

      "The Washington attorney who brokered book deals for Barack Obama, George W. Bush and dozens of other government leaders has died at age 79",
      "NEW YORK -- Robert B. Barnett, a powerhouse Washington attorney who became a fixture in the political and publishing worlds as the literary representative for Barack and Michelle Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton and dozens of other leaders, has died at age 79.",
      "Barnett's executive assistant, Ashley Duffy, told The Associated Press that he died Thursday night. Additional details were not immediately available.",
      "A stocky, raspy-voiced man with tortoise shell glasses, antique cuff links and a knack for being both forthright and discrete, Bob Barnett embodied an era when it was possible to work freely with both Democrats and Republicans and politics could stop at the edge of a good book deal. He was a longtime Democrat, working on Jimmy Carter's 1976 campaign and helping Bill Clinton and other candidates in debate preparation. But he would broker contracts for such a wide range of political figures that he liked to joke that should his clients all gather in one room the result would be \u201cWorld War III.\u201d",
      "He was a partner at the high-end law firm Williams & Connolly, and for more than 20 years no one approached his stature as an intermediary between the Washington elite and New York publishers. From the early 1990s through the end of the Obama administration, in 2017, Barnett represented three consecutive presidents and first ladies \u2014 the Clintons, George W. and Laura Bush and the Obamas \u2014 and much of the remaining A-list political players, from Ted Kennedy and Mitch McConnell to Dick Cheney and Joe Biden, from Paul Ryan and Donald Rumsfeld to Al Franken and Elizabeth Warren.",
      "Barnett was called upon so often by politicians leaving office that he became known as \u201cthe doorman to Washington\u2019s revolving door.\u201d",
      "He was not an agent, he liked to point out, but an attorney who billed clients by the hour instead of receiving a percentage of royalties. It was a unique business arrangement that priced out the average writer, but well rewarded Obama, the Clintons and others who landed multi-million dollar deals.",
      "The general public could have made good money betting on Barnett's authors to prevail in elections. In six consecutive presidential races, from 1992-2012, a current or future Barnett client was elected, often defeating a non-Barnett client.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s one of the sagest advisers I\u2019ve ever been able to call upon,\u201d Republican strategist Karl Rove, a Barnett client and top aide to George W. Bush, told Politico in 2017. \u201cHe has counseled me on every professional decision I\u2019ve made.\"",
      "Barnett also handled negotiations for media executives and reporters (Roger Ailes, Bob Woodward, Chris Wallace), musical superstars (Elton John, Barbra Streisand), business leaders (Jack Welch, Phil Knight), international leaders (former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Queen Noor of Jordan) and one of the world's best-selling novelists, James Patterson. For years, he was not only representing presidents, but Jake Tapper, Brit Hume and other White House reporters who covered them. One of the best-selling political novels in recent years, \u201cThe President Is Missing,\u201d was a collaboration conceived by Barnett for Patterson and Bill Clinton.",
      "His political winning streak ended after 2016 when non-client Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. He was disdainful of Trump and eventually overtaken by the Creative Artists Agency and such younger Washington players as the Javelin literary agency.",
      "Asked in 2012 by the British law firm Chamber Associates how he wanted to be remembered, Barnett responded. \u201c\u2018He was loyal, kept confidences, and tried his best. He was a good husband, father, grandfather, counselor, and friend.\" Around the same time, Obama offered a wryer take, as recorded in Mark Leibovich\u2019s bestselling political chronicle \u201cThis Town.\u201d",

      "Barnett was part of the team helping Obama prepare for his 2012 debates with Republican challenger Mitt Romney, and was known among the president\u2019s advisers for his quintessentially insider observations. When Barnett prefaced one of his comments with \u201cthe conventional wisdom is,\u201d Obama responded, \u201cBob, you ARE the conventional wisdom.\u201d",
      "In 1972, Barnett married Rita Braver, a fellow graduate of the University of Wisconsin and a future CBS television correspondent. They had a daughter, Meredith.",
      "A native of Waukegan, Illinois, Robert Bruce Barnett graduated as senior class president from Waukegan High School, majored in political science at the University of Wisconsin and received a law degree from the University of Chicago. He moved to Washington in the early 1970s, clerking for Supreme Court Justice Byron White and working as aide to then-Sen. Walter Mondale of Minnesota. In 1975, he joined Williams & Connolly, and was made a partner three years later. Beyond his political clients, he also represented numerous corporations and businesses, including Deutsche Bank, McDonald's and JM Family Enterprises.",
      "Barnett did not plan his rise in book publishing. He had helped Vice Presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro prepare for her 1984 debate against George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan's vice president, and consulted with her when reports came out about her husband's alleged ties to organized crime. After the election, Ferraro asked him to help find a publisher for her memoir. Barnett, as inexperienced about publishing a book as Ferraro was about writing one, worked with New York agent Esther Newberg on a 7-figure deal with Bantam Books. Soon after, he arranged a lucrative deal for David Stockman, the first budget director in the Reagan administration.",
      "Among political leaders, he was especially close to the Clintons. They turned to him when White House aide and family friend Vince Foster killed himself in 1993 and when news broke that Bill Clinton had an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. His influence was never greater than in 2008, during the Democratic presidential primary. The main contenders were his longtime client, Hillary Clinton, and a new client, Obama, who had dropped his previous agent and turned to Barnett to make a deal for \u201cThe Audacity of Hope,\u201d one of history's bestselling political books and a key factor in his stunning rise.",
      "After a long and emotional primary campaign, Clinton, who had been heavily favored, conceded in June 2008 and began negotiating her role at the Democratic National Convention. The negotiations were handled by Barnett. By the end of the year, Obama had been elected (defeating the non-Barnett client Sen. John McCain) and Barnett was arranging a multi-million dollar deal for another client, the outgoing president, George W. Bush.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader John Thune is rejecting Democratic demands on health care as unserious but says a government shutdown is still \u201cavoidable\u201d despite sharp divisions ahead of Wednesday's funding deadline.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a big believer that there\u2019s always a way out,\u201d the South Dakota Republican said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. \u201cAnd I think there are off-ramps here, but I don\u2019t think that the negotiating position, at least at the moment, that the Democrats are trying to exert here is going to get you there.\u201d",
      "Thune said Democrats are going to have to \u201cdial back\u201d their demands, which include immediately extending health insurance subsidies and reversing the health care policies in the massive tax bill that Republicans passed over the summer. Absent that, Thune said, \u201cwe\u2019re probably plunging forward toward the shutdown.\u201d",
      "It's just the latest standoff in Washington over government funding, stretching back through several administrations. President Donald Trump was the driving force behind the longest shutdown ever during his first term, as he sought money for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. This time it is Democrats who are making demands as they face intense pressure from their core supporters to stand up to the Republican president and his policies.",
      "Democrats have shown little signs of relenting, just before spending runs out Wednesday. Their position remained the same even after the White House Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday released a memo that said agencies should consider a \u201creduction in force\u201d for many federal programs if the government closes \u2014 meaning thousands of federal workers could be permanently laid off.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the OMB memo was simply an \u201cattempt at intimidation\u201d and predicted the \u201cunnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back.\u201d",
      "Thune stopped short of criticizing the White House threat of mass layoffs, saying the situation remains \u201ca hypothetical.\u201d Still, he said no one should be surprised by the memo as \u201ceveryone knows Russ Vought,\u201d the head of the Office of Management and Budget, and his longtime advocacy for slashing government.",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s all avoidable,\u201d Thune said. \u201cAnd so if they don\u2019t want to go down that path, there\u2019s a way to avoid going down that path.\u201d",
      "One way to avoid a shutdown, Thune said, would be for enough Democrats to vote with Republicans for a stripped-down \u201cclean\u201d bill to keep the government open for the next seven weeks while negotiations on spending continue. That\u2019s how Republicans avoided a shutdown in March, when Schumer and several other Democrats decided at the last minute to vote with Republicans \u2014 to great political cost when Schumer's party then revolted.",
      "A seven-week funding bill has already passed the House.",
      "\u201cWhat would eight Democrats be willing to support?\u201d Thune asked. \u201cIn terms of a path forward, or at least understanding what that path forward looks like.\u201d",

Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky both opposed it in preliminary votes last week. A competing bill from Democrats also fell well short of 60 votes.",
      "Thune suggested some individual bipartisan bills to fund parts of the government for the next year could be part of a compromise, \u201cbut that requires cooperation from both sides,\u201d he said.",
      "Democrats say they are frustrated that Thune hasn\u2019t approached them to negotiate \u2014 and that Trump abruptly canceled a meeting with Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York that had been scheduled for this week. Trump wrote on social media, \u201cI have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive.\u201d",
      "Thune said he \u201cdid have a conversation with the president\u201d and offered his opinion on the meeting, which he declined to disclose. \u201cBut I think the president speaks for himself, and I think he came to the conclusion that that meeting would not be productive,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Still, he says he thinks Trump could be open to a negotiation on the expanded health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year if Democrats weren't threatening a shutdown. Many people who receive the subsidies through the marketplaces set up by the Affordable Care Act are expected to see a sharp rise in premiums if Congress doesn\u2019t extend them.",
      "Some Republicans have agreed with Democrats that keeping the subsidies is necessary, but Thune says \u201creform is going to have to be a big part of it.\u201d Democrats are likely to oppose such changes.",
      "By Monday, when the Senate returns to session, lawmakers will have just over 24 hours to avoid federal closures.",
      "Thune said he intends to bring up the bills that were rejected last week. \u201cThey\u2019ll get multiple chances to vote,\u201d he said, before a government shutdown begins at midnight Wednesday.",
      "He said he hopes \u201ccooler heads will prevail.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think shutdowns benefit anybody, least of all the American people,\u201d Thune said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Department of Government Efficiency's remaking of the federal workforce has battered the Washington job market and put more households in the metropolitan area in financial distress, according to a report released Wednesday.",
      "The number of homes for sale in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia region, also known as the DMV, is up by 64% since June 2024, and the region\u2019s unemployment rate is the highest in the nation, according to the DMV Monitor, a real-time data interactive created by the Brookings Institution with the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments.",

      "From the start of President Donald Trump's second term in January, DOGE, led by his then-adviser Elon Musk, instigated purges of federal agencies with the expressed mission of rooting out fraud, waste and abuse. DOGE led to tens of thousands of job cuts, including layoffs and people who accepted financial incentives to quit. Some people were rehired, a reflection of the haphazard process. Although losses were felt around the country, the Washington area was particularly hard hit.",
      "Scott Kupor, director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, said last month that there will be 300,000 fewer federal workers on the payroll nationwide by the end of the year. The government has about 2.5 million workers, including military members.",
      "Contractors have been affected, too. DOGE's website states that 13,231 federal government contracts have been terminated, totaling $59 billion in savings. In fiscal year 2024, more than 100,000 companies received contracts, totaling roughly $774 billion.",
      "Besides the mass layoffs, the Republican president's other actions to remake the image of the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 including deploying National Guard troops and federalizing the city\u2019s local Metropolitan Police Department \u2014 \u201ccould shape consumer spending and investment in the local economy,\u201d the report says.",
      "The report also says private-sector job growth is stagnating, \u201cwith many new jobs not aligned with the skills and experiences of most laid-off federal workers.\u201d",

      "Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said D.C. \u201chas often had the highest unemployment rate in the nation, even during Joe Biden\u2019s federal hiring frenzy.\u201d D.C.'s unemployment rate hit 11.3% at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and fell to 5.3% at the end of Biden's presidency. \u201cThis longstanding problem is due to an overreliance on federal bloat and sky-high crime, two problems that President Trump is quickly and successfully fixing by cracking down on crime in the Nation\u2019s capital and implementing supply-side reforms that have already created over half a million private-sector jobs for American-born workers,\u201d Rogers said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan group of former Federal Reserve chairs, Treasury secretaries, and top White House economists urged the Supreme Court Thursday to reject an attempt by President Donald Trump to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook.",
      "In a filing with the court, the former officials argued that allowing the removal to proceed would undermine the Fed's longtime independence from day-to-day politics and lead to higher inflation and a weaker economy.",
      "The filing from such an influential group underscores the unpredecented nature of Trump's effort to remove Cook and the potentially far-reaching consequences for the economy if he were to succeed.",
      "\u201cThere is broad consensus among economists, based on decades of macroeconomic research, that a more independent central bank will lead to lower and more stable inflation without creating higher unemployment,\u201d the brief, signed by 18 top economists from both political parties, said. \u201cIndependent central banks also help increase confidence in the stability of the U.S. dollar, enabling the United States, businesses, and households to borrow at lower interest rates.\u201d",
      "Former Fed chairs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Alan Greenspan signed onto the filing. Former Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson, Lawrence Summers, Robert Rubin, Timothy Geithner, and Jacob Lew also signed. Paulson served in the George W. Bush administration while Rubin and Summers served in Bill Clinton's administration. Geithner and Lew served in President Barack Obama's White House.",
      "Trump sought to fire Lisa Cook last month after members of the administration accused her of mortgage fraud, the first time a president has tried to remove a Federal Reserve governor in the institution's 112-year history. Cook has denied the accusations and some documents have surfaced that appear to undercut the fraud claims.",
      "Cook sued to keep her job and two federal courts have ruled that she can stay in her position while her case is considered by the courts.",
      "Federal Reserve officials aren't like cabinet secretaries and don't serve at the pleasure of the president. Instead, they can only be fired \u201cfor cause,\u201d which has traditionally meant some kind of malfeasance or neglect on the job. At issue in the legal fight is whether the mortgage fraud allegations are sufficient cause for her to be removed. Governors vote on the Fed's interest-rate policies as well as oversee banking regulation.",
      "Bernanke and the other former officials argued in their filing that the perception of Fed independence is crucial for the central bank, because it can fight inflation much more effectively if businesses and workers \u2014 whom the filing refers to as \u201cprice-setters\u201d \u2014 believe the Fed will fight to keep inflation at its 2% target.",

The Fed typically seeks to combat inflation by raising its short-term interest rate to cool borrowing and spending.",
      "But if political pressure forces the Fed to shift its focus away from inflation and instead lower its key interest rate to provide a short-term boost to the economy, \u201cthe price-setters will not believe a future Fed announcement of a commitment to low-inflation policies and will therefore not structure their own economic decisions around the expectation of low inflation,\" the brief said. \u201cInstead, price-setters will expect inflation to go up and act accordingly, leading to a vicious cycle of high inflation and low employment.\u201d",
      "\u201cCentral bank independence is the solution that Congress and the President have chosen, effectively tying their hands, like Ulysses as he passed the sirens, to protect against the risk that monetary policy will be mishandled,\u201d they added.",
      "Former officials from both parties also signed onto the brief, including Phil Gramm, a former Republican senator from Texas, as well as Jason Furman, who was a top economic adviser to Obama; Glenn Hubbard and Gregory Mankiw, economic advisers to George W. Bush; Kenneth Rogoff, former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund; and Cecilia Rouse, a top adviser to former president Joe Biden.",
      "John Cochrane, a frequent Fed critic and a senior fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution signed onto the brief, as did Jared Bernstein, an adviser to Biden.",

      "WOODFIN, N.C. -- Bracing himself against the current in waist-deep water, Clancy Loorham wrestles a broken length of PVC pipe from the rocky bottom of the French Broad River and peers inside.",
      "\u201cI got a catfish in the pipe,\u201d the 27-year-old with wispy beard and mustache shouted to fellow cleanup workers floating nearby in rafts, canoes and kayaks piled with plastic pipe and other human-made detritus. \u201cHe\u2019s right here. I\u2019m looking him in the eyes!\u201d",
      "It\u2019s been just a year since floodwaters from the remnants of Hurricane Helene washed these pipes out of a nearby factory with such force that some pieces ended up in Douglas Lake, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) away in Tennessee. But they're already slick with algae and filled with river silt \u2014 and creatures.",
      "Helene killed more than 250 people and caused nearly $80 billion in damage from Florida to the Carolinas. In the North Carolina mountains, rains of up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) turned gentle streams into torrents that swept away trees, boulders, homes and vehicles, shattered century-old flood records, and in some places carved out new channels.",
      "In the haste to rescue people and restore their lives to some semblance of normalcy, some fear the recovery efforts compounded Helene\u2019s impact on the ecosystem. Contractors hired to remove vehicles, shipping containers, shattered houses and other large debris from waterways sometimes damaged sensitive habitat.",
      "\u201cThey were using the river almost as a highway in some situations,\u201d said Peter Raabe, Southeast regional director for the conservation group American Rivers.",

      "\u201cThose trees kind of create fish habitats,\u201d he said. \u201cThey slow the flow of water down. They\u2019re an important part of a river system, and we\u2019ve seen kind of a disregard for that.\u201d",
      "The Army Corps of Engineers said in a statement that debris removal missions \u201care often challenging\u201d due to the large volume storms can leave behind across a wide area. The Corps said it trains its contractors to minimize disturbances to waterways and to prevent harm to wildlife. North Carolina Emergency Management said debris removal after Helene took into account safety and the environment, and that projects reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency met that agency\u2019s standards for minimizing impact.",
      "Hannah Woodburn, who tracks the headwaters and tributaries of the New River as MountainTrue's Upper New Riverkeeper, said waters are much muddier since Helene, both from storm-related vegetation loss and from heavy machinery used during cleanup.",
      "She said it's been bad for the eastern hellbender, a \u201cspecies of special concern\u201d in North Carolina. It's one of only three giant salamanders found in the world, growing up to 2 feet (61 centimeters) long and weighing more than 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms).",
      "\u201cAfter the storm, we had so many reports and pictures of dead hellbenders, some nearly a mile from the stream once the waters receded,\u201d said Woodburn.",
      "Of even greater concern is the Appalachian elktoe, a federally endangered mussel found only in the mountains of North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. Helene hurt the Appalachian elktoe, but it also suffered from human-caused damage, said Mike Perkins, a state biologist.",
      "Perkins said some contractors coordinated with conservation teams ahead of river cleanups and took precautions. Others were not so careful.",
      "He described snorkeling in the cold waters of the Little River and \u201cfinding crushed individuals, some of them still barely alive, some with their insides hanging out.\u201d On that river, workers moved 60 Appalachian elktoe to a refuge site upstream. On the South Toe River, home to one of the most important populations, biologists collected a dozen and took them to a hatchery to store in tanks until it's safe to return them to the wild.",
      "\u201cIt was shocking and unprecedented in my professional line of work in 15 years,\u201d Perkins said of the incident. \u201cThere\u2019s all of these processes in place to prevent this secondary tragedy from happening, and none of it happened.\u201d",

      "Using rock, fill dirt and broken concrete dumped on his property by friendly debris-removal contractors, Paul has reclaimed the frontage the Swannanoa took. His wife planted it with marigolds for beauty and a weeping willow for stability. And they've purchased flood insurance.",

      "NEW YORK -- Did you buy a new pink dress to watch the Barbie movie, only to never wear it again? An Oura ring because your favorite TikTok influencer had it? A new pair of baggy jeans because '90s fashion is making a comeback?",
      "Niche trends fueled by social media can influence your shopping decisions. Participating often brings some happiness and a sense of community, but the problem comes when you do it so often that you\u2019re not using your money to achieve your financial goals, or worse, you get into debt, said Erika Rasure, chief financial wellness advisor for Beyond Finance, a financial services company.",
      "Whether it\u2019s coastal grandma or clean girl aesthetic, microtrends can take a significant toll on already-strained budgets as prices rise and Gen Z struggles to pay off debt.",
      "If you find yourself overspending to participate in microtrends, here are some expert recommendations:",
      "Before you click \u201cbuy\u201d on TikTok Shop, it\u2019s best if you take some time to reflect, said Jennifer Seitz, head of education for Greenlight, a financial literacy app for families. Pausing before a purchase can help you discern if the item is something you really want or a fleeting craving.",
      "\u201cThink if you want to put it in a schedule pause, whether it\u2019s 24 hours or even a couple of days if it\u2019s a larger expense,\u2033 Seitz said.",
      "Participating in personal challenges can be a good way to get in the habit of making purchases more deliberate. Back in 2022, Alyssa Barber participated in the no-buy year challenge, where she pledged to stop buying non-essential items for a year.",
      "Barber shares sustainable practices with over 370,000 followers on TikTok, where one of her recurrent themes is how to stop impulse buying. Barber said the challenge gave her perspective on how much she was spending on things she didn\u2019t need. Since then, she has changed her spending habits, focusing mainly on experiences.",
      "Taking a value-based spending approach can help you decide if you should participate in a trend you see online, Rasure said.",
      "If, for example, you want to build an emergency fund, having this goal in mind while shopping can help avoid unnecessary spending.",
      "Quynh Van, a 27-year-old UX designer from Minneapolis, was surprised by the number of ads on TikTok when she created an account after a four-year break from social media. And while being influenced by the ads is inevitable, she believes overspending comes in part from users not having defined goals.",
      "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t know who you are or what you like, you\u2019re so driven by over-consumerism and lifestyle creep because you don\u2019t have your values in order,\u2033 Van said.",
      "Rasure recommends using your financial values as a guiding principle for your spending decisions. If you\u2019re not sure of your values, allocate some time to map them out according to your life goals.",

      "\u201cJust that action of needing to input your payment information rather than just that simple click can help you give to really stop and think about purchases before moving ahead with them,\" she added.",
      "To add barriers, you can remove your credit card details from your computer browser or social media and disable Apple Pay on your phone.",

      "Dressed in shiny black sweatpants, a yellow, red and green top and a helmet, the 32-year-old cyclist was preparing for the road cycling world championships in neighboring Rwanda, the first time the event has taken place in Africa in its 104-year history.",
      "For Yiga and colleagues from his Fun Cycling Club, a small but growing community of riders in Uganda, the competition offered a chance to race alongside their heroes and maybe catapult a sport in Africa that has long felt like a pastime.",
      "\u201cThis is so big for the continent,\u201d said Yiga, who took up cycling during the COVID-19 pandemic to ride around lockdown public transport restrictions.",
      "Yiga said he will be excited to see Tadej Poga\u010dar, the reigning road race world champion and four-time Tour de France winner, in this week's championships in Rwanda. The Slovenian rider will compete Sunday in the men's elite road race, with the women's race set for Saturday.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see him (Poga\u010dar) ... because I have been seeing him on TV in the Tour de France. I can\u2019t wait,\u201d said the full-time cellphone repairer, before setting out on a 100-kilometer training ride.",
      "For Aziz Ssempijja, Yiga\u2019s teammate, it is more than just representing Uganda.",

      "Like others from Mali or South Sudan, many African riders race with vintage rim-brake bikes when professionals ride much more expensive machines. Yet they remain undeterred.",
      "The championships could provide a breakthrough moment for Africa, said Jacques Landry, director of the World Cycling Center, a development initiative set up by world cycling body UCI.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not a finality of what\u2019s going on in Africa. They\u2019re a rebirth of what can happen moving forward. I think for most of the national federations, they do see it as a way to ignite more activities in Africa, the linchpin of African cycling,\u201d said Landry.",
      "Across sub-Saharan Africa, cycling is still considered low-key, often associated with commuters or those of modest means. But its popularity is rising, with more local competitions giving riders, including children, \u201ca race to go to, whereas before there were no races,\u201d said Landry.",
      "Thousands of visitors have descended on Kigali, where the competition runs until Sunday. A global audience of over 300 million is expected to watch elite riders from about 100 nations test themselves on courses, including the men\u2019s 273-kilometer (179-mile) road race on Sunday up the Mur du Kigali with over 3,500 meters of elevation gain.",

    "story": [
      "Rep. John Moolenaar has requested an urgent briefing from the White House after Trump supported a deal giving Americans a majority stake in TikTok",
      "WASHINGTON -- The chairman of a House committee that pushed for the law demanding TikTok be spun off from its Chinese owners has requested an urgent briefing from the White House, one day after Trump signed an executive order supporting a proposed deal that would put the popular social video platform under U.S. ownership.",
      "In a statement released Friday, Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, praised the proposed deal as \"an important step\u201d in transitioning ownership of the TikTok platform to American hands but he emphasized that \u201cdivestment was not the law's only requirement.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance,\u201d Moolenaar said.",
      "The Michigan Republican's statement marks the first congressional effort to conduct oversight into the negotiations over TikTok, coming nearly two weeks after Chinese and American officials met in Spain to discuss a framework divestment deal for TikTok. Trump on Thursday signed an executive order providing support for the deal, and said Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to move forward with negotiations.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to an inquiry from the Associated Press regarding the urgent briefing.",
      "Much is still unknown about the actual deal in the works, but the new U.S. venture would license the famed ByteDance-owned algorithm that currently keeps TikTok users engaged. U.S. tech giant Oracle, a confirmed partner in the U.S. investment consortium that would own TikTok, would audit the copy of the algorithm and monitor it for security purposes.",
      "Vice President JD Vance on Thursday assured the public that the deal would not only keep TikTok operating but also protect Americans' data privacy as required by law. Moolenaar on Friday said he would like to know more.",
      "While algorithms are valuable assets, the real value of TikTok is its users, which is likely why the consortium won\u2019t just start from scratch to build a new app, said computer scientist Bart Knijnenburg, an associate professor at Clemson University who has studied how recommendation systems steer people to online content.",
      "Knijnenburg said all algorithms are biased in some way and if the administration is serious about retraining the TikTok algorithm to avoid Chinese influence, it should push for \u201cradical openness\u201d in TikTok\u2019s mechanics so that users have a window into how bias might be influencing their feeds.",
      "More than politics, Knijnenburg said the biggest problem with TikTok\u2019s algorithm is that it\u2019s geared toward addictive engagement and overuse.",
      "\u201cMoving it to the U.S. is not going to magically solve these types of problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAny company might put undue influence on these applications and from a business perspective, the best way to engage users is to make them addicted to watching these videos, which is not a good idea.\u201d",
      "Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, doubts that the deal, as revealed so far, complies with the law.",
      "\u201cThe law is clear: divestiture means severance, not supervision,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cA board seat for ByteDance or any continued role in maintaining the algorithm would flout Congress\u2019s mandate.\"",
      "Though the details have yet to be finalized, the U.S. investment group\u2019s controlling stake in the new venture would be around 80%. While ByteDance is expected to have a stake in the new venture, it would be less than 20% \u2014 a portion of the ownership reserved for foreign investors. The board running the new platform would be controlled by U.S. investors. ByteDance will be represented by one person on the board, but that individual will be excluded from any security-related matters.",

      "Singleton argues that a board foothold by ByteDance is not merely symbolic. \u201cByteDance\u2019s reported role as the largest single shareholder in a restructured TikTok U.S. venture, combined with a board seat, ensures continuing Chinese influence over the app,\u201d he said. \u201cPlainly put, ByteDance on the board means Beijing in the building.\u201d",
      "Vance said he expects the new U.S.-based TikTok to be valued at about $14 billion, describing it as a \u201cgood deal\u201d for investors who must ultimately decide \u201cwhat they want to invest in and what they think is the proper value.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a \u201csurprisingly low\u201d valuation, said Daniel Keum, a management professor at Columbia University\u2019s business school.",
      "Keum said it\u2019s possible that \u201cpolitics overrode the business case\u201d or that the licensing structure, which hasn\u2019t yet been disclosed, could have been designed with high fees or profit-sharing that depressed the value of TikTok\u2019s app in the U.S.",
      "Keum said TikTok had an early edge in attracting youth to its innovative video-sharing format, but its competitiveness has \u201cfundamentally eroded\u201d as social media creators and influencers increasingly post their videos on many different apps.",
      "As TikTok\u2019s popularity soared among young Americans in the past several years, U.S. lawmakers grew concerned that Beijing \u2014 viewed by many on the Capitol Hill as the biggest geopolitical rival to the U.S. \u2014 could use the platform to influence public discourse in the United States.",
      "\u201cByteDance has shown time and again that it is a bad actor, and the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s ultimate goal is to see America divided and weakened,\u201d Moolenaar said in his statement. \u201cThat is why, on an overwhelming bipartisan basis, Congress required ByteDance to divest control of TikTok.\u201d",
      "President Joe Biden signed legislation passed by Congress last year that would ban TikTok unless ByteDance sold its U.S. assets to an American company by early this year. The U.S. Supreme Court in January unanimously upheld the TikTok law.",
      "Trump, after he returned to the White House, has repeatedly signed orders that have allowed TikTok to keep operating in the U.S. as his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "On Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't provide any new information but repeated China's position on TikTok.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government respects the will of enterprises and welcomes them to conduct sound commercial negotiations based on market rules, reaching solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and achieve a balanced outcome of interests,\u201d said Guo Jiakun, a ministry spokesperson. \"We hope the U.S. will provide an open, fair, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises investing in the United States.\u201d",

The fossils are often referred to as \u201cJava Man.\u201d",

      "The fossils were excavated in the late 19th century by Dutch anatomist and geologist Eug\u00e8ne Dubois, when present day Indonesia was a colony of the Netherlands.",
      "After extensive research, the Dutch Colonial Collections Committee concluded that \"the circumstances under which the fossils were obtained means it is likely they were removed against the will of the people, resulting in an act of injustice against them.\" Fossils held spiritual and economic value for local people, who were coerced into revealing fossil sites.",

The repatriation marked the first use of a 2023 French law regulating the return of human remains to its former colonies.",

Others share knowledge on social media, and experienced foragers offer training to novices on safe and sustainable practices.",
      "The renewed interest ranges from those wanting to be budget-conscious \u2014 foraging is free after all \u2014 to those wanting to be more mindful of their environmental footprint. Some even use foraging as a creative outlet, using mushrooms they find to create spore prints and other art.",
      "The popularity is also helped by the hobby's accessibility.

      "The gorillas Fossey studied and looked after were mountain gorillas that belong to the species known as the eastern gorilla and live mostly in the Virunga Massif, a mountainous area encompassing parts of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. The second species, known as the western gorilla, inhabits areas of west and central Africa.",

      "Humans share much of their DNA with gorillas, and scientists cite figures showing up to 98% similarity. \u201cGorillas are humans\u2019 closest living relatives after chimpanzees, and are of comparable importance for the study of human origins and evolution,\u201d according to the science journal Nature. This kinship with humans is one reason gorillas are susceptible to infections spread through close contact with tourists, researchers and others who come near them. Gorillas are especially vulnerable to the influenza virus, and respiratory illnesses are a frequent cause of death among adult gorillas.",
      "Visitors tracking gorillas in the wild are usually urged to stand at least 7 meters (yards) from the primates \u2014 as well as not to touch them even if they wander, as they sometimes do, closer to people. In her lifetime, Fossey worried that gorilla tourism was injurious to the well-being of gorillas because it might alter their behavior in the wild, but tourism-driven gorilla conservation projects in countries such as Uganda has proved successful over the years.",

Gorilla mothers are just as generous with their offspring, and the \u201clove they show for their youngsters is undeniably deep and evident to everyone lucky enough to observe it,\u201d according to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, a charity working to protect the primates. Gorillas can live for over 40 years in the wild.",
      "The powerful majesty of gorillas in the wild is one reason they fascinate tourists. But while they are the largest living primates, they can also seem gentle and meek. An average silverback can weigh up to 180 kilograms (396 pounds). Herbivorous creatures, gorillas eat mostly leaves and the shoots and stems of plants. They may also eat ants and snails.",
      "The International Gorilla Conservation Program says the main threat to gorillas is habitat loss from the clearance of the forested ecosystems they inhabit. \u201cConversion of land for agriculture and competition for limited natural resources such as firewood lead to varying degrees of deforestation,\u201d according to the group, a coalition of conservation nonprofits focusing on the survival of mountain gorillas.",

      "Former Vice President Al Gore has announced an expansion of Climate TRACE to track soot pollution using satellite technology and artificial intelligence",
      "NEW YORK -- Soon people will be able to use satellite technology and artificial intelligence to track dangerous soot pollution in their neighborhoods \u2014 and where it comes from \u2014 in a way not so different from monitoring approaching storms under plans by a nonprofit coalition led by former Vice President Al Gore.",
      "Gore, who started Climate TRACE, which uses satellites to monitor the location of heat-trapping methane sources, on Wednesday expanded his system to track the source and plume of pollution from tiny particles, often referred to as soot, on a neighborhood basis for 2,500 cities across the world. Particle pollution kills millions of people worldwide each year \u2014 and tens of thousands in the United States \u2014 according to scientific studies and reports.",
      "Gore's coalition uses 300 satellites, 30,000 ground-tracking sensors and artificial intelligence to track 137,095 sources of particle pollution, with 3,937 of them categorized as \u201csuper emitters\u201d for how much they spew. Users can look at long-term trends, but in about a year Gore hopes these can become available daily so they can be incorporated into weather apps, like allergy reports.",
      "It\u2019s not just seeing the pollutants. The website shows who is spewing them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, before AI, for people to really see precisely where this conventional air pollution is coming from,\u201d Gore said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s over in their homes and in their neighborhoods and when people have a very clear idea of this, then I think they\u2019re empowered with the truth of their situation. My faith tradition has always taught me you will know the truth and the truth shall set you free.\u201d",
      "Unlike methane, soot pollution isn't technically a climate issue because it doesn't cause the world to warm, but it does come from the same process: fossil fuel combustion.",

      "Cadol says 12 years of recording French-language voiceovers for Lara Croft \u2014 from 1996 to 2008 \u2014 built an intimate bond with her fans. She calls them the \u201cguardians\u201d of her work.",
      "Once the initial shock subsided, she resolved to fight back. Her Paris lawyer, Jonathan Elkaim, is seeking an apology from Aspyr and financial redress.",
      "In the update, new chunks of voiceover appear to have been added to genuine recordings that Cadol says she made years ago.",
      "Most notably, fans picked up on one particularly awkward segment. In it, a voice instructs players how to use their game controllers to make Lara Croft climb onto an obstacle, intoning in French: \u201cPlace toi devant et appuyez sur avancer\u201d \u2014 Stand in front and press \u2018advance.'",
      "Not only does it sound clunky but it also rings as grammatically incorrect to French speakers \u2014 mixing up the polite and less polite forms of language that they use, depending on who they're addressing.",

      "\u201cI was really disgusted,\u201d the 34-year-old said in an AP interview. \u201cI grew up with Fran\u00e7oise Cadol's voice. I've been a \u2018Tomb Raider\u2019 fan since I was young kid.\"",
      "\u201cLara Croft is a bit \u2014 how should I say \u2014 a bit sarcastic at times in some of her lines. And I think Fran\u00e7oise played that very, very well,\u201d he said.",

      "Estonia is extending a fence along its border with Russia and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers in preparation for a potential conflict with Moscow",
      "VINSKI, Estonia -- Estonia is extending a fence along its border with Russia and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers in preparation for a potential conflict with Moscow. But those defenses won\u2019t guard against the threat it and its NATO allies face from Russian drones and electronic warfare.",
      "From the Baltic to the Black Sea, countries bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are facing the spillover from Moscow's war in Ukraine.",
      "The incursion of about 20 Russian drones into Poland this month shone a spotlight on holes in NATO's air defenses, as multimillion-dollar jets had to be scrambled to respond to drones that cost thousands and that ended up crashing into the Polish countryside. Russia denied that it targeted Poland, but Polish officials suggested it was intentional.",
      "Faced with a growing problem, some EU defense ministers will meet Friday to discuss creating a \u201cdrone wall.\"",
      "NATO warned Russia on Tuesday that it would defend against any further breaches of its airspace after Estonia said Russian fighter jets violated it last week. But although the alliance knows how to identify threats from jets and missiles, dealing with drones is a greater challenge, officials said.",
      "In Poland, \u201cmost of the drones were not detected,\" said Hanno Pevkur, Estonia\u2019s defense minister. \u201cThis is a real gap we have to solve.\u201d",
      "Military and defense officials from the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 NATO and EU members that border Russia \u2014 told The Associated Press that defending against drones requires solving a complex set of technological, financial and bureaucratic problems.",
      "Europe needs cheaper technology to buy and to speed up slow production and procurement cycles, they said. But even then, drone technology is advancing so quickly that anything bought now could be outdated in months.",
      "\u201cWhat I need,\u201d said Lt. General Andrus Merilo who commands Estonia's military, is technology that is \u201cgood enough, it\u2019s affordable and can be produced in mass.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t need high-end capabilities of which I can fire only one, against targets which will be attacking in hundreds,\u201d he said.",
      "Russia is using drones every night in Ukraine because each drone is a \u201clottery ticket that always wins,\u201d said Kusti Salm a former top official at Estonia\u2019s Defense Ministry.",
      "That\u2019s because a drone either hits something or, if Ukraine shoots it down with a missile, it drains Kyiv's air defenses and finances, since missiles are more expensive than drones, said Salm who now runs Frankenburg Technologies, a company developing low-cost anti-drone missiles.",
      "Although NATO countries have a \u201cvery good understanding\u201d of how to defend against conventional threats such as missiles and planes, they need to rapidly improve at dealing with drone threats, said Tomas Godliauskas, Lithuania\u2019s vice-minister of national defense.",
      "When the Russian drones flew into Poland, NATO nations deployed fighter jets and attack helicopters and put missile defense systems on alert. But none of those options was specifically designed for drone warfare.",
      "Although Russia and Ukraine have been firing more and more drones at each other, there has been less investment in counter-drone systems, said Salm. He suggested that's partly because it's easier to get a drone to fly than it is to develop something to detect or intercept it.",
      "Slow, low-flying drones made from wood, fiberglass, plastic or polystyrene might not be detected by radar systems searching for a fast-moving missile made of metal, or they might look like birds or a plane. Enemy operatives can also bypass defenses by launching drones from inside a country, as Ukraine did to devastating effect when it attacked Russian airfields this year.",
      "There are also other technological hurdles, including trying to jam the enemy\u2019s drones and communications without cutting your own, Merilo said.",
      "In August, a Ukrainian drone \u2014 possibly sent off course by Russian electronic jamming \u2014 landed in a field in southeastern Estonia. It crashed because the military wasn't capable of detecting it, Merilo said.",

      "\u201cDrones are not mosquitoes,\u201d the Estonian minister said, suggesting they would be unlikely to be zapped by an \u201celectronic wall\u201d along NATO\u2019s borders.",
      "There are many types of drones, including those used for intelligence and reconnaissance, that fly at high-altitude, that are used in attacks, or that even remain attached to a thin fiber-optic cable while flying, making them impossible to jam. Russia also uses decoy drones in Ukraine that carry no payload and are designed to exhaust air defenses.",
      "Any plan to defend against drones needs a multilayered approach including sensors, \u201celectronic warfare \u2026 also low-cost small missiles or attack drones,\u201d said Merilo.",
      "Although the need for better drone defenses isn't new, it\u2019s still largely only possible to buy systems that are \u201creally expensive,\u201d take a long time to develop and cannot be mass-produced, Merilo said.",
      "He suggested that\u2019s partly because big defense companies that have spent decades developing billion-dollar air defense systems might not want something new \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 on the market.",
      "\u201cWe have to understand this game,\u201d Merilo said, adding that some technology does exist, but \u201cthe question is who \u2014 and how fast they can start producing.\u201d",
      "Facing nightly onslaughts, Ukraine is rapidly developing its technology, including long-range attack drones and smaller ones for use on the frontlines.",
      "Latvia and some other NATO countries have turned to Salm's company, Frankenburg, to acquire its small anti-drone missiles once they're in production.",
      "But a piecemeal approach isn't ideal, Salm said. Instead, the EU needs to invest more in European startups which can turbocharge drone defense production that can be used by allies across different weapons systems, he said.",
      "Europe needs to switch to \u201csemi-wartime thinking\u201d and foster greater collaboration between the military, government and defense industries to be able to fill its technology gap, said Godliauskas.",
      "In Ukraine, it's sometimes only a matter of weeks between drone technology being developed and used on the battlefield. Europe \u201cdoesn't have time\u201d to spend years waiting to acquire equipment, the Lithuanian said.",
      "Another lesson from Ukraine is that what works today, might not work tomorrow, Godliauskas noted.",
      "While drone defense is critical now, it would be wrong to forget about everything else, said T\u016btins. That's because Moscow is using \u201call means possible\u201d to destabilize Europe, including hybrid warfare and cyberattacks, he said.",

      "\u201cIf we know there is a gorilla that is sick, you see everyone is concerned. \u2018Why? Why is the gorilla sick? It\u2019s suffering from what?\u2019\u201d said Joyleen Tugume, a ranger-guide in Uganda\u2019s Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. \u201cEven the community people. Everyone is touched.\u201d",
      "Tugume said poaching in the park is increasingly rare since \u201cwe are actually all working together to make sure conservation goes well, because we are all benefitting.\u201d",
      "Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in a remote part of southwestern Uganda, is home to many groups of habituated gorillas that have become comfortable in the presence of humans.",
      "Tourists pay a considerable sum \u2014 $800 in permit fees per foreign non-resident \u2014 for the right to see gorillas in their natural habitat. An official revenue-sharing policy channels $10 from each permit back to the local community via their elected leaders, who can invest in projects ranging from water provision to health care. Local communities are also entitled to 20% of all park entry fees generated annually.",
      "Many locals, including reformed poachers living near the park, told The Associated Press that the money generated has ensured the recovery of the species, with habitat encroachment and poaching in decline as wildlife authorities seek to collaborate more with nearby communities.",
      "Philemon Mujuni, a poacher until five years ago, said he once thought of the gorilla as a hostile animal to be killed before it killed him if he ever encountered one. As a boy, he used to follow his father, whom he described as \u201ca senior poacher,\u201d into the forest to help carry the antelopes they pulled from traps.",
      "But in 2020, when poachers killed a beloved gorilla named Rafiki, Mujuni and others formed an organization of former poachers who now say the primates are more important than any other animal.",
      "They serve as community watchdogs, looking out for people who might venture into the forest to set duiker traps that sometimes ensnare gorillas. Their surveillance efforts help support the work of armed rangers who also regularly patrol the park.",
      "\u201cWhen community conservation rangers sensitized us, we said, \u2018Let us reform and stop poaching in the national park of Bwindi,\u2019\u201d Mujuni said. \u201cI can\u2019t go there. Because, through the conservation team from (Bwindi Impenetrable National Park), we get some money from these gorillas we could kill.\u201d",
      "Peter Tumwesigye, one of 128 members of the group of reformed poachers, said gorillas are so important that people whose actions lead to a gorilla's death should be jailed.",
      "\u201cSo that others can learn and never do it again,\u201d he said.",
      "Many of the world\u2019s remaining mountain gorillas live in the Virunga Massif, a mountainous area encompassing parts of Congo, Uganda and Rwanda.",

      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature, which maintains a list of threatened species, cites the mountain gorilla as endangered, an improvement from its earlier designation as critically endangered. About half of the gorillas live in Uganda.",
      "Besides Bwindi, the only other Ugandan park where gorillas can be tracked in the wild is Mgahinga Gorilla National Park. But that protected area has just one family of gorillas, while Bwindi has 27 groups that can be seen up close by visitors.",
      "The primates are tracked daily. Tugume, the ranger-guide, said she works even on Christmas Day. One recent morning she led a small group of tourists into the forest, swinging a sickle to clear the way and speaking of the tenderness she sees in gorillas.",
      "\u201cYou have to fight to take over,\u201d she said, talking about a young male in a family of gorillas that one day could challenge the leader \u2014 known as a silverback for its distinguishing coat \u2014 for mating rights.",
      "\u201cWhen you are the leader, you have all the rights to mate with the females. But when you are not the leader, you don\u2019t need to mate but you can mate secretly. And if the silverback comes to know, then it will be a tug of war,\u201d she said.",
      "At the offices of the Uganda Wildlife Authority in Buhoma, a town outside the park, a group of ranger-guides and porters gathers each morning for the opportunity to earn generous tips from helping tourists navigate the forest.",
      "Groups of trackers are allocated porters, who can even help carry an unfit tourist up the hills and through the undergrowth for around $300.",
      "\u201cThe value of the gorilla money is very critical,\u201d said Gessa Simplicious, a conservationist with the Uganda Tourism Board. \u201cIt helps with building trust, but it also helps in the awareness of the need to conserve.\u201d",

Originally planned as a facility to mine cryptocurrency, developers had pivoted and expanded their designs to tailor the project to the AI boom sparked by ChatGPT.",

More recently, OpenAI signed a $300 billion deal to buy computing capacity from Oracle. It's a huge bet for the San Francisco-based AI startup, which was founded as a nonprofit.",
      "OpenAI and Oracle invited media and politicians, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, to tour the site for the first time Tuesday.",
      "Cruz called Texas \u201cground zero for AI\u201d because if \u201cyou\u2019re building a data center, what do you want? No. 1, you want abundant, low-cost energy.\u201d",
      "Of the other five Stargate data center projects announced Tuesday, Oracle is working with OpenAI to build one just northeast of Abilene, in Shackelford County, Texas, and another in New Mexico's Do\u00f1a Ana County. It also said it is working to build one in the Midwest.",
      "Softbank said it has broken ground on two more in Lordstown, Ohio, and in Milam County, Texas.",

      "President Donald Trump said prominent billionaires \u2013 including media mogul Rupert Murdoch and tech founder Michael Dell \u2013 could be part of a deal in which the U.S. will take control of the social video platform TikTok.",
      "Trump namedropped the 94-year-old Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch, the head of Fox News and News Corp, as part of a group of possible participants in a deal during an interview recorded Friday and aired Sunday on Fox News.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re going to be in the group. A couple of others. Really great people, very prominent people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re also American patriots, you know, they love this country. I think they\u2019re going to do a really good job.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s disclosure of the potential involvement of the Murdochs and Dell, the founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, is the latest twist in a fast-moving potential deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S.",
      "Trump also said Sunday that tech giant Oracle founder and Chairman Larry Ellison was part of the same group. His involvement had been previously disclosed. On Saturday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Oracle would be responsible for the app\u2019s data and security and that Americans will control six of the seven seats for a planned board.",
      "Much is still unknown about the actual deal in the works. Trump discussed the TikTok deal with China\u2019s Xi Jinping in a lengthy phone call on Friday. Chinese and U.S. officials have until Dec. 16 to hash out the details, following the latest deadline extension by the Trump administration.",

      "A day after the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, officials with the Justice Department were still offering few details about their case -- but sources said Friday that one of the two counts in the indictment focuses on his alleged role in the sharing of information about an FBI investigation related to Hillary Clinton.",
      "Count 1 of the indictment, which charges Comey with making false statements to Congress, involves Comey's alleged role in having his close friend and former personal lawyer, Daniel Richman, provide information to reporters about an FBI probe connected to Clinton, sources told ABC News.",
      "In the indictment, Count 1 says that Comey \"willfully and knowingly\" lied when, testifying under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020, he reaffirmed previous Senate testimony insisting that he never \"authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports\" about an investigation connected to someone only identified as \"PERSON 1.\"",
      "\"That statement was false, because, as JAMES B. COMEY JR. then and there knew, he in fact had authorized PERSON 3 to serve as an anonymous source in news reports regarding [the] FBI investigation,\" the indictment reads.",

      "It's unclear exactly which news reports are referred to in the indictment.",

He then asked you, 'Have you ever\u00a0authorized\u00a0someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton administration?' You responded again under oath, 'No,'\" Cruz said.",

      "A shutdown now could be even worse as parks are already under strain from a 24% reduction in staff and severe budget cuts, the former park officials said in a letter Thursday. A secretarial order by Burgum directing parks to remain open has led parks to neglect trash collection and other routine maintenance work, the ex-officials said. The April directive said the Park Service director should ensure that all park units remain open and accessible to the public during their specified hours of operation posted on the park websites.",
      "\"Leaving parks even partially open to the public during a shutdown with minimal \u2014 or no \u2014 park staffing is reckless and puts both visitors and park resources at risk,'' the former officials wrote.",

      "The unusual naval buildup off South America has stoked fears of invasion in Venezuela and speculation that Trump could try to topple its authoritarian president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has lost support in his own country and faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- With China leading the way by announcing its first emission cuts, world leaders said Wednesday they are getting more serious about fighting climate change and the deadly extreme weather that comes with it.",
      "At the United Nations' high-level climate summit, Chinese president Xi Jinping announced the world\u2019s largest carbon-polluting country would aim to cut emissions by 7% to 10% by 2035. China produces more than 31% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, and they have long been soaring.",

Mohammed said.",

The EU will formally submit its plan before the November negotiations.",

      "Xi and Brazil\u2019s leader also made statements on Wednesday afternoon that may have referred to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s attacks a day earlier on renewable energy and the concept of climate change. \u201cWhile some countries are acting against it, the international community should stay focused on the right direction,\" Xi said.",

      "\u201cHe was savagely assassinated just because his killer did not like his ideas,\u201d Vucic said of Kirk, suggesting that some of the reaction in the slaying's aftermath caused yet more damage in terms of the division it sowed. \"He was shot even after death by the same ones who had prepared political and media grounds for his assassination.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt just adds more trauma already to those who are suffering,\u201d said Ray Cummings, president of the American Federation of Teachers St. Louis Local 420. \u201cThose neighborhoods need hope.\u201d",

There was a waiting list for his museum studies class and his students participated in a National History Day competition.",

      "\u201cAt the time, I wasn\u2019t really studious. I was kind of rough around the edges,\u201d Scott said.",
      "But, she said, Sumner helped her get on track. She made a movie and joined choir, junior ROTC and student council. She competed in the history competition, and modeled in a Chicago fashion show with classmates.",
      "\u201cFrom being a kid who was skipping class, I was a kid who was literally on time and attending all of my classes,\u201d said Scott, now a University of Missouri freshman.",
      "Noting the \u201crich history\u201d of the school and the once wealthy neighborhood, Clarke, who taught Sumner's movie-making class as a volunteer, suggested all is not lost.",

Crudup earned his master's degree in acting there.",

      "Jimmy Kimmel returned to his long-running late-night show Tuesday, less than a week after network broadcaster ABC pulled \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" over remarks he made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "\"It's been overwhelming ... I've heard from all the people in the world over the last six days,\" Kimmel joked to open his monologue, going on to thank all those who came out in his defense, including conservatives.",
      "\"Most of all, I want to thank the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,\" Kimmel said. \"I never would have imagined that Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, even my old pal Ted Cruz, who believe it or not said something very beautiful on my behalf. It takes courage for them to speak out against this administration. They did and they deserve credit for it.\"",
      "The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, had announced Monday that Kimmel would return to the air.",
      "It followed a political and media firestorm that began after the comedian addressed Kirk's slaying in a Sept. 15 monologue, saying: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"",
      "An emotional Kimmel on Tuesday said, \"It's important to me as a human, and that is, you understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don't think there's anything funny about it,\" noting that he had taken to social media following Kirk's killing to send his condolences to Kirk's family.",
      "Kimmel didn't issue a blanket apology for his monologue remarks last week, but said he understood how it was offensive to some.",
      "\"Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual,\" Kimmel said of the suspected gunman. \"That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make. But I understand that to some, that felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both. And for those who think I did, point a finger, I get why you're upset. If the situation was reversed, there's a good chance I'd have felt the same way.\"",
      "Kimmel gave a brief explanation for what took place behind the scenes between himself and ABC's brass.",
      "\"I was not happy when they pulled me off the air on Wednesday,\" Kimmel said. \"I did not agree with that decision, and I told them that, and we had many conversations. I shared my point of view, they shared theirs. We talked it through, and at the end, even though they didn't have to, they really didn't have to, this is a giant company \u2026 they welcomed me back on the air.\"",
      "On Tuesday night, before the show aired on the East Coast, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled!\"",
      "He went on, \"I think we're going to test ABC out on this. Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars,\" Mr. Trump said in reference to his defamation lawsuit last year against ABC News over remarks made by anchor George Stephanopoulos, which the network settled in December by agreeing to contribute $15 million to Mr. Trump's presidential foundation and museum, and another $1 million toward Mr. Trump's legal fees.",
      "\"This one sounds even more lucrative,\" Mr. Trump wrote Tuesday. \"A true bunch of losers!\"",
      "Kimmel told his audience Tuesday that the president \"made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke.\"",
      "\"One thing I did learn from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern, is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn't like, is anti-American,\" he added.",
      "In a Sept. 17 interview with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr called Kimmel's remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"",
      "\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" Carr told Johnson. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "Within hours of that interview, station operator Nexstar announced it would preempt Kimmel's show over the remarks. Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.",
      "A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision to preempt Kimmel's show was \"made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "ABC later said that it was \"indefinitely\" suspending the show.",
      "Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.",
      "Despite its return to ABC on Tuesday night, both Nexstar and Sinclair said they would continue to preempt Kimmel's show.",
      "Sinclair on Monday night posted a statement on X saying it will preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be \"replacing it with news programming\" beginning Tuesday night. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,\" Sinclair said.",
      "Nexstar on Tuesday said it will continue to preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"monitor the show as it returns to ABC.\"",
      "Regarding Carr, Kimmel on Tuesday\u00a0showed\u00a0the audience a social media post that the FCC chair wrote in May 2022 in which he said, \"Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech. It challenges those in power while using humor to draw more people in to the discussion. That's why people in influential positions have always targeted it for censorship.\"",
      "Disney on Monday did not delve into the details of what led to its decision to allow Kimmel's show to resume, only saying in a statement that the initial suspension was \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" calling his comments \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"",
      "\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.",
      "The temporary removal of Kimmel's show sparked a nationwide debate over issues of free speech and censorship. Many in the Hollywood community rallied to Kimmel's side, with more than 400 celebrities \u2014 including actors Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep \u2014 signing an open letter with the American Civil Liberties Union that criticized the move as \"a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.\"",
      "Conservatives upset with Kimmel's comments about Kirk praised the decision, including President Trump, who congratulated ABC on his Truth Social platform \"for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also speculated last week whether networks that cover him negatively should have their broadcast licenses revoked.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" the president told reporters on Sept. 18. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "But one prominent conservative, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, was specifically critical of Carr's comments to Johnson.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas,'\" Cruz said Friday on his podcast. \"That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it.'\"",
      "Kimmel's show, which launched in 2003, tapes in front of a studio audience on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. The guests for Tuesday's show included actor Glen Powell and singer Sarah McLachlan.",

      "A former stylist for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs \u2014 who testified against the disgraced music mogul in his federal criminal trial earlier this year \u2014 filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing Combs of sexual abuse and violence while he was in Combs' employ.",
      "The 37-page lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on behalf of Deonte Nash against Combs and Combs' label, Bad Boy Entertainment, also accuses Combs of sexual battery, human trafficking and false imprisonment.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Nash said he was hired to be Combs' stylist around 2008, at the age of 21, and worked for him until about 2018. Nash said that during that time period, he also worked as a stylist and creative director for Combs' then-girlfriend, R&B singer Cassandra Ventura, who also accused Combs of sexual abuse in a 2023 lawsuit and gave graphic testimony against him in his trial.",
      "\"Nash personally experienced sexual, physical, mental, and emotional abuse at the hands of Defendants during his ten-year employment,\" including \"forced tests of loyalty and manipulation, sexual harassment and sexual assaults, physical violence and manhandling, labor trafficking, threats of harm, and threats of death,\" the lawsuit against Combs reads.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Nash was sexually assaulted by Combs on \"multiple occasions.\"",
      "Nash said the alleged abuse prompted him to resign in 2018, but Combs \"continued to threaten Mr. Nash after his employment ended.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Combs' attorneys for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "In one incident that Nash claims occurred in 2013 or 2014, Combs discovered that Nash and Ventura had gone out to dinner in L.A. without Combs' permission. The following day, the lawsuit states, Combs \"threw\" Nash \"onto the car and violently strangled him.\"",
      "On another occasion in 2014, Combs and his security team allegedly entered Nash's home without permission, during which they \"confiscated Mr. Nash's keys and phone while they forcibly searched the house\" for Ventura, the lawsuit says.",
      "\"After enduring years of abuse, I finally found the courage during the criminal trial, and I am now ready to take action,\" Nash said in a statement. \"Sean Combs has never taken accountability for the years of harm he inflicted on me and so many others.\"",
      "In July, following a lengthy trial, the 55-year-old Combs was found guilty of two counts of prostitution-related charges, but acquitted on more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.",
      "He is\u00a0scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 3.",
      "During the trial, Ventura testified that she was repeatedly physically and sexually abused by Combs over the course of their relationship. She testified about a 2016 incident, which was caught on\u00a0surveillance video, that showed Combs violently assaulting her in the hallway of a California hotel.",
      "Nash also testified in the trial that Combs threatened Ventura and that he \"would beat her.\"",
      "Nash testified about a time when Combs allegedly grabbed a sleeping Ventura by the hair and started hitting her \"pretty hard.\" Nash said Ventura's head hit a bed frame and started bleeding, and Combs then told her, Nash and an assistant, \"Look what y'all made me do.\"",
      "Nash testified he dialed 911 but was told to hang up. He said he feared retaliation but did tell some of Combs' employees about the alleged abuse and told jurors Combs got physical with him a few times.",
      "During the trial,\u00a0Combs' attorneys denied the sexual abuse allegations brought by Ventura against their client, and argued that while evidence showed Combs may have lived a party lifestyle, they claimed he did not engage in racketeering conspiracy or sex trafficking.",
      "Nash's lawsuit seeks both compensatory and punitive damages and demands a jury trial.",

    "summary": "Lisa Jeanine Findley concocted a bizarre, brazen scheme to try and sell Elvis Presley's iconic home, prosecutors said.",
    "story": [
      "A Missouri woman was sentenced Tuesday to more than four years in federal prison for scheming to defraud Elvis Presley's family by trying to auction off his Graceland home and property before a judge halted the brazen foreclosure sale.",
      "U.S. District Judge John T. Fowlkes Jr. sentenced Lisa Jeanine Findley in federal court in Memphis to four years and nine months behind bars, plus an additional three years of probation. Findley, 54, declined to speak on her own behalf during the hearing.",
      "Findley pleaded guilty in February to a charge of mail fraud related to the scheme. She also had been indicted on a charge of aggravated identity theft, but that charge was dropped as part of a plea agreement.",
      "Findley, of Kimberling City, falsely claimed Lisa Marie Presley borrowed $3.8 million from a bogus private lender and had pledged Graceland as collateral for the loan before her death in January 2023, prosecutors said when Findley was charged in August 2024. Findley  then threatened to sell Graceland to the highest bidder if Presley's family didn't pay a $2.85 million settlement, according to prosecutors.",
      "Findley posed as three different people allegedly involved with the fake lender, fabricated loan documents and published a fraudulent foreclosure notice in a Memphis newspaper announcing the auction of Graceland in May 2024, prosecutors said. A judge stopped the sale after Riley Keough, Lisa Marie's daughter, sued.",
      "Experts were baffled by the attempt to sell off one of the most storied pieces of real estate in the country using names, emails and documents that were quickly suspected to be phony.",
      "Graceland opened as a museum and tourist attraction in 1982 and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. A large Presley-themed entertainment complex across the street from the museum is owned by Elvis Presley Enterprises. Presley died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Members of the Presley family, including Elvis, Lisa Marie and Benjamin Keough are buried on the property.",
      "The public notice for the foreclosure sale of the 13-acre estate said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Keough inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother's death.",
      "After the scheme fell apart, Findley tried to make it look like the person responsible was a Nigerian identity thief, prosecutors said. An email sent May 25, 2024, to the AP from the same email as the earlier statement said in Spanish that the foreclosure sale attempt was made by a Nigerian fraud ring that targets old and dead people in the U.S. and uses the internet to steal money.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs urged a New York federal judge Monday to sentence him early next month to no more than 14 months in prison for his conviction on two prostitution-related charges, meaning he'd go free almost immediately if the judge agreed.",
      "The lawyers made their arguments in a written submission to Judge Arun Subramanian, who has already rejected a proposed $50 million bail package, signaling that he doesn't believe the Grammy-winning artist is close to being released.",
      "\"Mr. Combs's celebrity status in the realms of music, fashion, spirits, media, and finance has been shattered and Mr. Combs's legacy has been destroyed,\" the lawyers wrote, saying their client has been punished enough.",
      "The submission provided new information about what life behind bars for nearly 13 months has been like for Combs, what's happened to his businesses and other interests and explains why he turned down a plea-deal offer from prosecutors prior to his trial.",
      "Combs will learn his sentencing fate on Oct. 3",
      "Combs faces an Oct. 3 sentencing after his July conviction by a Manhattan jury on two Mann Act charges that outlaw interstate commerce related to prostitution. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.",
      "The Bad Boy Records founder was exonerated on more serious racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that would have required a minimum of 15 years in prison and the possibility of a life sentence.",
      "In their submission, Combs' lawyers argued that a jury sent a loud message to the judge by exonerating him of the most serious charges.",
      "\"Put simply, the jury has spoken. Its verdict represents an 'affirmative indication of innocence,'\" the lawyers said.",
      "\"He has served over a year in one of the most notorious jails in America - yet has made the most of that punishment. It is time for Mr. Combs to go home to his family, so he can continue his treatment and try to make the most of the next chapter of his extraordinary life,\" they added.",
      "Prosecutors, who will submit their recommendations prior to the Oct. 3 sentencing, have already said they'll urge Combs stay imprisoned substantially longer than the four to five years they originally thought.",
      "Defense lawyers, though, wrote in their submission Monday that prosecutors \"have lost all perspective.\"",
      "Combs's career and reputation are ruined, lawyers say",
      "\"Mr. Combs's career and reputation have been destroyed,\" they wrote. \"His life outside of jail has been systematically dismantled.\"",
      "Among other things, they noted that he had to let go over 100 employees from his businesses and many of them have been unable to get new jobs because of their past association with Combs.",
      "His seven children, they said, have faced \"devastating consequences,\" including lost business opportunities in acting, television, fashion and concerts, with some of them being included in some of the nearly 100 civil lawsuits filed against Combs since his arrest.",
      "The lawyers also noted that Combs and his family were set to star in a Hulu show about their lives, but the show was cancelled once the allegations against him became public.",
      "Combs was removed from the boards at three charter schools he created in Harlem, the Bronx and Connecticut and was stripped of an honorary doctorate degree from Howard University, which plans to return his prior donations, they said.",
      "Inmate approached Combs with a shiv, lawyers say",
      "Meanwhile, Combs's life in prison has been harrowing at times, even as it has allowed him to become sober for the first time in 25 years, his lawyers said.",
      "On one occasion, another inmate approached Combs with a shiv, accusing Combs of sitting on a chair that the inmate wanted to sit on, before Combs defused the situation and calmed the man and his makeshift weapon down, the lawyers said.",
      "They said he has been under constant suicide watch, meaning every two hours he must present his identification card to guards to show he is alive and well and is awakened from sleep in a brightly lighted cell by a guard to ensure he is well.",
      "He also has limited access to clean water, leaving him to heat the water that he drinks to ensure it won't make him sick and he must sleep within two feet of other inmates in a dorm-style room containing a bathroom and no door, the lawyers wrote.",
      "\"Mr. Combs has not breathed fresh air in nearly 13 months, or felt sunlight on his skin, often walking with a limp due to a painful knee injury that requires surgery,\" they said. And the food, they added, sometimes contains maggots.",
      "Lawyers say Combs had no choice to face trial after plea offer",
      "Prior to trial, the lawyers said, prosecutors offered Combs a plea deal that would have recommended a prison sentence of at least 25 years and required him to plead guilty to crimes of which he was acquitted.",
      "They portrayed their client as a changed man, who had realized that his overuse of drugs, including some prescribed by doctors, had contributed to violent acts he participated in.",
      "\"Without minimizing Mr. Combs's conduct, this is in many ways a 'sex, drugs, and rock n' roll' story,\" they said. \"Mr. Combs had severe substance abuse problems throughout the entirety of the offense conduct and participated in a high-octane celebrity lifestyle.\"",
      "The music maven's trial featured lengthy testimony from two former girlfriends of Combs who said they felt forced to participate in drug-fueled sex marathons with male sex workers as Combs watched and sometimes filmed the dayslong encounters.",
      "R&B singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura testified that she participated in hundreds of the meetups that were referred to as \"freak-offs\" while she was his most frequent girlfriend from 2007 to 2018.",
      "Another ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" said she also felt pressured to perform sexually with male sex workers while she dated Combs from 2021 until his arrest at a New York hotel a year ago.",
      "Lawyers say a sober Combs looks to new future unlike his past",
      "There was also extensive testimony during the trial about Combs beating his girlfriends and using violence and the fears of it to control those around him.",
      "Defense lawyers at trial conceded there was domestic abuse but said the charges brought by prosecutors were not proven.",
      "While he was once so depressed in jail that \"there were days when he was unable to get out of his bed or even talk to the psychology department,\" his lawyers said he looks forward to the future.",
      "They said he has begun teaching other inmates essential skills in business management, entrepreneurship and personal development.",
      "The lawyers wrote that the education program has become \"one of the most impactful and important endeavors of his life\" and he hopes to expand it to state-run facilities once he is released.",
      "\"He is a humbled man who understands that the most important things in life are his devotion to and quality time with his family and his contributions for the benefit of others,\" they said.",
      "Possibility of a pardon",
      "Combs' lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, told CBS News in July that he has not had any conversations with the Trump administration about seeking a pardon for his client after another attorney for Combs, Nicole Westmoreland, told\u00a0CNN\u00a0it was her understanding that the defense team \"had conversations in reference to a pardon.\"",
      "But Agnifilo told CBS News, \"I have nothing to do with a possible pardon.\"",
      "\"I have had conversations with nobody,\" Agnifilo said. \"I have not spoken to the president. I have not spoken to anybody who speaks to the president about Sean Combs. I have not.\"",
      "He says he hasn't discussed it with Combs either, except to tell him what's in the news.",
      "\"He says, 'Go tell him (Mr. Trump) that I need a pardon,'\" Agnofilo said. \"'Go tell him I deserve a pardon.' That's what he said.\"",

      "After being pulled off the air nearly a week ago, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" will return on Tuesday, The Walt Disney Company announced Monday.",
      "The late-night show had been \"pre-empted indefinitely\" last week following comments Kimmel made on the show in response to\u00a0the shooting death\u00a0of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "In a statement Monday, The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, said Kimmel's show was suspended \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" adding that some of the host's comments were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"",
      "\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.",
      "Kimmel had not yet commented on Monday on his show's return.",
      "The late-night host made the remarks in his monologue on Sept. 15, saying: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\" He also mocked Mr. Trump's reaction to the shooting.",
      "Before Disney announced last week that Kimmel's show was \"pre-empted indefinitely,\" Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr called the remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"",
      "\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" he said during a podcast interview, telling host Benny Johnson: \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "Kimmel faced criticism from conservatives over his comments. Mr. Trump last week had congratulated ABC for \"finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"",
      "ABC parent company Disney has faced fallout in Hollywood over the move: Other late-night hosts have publicly sided with Kimmel, A-listers like Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro signed an open letter calling it a \"dark moment for freedom of speech,\" and screenwriter and \"Lost\" co-creator Damon Lindelof vowed not to work with Disney unless Kimmel's show is restored. Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who led Disney for more than two decades, spoke out and defended Kimmel last week, writing on X: \"Where has all the leadership gone? If not for university presidents, law firm managing partners, and corporate chief executives standing up against bullies, who then will step up for the first amendment?\"",
      "Carr's comments on Kimmel drew pushback on First Amendment grounds, with the FCC's sole Democrat-appointed commissioner, Anna Gomez, arguing the agency had used Kimmel's \"inopportune joke as a pretext to punish speech it disliked.\" Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas also sharply criticized Carr for urging ABC to crack down on Kimmel, calling the Trump appointee's comments \"dangerous as hell\" and \"right out of 'Goodfellas.'\" Cruz chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.",
      "ABC's announcement last week came after media giant Nexstar announced that it would preempt Kimmel's show indefinitely on all its stations over Kimmel's remarks. Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division, said the comments were \"offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located.\"",
      "Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it. A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision was \"made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.",
      "\"Regardless of ABC's plans for the future of the program, Sinclair intends not to return 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' to our air until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform,\" Sinclair said last week in a statement.",

    "summary": "President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between Tylenol and autism has drawn pushback from medical experts.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout\" Thursday the Trump administration is not advising pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol under any circumstances \u2014 as President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between the painkiller and fever reducer and autism draws pushback from medical experts.",
      "Oz \u2014 a former surgeon and television personality who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an agency that is under the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 said that if a pregnant woman develops a high fever, a doctor will likely encourage her to take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, because fevers can pose health risks. And\u00a0studies show acetaminophen is the safest medication to treat fevers in pregnant women.",
      "\"The concern here is that I believe most women get low-grade fevers, they stub their toe, they have little aches and pains, and they think it's perfectly safe to throw a couple paracetamol or acetaminophen or Tylenol when they're pregnant, and I don't think that's the case,\" Oz said.",
      "On Monday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary released an open letter to physicians that said acetaminophen use during pregnancy \"may be associated with\" an increased risk of conditions like autism.",
      "The letter noted that \"while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established.\"",
      "Makary's letter was also more tempered than Mr. Trump's comments during a news conference earlier this week in which the president said there's \"no downside in not taking\" Tylenol.",
      "\"Acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics,\" Makary wrote in his letter.",
      "There is concern among the medical community that, as a result of the FDA's announcement Monday, that some patients could turn to other pain medications that are proven to be unsafe during pregnancy.",
      "\"You should not, under any circumstances, avoid taking acetaminophen if you have a fever early in pregnancy, if you have a headache, if you have some other condition in pregnancy, we want you to take that medication,\" Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CBS News following the FDA's announcement. \"The overwhelming evidence that we have seen over the last 20 years does not show causation for acetaminophen causing autism.\"",
      "In a statement in response to the FDA's announcement, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said, \"Independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,\" calling it \"the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"",
      "Oz also addressed Makary's announcement that the agency will approve the prescription drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid, to treat autism in children. Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"The key question is, if you, as a researcher on those trials, had a child, would you give that child leucovorin?\" Oz said he asked of researchers studying leucovorin. \"And when I asked the doctors on those trials, they said yes.\"",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years,\u00a0according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there is no scientific consensus as to why.",
      "Oz said that when he, Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, were asked by the White House to examine the issue, they found two \"clues,\" not conclusions, that pointed to leucovorin as a possible treatment option for autistic children, and acetaminophen as a medication pregnant women should be cautious about taking.",
      "\"These are things that we believe, that if you're fully transparent about, you'll rebuild trust with the American people,\" Oz said. \"Just tell people what you know.\"",
      "Oz argued that Mr. Trump was right in pushing for the FDA to both approve leucovorin and make its Tylenol recommendation \u2014 even though there is no consensus in the medical community and no definitive evidence supporting either move \u2014 because he believes the FDA has an obligation to be transparent.",
      "But Oz was clear that patients should consult their doctors first before making a decision.",
      "\"The Tylenol issue is whether or not we should warn moms, who are pregnant today, about a problem that we may not know fully the answer to \u2014 'Is Tylenol a problem during pregnancy?' \u2014 for another five years,\" Oz said. \"Well, what about the kid today? Are you going to take the Tylenol or not. Well I think the answer is, the best prudent answer, of course take it if a doctor says you need it. But don't take it on your own without thinking twice about it.\"",
      "Oz also indicated that he would not advise a pregnant family member to take Tylenol without talking to their physician first.",
      "\"We're guarded in saying we don't have all the answers,\" he said. \"But if it's my family, I'm not going to have my pregnant daughter take acetaminophen if she doesn't need to be on it without certainly talking to a doctor about it.\"",

    "title": "U.S. to impose tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs, furniture and heavy trucks",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariff-pharmaceutical-drugs-kitchen-cabinets-furniture-heavy-trucks/",
    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 20:29:37 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture and a 25% tariff on heavy trucks.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. would impose a new round of tariffs, including a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30% tariff on heavy trucks.",
      "In social media posts to Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the new tariffs would take effect Oct. 1.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his posts that the 100% tariff on \"any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product\" would not apply to companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., which he defined as either \"breaking ground\" or being \"under construction.\"",
      "In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shockwaves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.",
      "Still, some experts think the new pharma tariffs could end up having only a modest impact, noting that generic drugs are exempt. The loophole for drugmakers with operations in the U.S. is also likely to soften the blow, Neal Shearing, group chief economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"Many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies either already have some production in the U.S. or have announced plans to build production in the near future,\" he said. \"Add in the fact that pharmaceuticals is the one area where we think there may have been significant inventory accumulation this year, as importers have sought to front-run potential tariffs, and the impact on the effective tariff rate is likely to be small.\"",
      "Higher costs for home furnishings?",
      "Trump argued that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were \"flooding\" the U.S. with their products and that tariffs must be applied \"for National Security and other reasons.\"",
      "The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump announced on social media that a \"major Tariff Investigation\" was being conducted on furniture coming into the U.S. and said that within the next 50 days, the investigation would be completed, and a tariff rate would be announced.",
      "The president said the 25% tariff on \"all 'Heavy (Big!) Trucks' made in other parts of the world\" was \"in order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition.\"",
      "\"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,\" Trump posted.",
      "Throughout much of 2025, the Trump administration's broad tariffs defied predictions that they would fuel inflation, but that respite seems to have ended after economic data this month showed the duties are now driving prices upward. The Consumer Price Index in August rose at a rate of 2.9% from a year ago, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Mr. Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.",
      "Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.",
      "\"There's no inflation,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday. \"We're having unbelievable success.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-september-2025-economic-impact-social-security-tsa/",
    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 18:09:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The economic impact of a government shutdown depends on its duration, economists say. Some payments, like Social Security, would continue to be issued.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown could begin within days, halting pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delaying services, as lawmakers remain deadlocked over funding past Sept. 30.",
      "The financial impact of a shutdown typically depends on the length of the disruption, with each week costing the U.S. economy about $7 billion, according to a new analysis from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco. A suspension could also weigh on investor and consumer confidence at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing headwinds, he told CBS News.",
      "Government shutdowns aren't new: The U.S. has experienced 14 of them since 1980, with the longest occurring over 34 days from December 2018 into January 2019, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. They're triggered when Congress fails to pass a full-year spending bill or a continuing resolution to fund the government for the pending fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday. Oct. 1.",
      "\"We've been to this picnic before, unfortunately,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute, told CBS News. Pacific Research is a think tank that focuses on free trade.",
      "\"In general, things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, those will continue to go out, and we'll continue to pay interest on the debt,\" Winegarden said.",
      "But, he added, \"The general rule is that the longer it goes on, the bigger the disruption.\"",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically prohibited from doling out money. Activities at many agencies will be suspended until lawmakers agree on a new funding bill, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely to be furloughed during that time.",
      "Yet because the government must continue to provide services that protect life and property, agencies will determine which essential workers must continue working, although they won't receive pay until lawmakers resolve the funding gap.",
      "And while some federal employees would eventually receive back pay, others could experience financial strain while their paychecks are suspended, Daco noted.",
      "During the shutdown of 2018-2019, about 800,000 government workers missed several weeks of pay, creating financial hardships for many. Some turned to online fundraising campaigns for assistance, while others relied on food banks to help them get through the period.",
      "What is the economic impact of a government shutdown?",
      "While the biggest direct hit would be on government workers, followed by federal contractors who would also be shut off from funding, delayed federal procurement on goods and services could also ripple through the broader economy, Daco told CBS News.",
      "A shutdown could also undermine confidence in the economy at a time when some sectors, such as the labor market, are facing headwinds, he added. Markets could be rattled by the disruption, as well as consumer sentiment, some economists noted.",
      "\"We need more certainty in the rules of the game of the economy,\" Winegarden said. \"Uncertainty, at this moment, is the last thing we need.\"",
      "A halt in government functions could also complicate monetary policy decisions, potentially resulting in delays for key economic data next month, such as the Oct. 3 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the labor market stalling out over the summer, Federal Reserve officials are expected to closely scrutinize the latest jobs data when they make their next rate decision at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"A government shutdown at this economic juncture represent a graver risk than when the economy is running at full steam,\" Daco said.",
      "Would Social Security benefits be impacted?",
      "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are covered by mandatory spending, which means that funding for these programs has been approved by Congress to continue without an expiration date.",
      "Social Security benefits would be paid on time, while health care payments for seniors in Medicare and low- and middle-income Americans enrolled in Medicaid would continue.",
      "However, Social Security's administrative budget needs to receive approval from Congress, which means that some of its services could be impacted in a shutdown, some experts note.",
      "\"In the event of a government shutdown ... customer service at the Social Security Administration may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing and replacing Medicare cards,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in a Friday email.",
      "Would other federal functions like the TSA be impacted?",
      "Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay because they provide essential services.",
      "Unlike other government agencies. the U.S. Postal Service operates as a sefl-funded, independent agency. That means mail, packages and other shipments would still be delivered and post offices would remain open in the event of a shutdown.",
      "But there could be other impacts for consumers and businesses. For one, some mortgage processing could face delays because the flood insurance program would be closed to new policies until Congress agrees to a new spending deal, according to TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.",
      "\"That means no mortgages which require federal flood insurance will be originated,\" he noted.",
      "In previous shutdowns, other services were also suspended, such as the Food and Drug Administration's inspections, as well as the entry to the National Parks, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",

    "summary": "President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that paves the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that paves the way for\u00a0a deal\u00a0brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "\"With this executive order, you will be effectively bringing into effect the agreement that will save TikTok and ensure that it can operate safely and securely,\" White House staff secretary Will Scharf said ahead of a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.",
      "The move declares that the deal represents a \"qualified divestiture\" that satisfies a law passed by Congress requiring TikTok's China-based parent company to divest or face a ban and pushes back enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for an agreement on how the app operates in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during their call last week. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The TikTok deal",
      "Under the law, TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. Earlier this month, the president extended the enforcement pause until Dec. 16. The new order extends the pause until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "According to a senior White House official, under the deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, according to the White House. The executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by the divest-or-ban law.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said at the White House that the new entity would have a valuation of about $14 billion.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in the new TikTok, according to the White House. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "The full roster of U.S. investors and their stakes in the company remain unclear, but Vance said Thursday the administration is planning to announce the other investors in the coming days.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "CBS News contributor Christopher Krebs, the former director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said there are \"still some questions on how operationally ... it's going to play out and what the user is going to experience on a daily basis.\"",
      "There's been limited pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "Still, some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern Friday and said he has asked for an \"urgent\" briefing from the Trump administration.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",
      "The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress, however, left it up to the president to ultimately determine what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\" The law gives the president the power to decide, through an interagency process, whether \"the relevant foreign adversary controlled application [is] no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary.\" It defines \"controlled by a foreign adversary\" as a company headquartered in a foreign adversary country and owning at least a 20% stake.",
      "According to the executive order, the joint venture resolves national security concerns because ByteDance will have a minority stake; the joint venture will operate the algorithm and code and make content-moderation decisions; the data of U.S. users will be stored in a cloud environment run by an American company; and the arrangement includes \"intense monitoring\" of software updates, algorithms and data.",
      "\"These safeguards would protect the American people from the misuse of their data and the influence of a foreign adversary, while also allowing the millions of American viewers, creators, and businesses that rely on the TikTok application to continue using it,\" it says.",
      "The interagency process was led by Vance and included consultation with the National Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Treasury Department, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "\"This process has included, among other things, significant interagency deliberations and consultations, numerous briefings by informed experts and national security officials, and extensive negotiations with outside parties,\" the executive order says.",
      "The senior White House official said the administration plans to engage \"vigorously\" with lawmakers \"to show them what a great deal this is\" for Americans while also making the app \"safe and secure.\"",
      "During the legal battle over the law, TikTok's lawyers said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that global content will still be accessible for American users.",
      "For that to happen, the U.S. algorithm would have to interact with the original algorithm that feeds the rest of the world content, according to Ari Lightman, a professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University.",
      "\"The semantics associated with how that'll work have not been disclosed at all,\" Lightman said.",
      "Lightman added that the level of complexity involved in retraining an algorithm to run off a smaller set of users and potentially weighting data sets differently while also maintaining the quality of the current user experience is \"huge.\"",
      "\"The TikTok algorithm has been optimized over a long period of time to understand its community's interests and what defines value for them,\" he said. \"It's kind of it's impossible to recreate.\"",

      "A pair of e-commerce entrepreneurs who bought a number of well-known retail brands \u2014 including RadioShack, Modell's Sporting Goods and Pier 1 Imports \u2014 out of bankruptcy are accused of running a Ponzi scheme.",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of the Miami-based Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), of defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million.",
      "Through their holding company, Mehr and Lopez acquired distressed brick-and-mortar companies in order to turn them into successful, online-only brands. Dress Barn and Linens 'n Things were also among their acquisitions.",
      "REV acquired RadioShack in 2020, three years after the nearly century-old electronics chain filed for its second bankruptcy. RadioShack first filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2015. In 2023, Unicomer Group acquired RadioShack, and in 2024, relaunched it as an e-commerce platform. RadioShack's current owners are not named in the lawsuit.",
      "Modell's Sporting Goods filed for bankruptcy in March 2020, when it also announced it would be closing all of its stores. REV bought the Modell's brand name and assets in August 2020. Pier 1 Imports \u2014 which still exists as an online store \u2014 declared bankruptcy in early 2020. REV acquired its trademark name and assets later that same year.",
      "The SEC's suit alleges that between 2020 and 2022, Mehr and Lopez, \"made material misrepresentations\" to hundreds of investors about the bankrupt retailers they had acquired. For example, to entice individuals to invest in their acquisitions, they said their portfolio companies were \"on fire\" and that \"cash flow is strong.\" They also told prospective backers that money raised for a company would only be invested in that specific firm. That proved not to be the case, according to the SEC's lawsuit, which was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.",
      "\"Contrary to these representations, while some of the REV Retailer Brands generated revenue, none generated any profits,\" the suit states. \"Consequently, in order to pay interest, dividends and maturing note payments, Defendants resorted to using a combination of loans from outside lenders, merchant cash advances, money raised from new and existing investors, and transfers from other portfolio companies to cover obligations.\"",
      "Neither Mehr nor Lopez immediately responded to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "The SEC alleges that at least $5.9 million of returns paid to investors were actually Ponzi-like payments funded by other investors, as opposed to companies' profits.",
      "Additionally, the federal regulatory agency claims that Mehr and Lopez allocated $16 million worth of investments for their own use, according to the filing.",
      "REV Chief Operating Officer Maya Burkenroad is also accused of aiding Lopez and Mehr's alleged crimes. On REV's website, Burkenroad, who is Lopez's cousin, was described as having \"over 10 years of experience managing multi-million-dollar companies,\" according to the complaint.",
      "But the SEC claims Lopez and Mehr misrepresented her experience. Before joining REV, she had worked as a substitute preschool teacher, a promoter at a radio station, and as an assistant to Lopez at a prior endeavor, the complaint alleges.",

    "story": [
      "The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, rose slightly in August, in line with economists' expectations.",
      "Inflation yardsticks such as the PCE index and the Consumer Price Index measure the change in prices over time of a typical basket of goods and services.",
      "The\u00a0core\u00a0PCE, which excludes volatile fuel and food prices, shows a 2.9% in August on an annual basis, the same as July and in line with predictions from economists polled by financial data provider FactSet.",
      "The PCE rose 2.7% on an annual basis, a slight increase from the 2.6% year-over-year increase in July and the highest since February, according to data\u00a0released\u00a0Friday by the Commerce Department.",
      "Inflation has come down since rising prices prompted the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. But annual price gains have remained stubbornly above the central bank's 2% target. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), another key measure of inflation that tracks the change in prices on everyday items, also ticked higher last month.",
      "The ongoing strain of higher prices is taking a toll on Americans. A CBS News poll released earlier this month showed many are souring at the state of the economy. Two-thirds of the 2,344 U.S. adults polled said prices are still going up, with the same amount saying they expect prices to keep escalating in the coming months.",
      "Last week, the Fed went ahead and reduced the rate for the first time this year, lowering borrowing costs to help a deteriorating U.S. job market. But it's been cautious about cutting, waiting to see what impact President Donald Trump's sweeping taxes on imports have on inflation and the broader economy.",
      "For months, Trump has relentlessly pushed the Fed to lower rates more aggressively, calling Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"Too Late\" and a \"moron\" and arguing that there is \"no inflation.\"",
      "It's widely expected that the Fed will cut rates at its next meeting, which is scheduled for Oct. 28 - 29.",
      "\"This inline PCE today can keep the focus of the Fed on their full employment mandate, which will give them room to continue normalization of the Fed Funds rate,\" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at investment firm B. Riley Financial, said in an email note.",
      "Last month, Trump sought to fire Lisa Cook, a member of the Fed's governing board, in an effort to gain greater control over the central bank. She has challenged her dismissal in court, and the Supreme Court will decide whether she can stay on the job while the case goes through the judicial system.",
      "The Fed tends to favor the PCE inflation gauge that the government issued Friday over the better-known consumer price index. The PCE index tries to account for changes in how people shop when inflation jumps. It can capture, for example, when consumers switch from pricier national brands to cheaper store brands.",

      "These calls could be played back by intelligence officers, and The Guardian cited three sources within Unit 8200 who said the database was used to help shape military operations in Gaza and the West Bank, and to prepare deadly airstrikes by helping with research and to identify bombing targets in Gaza.",

      "\"When they need to arrest someone and there isn't a good enough reason to do so, that's where they find the excuse,\" one source told the British newspaper.",
      "The Guardian reported that leaked Microsoft files suggested a large proportion of the sensitive data was potentially being stored in Microsoft data centers in Ireland and the Netherlands.",
      "After the publication of its report, several sources told the newspaper that the repository of intercepted calls \u2014 as much as 8,000 terabytes of data \u2014 had been held in a Microsoft data center in the Netherlands, but within days of its report being published in early August, the data appeared to have been moved out of the country.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Thursday approved a $1.5 billion settlement between artificial intelligence company Anthropic and authors who allege nearly half a million books had been illegally pirated to train chatbots.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup issued the preliminary approval in San Francisco federal court Thursday after the two sides worked to address his concerns about the settlement, which will pay authors and publishers about $3,000 for each of the books covered by the agreement. It does not apply to future works.",
      "\"This is a fair settlement,\" Alsup said, though he added that distributing it to all parties will be \"complicated.\" About 465,000 books are on the list of works pirated by Anthropic, according to Justin Nelson, an attorney for the authors.",
      "\"We have some of the best lawyers in America in this courtroom and if anyone can do it, you can,\" Alsup said.",
      "The Association of American Publishers called the settlement a \"major step in the right direction in holding AI developers accountable for reckless and unabashed infringement.\"",
      "\"Anthropic is hardly a special case when it comes to infringement. Every other major AI developer has trained their models on the backs of authors and publishers, and many have sourced those works from the most notorious infringing sites in the world,\" said Maria A. Pallante, president and CEO of the publisher group.",
      "San Francisco-based Anthropic said it is pleased with the preliminary approval.",
      "\"The decision will allow us to focus on developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems. As we've consistently maintained, the court's landmark June ruling that AI training constitutes transformative fair use remains intact. This settlement simply resolves narrow claims about how certain materials were obtained,\" said Aparna Sridhar, deputy general counsel at Anthropic.",
      "The Authors Guild, meanwhile, said the settlement \"marks a milestone in authors' fights against AI companies' theft of their works. It sends a clear signal to AI companies that infringement of authors' rights comes at a steep price and will undoubtedly push AI companies towards acquiring the books they want legally, through licensing.\"",
      "A Monday filing sought to convince the judge that the parties have set up a system designed to get out robust notice to all authors and publishers covered by the agreement, ensuring they get their cut of the pot if they want to sign off on the settlement or opt out to protect their legal rights moving forward.",
      "They also tried to assure him that the author and publishers group that cobbled the deal together are not doing any \"back room\" dealings that would hurt lesser-known authors.",
      "Alsup's main concern centered on how the claims process will be handled in an effort to ensure everyone eligible knows about it so the authors don't \"get the shaft.\" He had set a Sept. 22 deadline for submitting a claims form for him to review before Thursday's hearing to review the settlement again.",
      "The judge had raised worries about two big groups connected to the case \u2014 the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers \u2014 working \"behind the scenes\" in ways that could pressure some authors to accept the settlement without fully understanding it.",
      "Attorneys for the authors said in Monday's filing they believe the settlement will result in a high claims rate, respects existing contracts and is \"consistent with due process\" and the court's guidance.",
      "Alsup had dealt the case a mixed ruling in June, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn't illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites to help improve its Claude chatbot.",
      "Bestselling thriller novelist Andrea Bartz, who sued Anthropic with two other authors last year, said in a court declaration ahead of the hearing that she strongly supports the settlement and will work to explain its significance to fellow writers.",
      "\"Together, authors and publishers are sending a message to AI companies: You are not above the law, and our intellectual property isn't yours for the taking,\" she wrote.",
      "Alsup also said in the courtroom Thursday that he plans to step down from the bench by the end of the year. President Bill Clinton nominated him for the federal bench in 1999.",

About $150 million will cover expenses for cutting the 900 employees, who Niccol said are \"nonretail\" workers.",
      "Niccol disclosed the plan in a letter to employees, but didn't specify how many locations would be shuttered. He did note that after adding some new locations over the last year, the company's overall store count in North America will decline by about 1% in fiscal year 2025.",

      "After 85 years of sending out paper checks to retirees, the Social Security Administration (SSA) is transitioning to electronic payments in what it says is an effort to modernize its services and improve efficiency.",
      "Starting Sept. 30, the SSA will no longer issue paper checks to its nearly 70 million recipients, instead sending benefits through either direct deposit or a prepaid debit card.",
      "\"We have been communicating directly with beneficiaries since July 1, and we have worked diligently to ensure that the less than one percent of individuals who receive paper checks have ample time to enroll in direct deposit or receive Direct Express cards,\" a Social Security spokesperson told CBS News in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"By moving to electronic payments exclusively, we aim to improve efficiency, security, and ensure beneficiaries receive their monthly benefits promptly,\" they added.",
      "The Social Security Administration has emphasized that electronic payments provide a safer and more secure way to receive benefits compared with paper checks, which the agency says are 16 times more likely to be lost or stolen. Eliminating paper checks is also a cost-saving measure: Checks cost 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer.",
      "In an online post, the SSA said it was sending notices to people who receive paper checks to alert them of the change. The agency encouraged paper check recipients to switch to the new payment options before the deadline to ensure they receive their benefits in a timely fashion.",
      "The Social Security spokesperson declined to comment on how people were contacted or on the current status of its outreach.",

      "\"The U.S. Department of the Treasury will grant exceptions to the rule for qualifying circumstances,\" the spokesperson said, without elaborating on what the qualifying circumstances are or the steps Social Security recipients would need to take to establish they qualify.",
      "President Trump set the shift away from paper checks in motion with a March executive order that mandated all federal payments be digitized. Paper-based checks, the White House said at the time, impose \"unnecessary costs; delays; and risks of fraud, lost payments, theft, and inefficiencies.\"",
      "Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, as well as advocates for seniors have noted that the roughly 600,000 people who rely on the SSA's original payment system often need paper checks because they're unable to receive electronic deposits.",
      "That includes people who are \"unbanked,\" or those who lack access to traditional bank accounts. According to an August report from Bankrate, the unbanked represent 4.6% of the U.S. population, and tend to rely more on check-cashing services and other alternative forms of payment to manage their finances.",
      "While the Social Security Act was signed into law in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it wasn't until\u00a01940\u00a0that the agency began sending paper checks to retired workers and their dependents as well as to survivors of deceased insured workers.

The rule had been set to take effect July 14, but was blocked by a federal court that month.",
      "\"We hope the FTC resurrects the click-to-cancel rules to protect millions of consumers from shady sales tactics,\" said Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a nonprofit public interest group, in en email. \"In the meantime, we hope this Amazon settlement sends a strong message to any company operating in ways that could conceivably confuse customers or thwart their efforts to not be customers any more.\"",
      "Thursday's settlement, which came\u00a0two days after a jury trial kicked off in Seattle, represents the culmination of a two-year case that the FTC began in June 2023.",

      "Amazon's most advanced fulfillment center, called SHV1, is located in Shreveport, Louisiana. It's more than 3 million square feet and one of the company's largest facilities that utilizes nearly 1,000 robots at the center.",
      "\"We have a number of different types of new robotics that we're using to fulfill customer orders,\" said Scott Dresser, Amazon's vice president of robotics.",

      "\"The robots we designed to run all day long, if they need to,\" he said. \"Certainly as we come into our peak holiday season, which we're already getting ready for, that's something we think about a lot because we will have to run the building almost all day round.\"",
      "How robots work in the facility",
      "When a customer orders a product, the robots get to work.",
      "Some move the item out of storage. Then, one of the 2,500 employees sorts it while another packs it before it travels along some of the nearly 15 miles of conveyor belts to get labeled.",
      "The robots have different functions to help move and lift the packages. For example, the robot Proteus hauls pallets and orders across the facility floor, while Cardinal lifts packages into pallets set for delivery.",
      "\"Cardinal is lifting packages that weigh up to 50 pounds. \u2026 And then we can use Proteus to take the container over to the docks. So a lot of it's less about performance, more about making sure that our employees are safe,\" Dresser said.",
      "The final step is a human loading the packages onto a truck.",
      "Dresser said SHV1 is 25% more efficient compared to other fulfillment centers.",
      "\"So if you're ordering an order here in Shreveport right before Christmas and you need that by Christmas, robots are going to help make sure we get that product to you fast, safely and accurately to your doorstep,\" he said.",
      "Impact on jobs",
      "Dresser said that while robots are replacing some jobs, they're also creating new ones.",
      "\"Every time we're able to grow and expand the network, which robotics has enabled over the last decade, we're able to add new jobs. \u2026 like our robotics maintenance engineers, people that we need in the operation now that we have these new robotics to help us run the building,\" he said.",
      "While Amazon's revenue has grown, its number of employees has held steady at around 1.5 million since 2022, according to the company's quarterly reports.",
      "\"I think the thing that we think of most when we're deploying a new fulfillment operation or a new process in a fulfillment operation, is how are people and robots best going to be able to do that together?\"",
      "Dresser added that Amazon is offering training for employees whose positions are being replaced and said those more advanced jobs pay better.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy grew at a strong 3.8% annualized pace in the second quarter, the government\u00a0reported Thursday in its final revision of gross domestic product data for April through June.",
      "U.S. GDP \u2014 the nation's output of goods and services \u2014 rebounded in the spring from a 0.6% first-quarter drop caused by fallout from President Donald Trump's trade wars, the Commerce Department said. The department had previously estimated second-quarter growth at 3.3%, and forecasters had expected a repeat of that figure.",
      "Consumer spending buoyed the economy in the second quarter, rising at a 2.5% pace, up from 0.6% in the first quarter and well above the 1.6% the government previously estimated. The data provides evidence that Americans continued to open their wallets despite broader economic headwinds such as tariffs and a slowing job market, economists noted.",
      "\"That was a meaningful bump-up from the previous estimate of 3.3% thanks to the mighty consumer,\" Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, senior economist at BMO, said in a Thursday report. \"Today's run of data suggest that the economy \u2014 which strongly rebounded after the pandemic recession \u2014 continues to hold up well, even as we anticipate some slowdown ahead.\"",
      "Spending on services advanced at a 2.6% annual pace, more than double the government's previous estimate of 1.2%.",
      "The stronger-than-expected GDP data provides evidence that the economy remains on a solid footing, which may dampen the Federal Reserve's enthusiasm for additional rate cuts in 2025 and early 2026, economists noted. The central bank last week issued its first rate cut of 2025 when it reduced\u00a0its benchmark rate by one-quarter point, with the Fed penciling in two additional cuts in 2025.",
      "When announcing the rate cut last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointed to a weakening labor market as prompting the move. Because rate reductions make it cheaper for businesses to borrow and expand, they can help bolster hiring and support the labor market.",
      "\"The Fed's September dot plot indicated that additional rate cuts are likely at their next two decisions in late October and December, but the case for back-to-back cuts is no slam dunk\" after today's GDP data, said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, in a Thursday email.",
      "Fed officials will be watching even more closely than unusual when their favorite inflation gauge \u2014 the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index \u2014 comes out Friday.",
      "Rebound from first quarter",
      "The first-quarter GDP drop, the first retreat of the U.S. economy in three years, was mainly caused by a surge in imports \u2014 which are subtracted from GDP \u2014 as businesses hurried to bring in foreign goods before Trump could impose sweeping taxes on them. That trend reversed as expected in the second quarter: Imports fell at a 29.3% pace, boosting April-June growth by more than 5 percentage points.",
      "A category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength came in stronger than previously reported as well, growing 2.9% from April-June, up from 1.9% in the first quarter and in the government's previous estimate. This category includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.",
      "But private investment fell, including a 5.1% drop in residential investment. Declining business inventories took more than 3.4 percentage points off second-quarter growth.",
      "Spending and investment by the federal government fell at a 5.3% annual pace on top of a 5.6% drop in the first quarter.",
      "Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander, noted that GDP growth averaged 1.6% in the first half of 2025 and consumer spending 1.5% \u2014 \"not great but much better than initially thought.''",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has added double-digit taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on imports from almost every country and targeted specific products for tariffs, including steel, aluminum and autos. The president sees tariffs as a way to protect American industry, lure factories back to the U.S. and to help pay for the tax cuts he signed into law July 4.",
      "Thursday's GDP report was the Commerce Department's third and final look at second-quarter economic growth. It will release its initial estimate of July-September growth on Oct. 30.",

    "story": [
      "Retailers around the U.S. are expected to sharply reduce the number of workers they add for the holidays, a shift from their usual seasonal hiring sprees to help cope with the annual crush of customers.",
      "Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas attributes the weak demand for extra workers this year to companies bearing the heavier costs from U.S. tariffs on foreign goods, as well as on rising inflation and their growing reliance on technology to improve efficiency.",
      "The firm expects retail hiring fo the holidays to fall to its lowest level since 2009, when the economy was emerging from a recession caused by the global financial crisis.",
      "\"Seasonal employers are facing a confluence of factors this year: tariffs loom, inflationary pressures linger, and many companies continue to rely on automation and permanent staff instead of large waves of seasonal hires,\" Andy Challenger, workplace expert and senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "The weaker seasonal hiring forecast comes as the U.S. job market is faltering. Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, falling far short of economists' expectations.",
      "Inflation has also edged up in recent months. The Consumer Price Index, which in March had sunk to an annual rate of 2.3%, in August\u00a0rose at a 2.9%\u00a0pace from a year ago.",
      "In the last quarter of 2024, retailers added just over 543,000 seasonal workers, down roughly 4% compared to 2023. Companies are projected to add fewer than 500,000 jobs during the last three months of 2025, according to Challenger. Such a figure would mark the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years.",
      "Challenger pointed to fewer seasonal hiring announcements than usual from retailers as a sign they plan to hire fewer workers for the holidays.",
      "\"While we could see a late hiring push if holiday sales surprise to the upside, the cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge. This year may be more about doing more with less,\" Challenger said.",
      "Tariffs are causing some consumers to pull back on spending, recent data shows. An August survey\u00a0of consumers from the University of Michigan found that most U.S. adults plan to spend less on goods that see tariff-driven price hikes. Just 24% of consumers surveyed said they expected to spend as usual on items that rise substantially in price, according to the report.",
      "Tariffs have already driven up the cost of some categories of goods for U.S. consumers. For example, in August, audio equipment rose in price by 12% compared to one year earlier,\u00a0 while the cost of household goods rose 10%, the latest Consumer Price Index report\u00a0shows.",
      "\"A wave of uncertainty is impacting not just retailers, but also consumers heading into the final quarter of the year. With hiring slowing across the board, Retailers may hire fewer workers themselves, while many of their shoppers slow spending,\" Challenger added.",

    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:23:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The large fee could help some U.S. workers find jobs, but there could be longer-term costs, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says the new $100,000 fee for foreign employees to obtain an H-1B visa will spur companies to hire Americans instead of bringing in labor from overseas. Yet many economists predict the results will be more mixed, potentially fostering increased domestic hiring in some industries but slowing long-term economic growth with a knock-on effect on overall employment.",
      "\"I could envision a scenario in which otherwise available [American] employees see a large increase for their labor demand,\" Kirk Doran, associate professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame, said of the new visa policy. \"There is some evidence that for the kind of work H-1B employees do, there are available workers looking for jobs right now.\"",
      "In the near term, some technology industry workers in particular could see job gains as more companies seek to avoid the sharply higher costs of bringing in employees from overseas, Rutgers University labor economist Jennifer Hunt told CBS News.",
      "\"The winners would be U.S. native-born computer programmers,\" she said. \"If you're a native worker who is really similar to an immigrant, immigrants are usually bad for you. So we would expect current American, U.S. programmers to be helped.\"",
      "Yet the bigger picture is more complex. Other economic research shows that hiring immigrant workers often benefits companies, providing a ready source of skilled labor with the education and training that may not be widely available in the U.S.",
      "One 2024 study from the nonprofit IZA Institute of Labor Economics on the impact of U.S. immigration on employment said H-1B workers can \"help firms increase their employment, revenues and survival probabilities,\" while finding no evidence that hiring of foreign labor through the program displaced native-born American workers.",
      "The research \u2014 from economists at IZA, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, University of Delaware, University of Michigan and Queens College, CUNY \u2014 also found that every H-1B worker a company hired helped produce additional job gains. \"High-wage, high-productivity firms expand more and even crowd-in natives with college degrees\" when able to add H-1B workers, they wrote.",
      "George Mason University economics professor Michael Clemens underlined that H-1B workers with specialized skills can help boost a company's revenue and profits, potentially spawning other kinds of jobs at the employer, such as in sales and marketing, that can be filled by U.S. workers.",
      "As a result, Clemens worries that the policy change would hurt Americans' job prospects over the long term. \"It is going to choke off job opportunities for the people it is supposed to help,\" he said.",
      "Cost of restricting immigration",
      "To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company. Congress caps the number of H-1B visas \u2014 which are valid for three years and which can be extended for an additional three years \u2014 at 85,000 annually. Roughly 700,000 workers in the U.S. hold H-1B visas, according to Capital Economics.",
      "\"The costs of restricting immigration are widespread,\" Gaurav Khanna, a University of California San Diego professor of economics focusing on migration, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"On net, it benefits U.S. workers more than it hurts them, such that the benefits outweigh the costs. The visas allow the IT companies to grow quite rapidly, and these IT firms start hiring other workers in management positions and in HR, so it leads to employment growth at these firms.\"",
      "The White House dismissed the notion that hiring workers from abroad also benefits U.S. workers.",
      "\"President Trump continues to prove to so-called 'experts' wrong time and time again \u2013 no 'economic study' can change the reality lived by many Americans across the country who bore the brunt of the massive abuse of the H-1B system,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "Rogers added that the visa fee protects \"Americans from cheap, foreign labor.\"",
      "In a\u00a0proclamation\u00a0last week, Mr. Trump said H-1B visas disadvantage Americans by allowing companies to exploit the program to \"replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.\" That has stunted job opportunities and undermined wages, he added.",
      "How much do H-1B workers earn?",
      "Some research supports this claim. For example, an August analysis\u00a0from The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, found that H-1B workers earn significantly less than their American counterparts.",
      "\"[M]any employers may be using the H-1B program not to attract top-tier global talent, but to fill roles at below-median wage levels\u2014raising questions about the program's alignment with its stated objectives,\" the report said.",
      "Other changes could be coming to the H-1B program, with the Trump administration aiming to tilt it toward better-paid foreign workers. On Monday, it proposed replacing the lottery with a system that would favor immigrants with advanced skills and higher incomes.",
      "The Heritage report also notes that the visas restrict worker mobility by tying a visa holder to a given company, preventing them from seeking other employment. That can make such workers more desirable to employers than native workers, who can leave their jobs at any time, the report explains.",
      "In this sense, companies' reliance on the program can hurt native workers, the group said.",
      "\"But this creates an uneven playing field: Native workers, who are free to switch jobs or negotiate better pay, may be overlooked not because they lack skills, but because they are not as easily retained or controlled,\" wrote Alexander Frei, the report's author and formerly a senior research associate at Heritage. \"As a result, employers may favor visa-bound workers who accept lower wages and fewer demands, driving down bargaining power and wage growth for equally or more qualified U.S. workers.\"",
      "Other groups have\u00a0criticized the H-1B program for disproportionately benefiting large, multinational firms that can enter thousands of visa applicants in the lottery and hire whomever is successful.",

      "The lawsuit focused on several Hershey candies that are marketed around Halloween, including its Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins and its Reese's White Ghost, as well as a few other holiday-themed chocolates like its Reese's Peanut Butter Shapes Assortment Snowmen Stockings Bells.",
      "The original lawsuit, filed in 2024, claimed that Hershey used deceptive advertising because the \"artistic designs\" depicted on the wrappers were absent from the actual candies.",

      "About 42 million individuals in 22.3 million households received food stamps in 2023, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report on the program.",
      "While SNAP is funded by the USDA, every U.S. state is in charge of administering the program to its residents, with those administrative costs split between the federal and state governments. Some states are already beginning to implement some of the new law's food stamp restrictions, such as Pennsylvania, which is mandating the stricter work rules starting Nov. 1.",
      "The changes are arriving at a precarious time for many, with grocery costs continuing to rise and poverty rates inching higher for senior citizens and Black Americans, according to new Census data. Anti-hunger advocates warn that reduced SNAP benefits could worsen food insecurity, undermining one of the nation's most effective safety nets credited with lifting 3.6 million people out of poverty last year, according to U.S. Census data.",
      "\"We are deeply concerned that the cuts to SNAP will lead to an increase in hunger,\" Carolyn Vega, associate director of policy analysis for Share Our Strength, an anti-hunger nonprofit, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You are looking at households that don't have a lot of extra wiggle room in their budget, so that makes every SNAP dollar very precious in extending that food budget.\"",
      "Tracking the impact of those SNAP cuts on food insecurity as the changes unfurl over the coming months and years may be difficult, given the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Sept. 20 announcement that it is halting its annual Household Food Security Report, which measures whether American families have access to healthy food.",
      "The USDA said it is nixing the report because it is \"redundant, costly, politicized and extraneous\" and leads to \"fear mongering.\" But anti-hunger advocates say scrapping the report could ultimately obscure the impact of the Republicans' cuts to the food stamp program.",
      "\"I don't see how it's redundant \u2014 the USDA puts out the only report on food insecurity,\" Vega said. \"It just indicates to me that they don't want to see the results of the reconciliation bill,\" referring to the Republican's \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about that claim.",
      "New work requirements",
      "New work requirements for SNAP recipients are taking effect as the labor market stalls, raising the risk that more people could lose access to food stamps under the stricter rules mandated by the Republican law, advocates say.",
      "\"It's a tough workforce right now, and the work requirements come without any support,\" Gina Plata-Nino, a food stamp expert at the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our most vulnerable will have even less access to resources.\"",
      "The new work rules expand what the federal government considers so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, who are adults without young children who must prove they are either working, volunteering or engaged in an education or training program for at least 20 hours a week to qualify for food stamps.",
      "Previously, the work requirements only applied to people between 18 to 54 years old, but the new law pushes that to age 64. Additionally, people who are former foster youth between 18 to 24 years old, veterans or homeless are no longer exempt from the work requirements, as they were previously.",
      "People who don't meet the work requirements will be limited to receiving food stamps for three months within a three-year period.",
      "\"Just off the bat, those are veterans, youths aging out of foster care \u2014 think about what it means to be unhoused, trying to get a job when you don't have a place to shower,\" Plata-Nino said. \"Again, these populations are going to be worse off.\"",
      "Work requirements have been championed by Republican lawmakers because they say the rules encourage people to be gainfully employed or engaged in the community in exchange for food aid.",
      "But anti-hunger advocates argue the rules often bump people off the program because they may face difficulties in filing paperwork. Others point out that low-income workers may struggle to get enough hours from their employers to meet the new federal requirements, especially given the proliferation of \"just in time\" scheduling, which slots workers into short shifts to reduce costs for employers.",
      "Prior to the changes, most SNAP recipients who were required to work were doing so, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Stricter aid calculations",
      "Under the new GOP tax and spending law, there are other changes going into the SNAP program that could reduce benefits for millions.",
      "For instance, SNAP applicants can deduct their utility costs from their incomes when calculating their benefits, which can help to increase their food-stamp allotments. But the new law now prevents food-stamp recipients from counting internet expenses as part of their household costs when determining benefits. That change went into effect as soon as the law was signed on July 4 by President Trump.",
      "\"Roughly 65% of participating households will see their benefit drop by an average of $10 a month\" because of the exclusion in using internet costs to calculate benefits, Vega said.",
      "\"It's a relatively small amount but for a household facing rising grocery cost and facing tough decisions, $10 can make a difference,\" she added.",
      "Longer-term, there are additional changes that could strain states' ability to provide food stamps, such as a shift in fiscal year 2027 requiring that states cover 75% of administrative costs, up from 50% now. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, states with high error rates \u2014 such as over- and underpayments of SNAP benefits \u2014 will also need to provide more funding for the program, starting in 2028.",
      "One concern, according to Vega, is whether states will have the financial resources to cover those additional costs.",
      "\"It's uncharted territory,\" she said. \"We do worry some states might decide they can't take that level of liability and won't participate in SNAP.\"",

      "For car buyers interested in electric vehicles, the clock is ticking to take advantage of federal tax credits on new and used EVs before they expire on Sept. 30.",
      "Introduced in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act signed, the federal tax credits \u2014 $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used \u2014 are being phased out due to President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is also\u00a0ending a series\u00a0\u00a0of other clean energy credits over the next several months.",
      "With just one week to go until the expiration date of the Biden-era EV credit, customers are flocking to dealerships to cash in. EV sales reached a record high in August, with new EV sales up 17.7% year over year and used EV sales up 59% for the same period, data from Cox Automotive shows.",
      "\"As we approach the sunset of the IRA tax credit, we expect September to mirror August's elevated sales activity, driven by time-sensitive purchase and lease offers,\" Cox Automotive said in its report.",
      "The findings jibe with data from Cars Commerce \u2014 whose holdings include\u00a0Cars.com\u00a0\u2014 that shows\u00a0 a 33% surge in EV demand since last year as shoppers rush to take advantage of the credits. The automotive tech company also found that used EVs are on dealers' lots for 46 days on average, a nearly 30% decrease from last last year that indicates the sector of the EV market is rising in popularity.",
      "Deals to be had",
      "Anxious to clear out EV inventory before the arrival of new models in November, dealerships have been offering their own incentives, such as monthly lease rates that are are as little as 1% of the car's sticker price.",

      "September 2025 could end up being the \"single biggest EV month in history,\" Tim Horvick, owner of the San Tan Ford dealership outside of Phoenix, told CBS' Van Cleave. But come October, when the EV credit is no longer in effect, the sales landscape could shift.",
      "\"It is the concern,\" Horvick said. \"It could be challenging.\"",
      "As a result of the coming end of the tax credit, along with other\u00a0policy changes introduced by the Trump administration, automakers have already slowed their production of electric vehicles, shifting their attention to more popular gas and hybrid models, CBS News reported.",

      "That's according to a new study from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) which predicts that\u00a0Americans will see their energy bill rise 7.6% to $976 on average this cold weather season. Those who rely on natural gas to heat their home could see an 8.4% jump in their bill, while those who use electricity could see a 10.2% increase.",
      "While electricity\u00a0prices vary\u00a0by state, overall the cost is rising. In August, prices increased by 6.2% compared with the same month last year, according to the latest inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",

      "The overall rising home-heating costs follow greater summer air-conditioning use, amid warmer temperatures. \"The average summer household electricity bill reached an estimated $776 in 2025, the highest in at least 12 years compounding household strain,\" the report states.",
      "\"We had a period of relatively stable electric bills and then last year electricity went up twice the rate of inflation,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As a result, more American households are falling behind on their energy bills.",
      "Since Dec. 31, 2023, energy arrearages \u2014 unpaid energy bills that homeowners owe to their utility company \u2014 have risen by about 31%, from approximately $17.5 billion to $23.0 billion by June 30, 2025, NEADA said in its report.",
      "The surge in energy arrearages comes as Americans are carrying\u00a0record amounts of debt.

Offerings vary by utility, but many companies provide free home energy assessments and discounts for people who want to insulate their homes.",
      "For those interested in fortifying the envelope of their home to minimize heat loss, options include hiring a contractor for a professional retrofit or, for straightforward insulation projects, DIY tips, he said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-h1b-visa-faq-100000-fee-uscis/",
    "published": "Tue, 23 Sep 2025 11:09:15 -0400",
    "summary": "Heavy new H-1B visa fee raises numerous questions, immigration law experts told CBS News. Here's what employees and employers should know.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications is sowing confusion among some immigrant workers and their employers, including whether it's safe for current holders of the visa to travel outside the U.S.",
      "The new fee, which President Trump announced in a proclamation on Friday, represents a major change to a 35-year-old program that has enabled millions of immigrants to work legally in the U.S. The visa has become a mainstay in the technology industry, including among bellwethers such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, and is also widely used in the financial sector.",
      "Over the weekend, the White House sought to\u00a0clarify\u00a0the new policy, stating that the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and that it is a one-time cost required only when initially applying for the visa.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said the addition of a $100,000 charge for H-1B visas on top of the existing fees reflects President Trump's promise \"to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "She added, \"The text of the proclamation is very clear, and it is unfortunate that uninformed reporters and corporate lawyers attempt to sow chaos and confusion. Americans have another reason to celebrate unprecedented action by President Trump to protect Americans from cheap foreign labor.\"",
      "After the White House outlined the new policy on Friday, some tech companies including Google and Microsoft this weekend instructed H-1B employees who were traveling outside the U.S. to return immediately, expressing concern they might not be allowed to re-enter without the $100,000 payment, according to workers and immigration lawyers.",
      "Despite the White House's clarification that the new fee applies only to new visa applications, not existing H-1B holders, there remains \"a great degree of uncertainty on the ground,\" Parul Koul, president of the union that represents employees at Google owner Alphabet, said during a press conference on Monday to address the new policy.",
      "On Tuesday, the Trump administration published a proposal to change how H-1B visas are allotted, switching from a randomized lottery to a system that would favor immigrants with higher skills and incomes.",
      "CBS News spoke with attorneys and other sources about the new policy \u2014 here's what to know.",
      "Who pays the $100,000 fee?",
      "Under current H-1B rules, employers pay the application fees on behalf of workers. Assuming that approach continues, that could deter many employers from picking up the additional $100,000 fees \u2014 roughly 10 times what they previously paid for an applicant, Emily Neumann, an immigration attorney and managing partner at Houston-based Reddy Neumann Brown, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Very few employers would be willing to shell out that kind of money,\" she said.",
      "Such an outcome would appear to align with the White House's goals of spurring employers to hire within the U.S. rather than recruiting foreign workers.",
      "\"It is therefore necessary to impose higher costs on companies seeking to use the H-1B program in order to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers,\" Mr. Trump said in his order.",
      "When does the fee go into effect?",
      "The new fee must be paid in submitting any new H-1B visa application and went into effect at 12:01 am EST on Sept. 21, according to a White House\u00a0statement.",
      "Each year, the federal government approves 85,000 H-1B visas for highly skilled non-U.S. workers, who typically require at least a bachelor's degree and a skill in a highly specialized field,\u00a0according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. An estimated 700,000 people in the U.S. hold a H-1B visa, according to Capital Economics.",
      "The USCIS says it has already reached its applicant cap for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. That means those applications would be excluded from having to pay the fee, but new applicants filing during the next fiscal year would be subject to it, Neumann explained.",
      "What are the main issues for current H-1B holders?",
      "According to the White House, the proclamation \"does not prevent any holder of a current H-1B visa from traveling in and out of the United States.\"",
      "H-1B visas are valid for three years, but can be extended for an additional three years. A White House official said the one-time $100,000 fee is only charged when applying for a visa for the first time \u2014 the payment is not required for current visa holders or those renewing the document, and those fees aren't changing.",
      "Yet the new rules leave some gray areas for current H-1B holders, Neumann said. For instance, the new fee is targeted at new visa applicants residing outside the U.S. That raises questions about whether current H-1B visa holders who are applying for changes, such as a visa renewal or a change of employer, might be caught up in the new requirement if they leave the U.S., Neumann and other immigration attorneys said.",
      "\"Where the question comes in is, what if after September 21 they file that extension and then they need to travel \u2014 are they going to be expected to pay that in order to get back into the U.S.?\" she said. \"That's kind of an open question right now.\"",
      "Although the White House said the fee doesn't apply to current H-1B holders and won't impact their travel, Neumann said she believes more guidance is needed because the White House's Sept. 21 FAQ notes the fee applies to \"any other H-1B petitions submitted after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025.\"",
      "\"This makes it sound like it could apply to an employee who travels with any petition filed after September 21, 2025. Although it seems clear that it does not apply to individuals currently in the United States, it is not clear how it impacts those who later travel and have a petition filed after the relevant date,\" she said.",
      "For now, Neumann said she is advising her corporate clients to direct their H-1B employees not to leave the U.S.. That was echoed by Jeff Joseph, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association and an immigration attorney.",
      "\"Until we have more clarification, which hopefully we'll have soon, we're telling people to just sit tight and not travel,\" Joseph said.",
      "Asked about the issue of H-1B holders who are applying for a change and who travel outside the U.S., the White House said the one-time $100,000 fee doesn't apply to renewals or current visa holders.",
      "How does the new fee impact the H-1B program?",
      "The $100,000 fee is likely to have a \"chilling effect\" on skilled foreign workers moving to the U.S.,\u00a0Joseph of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said.",
      "Although the tech industry has long been the biggest beneficiary of the H-1B program, the visa is designed for highly skilled workers across many industries, he added. Employers who rely on the visa include those in health care, which often recruit medical professionals outside the U.S. in areas where they have shortages, he said.",
      "More than 7 in 10 recipients of H-1B visas are from India, followed by China, at more than 1 in 10 recipients. The remainder of H-1B visa holders come from a range of countries, including Canada, South Korea, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan, according to a 2022 USCIS\u00a0report.",
      "What about the national security exemption?",
      "A provision in Mr. Trump's proclamation exempts some workers, companies and even entire industries from the new $100,000 fee if they are deemed to support the \"national interest\" and are adjudged not to pose a threat to the security or welfare of the U.S.",
      "For now, however, it's unclear how to receive such an exemption, including which federal agency will be charged with approving them, Neumann said.",
      "\"There's no guidance out there yet,\" she said. \"What are the national interest exemptions going to be? How would a company apply for that, if they can get the entire company to get the exemption? How would the individual apply?\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to questions about how the national security exemption would be applied or which agency will be handling the issue.",

    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 20:29:37 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture and a 25% tariff on heavy trucks.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. would impose a new round of tariffs, including a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30% tariff on heavy trucks.",
      "In social media posts to Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the new tariffs would take effect Oct. 1.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his posts that the 100% tariff on \"any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product\" would not apply to companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., which he defined as either \"breaking ground\" or being \"under construction.\"",
      "In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shockwaves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.",
      "Still, some experts think the new pharma tariffs could end up having only a modest impact, noting that generic drugs are exempt. The loophole for drugmakers with operations in the U.S. is also likely to soften the blow, Neal Shearing, group chief economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"Many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies either already have some production in the U.S. or have announced plans to build production in the near future,\" he said. \"Add in the fact that pharmaceuticals is the one area where we think there may have been significant inventory accumulation this year, as importers have sought to front-run potential tariffs, and the impact on the effective tariff rate is likely to be small.\"",
      "Higher costs for home furnishings?",
      "Trump argued that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were \"flooding\" the U.S. with their products and that tariffs must be applied \"for National Security and other reasons.\"",
      "The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump announced on social media that a \"major Tariff Investigation\" was being conducted on furniture coming into the U.S. and said that within the next 50 days, the investigation would be completed, and a tariff rate would be announced.",
      "The president said the 25% tariff on \"all 'Heavy (Big!) Trucks' made in other parts of the world\" was \"in order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition.\"",
      "\"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,\" Trump posted.",
      "Throughout much of 2025, the Trump administration's broad tariffs defied predictions that they would fuel inflation, but that respite seems to have ended after economic data this month showed the duties are now driving prices upward. The Consumer Price Index in August rose at a rate of 2.9% from a year ago, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Mr. Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.",
      "Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.",
      "\"There's no inflation,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday. \"We're having unbelievable success.\"",

      "Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared as they flew toward Howland Island in the Pacific, part of her attempt to become the first female aviator to circumnavigate the world.",
      "It's widely believed that Earhart crashed into the ocean near Howland Island after running out of fuel, says Laurie Gwen Shapiro, a journalist who wrote a book on Earhart. But other theories about where she and her plane ended up have circulated for decades \u2014 many of which lack clear evidence. Researchers are planning an expedition to a remote island later this year.",
      "It's not clear what, if any, classified documents the government may have on Earhart.",
      "But a lawmaker who represents the Northern Mariana Islands territory in the U.S. House pushed Mr. Trump to declassify and release Earhart records earlier this year, referring to \"credible, firsthand accounts\" that the aviator was spotted on the Pacific island of Saipan.",
      "\"Despite these recollections, her disappearance and the possibility that she may have died on our islands remain matters of unresolved historical inquiry,\" Del. Kimberlyn King-Hinds, a Republican, wrote in a July letter to the president.",
      "One of the theories is that Earhart was on a spy mission for the U.S. government when she landed in Saipan and was taken into custody by the Japanese.",
      "Documents previously released by the FBI contain a 1967 request for a security review of a manuscript that cites Navy files on Earhart that were marked \"confidential,\" a level of classification. The manuscript's author, a senior officer in the Air Force, wrote that the conclusions in the Navy report were that Earhart was not on a spy mission, did not crash-land in Saipan and was not held as a prisoner or executed as a spy.",
      "The FBI, in approving that manuscript for publication \u2014 which is a typical process for current and former government officials \u2014 noted that the Navy files did \"not warrant classification since the release of it would not be prejudicial to the national defense.\"",
      "Shapiro called the theory that Earhart was taken captive in Saipan \"nonsense.\"",
      "\"It's 99.9% that she ran out of gas,\" Shapiro told CBS News. She said Earhart and Noonan were low on fuel and \"very ill-prepared\" for their attempted flight to Howland Island, a tiny, difficult-to-find island in the middle of the ocean.",
      "\"It's very boring to tell people, you know what, she ran out of gas,\" said Shapiro. \"The fantasy around it is amazing.\"",
      "The National Archives and Records Administration has also previously\u00a0released documents\u00a0on the search for Earhart.",
      "In 1993, two Hawaiian lawmakers introduced bills in the House and Senate to require the government to release all records relating to Earhart's last flight and disappearance. The bills called for the declassification of any such relevant records that have been classified as government secrets.\" The measures never made it out of the committees they were referred to.",
      "Mr. Trump's push to declassify Earhart records follows his decision to release records on the 1960s-era assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. His administration is also under pressure to release records on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",

    "summary": "A federal grand jury indicted former FBI Director James Comey on two criminal counts. Comey has said he is innocent.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on Thursday marked the culmination of President Trump's yearslong desire to see one of his political foes punished after the bureau's investigation into his 2016 presidential campaign and Russian meddling in that election.",
      "But the president's long-held ire toward Comey, coupled with his latest comments cheering the federal charges brought against the former FBI chief, could aid defense lawyers in a potential bid to have the case against Comey tossed.",
      "\"In this case, the facts before the indictment and even comments Trump made after the indictment provide strong factual evidence that Mr. Comey is the victim of either selective or vindictive prosecution,\" Gene Rossi, a former federal prosecutor who worked at the Justice Department for nearly 30 years, told CBS News.",
      "A federal grand jury returned an indictment against Comey charging him with two counts: making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. It declined to indict him on an additional count of lying to Congress, a rare rejection of a proposed charge.",
      "The charges stem from Comey's September 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which he denied authorizing anyone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports.",
      "Whether to seek an indictment had been met with pushback from career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which is prosecuting the case. Staff in the office had circulated a \"declination\" memo explaining why criminal charges should not be filed against Comey, a Justice Department source told CBS News.",
      "But days before Comey was charged, and after the abrupt departure of Erik Siebert as the top prosecutor in the Virginia office, Mr. Trump installed a White House aide and his former personal defense lawyer Lindsey Halligan as Siebert's replacement.",
      "Halligan has no prosecutorial experience. Only she signed Comey's indictment, and Halligan remains the only attorney listed as representing the U.S.",
      "Comey denied any wrongdoing, and said in a video shared to social media, \"I'm innocent, so let's have a trial and keep the faith.\" His lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, said Comey will be vindicated in court.",
      "Legal experts expect Fitzgerald will seek to have the case dismissed on numerous grounds, including selective prosecution, which is when the prosecutor appears motivated by discriminatory intent, and vindictive prosecution, when the government acts out of \"genuine\" animus or seeks to punish a defendant for exercising a legal right.",
      "Carissa Byrne Hessick, a law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, said claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are difficult to prevail on, and it's tough to predict whether Comey will succeed in convincing a judge to dismiss his charges on those grounds.",
      "Courts are generally hostile to those claims \u2014 the legal standard is high for proving them and judges are concerned about opening the floodgates to these types of motions, Hessick said. But on the other hand, Comey's case may look different than others given the events leading up to his indictment, namely the appointment of Halligan and reports of internal disagreement over seeking charges, she said.",
      "\"The mixture of those two things \u2014 the fact that these sorts of cases are very hard to win, but also the unusual circumstances and the availability of evidence \u2014 I think makes it too difficult to predict what a court will do here,\" Hessick said.",
      "Mr. Trump has for years railed against Comey publicly, claiming he should be prosecuted for \"treason\" and calling him \"corrupt,\" \"stupid\" and a \"dirty cop,\" among other insults. In a social media post Saturday, the president made a direct appeal to Attorney General Pam Bondi for action against Comey and two other political opponents: New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote the three are \"guilty as hell\" and said, \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"",
      "The president then cheered Comey's indictment Thursday night.",
      "\"One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to is James Comey, the former Corrupt Head of the FBI,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Today he was indicted by a Grand Jury on two felony counts for various illegal and unlawful acts. He has been so bad for our Country, for so long, and is now at the beginning of being held responsible for his crimes against our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The attacks on Comey continued Friday, with Mr. Trump calling him a \"destroyer of lives\" who must pay a \"very big price\" for lying.",
      "\"Whether you like Corrupt James Comey or not, and I can't imagine too many people liking him, HE LIED!\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"It is not a complex lie, it's a very simple, but IMPORTANT one. There is no way he can explain his way out of it. He is a Dirty Cop, and always has been.\"",
      "Rossi said the years of comments made by Mr. Trump from the spring of 2017 \u2014 when the president fired Comey during his first term \u2014 to now, could bolster Comey's bid to have the charges dismissed.",
      "\"Whether vindictive or selective, this animus, the hatred, the prejudice toward who is charged, those emotions and factors become highly relevant,\" he said.",
      "But it's not just comments from Mr. Trump that could come into play. Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel also cheered the charges against Comey, with Patel claiming Comey and other top FBI officials weaponized federal law enforcement when they led the bureau.",
      "\"They are putting their thumb on the scale of justice instead of letting Lady Justice handle this matter blindly,\" Rossi said. \"That violates every norm \u2014 every norm \u2014 that a federal prosecutor is taught from the time they're born as baby prosecutors.\"",
      "He said the grand jury's rejection of the third count, lying to Congress, is \"another brick in the wall\" in support of Comey moving to dismiss the charges because of vindictive and selective prosecution, as is the opposition to pursuing an indictment by career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. Under Justice Department policy, prosecutors may pursue indictments only if they believe they can secure a conviction and that conviction will be sustained on appeal.",
      "\"That seasoned and career prosecutors, plus the former U.S. attorney for the EDVA, all said that this indictment doesn't have a legal and factual basis to present to the grand jury, and that [Halligan] was appointed three days before this charge was approved by the grand jury is all ample evidence that something is rotten in Denmark,\" Rossi said.",
      "Comey's case is unique compared to others where claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are raised for numerous reasons, Hessick said: It involves people who are newsworthy; there are media reports about the decision to bring charges; Mr. Trump has publicly spoken about action against Comey; and the charges against him appear to involve congressional testimony about investigations into Mr. Trump or Clinton.",
      "\"The case is also notable because this isn't just a question of the motives of the specific prosecutor who brought the charges,\" she said. \"It's also about the president's decisions to speak publicly about a case that's a high-profile political case.\"",
      "Hessick said that in previous administrations, presidents are often \u2014 but not always \u2014 careful not to comment about ongoing cases.",
      "Mr. Trump sought to have criminal charges brought against him by former special counsel Jack Smith in each of the two cases dismissed for vindictive and selective prosecution, but one of the requests was denied. The two cases, one involving the 2020 election and the other involving Mr. Trump's handling of sensitive government documents after his first term, were dismissed after he won a second term in the White House.",
      "Hunter Biden, former President Joe Biden's son, also unsuccessfully sought to have his indictment on tax charges dismissed on the same grounds, arguing the investigation into him was \"compromised by politics.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 18:09:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The economic impact of a government shutdown depends on its duration, economists say. Some payments, like Social Security, would continue to be issued.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown could begin within days, halting pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delaying services, as lawmakers remain deadlocked over funding past Sept. 30.",
      "The financial impact of a shutdown typically depends on the length of the disruption, with each week costing the U.S. economy about $7 billion, according to a new analysis from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco. A suspension could also weigh on investor and consumer confidence at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing headwinds, he told CBS News.",
      "Government shutdowns aren't new: The U.S. has experienced 14 of them since 1980, with the longest occurring over 34 days from December 2018 into January 2019, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. They're triggered when Congress fails to pass a full-year spending bill or a continuing resolution to fund the government for the pending fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday. Oct. 1.",
      "\"We've been to this picnic before, unfortunately,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute, told CBS News. Pacific Research is a think tank that focuses on free trade.",
      "\"In general, things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, those will continue to go out, and we'll continue to pay interest on the debt,\" Winegarden said.",
      "But, he added, \"The general rule is that the longer it goes on, the bigger the disruption.\"",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically prohibited from doling out money. Activities at many agencies will be suspended until lawmakers agree on a new funding bill, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely to be furloughed during that time.",
      "Yet because the government must continue to provide services that protect life and property, agencies will determine which essential workers must continue working, although they won't receive pay until lawmakers resolve the funding gap.",
      "And while some federal employees would eventually receive back pay, others could experience financial strain while their paychecks are suspended, Daco noted.",
      "During the shutdown of 2018-2019, about 800,000 government workers missed several weeks of pay, creating financial hardships for many. Some turned to online fundraising campaigns for assistance, while others relied on food banks to help them get through the period.",
      "What is the economic impact of a government shutdown?",
      "While the biggest direct hit would be on government workers, followed by federal contractors who would also be shut off from funding, delayed federal procurement on goods and services could also ripple through the broader economy, Daco told CBS News.",
      "A shutdown could also undermine confidence in the economy at a time when some sectors, such as the labor market, are facing headwinds, he added. Markets could be rattled by the disruption, as well as consumer sentiment, some economists noted.",
      "\"We need more certainty in the rules of the game of the economy,\" Winegarden said. \"Uncertainty, at this moment, is the last thing we need.\"",
      "A halt in government functions could also complicate monetary policy decisions, potentially resulting in delays for key economic data next month, such as the Oct. 3 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the labor market stalling out over the summer, Federal Reserve officials are expected to closely scrutinize the latest jobs data when they make their next rate decision at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"A government shutdown at this economic juncture represent a graver risk than when the economy is running at full steam,\" Daco said.",
      "Would Social Security benefits be impacted?",
      "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are covered by mandatory spending, which means that funding for these programs has been approved by Congress to continue without an expiration date.",
      "Social Security benefits would be paid on time, while health care payments for seniors in Medicare and low- and middle-income Americans enrolled in Medicaid would continue.",
      "However, Social Security's administrative budget needs to receive approval from Congress, which means that some of its services could be impacted in a shutdown, some experts note.",
      "\"In the event of a government shutdown ... customer service at the Social Security Administration may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing and replacing Medicare cards,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in a Friday email.",
      "Would other federal functions like the TSA be impacted?",
      "Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay because they provide essential services.",
      "Unlike other government agencies. the U.S. Postal Service operates as a sefl-funded, independent agency. That means mail, packages and other shipments would still be delivered and post offices would remain open in the event of a shutdown.",
      "But there could be other impacts for consumers and businesses. For one, some mortgage processing could face delays because the flood insurance program would be closed to new policies until Congress agrees to a new spending deal, according to TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.",
      "\"That means no mortgages which require federal flood insurance will be originated,\" he noted.",
      "In previous shutdowns, other services were also suspended, such as the Food and Drug Administration's inspections, as well as the entry to the National Parks, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to withhold more than $4 billion in foreign aid funding through a maneuver known as a \"pocket rescission.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday allowed President Trump's administration to withhold more than $4 billion in foreign aid funding, granting its request for emergency relief in a dispute over money that Congress has already approved.",
      "The high court's decision follows an order that Chief Justice John Roberts had issued earlier this month, which temporarily froze a district court injunction requiring the Trump administration to spend the money Congress appropriated for foreign-aid projects by the end of September. The court appeared to divide 6-3, with Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court's three liberals, dissenting.",
      "The Supreme Court said in an unsigned order that the harm to the executive branch's ability to conduct foreign affairs appears to outweigh the potential harm faced by the plaintiffs, which are organizations and businesses that receive funding for foreign aid projects. It added that the decision \"should not be read as a final determination on the merits. The relief granted by the Court today reflects our preliminary view, consistent with the standards for interim relief.\"",
      "The legal fight over foreign aid",
      "The dispute before the justices involves a tranche of more than $4 billion Congress approved last year for overseas development assistance, peacekeeping operations and to promote democracy globally, among other priorities. Mr. Trump notified Congress last month that he is seeking to claw back $4.9 billion before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30 through a maneuver known as a \"pocket rescission.\"",
      "The Government Accountability Office has said the move is illegal.",
      "But the Supreme Court said in its decision that at this stage in the proceedings, the government \"has made a sufficient showing\" that the Impoundment Control Act, the mechanism for the president to move to cancel congressionally approved federal funding, precludes the plaintiffs' suit. That lawsuit sought to make the president comply with appropriations law passed last year.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Kagan said the stakes in the case are high, as it involves the allocation of power between the executive branch and Congress.",
      "\"[T]he consequence of today's grant is significant. I appreciate that the majority refrains from offering a definitive view of this dispute and the questions raised in it,\" she wrote. \"But the effect of its ruling is to allow the Executive to cease obligating $4 billion in funds that Congress appropriated for foreign aid, and that will now never reach its intended recipients. Because that result conflicts with the separation of powers, I respectfully dissent.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled in early September that the administration's refusal not to spend congressionally approved funds is likely illegal under a federal law governing the agency rule-making process. The judge said the Trump administration could withhold the funding only if Congress rescinded it through duly enacted legislation.",
      "The dispute was brought by nonprofit organizations and development companies in February after the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause of foreign development assistance to review whether programs were consistent with the president's foreign policy.",
      "It has since ping-ponged through the courts, including the Supreme Court back in March. Then, the high court split 5-4 in deciding to leave in place an order from Ali that required the Trump administration to pay roughly $2 billion in invoices for foreign-aid work that had already been performed.",
      "In the latest development in the case, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled last month that the nonprofits and businesses could not sue on grounds the administration violated the separation of powers by unilaterally declining to spend congressionally approved foreign-aid funds. The panel voted 2-1 to wipe away an order from Ali that had prohibited the government from withholding the money Congress appropriated last year for foreign assistance programs.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit panel later issued an amended opinion that opened up an avenue for the nonprofits and businesses to seek relief on different legal grounds. On the heels of that decision, Mr. Trump informed Congress of his plan to rescind the $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding, which he said supported \"wasteful\" programs that did not align with his \"America First\" foreign policy agenda.",
      "The plaintiffs then filed a new request for preliminary relief with Ali, and the judge found that the Trump administration had a duty to comply with Congress's directives by spending the $4 billion by the end of September, when the fiscal year ends.",
      "The Trump administration asked the D.C. Circuit to freeze Ali's latest order. After the appeals court declined to do so, the administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene.",
      "In a filing with the high court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the district court's injunction \"raises a grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers.\"",
      "\"The President can hardly speak with one voice in foreign affairs or in dealings with Congress when the district court is forcing the Executive Branch to advocate against its own objectives,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "The solicitor general said Ali's injunction \"puts the executive branch at war with itself\" by requiring it to spend the same $4 billion that the president wants to claw back.",
      "But lawyers for the plaintiffs said that the government has been obligated to spend the money approved by Congress for specific purposes since at least March 2024. They wrote in a filing that the appropriations legislation enacted by Congress last year remains binding on the executive branch.",
      "\"[T]he upshot of the government's theory is that Congress's signature law meant to control impoundments actually provided the President vast new powers to impound funds, and made it virtually impossible to challenge impoundments in court,\" the lawyers said. \"Congress would not have enacted such a self-defeating statute.\"",
      "The plaintiffs warned that allowing the president to withhold the money for foreign assistance would threaten the viability of groups that receive federal dollars for projects overseas. For one of the organizations, Democracy International, 98% of its revenues in 2024 came from awards from the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to court filings. Lawyers warned the company would be at risk of bankruptcy if the expiring appropriations are not spent.",
      "\"The pocket rescission of democracy promotion funds is an existential threat to Democracy International,\" the plaintiffs wrote.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's Justice Department charged former FBI Director James Comey on Thursday with lying to Congress, an unprecedented step against a longtime Trump foe that revisits controversies over the FBI's Trump-Russia probe from nearly a decade ago.",
      "A grand jury in Northern Virginia voted to indict Comey on two counts: making a false statement to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. In an unusual move, the grand jury voted against indicting him on an additional charge of making a false statement.",
      "The criminal charges revolve around a Senate hearing in September 2020, when lawmakers grilled Comey \u2014 who was fired by Mr. Trump three years earlier \u2014 about how he handled the FBI's 2016 investigations into pro-Trump election meddling by Russia and Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Both election-year probes have drawn Mr. Trump's ire for years.",
      "The five-year statute of limitations for charges out of that hearing would have expired next week.",
      "Comey asserted in an Instagram video that he is innocent.",
      "In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the indictment \"reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people.\"",
      "Count 1: Comey accused of lying about media leaks",
      "The first count against Comey that was approved by the grand jury accuses him of breaking a federal law that makes it a crime to make \"any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation\" to a federal body, including Congress.",
      "The charge hinges on a combative back-and-forth between the former FBI director and Republican Sen.Ted Cruz of Texas during the Sept. 30, 2020, Senate hearing.",
      "In the hearing, Cruz pressed Comey on whether he had ever authorized another FBI staffer to serve as an anonymous source in any media reports about the bureau's 2016 investigations involving Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton.",
      "Comey had answered no to a similar question during another Senate hearing in 2017. But Cruz said in the 2020 questioning that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe \u2014 another Trump foe \u2014 has \"publicly and repeatedly stated that he leaked information to the Wall Street Journal and that you were directly aware of it and that you directly authorized it,\" referring to an article about an FBI investigation\u00a0into the Clinton Foundation.",
      "\"Now, what Mr. McCabe is saying and what you testified to this committee cannot both be true. One or the other is false,\" the senator said to Comey. \"Who's telling the truth?\"",
      "\"I can only speak to my testimony. I stand by the testimony,\" replied Comey.",
      "Thursday's indictment alleges that this statement is false because Comey \"then and there knew, he in fact had authorized [an unnamed person] to serve as an anonymous source in news reports regarding an FBI investigation.\"",
      "The indictment does not specify what alleged media leak led to the charges.",
      "A 2018 report by the Justice Department inspector general's office says Comey and McCabe discussed the Wall Street Journal article after it came out, but gave investigators competing stories about their meeting. Comey told the watchdog that McCabe \"led him to believe\" that McCabe hadn't authorized the release of any information to the Journal. But McCabe said he told Comey a day after the article was published that he'd approved the release himself, and Comey replied that it was a good idea.",
      "The report says \"the overwhelming weight of that evidence supported Comey's version of the conversation,\" and McCabe \"lacked candor\" in his conversation with Comey.",
      "McCabe later told \"60 Minutes\"\u00a0he did not intentionally mislead the inspector general. McCabe was fired in 2018, days before he was set to retire.",
      "In another incident separate from the McCabe controversy, the Justice Department's internal watchdog\u00a0found that Comey violated FBI policy by authorizing a friend, law professor Daniel Richman, to provide a reporter with the contents of a memo describing his interactions with Mr. Trump. It did not accuse Comey of releasing classified information.",
      "Count 2: Obstructing a congressional proceeding",
      "Comey was also indicted Thursday for allegedly trying to \"influence, obstruct and impede\" an investigation by the Senate Judiciary Committee by \"making false and misleading statements.\" The indictment does not say what alleged false statement led to the obstruction charge.",
      "Grand jury rejects a charge against Comey",
      "A majority of the Alexandria, Virginia-based grand jury that reviewed the Comey matter voted not to charge him with one of the three counts presented by prosecutors, according to a form that was signed by the grand jury's foreperson and filed in court.",
      "In order for federal prosecutors to criminally indict somebody, they need to convince most members of a 23-person grand jury that they have \"probable cause\" to believe a crime was committed \u2014 a much lower bar than the one needed to convict somebody.",
      "It's very rare for grand juries to decline an indictment.",
      "The unsuccessful count against Comey would have accused him of illegally making false statements to Congress during a line of questioning by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in September 2020.",
      "Graham had asked Comey if he remembered getting a lead from the intelligence community in September 2016 that alleged Hillary Clinton's campaign \"was going to create a scandal regarding Trump and Russia\" in order to distract from her use of a private email server.",
      "Comey replied: \"That doesn't ring a bell\" \u2014 which the Justice Department called false.",
      "The allegation about Clinton's campaign first surfaced in 2020, when it was\u00a0declassified\u00a0by Mr. Trump's Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe. Clinton campaign officials denied the accusation to Justice Department special counsel John Durham, a Trump-era prosecutor tasked with reviewing the Russia probe. But Durham said in a\u00a02023 report\u00a0that FBI investigators looking into possible Trump-Russia ties should've paid more attention to the claims.",
      "Justice Department data shows how unusual it is for grand juries to decline an indictment. In the 2016 fiscal year, federal prosecutors declined to bring charges against somebody because the grand jury didn't return an indictment only six times, out of more than 150,000 suspects who were investigated that year, according to a\u00a0Justice Department report.",
      "In recent months, however, grand juries in Washington, D.C., have rejected several requests for indictments by the Justice Department, including a possible felony charge against a person who was accused of throwing a sandwich at a federal agent. Former federal prosecutor Brendan Ballou told CBS News earlier this month that trend \"suggests that the administration has absolutely destroyed its credibility with jurors.\"",

      "Comey appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020 to answer questions about the origins of the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, known as \"Crossfire Hurricane.\" The probe, which has frustrated Mr. Trump for years, was later taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller.",
      "During that hearing, GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas asked Comey about earlier testimony in 2017 denying having been an anonymous source or authorizing another FBI official to be an anonymous source for news reports about the FBI's investigations into Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton.

      "But Cruz's line of questioning focused specifically on an alleged leak involving Andrew McCabe, Comey's former deputy at the FBI. A lawyer for McCabe said in 2018 that McCabe authorized the disclosure of information to a Wall Street Journal reporter in 2016 about the Clinton investigation with Comey's knowledge. The lawyer made the claim in response to an investigation by the Justice Department's internal watchdog, which found McCabe \"lacked candor\" when he told Comey, or led Comey to believe, that he had not authorized the disclosure.",
      "Comey also denied approving the disclosure to the Wall Street Journal during an interview with investigators in the inspector general's office, saying, \"just to make sure there's no fuzz on it, I did not authorize this. I would not have authorized this. If someone says that I did, then we ought to have another conversation because I, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me,\" according to a report detailing the findings released in April 2018.",
      "The inspector general's report noted that while it was relying on the recollections only of McCabe and Comey about conversations about the leak, \"the overwhelming weight of that evidence supported Comey's version of the conversation. Indeed, none of the circumstantial evidence provided support for McCabe's account of the discussion; rather, we found that much of the available evidence undercut McCabe's claim.\"",
      "The internal watchdog concluded that McCabe \"lacked candor, including under oath, on multiple occasions\" when describing his role regarding the disclosure to the Journal in violation of FBI rules.",
      "Separately, the Justice Department's inspector general\u00a0found that Comey violated FBI policy\u00a0by taking home four unclassified memos memorializing interactions with Mr. Trump in 2017 and authorizing a friend, Daniel Richman, who is a law professor at Columbia University, to provide the contents of one of the memos to a reporter at The New York Times.",

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are escalating their demands for information about White House border czar Tom Homan and any involvement he has had in federal contracts, following allegations that he accepted $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents posing as businessmen last year.",
      "In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that was first obtained by CBS News, seven Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee called for the release of Department of Homeland Security contracts, communications and other materials tied to the allegations. The group of lawmakers, which includes ranking member Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, set an Oct. 10 deadline for the department to respond.",
      "CBS News reported earlier this week that investigators examined whether Homan took the money in September 2024 in return for promises of government action if President Trump returned to office. One source briefed on the matter said investigators were focused on a bag of money given to Homan. MSNBC first reported that the transaction was caught on video as part of an FBI sting, and that Homan indicated he could help the undercover agents win government contracts. Homan did not disclose any such payment on his White House ethics filings, and Justice Department sources told CBS News the probe involved FBI and public integrity investigators before it was closed by Trump appointees.",
      "\"If true, this alleged conduct by a senior government official is unacceptable,\" the Democratic senators wrote, warning that the administration's decision to end the case \"raises further concerns that the Administration is weaponizing our system of justice to protect the President's friends and to persecute his political foes.\" The letter also points to the $170 billion Congress recently appropriated for border security and immigration enforcement, stressing that \"our homeland security should not be for sale.\"",
      "Democrats noted that Homan previously worked as a consultant for GEO Group, a private prison company that is one of ICE's largest contractors, saying his relationship with the company could be a conflict of interest. Homan was an official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the first Trump term and was named border czar shortly after the 2024 election.",
      "In an appearance on Fox News this week, Homan insisted that he did nothing wrong.",
      "\"Look, I did nothing criminal. I did nothing illegal,\" he said. \"You're talking about a guy who spent 34 years enforcing the law.\"",
      "On Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Homan never took the money. She called the investigation, which was initiated by the prior administration and dropped by the Trump administration, \"another example of the weaponization of the Biden Department of Justice against one of President Trump's strongest and most vocal supporters.\" Justice Department leaders have also said investigators found no credible evidence of wrongdoing.",
      "The Senate Democrats are asking DHS to hand over all contracts and grants Homan has been involved in since Jan. 20, 2025; his communications on contract awards; full GEO Group contract files; contacts between GEO Group and federal officials; and records of meetings with former clients while serving as border czar.",
      "A DHS spokesperson referred questions about the demand to the White House. A White House spokesperson pointed to statements defending Homan and saying he \"has not been involved with any contract award decisions.\"",
      "\"He is a career law enforcement officer and lifelong public servant who is doing a phenomenal job on behalf of President Trump and the country,\" said Abigail Jackson, the White House deputy press secretary.",
      "The letter follows a flurry of similar moves this week. Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee called for Homan to testify, and Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee opened an inquiry into the closure of the investigation. The same group of Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee pressed Attorney General Pam Bondi to release information about the Homan investigation by Oct. 8.",
      "With Republicans in control of the House and Senate, the inquiries are unlikely to go far, since Democrats do not wield subpoena power in the minority. But the investigations could gain steam if Democrats win back either chamber in next year's midterm elections.",

    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 14:33:53 -0400",
    "summary": "The National Archives admitted a technician had erred in releasing Rep. Mikie Sherill's \"entire record.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A branch of the National Archives released a mostly unredacted version of Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill's military records to Nicholas De Gregorio, an ally of Jack Ciattarelli, her GOP opponent in the New Jersey governor's race. The disclosure potentially violates the Privacy Act of 1974 and exemptions established under the Freedom of Information Act.",
      "The documents, which were also obtained by CBS News, appear to show that the National Personnel Records Center, a wing of the National Archives and Records Administration charged with maintaining personnel records for service members and civil servants of the U.S. government, released Sherrill's full military file \u2014 almost completely unredacted. CBS News discovered the egregious blunder while investigating whether Sherrill was involved in the 1994 Naval Academy scandal, in which more than 100 midshipmen were implicated in cheating on an exam. Sherrill was not accused of cheating and said her only involvement was not informing on her fellow classmates.",
      "The documents included Sherrill's Social Security number, which appears on almost every page, home addresses for her and her parents, life insurance information, Sherrill's performance evaluations and the nondisclosure agreement between her and the U.S. government to safeguard classified information.",
      "The only details redacted in the document are the Social Security numbers of her former superiors. The files appear to be the same ones Sherrill requested in August 2017 from the National Personnel Records Center, or NPRC, according to a signature verification page in the documents.",
      "Contacted by CBS News, the NPRC told CBS News that a technician did not follow standard operating procedures for releasing records, and should only have released portions eligible under FOIA rules.",
      "\"The technician should NOT have released the entire record,\" Grace McCaffrey of the National Archives and Records Administration, said in an email to CBS News' questions.",
      "McCaffrey said the Archives became aware of the breach on Tuesday and immediately initiated a review of internal controls, including how and why the technician did not follow standard operating procedures. The National Personnel Records Center also alerted the agency's inspector general to the breach and said it contacted Sherrill's congressional office to apologize.",
      "Political campaigns, opposition research firms and news organizations often seek the military records of current or former service members running for elected office for both vetting purposes and to better inform voters. Military veterans and the next of kin of a deceased former member may request the full breadth of their military service records. The full file is only available to the general public 62 years after they finish their military service. When others request those records, only parts of the military file are released, and sections are redacted for privacy or national security reasons.",
      "During the tightening New Jersey governor's race \u2014 a new poll shows Sherrill and Ciattarelli tied \u2014 Republicans allied with Ciattarelli have been examining Sherrill's military record, looking for information about the Naval Academy cheating scandal, in which over a hundred midshipmen were implicated in cheating on the final electrical engineering exam, a notoriously difficult course required for all third-year students who are not engineering majors.",
      "Sherrill had an unblemished career in the Navy and as a midshipman received a Navy Achievement Medal in 1991 for saving the life of a fellow classmate.\u00a0 Neither the documents released by the National Archives to De Gregorio nor the documents released to CBS News under the Freedom of Information Act spoke to her role in the 1994 Naval Academy scandal.",
      "A document\u00a0obtained\u00a0by CBS News \u2014 which is not in the files released by the Archives \u2014 shows that Sherrill's name was omitted from a commencement program on May 25, 1994, the date of the Naval Academy graduation. The program was confirmed to be authentic by the U.S. Naval Academy.",
      "When asked by CBS News why her name does not appear in the commencement program, Sherrill said in a statement: \"When I was an undergraduate at the Naval Academy[,] I didn't turn in some of my classmates, so I didn't walk, but graduated and was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy, serving for nearly ten years with the highest level of distinction and honor.\"",
      "She added: \"That Jack Ciattarelli and the Trump administration are illegally weaponizing my records for political gain is a violation of anyone who has ever served our country. No veteran's record is safe.\"",
      "While Ciattarelli did not respond for comment on the release of her records, he posted on social media about Sherrill not walking at graduation. He called it \"stunning and deeply disturbing\" that she was implicated in the scandal, although Sherrill said she did not walk because she refused to report classmates.",
      "The White House referred the matter to the National Archives.",
      "De Gregorio, a Marine veteran who unsuccessfully ran as a Republican for Congress in New Jersey, told CBS News: \"Given the charged political environment \u2026 Rep. Sherrill will no doubt seek to paint my actions as nefarious and the records as leaked by the Trump Administration to injure her, which as we both know is completely and totally false on both counts.\"",
      "De Gregorio told CBS News that Chris Russell, a Republican consultant in the state, had asked him to see what he could find on Sherrill.",
      "\"He [Russell] asked me if I could help him at all, and my first stop was, let me see what I can find from FOIA, and it was really the first time I'd ever done it,\" said De Gregorio.",
      "In May, De Gregorio, submitted a FOIA request to the NPRC for Sherrill's records. On June 11, De Gregorio received an email from the NPRC saying they had no records for a veteran named \"Sherill.\" The Archives had omitted the second \"r\" from Sherrill's last name.",
      "On June 12, De Gregorio told CBS News he called NPRC's customer service line, which routed him to a \"real, helpful person.\" CBS News has learned that the technician at NPRC accessed a system to retrieve Sherrill's Social Security number. And on June 30, her records were transmitted to De Gregorio, who said he gave the file to Ciattarelli's campaign but was surprised by what he received.",
      "\"When I saw [Sherrill's] Social (Security number), I was shocked,\" said De Gregorio. \"All of a sudden, the NPRC decides to give it to [me] a random guy. I made no bones like, I wasn't her, I wasn't a family member. There was no relationship there. And so I didn't know what to expect. So, I guess I'm a little shocked and kind of disgusted that the social was there.\"",
      "CBS News reviewed De Gregorio's request to the Archives and found it properly acknowledged that personal information and medical details would be redacted. The Archives told CBS News, \"We do not believe that there was any attempt to deceive NPRC staff in this case.\"",
      "De Gregorio later told CBS News that Ciattarelli's campaign did not hire or encourage him to access the files. Scott Levins, the NPRC director, on Monday sent a letter to De Gregorio admitting the Archives' \"serious error\" and said, \"I apologize for our mistake and ask that you please do NOT further disseminate the record that was sent to you in error.\"",
      "Sherrill's campaign was notified of the breach on Monday. In a letter to the congresswoman, NPRC apologized and said it was coordinating with the Navy, which is the legal custodian of the records. The records center also offered identity protection and free credit monitoring services.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday that he supports a \"criminal investigation into the unauthorized and illegal release\" of Sherrill's records.\"It's outrageous that Donald Trump and his administration and political hacks connected to them continue to violate the law,\" Jeffries said. \"And they will be held accountable.\"",
      "Two years ago, Republican Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Zach Nunn of Iowa were among 11 individuals whose records had been impacted by an unauthorized release from the Air Force Personnel Center Military Records Branch to a Democratic-aligned group. Politico reported Abraham Payton, of the research firm Due Diligence Group, had requested the records for the stated purpose of \"Benefits,\" \"Employment,\" and \"Other.\" Due Diligence was paid just over $110,000 by the House Democratic campaign, according to the Federal Election Commission records. The Air Force, in notifying Bacon of the breach, said Payton had requested the records \"inappropriately,\" and a House Judiciary subcommittee launched a probe in March 2023, but it is not clear whether it was completed.",
      "The unauthorized releases outraged Republicans in Congress. House Republicans attempted to stop the Defense Department from releasing summaries of the service records of current or former U.S. military members without the consent of the member, or if deceased, their next of kin, according to NBC News, but did not succeed.",
      "Journalists and veterans who investigate stolen valor claims said at the time the proposed legislation would effectively end independent examinations of individuals exaggerating their service record or violating the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, a federal law that makes it a crime to falsely claim to have received certain military decorations or awards with the intent of gaining a tangible benefit.",
      "Sherrill's political foes have also sought information about whether Sherrill had ever exaggerated her rank after leaving the Navy. Congressional records show she was selected for advancement to lieutenant commander in Sept. 2003. Records obtained through a FOIA request by CBS News and inquiries of the U.S. Naval Academy and Naval Personnel Command show Sherrill left the Navy at the rank of lieutenant in December 2003, before she received the promotion.",
      "CBS News found that in 2020, her campaign sent out political emails that incorrectly used the lieutenant commander rank. Also, former President Joe Biden referred to Sherrill as a \"lieutenant commander\" in his remarks in Oct. 2021 while touting his Build Back Better and infrastructure deal.",
      "But CBS News did not find any instances where Sherrill herself misrepresented her military rank. Anthony Anderson, an Army veteran who is one of the country's most prominent \"stolen valor\" detectives, told CBS News that the rank issue did not rise to the level of her stealing valor either under the Stolen Valor Act of 2013 or how the term is used within the military community.",

      "\"The Secretary of War will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week,\" said chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell. President Trump earlier this year signed an executive order renaming the Defense Department as the Department of War and Hegseth as Secretary of War, but the name can only officially be changed by Congress.",
      "The Pentagon has provided no other details about the meeting to either the military leaders or the press.",
      "The news of the meeting was first reported in The Washington Post.",
      "There are regularly scheduled meetings with senior military leaders, but a meeting of this size \u2014 in person and on such short notice \u2014 is rare, if not unprecedented.",
      "Asked Thursday about the planned meeting, Mr. Trump told reporters, \"I love it.\"",
      "\"Let them be friendly with the generals and admirals from all over the world,\" he said. \"Is there something wrong with it?\"",
      "Hegseth earlier this year said the Pentagon plans to cut down the number of generals and flag officers \u2014 that is, those holding the rank of at least rear admiral in the Navy or brigadier general in the Army, Air Force or Marines. The goal, according to a May memo, is to cut 20% of the four-star positions in the active-duty force and 20% of the generals in the National Guard.",
      "During his first few weeks on the job, Hegseth held a town hall at the Pentagon and promised to look into whether every four-star general or admiral is necessary.",
      "\"We won World War II with seven four-star generals,\" Hegseth said in February. \"Today, we have 44. Do all of those directly contribute to warfighting success? Maybe they do, I don't know, but it's worth reviewing to make sure they do.\"",
      "It's not clear whether Hegseth is expected to address reducing the general and admiral positions in this meeting.",
      "Some officials have raised other theories, like whether he will roll out the National Defense Strategy, released every four years, which details the priorities for the department. This year's National Defense Strategy is expected to place a heavier emphasis than previous ones on defending the homeland with operations in U.S. Southern Command, like the recent strikes destroying boats of alleged drug smugglers, and in U.S. Northern Command at the southwest border.",
      "The meeting also comes as Congress remains deadlocked over funding the government, teeing up a potential government shutdown on Oct. 1. If the government shuts down, paychecks for military personnel will be delayed, although they will still be required to report for duty.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a recent letter to Republican state attorneys general.",
      "Conservatives and anti-abortion groups have criticized the drug, particularly after the Biden administration in 2023 made it possible for women to receive mifepristone via telehealth and by mail. The majority of women who terminate pregnancies do so through medication abortions.",
      "Republican attorneys general had written to Kennedy on the matter in July, and in response, Kennedy said the FDA is taking a look at the drug's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. Kennedy in June asked FDA Commissioner Martin Makary to \"review the latest data\" on the drug, an FDA spokesperson confirmed at the time. The spokesperson did not respond to further questions about when the review would start or what specifically it was reviewing about the drug.",
      "In their Sept. 19 letter to the states, Kennedy and Makary wrote, \"HHS \u2014 through the FDA \u2014 is conducting its own review of the evidence, including real-world outcomes and evidence, relating to the safety and efficacy of the drug.\"",
      "\"Recent studies \u2014 such as the study by the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC), which you highlighted in your letter \u2014 indicate potential dangers that may attend offering mifepristone without sufficient medical support or supervision,\" the letter continued. \"FDA's own data collected between 2000 to 2012 indicated 2,740 adverse events, including 416 events involving blood loss requiring transfusions. Since then, safeguards for women regarding the administration of mifepristone have been significantly reduced.\"",
      "According to EPPC, its\u00a0study found nearly 11% of women \"experience sepsis, infection, hemorrhaging, or another serious adverse event within 45 days following a mifepristone abortion,\" but CBS News medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder told \"CBS Evening News,\" \"Other data sources show the rate of serious complications to be much lower, at less than 1 in 200.\"",
      "The EPPC study cited by Kennedy and lawmakers like Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, is one that says it focuses on \"applying the Judeo-Christian moral tradition\" to public policy.",
      "Asked whether the review could lead to a ban on mifepristone, Gounder suggested it would be difficult for the FDA to withdraw approval, an extraordinary step that would quickly draw legal challenges, but said depending on what the safety review finds, it could make access more difficult, limiting the drug's availability through telehealth or by mail, or restricting the ability to prescribe it to doctors, rather than physician assistants or nurses who are also currently able to prescribe it.",
      "Kennedy and Makary did not say when their review would be completed, but told the states, \"We will keep you informed as the FDA's review of mifepristone progresses.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that paves the way for\u00a0a deal\u00a0brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "\"With this executive order, you will be effectively bringing into effect the agreement that will save TikTok and ensure that it can operate safely and securely,\" White House staff secretary Will Scharf said ahead of a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.",
      "The move declares that the deal represents a \"qualified divestiture\" that satisfies a law passed by Congress requiring TikTok's China-based parent company to divest or face a ban and pushes back enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for an agreement on how the app operates in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during their call last week. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The TikTok deal",
      "Under the law, TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. Earlier this month, the president extended the enforcement pause until Dec. 16. The new order extends the pause until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "According to a senior White House official, under the deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, according to the White House. The executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by the divest-or-ban law.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said at the White House that the new entity would have a valuation of about $14 billion.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in the new TikTok, according to the White House. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "The full roster of U.S. investors and their stakes in the company remain unclear, but Vance said Thursday the administration is planning to announce the other investors in the coming days.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "CBS News contributor Christopher Krebs, the former director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said there are \"still some questions on how operationally ... it's going to play out and what the user is going to experience on a daily basis.\"",
      "There's been limited pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "Still, some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern Friday and said he has asked for an \"urgent\" briefing from the Trump administration.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",
      "The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress, however, left it up to the president to ultimately determine what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\" The law gives the president the power to decide, through an interagency process, whether \"the relevant foreign adversary controlled application [is] no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary.\" It defines \"controlled by a foreign adversary\" as a company headquartered in a foreign adversary country and owning at least a 20% stake.",

      "\"These safeguards would protect the American people from the misuse of their data and the influence of a foreign adversary, while also allowing the millions of American viewers, creators, and businesses that rely on the TikTok application to continue using it,\" it says.",

      "Inflation has come down since rising prices prompted the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. But annual price gains have remained stubbornly above the central bank's 2% target. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), another key measure of inflation that tracks the change in prices on everyday items, also ticked higher last month.",

      "The findings, published Thursday, are based on a reconstruction of a crushed skull discovered in China in 1990 and have the potential to resolve the long-standing \"Muddle in the Middle\" of human evolution, researchers said.",
      "But experts not involved in the work cautioned that the findings were likely to be disputed and pointed to ongoing uncertainties in the timeline of human evolution.",
      "The skull, labelled Yunxian 2, was previously thought to belong to a human forerunner called Homo erectus.",
      "But modern reconstruction technologies revealed features closer to a species previously thought to have existed only later in human evolution, including the recently discovered Homo longi and our own Homo sapiens.",
      "\"This changes a lot of thinking,\" said Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum, London, who was part of the research team.",
      "\"It suggests that by 1 million years ago, our ancestors had already split into distinct groups, pointing to a much earlier and more complex human evolutionary split than previously believed,\" he added.",
      "The findings shocked the research team.",
      "\"From the very beginning, when we got the result, we thought it was unbelievable. How could that be so deep into the past?\" Xijun Ni, a professor at Fudan University who co-led the analysis, told BBC News. \"But we tested it again and again to test all the models, use all the methods, and we are now confident about the result, and we're actually very excited.\"",

      "The scientists relied in part on another similar skull to shape their model, and then compared it to over 100 other specimens.",
      "The resulting model \"shows a distinctive combination of traits,\" the researchers said, some of them similar to Homo erectus, including a projecting lower face.",
      "But other aspects, including its apparently larger brain capacity, are closer to Homo longi and Homo sapiens, according to the study.",

    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 06:21:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The study's author said \"there is some irony\" in the discovery that these \"things that are meant to kill everything are now attracting so much life.\"",
    "story": [
      "Marine life is thriving on unexploded Nazi bombs sitting at the bottom of a German bay, a submersible has discovered, even capturing footage of starfishes creeping across a huge chunk of TNT.",
      "The discovery, which was revealed in a study published Thursday, was \"one of those rare but remarkable eureka moments,\" marine biologist Andrey Vedenin told AFP.",
      "The waters off Germany's coast are estimated to be littered with 1.6 million tons of unexploded munitions left behind from both world wars.",
      "In October last year, a team of German scientists went to a previously uncharted dump site in the Baltic Sea's Luebeck Bay and sent an unmanned submersible 20 meters down to the seafloor.",
      "They were surprised when footage from the sub revealed 10 Nazi-era cruise missiles. Then they were stunned when they saw animals covering the surface of the bombs.",
      "There were roughly 40,000 animals per square meter \u2014 mostly marine worms \u2014 living on the munitions,\u00a0the scientists wrote\u00a0in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.",
      "\"Despite the potential negative effects of the toxic munition compounds, published underwater images show dense populations of algae, hydroids, mussels, and other epifauna on the munition objects, including mines, torpedo heads, bombs, and wooden crates,\" the study concludes.",
      "They also counted three species of fish, a crab, sea anemones, a jellyfish relative called hydroids and plenty of starfishes.",
      "While animals covered the hard casing of the bombs, they mostly avoided the yellow explosive material \u2014 except for one instance.",
      "The researchers were baffled to see that more than 40 starfishes had piled on to an exposed chunk of TNT.",
      "\"It looked really weird,\" said Vedenin, a scientist at Germany's Carl von Ossietzky University and the study's lead author.",
      "Exactly why the starfishes were there was unclear, but Vedenin theorized they could be eating bacterial film collecting on the corroding TNT.",
      "Life on deadly weapons",
      "The explosive chemicals are highly toxic, but the animals appeared to have found a way to live near it.",
      "Other than the death-wish starfishes, they did not seem to be behaving strangely.",
      "\"The crabs were just sitting and picking something with their claws,\" Vedenin said.",
      "To find out what kind of bombs they were dealing with, he went online and found a manual from the Nazi air force Luftwaffe describing how to handle and store V-1 flying bombs. The cruise missile exactly matched the 10 bombs from the footage.",
      "Vedenin said \"there is some irony\" in the discovery that these \"things that are meant to kill everything are now attracting so much life.\"",
      "He compared it to how animals such as deer now thrive in radioactive areas abandoned by humans near the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.",
      "Hard surfaces on the seafloor are important for marine life that want more than mud and sand.",
      "Animals once flocked to huge boulders that littered the Baltic Sea, however humans removed the stones to build infrastructure such as roads at the start of the 20th century.",
      "So when the Nazi bombs are eventually cleared from the bay, the researchers called for more stones \u2014 or concrete structures \u2014 to be put in place to continue supporting the sea life.",
      "The scientists also plan to return to the spot next month to set up a time-lapse camera to watch what the starfishes do next.",
      "Marine life also thriving in shipwrecks",
      "It's the latest example of wildlife flourishing in polluted sites. Previous research has shown shipwrecks and former weapons complexes teeming with biodiversity.",
      "Studies like these are a testament to how nature takes advantage of human leftovers, flipping the script to survive, said marine conservation biologist David Johnston with Duke University. He recently mapped sunken World War I ships that have become habitats for wildlife along the Potomac River in Maryland.",
      "\"I think it's a really cool testimony to the strength of life,\" Johnston told The Associated Press.",
      "A 2023 paper\u00a0published in BioScience\u00a0found that shipwrecks provide important ecological resources for a wide variety of organisms, from tiny microbes to large marine creatures.",
      "\"Small fish and mobile crustaceans often find shelter in the crevices of the sunken material, and larger baitfish and predators use shipwrecks as feeding grounds and rest stops as they swim from one place to another,\"\u00a0according to NOAA, which helped conduct the study.",
      "This year, a cargo ship lying at the bottom of the sea off the Belgian coast has been filled with a stash of rare flat oysters in a bid to help boost other marine species.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur from Argentina with powerful claws, feasting on an ancient crocodile bone.",
      "The new find was possibly 23 feet long and hailed from a mysterious group of dinosaurs called megaraptorans. They prowled across what's now South America, Australia and parts of Asia, splitting off into different species over millions of years.",
      "Megaraptorans were known for their stretched-out skulls and \"huge and very powerful claws,\" said Lucio Ibiricu with the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Paleontology, who was part of the discovery team.",
      "But it's not yet clear how these creatures hunted and where they fall on the evolutionary timeline \u2014 mainly because the fossils recovered so far were incomplete.",
      "\"Megaraptorans are among the least understood dinosaurs of all,\" Ibiricu told the Reuters news agency.",
      "In a new study, researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhu\u00e9 Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realize this could be a new species.",
      "This latest member of the megaraptoran clan named Joaquinraptor casali \"fills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet,\" Federico Agnolin with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia said in an email. Agnolin was not involved with the research, which was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The creature likely lived between 66 and 70 million years ago \u2014 close to the time dinosaurs went extinct \u2014 and was at least 19 years old when it died, though scientists don't know what killed it.",
      "The front leg bone pressed against its jaws \u2014 belonging to an ancient relative of crocodiles \u2014 could yield some clues to its diet and whether it was the top predator on the humid prehistoric flood plains.",
      "Study co-author Matt Lamanna told Reuters that unlike the T. rex, which had massive teeth and small arms, the Joaquinraptor likely used its long arms to capture prey.",
      "\"This suggests that these two predatory dinosaur lineages evolved different adaptations to accomplish basically the same thing - that is, to capture, subdue, kill and eat other animals such as other dinosaurs,\" Lamanna told Reuters. \"Precisely why these groups evolved along these different evolutionary pathways remains a mystery, but it shows that, during the Cretaceous, there was more than one way to be a top predator.\"",
      "Ibiricu named the new dinosaur in memory of his son Joaquin. While Joaquin was very young and hadn't yet developed a fascination with dinosaurs, Ibiricu still thinks he would have appreciated being named after one.",
      "\"All children love dinosaurs so he would probably be a fan too,\" he said.",
      "The discovery comes just a few months after\u00a0 scientists identified the Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, a new T. rex ancestor that researchers called the \"missing link\" between apex predators.",

      "The telescope was studying Sagittarius B2, a massive molecular cloud, NASA said in a news release. The region is just a few hundred light-years from the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way and is densely packed with stars, star-forming clouds and complex magnetic fields. Sagittarius B holds only 10% of the galactic center's gas, but produces 50% of its stars.",
      "The Webb telescope's instruments can examine the infrared light that passes through the region to study what forms there.",
      "One image from the Mid-Infrared Instrument shows an area known as Sagittarius B2 North, which is one of the most molecularly rich regions known to humans, NASA said. The images taken with Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument show gas and dust in the region in \"unprecedented detail,\" NASA said. In this image, stars appear only as blue pinpoints through the thick clouds.",
      "When using the telescope's Near-Infrared Camera, astronomers were able to see colorful stars illuminating bright clouds of gas and dust. The astronomers will continue to study these stars to learn more about their size and age, which will inform research into the process of star formation in Sagittarius B2.",
      "The new images still leave some questions for astronomers. Areas of Sagittarius B2 that look dark and empty are actually \"so dense with gas and dust that even Webb cannot see through them,\" NASA said. Those clouds of gas and dust will eventually become future stars, NASA said. The clouds also serve as a sort of \"cocoon\" for young stars.",
      "Researchers also hope the Webb telescope's instruments can help them learn why star formation in the center of the Milky Way is so low.",

    "summary": "Microsoft says it stopped providing some cloud and AI services to Israel after allegations that it used the services to conduct mass surveillance of Palestinians in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",
    "story": [
      "Microsoft says it has stopped providing some of its cloud and AI services to Israel's Ministry of Defense following a report in Britain's Guardian newspaper, which alleged Israel used the services to conduct mass surveillance of Palestinians in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",
      "The Guardian report, published in August in conjunction with Israeli outlets +972 Magazine and Local Call, claimed Israel's military surveillance agency \u2014 called Unit 8200 \u2014 used Microsoft's Azure cloud platform to store recordings of millions of cellphone calls made by Palestinians.",
      "These calls could be played back by intelligence officers, and The Guardian cited three sources within Unit 8200 who said the database was used to help shape military operations in Gaza and the West Bank, and to prepare deadly airstrikes by helping with research and to identify bombing targets in Gaza.",
      "One source told The Guardian that during the planning of an airstrike on an individual in a densely populated area of Gaza, officers would use the system to examine calls made by other people in the immediate vicinity.",
      "Other sources told The Guardian that use of the data was initially focused on the West Bank, which Israel's military controls.",
      "\"When they need to arrest someone and there isn't a good enough reason to do so, that's where they find the excuse,\" one source told the British newspaper.",
      "The Guardian reported that leaked Microsoft files suggested a large proportion of the sensitive data was potentially being stored in Microsoft data centers in Ireland and the Netherlands.",
      "After the publication of its report, several sources told the newspaper that the repository of intercepted calls \u2014 as much as 8,000 terabytes of data \u2014 had been held in a Microsoft data center in the Netherlands, but within days of its report being published in early August, the data appeared to have been moved out of the country.",
      "\"We have found evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting. This evidence includes information relating to IMOD consumption of Azure storage capacity in the Netherlands and the use of AI services,\" Microsoft said in a statement Thursday, without elaborating on what the evidence showed.",
      "Microsoft said it had informed the Israeli Ministry of Defense that it would be halting and disabling its use of some specific subscriptions and services.",
      "\"We have reviewed this decision with IMOD and the steps we are taking to ensure compliance with our terms of service, focused on ensuring our services are not used for mass surveillance of civilians,\" Microsoft said.",
      "Intelligence sources told The Guardian that Unit 8200 planned to transfer the data from Microsoft's servers to the Amazon Web Services cloud platform. Neither the Israel Defense Forces nor Amazon replied to The Guardian's request for comment.",
      "CBS News asked both the IDF and Amazon for comment on the report of a possible transfer of the data to Amazon's servers but did not receive a reply by time of publication.",
      "Microsoft said its current review is still ongoing.",
      "It follows an initial review by the American tech giant, triggered by an earlier Guardian report about how the IDF's use of Microsoft's Azure and AI services surged during its Gaza offensive, in which the company said it had found \"no evidence that Microsoft's Azure and AI technologies, or any of our other software, have been used to harm people or that IMOD has failed to comply with our terms of service or our AI Code of Conduct.\"",

    "summary": "YouTube will offer creators a way to rejoin the streaming platform if they were banned for violating COVID-19 and election misinformation policies that are no longer in effect.",
    "story": [
      "YouTube creators whose accounts were banned for violating previous policies against COVID-19 and election misinformation will be given the chance to rejoin the platform, said Alphabet, YouTube's parent company, on Tuesday.",
      "In a letter submitted in response to subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee, attorneys for Alphabet said the decision to bring back banned accounts reflected the company's commitment to free speech.",
      "\"No matter the political atmosphere, YouTube will continue to enable free expression on its platform, particularly as it relates to issues subject to political debate,\" the letter read, noting that a number of accounts were kicked off the platform between 2023 and 2024 for violating misinformation rules that don't exist anymore. Now, it said, \"YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect.\"",
      "The company in its letter also said it \"values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse\" and added that YouTube \"recognizes these creators are among those shaping today's online consumption, landing 'must-watch' interviews, giving viewers the chance to hear directly from politicians, celebrities, business leaders, and more.\"",
      "The move is the latest in a cascade of content moderation rollbacks from tech companies, who cracked down on false information during the pandemic and after the 2020 election but have since faced pressure from President Trump and other conservatives who argue they unlawfully stifled right-wing voices in the process.",
      "It comes as tech CEOs, including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, have sought a closer relationship with the Republican president, including through high-dollar donations to his campaign and attending events in Washington.",
      "YouTube in 2023 phased out its policy to remove content that falsely claims the 2020 election, or other past U.S. presidential elections, were marred by \"widespread fraud, errors or glitches.\" Claims of fraud in the 2020 election have been debunked.",
      "The platform in 2024 also retired its standalone COVID-19 content restrictions, allowing various treatments for the disease to be discussed. COVID-19 misinformation now falls under YouTube's broader medical misinformation policy.",
      "Among the creators who have been banned from YouTube under the now-expired policies are prominent conservative influencers, including Dan Bongino, who now serves as deputy director of the FBI. For people who make money on social media, access to monetization on YouTube can be significant, earning them large sums through ad revenue.",
      "House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan and other congressional Republicans have pressured tech companies to reverse content moderation policies created under former President Joe Biden and accused Biden's administration of unfairly wielding its power over the companies to chill lawful online speech.",
      "In Tuesday's letter, Alphabet's lawyers said senior Biden administration officials \"conducted repeated and sustained outreach\" to coerce the company to remove pandemic-related YouTube videos that did not violate company policies.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and wrong when any government, including the Biden Administration, attempts to dictate how the Company moderates content, and the Company has consistently fought against those efforts on First Amendment grounds,\" the letter said.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also accused the Biden administration of pressuring employees to inappropriately censor content during the COVID-19 pandemic. Elon Musk, the owner of the social platform X, has accused the FBI of illegally coercing Twitter before his tenure to suppress a story about Hunter Biden.",
      "The Supreme Court last year sided with the Biden administration in a dispute with Republican-led states over how far the federal government can go to combat controversial social media posts on topics including COVID-19 and election security.",
      "Asked for more information about the reinstatement process, a spokesperson for YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "The Secret Service has disrupted a sprawling telecommunications network in the New York Tri-State Area that investigators say posed a serious potential disruption to New York's telecom systems and a possible threat to the United Nations General Assembly meetings this week.",
      "In the largest seizure of its kind, the U.S. Secret Service announced Tuesday that the agency found active SIM farms at abandoned apartment buildings located at more than five sites. In total, law enforcement discovered 300 SIM servers \u2013 over 100,000 SIM cards \u2013 enabling encrypted, anonymous communication and capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute. Officials say the servers were so powerful they could have disabled cell phone towers and launched distributed denial of services attacks with the ability to block emergency communications like EMS and police dispatch.",
      "\"This network had the potential to disable cell phone towers and essentially shut down the cellular network in New York City,\" U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool said in a video released by the agency.",
      "An official briefed on the investigation told reporters that this week, the sophisticated network \"could text message the entire country within 12 minutes,\" later adding, \"This was well organized and well funded.\"",
      "Telephonic threats to multiple senior U.S. officials this past spring \u2013 including multiple people protected by the Secret Service \u2013 first triggered the investigation, but officials say the network was seized within the last three weeks.",
      "\"We cannot share which officials were targeted out of concerns for their privacy, but as the forensics investigation continues, we do expect that we will find more targeted officials once we get through that data,\" McCool said.",
      "Early analysis shows the network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals known to U.S. law enforcement, including members of known organized crime gangs, drug cartels and human trafficking rings, according to multiple officials briefed on the investigation. The U.S. Secret Service says it is combing through the more than 100,000 SIM cards in an ongoing, exhaustive forensic analysis.",
      "\"Each SIM basically has the equivalent data of a cell phone. So we're working through every call, every text, every search made on those SIM cards,\" an official told CBS News, adding, \"Early analysis indicates that this network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals that are known to federal law enforcement here in the U.S.\"",
      "The equipment was found within 35 miles of the United Nations in New York, ahead of the U.N. General Assembly. Investigators also found 80 grams of cocaine, illegal firearms, plus computers and phones.",
      "\"This isn't a group of people in a basement playing a video game and trying to play a prank,\" one official said. \"This was well organized and well funded.\"",
      "\"The timing, the location, the proximity of this network had the potential to impact the U.N. and that was clear and something that we had to consider,\" added McCool.",
      "The investigation was launched by a new division within the U.S. Secret Service established by Director Sean Curran and dubbed the \"Advanced Threat Interdiction Unit,\" in conjunction with Homeland Security Investigations.",
      "\"These devices no longer pose any threat to New York,\" an official said. \"We've taken care of and dismantled that threat\u2026There is currently no credible threat against the UN.\"",
      "Still, another official added that \"it would be unwise to assume\" there aren't other such networks in the U.S.",
      "The investigation remains ongoing, according to the U.S. Secret Service. There have been no arrests yet, but officials said, \"there could be arrests down the road,\" adding that \"from an operational perspective, we want those behind the network to know that the Secret Service is aware and that we're kind of coming for them.\"",
      "Homeland Security Investigations is leading the criminal investigation into individuals involved in coordinating this large scheme, while the U.S. Secret Service is running down threats tied back to its protectees, according to multiple U.S. officials.",
      "In a statement released by the U.S. Secret Service, the agency also thanked the Department of Justice, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the NYPD, as well as other state and local law enforcement partners, for providing technical advice and assistance.",

      "Robot umpires are getting called up to the big leagues next season.",
      "Major League Baseball's 11-man competition committee on Tuesday approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System in the major leagues in 2026.",
      "Human plate umpires will still call balls and strikes, but teams can challenge two calls per game and get additional appeals in extra innings. Challenges must be made by a pitcher, catcher or batter \u2014 signaled by tapping their helmet or cap \u2014 and a team retains its challenge if successful. Reviews will be shown as digital graphics on outfield videoboards.",
      "Adding the robot umps is likely to cut down on ejections. MLB said 61.5% of ejections among players, managers and coaches last year were related to balls and strikes, as were 60.3% this season through Sunday. The figures include ejections for derogatory comments, throwing equipment while protesting calls and inappropriate conduct.",
      "Big league umpires call roughly 94% of pitches correctly, according to UmpScorecards.",
      "The Automated Ball-Strike Challenge System, powered by T-Mobile, is coming to MLB's Regular Season \u26be\ufe0f https://t.co/97raRHFtsT pic.twitter.com/SHxKuRTKu8",
      "ABS, which utilizes Hawk-Eye cameras, has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019. The independent Atlantic League trialed the system at its 2019 All-Star Game and MLB installed the technology for that year's Arizona Fall League of top prospects. The ABS was tried at eight of nine ballparks of the Low-A Southeast League in 2021, then moved up to Triple-A in 2022.",
      "In 2019, Fred DeJesus became the first umpire in a regular-season game to use ABS. He remembers the first pitch he tested \u2013 it was a strike \u2013 and how he was hesitant about the new technology at first.",
      "\"Initially, it was like, no way, we're not doing this. I spent way too much money trying to learn the craft of calling balls and strikes,\" he told CBS News in 2021.",
      "At Triple-A at the start of the 2023 season, half the games used the robots for ball/strike calls and half had a human making decisions subject to appeals by teams to the ABS.",
      "MLB switched Triple-A to an all-challenge system on June 26, 2024, then used the challenge system this year at 13 spring training ballparks hosting 19 teams for a total of 288 exhibition games. Teams won 52.2% of their ball/strike challenges (617 of 1,182) challenges.",
      "At Triple-A this season, the average challenges per game increased to 4.2 from 3.9 through Sunday and the success rate dropped to 49.5% from 50.6%. Defenses were successful in 53.7% of challenges this year and offenses in 45%.",
      "ABS was used in this year's All-Star Game as well and has generally received positive reviews, CBS Sports reported. Four of five challenges of plate umpire Dan Iassogna's calls were successful in July.",
      "Teams in Triple-A do not get additional challenges in extra innings. However, the proposal approved by the MLB on Tuesday included a provision granting teams one additional challenge each inning if they don't have challenges remaining.",
      "MLB has experimented with different shapes and interpretations of the strike zone with ABS, including versions that were three-dimensional. Currently, it calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone is 53.5% of batter height and the bottom 27%.",
      "This will be MLB's first major rule change since sweeping adjustments in 2024. Those included a pitch clock, restrictions on defensive shifts, pitcher disengagements such as pickoff attempts and larger bases.",
      "The challenge system introduces ABS without eliminating pitch framing, a subtle art where catchers use their body and glove to try making borderline pitches look like strikes. Framing has become a critical skill for big league catchers. While there was concern that full-blown ABS would make some strong defensive catchers obsolete, not everyone considers the skill a good thing.",
      "\"The idea that people get paid for cheating, for stealing strikes, for moving a pitch that's not a strike into the zone to fool the official and make it a strike is beyond my comprehension,\" former manager Bobby Valentine said.",
      "Texas manager Bruce Bochy, a big league catcher from 1978-87, maintained old-school umpires such as Bruce Froemming and Billy Williams never would have accepted pitch framing. He said they would have told him: \"'If you do that again, you'll never get a strike.' I'm cutting out some words.\"",

    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok includes new stipulations over who controls the social media company's algorithm, a closely guarded secret which has proved to be a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market.",
      "In the meantime, a senior White House official said Monday that the U.S. and China had reached agreement on the basic details of the app's ownership. The new structure will move TikTok's U.S. operations under a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S. that will control the algorithm and oversee security, the official said.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Who will control the TikTok algorithm?",
      "According to the White House official, the new arrangement will operate and control a copy of the algorithm. Software maker Oracle will \"provide sort of top to bottom security\" throughout the company, the official said, noting that will involve monitoring the technology as well as managing how American data is stored.",
      "\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately, that it's not being used for any kind of malicious purpose, and that it's not being unduly influenced,\" the White House official said.",
      "Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",
      "Mr. Trump, asked last week about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. Last week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, last week told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "Asked about this structure last week, Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization, told CBS MoneyWatch that as she understands it, ByteDance would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use the algorithm under certain terms.",
      "\"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it,\" she said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said last week that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch before details of the new structure were announced.",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, said the new arrangement has to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",

    "summary": "Members of the blind community have found new ways to use the AI technology to help manage everyday tasks, such as reading the mail.",
    "story": [
      "Emeline Lakrout, a busy New Yorker with a knack for running, rock climbing and swimming, doesn't let being legally blind stop her from living an active lifestyle.",
      "Despite being declared blind at 8 years old, Lakrout has taken on challenges, such as running the New York City Marathon and joining the U.S. National Paraclimbing Team. A new piece of technology \u2014 Meta's AI glasses \u2014 is her latest tool to help her stay savvy and adaptable on a daily basis.",
      "\"The glasses make my life easier,\" said the 27 year old. \"They make things faster and they make me able to do more in the day because it's just quicker and easier to do things and I feel less tired at the end of the day.\"",
      "Meta originally designed the glasses for users to stream video on the go and interact with the world around them using AI. The newest iteration of the technology was unveiled last week and includes the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses\u00a0and a new model of smart Oakley glasses aimed at sports enthusiasts.",
      "Members of the blind community have found new ways to use the technology.",
      "Users are able to connect their glasses to the \"Be My Eyes\" app which connects blind and visually impaired users with volunteers to assist with recognizing objects and managing everyday tasks in real time. Such activities may include going through mail, or helping individuals grocery shop.",
      "The new AI glasses also use optical character recognition, or OCR, which can recognize and read aloud text for users on menus, receipts and mail. For Lakrout, having access to text-based information like signs in a subway station or on street corners is what makes AI technology useful. She says Meta's AI glasses are bringing blind communities one step closer to accessing this information.",
      "The glasses, however, are work in progress says Mark Riccobono, president of the National Federation of the Blind.",
      "\"(They) work well for some things, doesn't work well in other situations,\" he said.",
      "Lakrout discovered this for herself. When she tried the glasses on in a restaurant, they read the menu to her perfectly but couldn't tell her the price for a specific item on second prompt. When using some of the AI-powered features, the glasses' battery died, and so she regularly had to keep them in their case to charge.",
      "More importantly, Riccobono said, is that Meta has \"taken an interest in working with blind people to make the technology better, make it more accurate, make it more meaningful to the experience of blind people.\"",
      "Lakrout and Riccobono both agree that AI technology and Meta's glasses are a useful step in enhancing the blind and visually impaired community's independence. But in the end, the glasses do not \"replace the need for human capacity,\" Riccobo said. \"So we need to teach blind people and we still need to make sure that blind people develop the skills that blind people need to be successful.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tariff-pharmaceutical-drugs-kitchen-cabinets-furniture-heavy-trucks/",
    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 20:29:37 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture and a 25% tariff on heavy trucks.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. would impose a new round of tariffs, including a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30% tariff on heavy trucks.",
      "In social media posts to Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the new tariffs would take effect Oct. 1.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his posts that the 100% tariff on \"any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product\" would not apply to companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., which he defined as either \"breaking ground\" or being \"under construction.\"",
      "In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shockwaves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.",
      "Still, some experts think the new pharma tariffs could end up having only a modest impact, noting that generic drugs are exempt. The loophole for drugmakers with operations in the U.S. is also likely to soften the blow, Neal Shearing, group chief economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"Many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies either already have some production in the U.S. or have announced plans to build production in the near future,\" he said. \"Add in the fact that pharmaceuticals is the one area where we think there may have been significant inventory accumulation this year, as importers have sought to front-run potential tariffs, and the impact on the effective tariff rate is likely to be small.\"",
      "Higher costs for home furnishings?",
      "Trump argued that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were \"flooding\" the U.S. with their products and that tariffs must be applied \"for National Security and other reasons.\"",
      "The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump announced on social media that a \"major Tariff Investigation\" was being conducted on furniture coming into the U.S. and said that within the next 50 days, the investigation would be completed, and a tariff rate would be announced.",
      "The president said the 25% tariff on \"all 'Heavy (Big!) Trucks' made in other parts of the world\" was \"in order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition.\"",
      "\"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,\" Trump posted.",
      "Throughout much of 2025, the Trump administration's broad tariffs defied predictions that they would fuel inflation, but that respite seems to have ended after economic data this month showed the duties are now driving prices upward. The Consumer Price Index in August rose at a rate of 2.9% from a year ago, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Mr. Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.",
      "Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.",
      "\"There's no inflation,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday. \"We're having unbelievable success.\"",

      "In the same survey, 43% of teen boys said they feel pressure to be physically strong. It's one reason that some young men are drawn to social influencers collectively known as the \"manosphere,\" a term widely used to describe the ecosystem of content aimed at men.",

      "\"There's a pain that's there, and that pain is real and it's authentic,\" Reese said. \"It's understandable, the draw to the manosphere, because, you know, who else is actually talking about some of the struggles of what it means to be a boy, and trying to understand these feelings and emotions? And you're hearing from people who look and sound like they got it all together. It's pain layered on pain that's there. We're just trying to offer a more loving way to move forward.\"",

But other theories about where she and her plane ended up have circulated for decades \u2014 many of which lack clear evidence. Researchers are planning an expedition to a remote island later this year.",

      "\"It's 99.9% that she ran out of gas,\" Shapiro told CBS News. She said Earhart and Noonan were low on fuel and \"very ill-prepared\" for their attempted flight to Howland Island, a tiny, difficult-to-find island in the middle of the ocean.",

The bills called for the declassification of any such relevant records that have been classified as government secrets.\" The measures never made it out of the committees they were referred to.",
      "Mr. Trump's push to declassify Earhart records follows his decision to release records on the 1960s-era assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. His administration is also under pressure to release records on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",

He said the body was found in a \"mountainous area\" that was not along a trail, and it was about a three-hour hike to get to the remains on foot.",
      "Decker, a 32-year-old former Army soldier, was accused in May of killing his three daughters, 9-year-old Paityn Decker, 8-year-old Evelyn Decker and 5-year-old Olivia Decker. DNA testing confirmed he was the only suspect in the murders, police have said.",
      "The girls' mother alerted authorities on May 30 that he had not returned the three girls on time to her at her home in Wenatchee, Washington, following a scheduled visit, and a search was launched. The girls' bodies were found three days later at a campsite in the Cascade Mountains, along with Decker's truck.",

      "In September 2024, Decker's ex-wife, Whitney Decker, filed to modify their custody agreement. In a petition, she wrote that Decker's mental health issues had worsened and that he had become increasingly unstable. She also said he was often living out of his truck.",
      "Decker, an Army infantryman from March 2013 to July 2021, had extensive training in navigation, survival and other survival skills, authorities previously said. Despite the continued search, police said in late June that they\u00a0believe he may have died\u00a0or left the area.",

    "summary": "\"48 Hours\" can exclusively report there has been a huge break in the 1991 murders of four teenage girls in a Texas yogurt shop.",
    "story": [
      "\"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty has learned a suspect has been identified in the 1991 murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop. This is according to one of the original investigators who worked the case.",
      "That suspect is Robert Eugene Brashers, who is deceased, says retired Austin detective John Jones.",
      "Brashers is a serial killer and rapist who committed at least three murders between 1990 and 1998 in the states of South Carolina and Missouri. He died in January 1999 by suicide during a standoff with police. The gun he used to shoot himself is believed to be consistent with a bullet casing found in a drain inside the yogurt shop, says Jones.",
      "The connection between Brashers and the case was made through DNA, Jones told Moriarty.",
      "Moriarty has reported on the yogurt shop case since the very beginning.",
      "On Dec. 6, 1991, 17-year-old Eliza Thomas, 13-year-old Amy Ayers, and two sisters, 17-year-old Jennifer Harbison and 15-year-old Sarah Harbison, were found gagged, tied up with their own clothing, and shot in the head in an I Can't Believe It's Yogurt! shop in Austin. The person responsible had also set the shop on fire, compromising much of the evidence.",
      "Eliza and Jennifer had been working at the yogurt shop that night. They were getting ready to close when Jennifer's sister, Sarah, and their friend, Amy, met them there to head home.",
      "Following the crime, the Austin Police Department developed a task force dedicated solely to solving the case. Government agencies, including the FBI, were called in to assist, but the case ultimately went cold until 1999, when four men, Robert Springsteen, Michael Scott, Maurice Pierce and Forrest Welborn, were arrested and charged with the murders.'",
      "The men were only teenagers at the time of the crime. They were first questioned just days after the murders when one of them, Maurice Pierce, was arrested at a mall not far from the yogurt shop with a .22 caliber gun \u2014 one of the same types of weapons believed to have been used in the killings.",
      "All four were released back then for lack of evidence, but in 1999, when a new team of investigators were tasked with taking a fresh look at the old case, they obtained confessions from two of the four men, Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott. Those confessions would later be called into question after the two recanted, saying they were coerced.",
      "Charges were ultimately dropped against Maurice Pierce and Forrest Welborn due to lack of evidence, and Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott were the only two to go on trial. The sole evidence against them were their own words. They were both convicted, but a few years later, their convictions were overturned on constitutional grounds. The Sixth Amendment gives defendants the right to confront accusers and in Scott and Springsteen's trials, their confessions were used against one another, but they weren't allowed to question each other in court.",
      "Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County, Texas, district attorney at the time, was intent on retrying Springsteen and Scott. But before doing so, her office decided to take advantage of what was then a fairly new type of DNA testing called Y-STR testing. It was a way of searching for and extracting male DNA only. Y-STR testing was ordered on vaginal swabs taken from the victims at the time of the murders. By this point, investigators had come to believe that at least one of the victims had been sexually assaulted. As a result of the Y-STR testing, a partial male DNA profile was obtained from one of the girls, but to the surprise of the district attorney's office, the DNA sample did not match any of the four men who were arrested.",
      "Still, prosecutors were determined to retry Springsteen and Scott. But before doing so, they wanted to figure out who that mystery DNA belonged to. In 2009, with no matches, the charges against Springsteen and Scott were dropped. After nearly 10 years behind bars, they were released.",
      "For years, officials kept trying to track down the source of the mystery DNA and finally there was a match this month, according to original investigator John Jones.",

    "summary": "A federal grand jury indicted former FBI Director James Comey on two criminal counts. Comey has said he is innocent.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on Thursday marked the culmination of President Trump's yearslong desire to see one of his political foes punished after the bureau's investigation into his 2016 presidential campaign and Russian meddling in that election.",
      "But the president's long-held ire toward Comey, coupled with his latest comments cheering the federal charges brought against the former FBI chief, could aid defense lawyers in a potential bid to have the case against Comey tossed.",
      "\"In this case, the facts before the indictment and even comments Trump made after the indictment provide strong factual evidence that Mr. Comey is the victim of either selective or vindictive prosecution,\" Gene Rossi, a former federal prosecutor who worked at the Justice Department for nearly 30 years, told CBS News.",
      "A federal grand jury returned an indictment against Comey charging him with two counts: making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. It declined to indict him on an additional count of lying to Congress, a rare rejection of a proposed charge.",
      "The charges stem from Comey's September 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which he denied authorizing anyone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports.",
      "Whether to seek an indictment had been met with pushback from career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which is prosecuting the case. Staff in the office had circulated a \"declination\" memo explaining why criminal charges should not be filed against Comey, a Justice Department source told CBS News.",
      "But days before Comey was charged, and after the abrupt departure of Erik Siebert as the top prosecutor in the Virginia office, Mr. Trump installed a White House aide and his former personal defense lawyer Lindsey Halligan as Siebert's replacement.",
      "Halligan has no prosecutorial experience. Only she signed Comey's indictment, and Halligan remains the only attorney listed as representing the U.S.",
      "Comey denied any wrongdoing, and said in a video shared to social media, \"I'm innocent, so let's have a trial and keep the faith.\" His lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, said Comey will be vindicated in court.",
      "Legal experts expect Fitzgerald will seek to have the case dismissed on numerous grounds, including selective prosecution, which is when the prosecutor appears motivated by discriminatory intent, and vindictive prosecution, when the government acts out of \"genuine\" animus or seeks to punish a defendant for exercising a legal right.",
      "Carissa Byrne Hessick, a law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, said claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are difficult to prevail on, and it's tough to predict whether Comey will succeed in convincing a judge to dismiss his charges on those grounds.",
      "Courts are generally hostile to those claims \u2014 the legal standard is high for proving them and judges are concerned about opening the floodgates to these types of motions, Hessick said. But on the other hand, Comey's case may look different than others given the events leading up to his indictment, namely the appointment of Halligan and reports of internal disagreement over seeking charges, she said.",
      "\"The mixture of those two things \u2014 the fact that these sorts of cases are very hard to win, but also the unusual circumstances and the availability of evidence \u2014 I think makes it too difficult to predict what a court will do here,\" Hessick said.",
      "Mr. Trump has for years railed against Comey publicly, claiming he should be prosecuted for \"treason\" and calling him \"corrupt,\" \"stupid\" and a \"dirty cop,\" among other insults. In a social media post Saturday, the president made a direct appeal to Attorney General Pam Bondi for action against Comey and two other political opponents: New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote the three are \"guilty as hell\" and said, \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"",
      "The president then cheered Comey's indictment Thursday night.",
      "\"One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to is James Comey, the former Corrupt Head of the FBI,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Today he was indicted by a Grand Jury on two felony counts for various illegal and unlawful acts. He has been so bad for our Country, for so long, and is now at the beginning of being held responsible for his crimes against our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The attacks on Comey continued Friday, with Mr. Trump calling him a \"destroyer of lives\" who must pay a \"very big price\" for lying.",
      "\"Whether you like Corrupt James Comey or not, and I can't imagine too many people liking him, HE LIED!\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"It is not a complex lie, it's a very simple, but IMPORTANT one. There is no way he can explain his way out of it. He is a Dirty Cop, and always has been.\"",
      "Rossi said the years of comments made by Mr. Trump from the spring of 2017 \u2014 when the president fired Comey during his first term \u2014 to now, could bolster Comey's bid to have the charges dismissed.",
      "\"Whether vindictive or selective, this animus, the hatred, the prejudice toward who is charged, those emotions and factors become highly relevant,\" he said.",
      "But it's not just comments from Mr. Trump that could come into play. Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel also cheered the charges against Comey, with Patel claiming Comey and other top FBI officials weaponized federal law enforcement when they led the bureau.",
      "\"They are putting their thumb on the scale of justice instead of letting Lady Justice handle this matter blindly,\" Rossi said. \"That violates every norm \u2014 every norm \u2014 that a federal prosecutor is taught from the time they're born as baby prosecutors.\"",
      "He said the grand jury's rejection of the third count, lying to Congress, is \"another brick in the wall\" in support of Comey moving to dismiss the charges because of vindictive and selective prosecution, as is the opposition to pursuing an indictment by career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. Under Justice Department policy, prosecutors may pursue indictments only if they believe they can secure a conviction and that conviction will be sustained on appeal.",
      "\"That seasoned and career prosecutors, plus the former U.S. attorney for the EDVA, all said that this indictment doesn't have a legal and factual basis to present to the grand jury, and that [Halligan] was appointed three days before this charge was approved by the grand jury is all ample evidence that something is rotten in Denmark,\" Rossi said.",
      "Comey's case is unique compared to others where claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are raised for numerous reasons, Hessick said: It involves people who are newsworthy; there are media reports about the decision to bring charges; Mr. Trump has publicly spoken about action against Comey; and the charges against him appear to involve congressional testimony about investigations into Mr. Trump or Clinton.",
      "\"The case is also notable because this isn't just a question of the motives of the specific prosecutor who brought the charges,\" she said. \"It's also about the president's decisions to speak publicly about a case that's a high-profile political case.\"",
      "Hessick said that in previous administrations, presidents are often \u2014 but not always \u2014 careful not to comment about ongoing cases.",
      "Mr. Trump sought to have criminal charges brought against him by former special counsel Jack Smith in each of the two cases dismissed for vindictive and selective prosecution, but one of the requests was denied. The two cases, one involving the 2020 election and the other involving Mr. Trump's handling of sensitive government documents after his first term, were dismissed after he won a second term in the White House.",
      "Hunter Biden, former President Joe Biden's son, also unsuccessfully sought to have his indictment on tax charges dismissed on the same grounds, arguing the investigation into him was \"compromised by politics.\"",
      "Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to the charges last year.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-september-2025-economic-impact-social-security-tsa/",
    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 18:09:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The economic impact of a government shutdown depends on its duration, economists say. Some payments, like Social Security, would continue to be issued.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown could begin within days, halting pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delaying services, as lawmakers remain deadlocked over funding past Sept. 30.",
      "The financial impact of a shutdown typically depends on the length of the disruption, with each week costing the U.S. economy about $7 billion, according to a new analysis from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco. A suspension could also weigh on investor and consumer confidence at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing headwinds, he told CBS News.",
      "Government shutdowns aren't new: The U.S. has experienced 14 of them since 1980, with the longest occurring over 34 days from December 2018 into January 2019, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. They're triggered when Congress fails to pass a full-year spending bill or a continuing resolution to fund the government for the pending fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday. Oct. 1.",
      "\"We've been to this picnic before, unfortunately,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute, told CBS News. Pacific Research is a think tank that focuses on free trade.",
      "\"In general, things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, those will continue to go out, and we'll continue to pay interest on the debt,\" Winegarden said.",
      "But, he added, \"The general rule is that the longer it goes on, the bigger the disruption.\"",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically prohibited from doling out money. Activities at many agencies will be suspended until lawmakers agree on a new funding bill, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely to be furloughed during that time.",
      "Yet because the government must continue to provide services that protect life and property, agencies will determine which essential workers must continue working, although they won't receive pay until lawmakers resolve the funding gap.",
      "And while some federal employees would eventually receive back pay, others could experience financial strain while their paychecks are suspended, Daco noted.",
      "During the shutdown of 2018-2019, about 800,000 government workers missed several weeks of pay, creating financial hardships for many. Some turned to online fundraising campaigns for assistance, while others relied on food banks to help them get through the period.",
      "What is the economic impact of a government shutdown?",
      "While the biggest direct hit would be on government workers, followed by federal contractors who would also be shut off from funding, delayed federal procurement on goods and services could also ripple through the broader economy, Daco told CBS News.",
      "A shutdown could also undermine confidence in the economy at a time when some sectors, such as the labor market, are facing headwinds, he added. Markets could be rattled by the disruption, as well as consumer sentiment, some economists noted.",
      "\"We need more certainty in the rules of the game of the economy,\" Winegarden said. \"Uncertainty, at this moment, is the last thing we need.\"",
      "A halt in government functions could also complicate monetary policy decisions, potentially resulting in delays for key economic data next month, such as the Oct. 3 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the labor market stalling out over the summer, Federal Reserve officials are expected to closely scrutinize the latest jobs data when they make their next rate decision at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"A government shutdown at this economic juncture represent a graver risk than when the economy is running at full steam,\" Daco said.",
      "Would Social Security benefits be impacted?",
      "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are covered by mandatory spending, which means that funding for these programs has been approved by Congress to continue without an expiration date.",
      "Social Security benefits would be paid on time, while health care payments for seniors in Medicare and low- and middle-income Americans enrolled in Medicaid would continue.",
      "However, Social Security's administrative budget needs to receive approval from Congress, which means that some of its services could be impacted in a shutdown, some experts note.",
      "\"In the event of a government shutdown ... customer service at the Social Security Administration may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing and replacing Medicare cards,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in a Friday email.",
      "Would other federal functions like the TSA be impacted?",
      "Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay because they provide essential services.",
      "Unlike other government agencies. the U.S. Postal Service operates as a sefl-funded, independent agency. That means mail, packages and other shipments would still be delivered and post offices would remain open in the event of a shutdown.",
      "But there could be other impacts for consumers and businesses. For one, some mortgage processing could face delays because the flood insurance program would be closed to new policies until Congress agrees to a new spending deal, according to TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.",
      "\"That means no mortgages which require federal flood insurance will be originated,\" he noted.",
      "In previous shutdowns, other services were also suspended, such as the Food and Drug Administration's inspections, as well as the entry to the National Parks, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",

      "She was charged with multiple crimes in the early 1970s, including a bank robbery. In 1973, she was involved in a shootout on the New Jersey Turnpike. The incident left state trooper Werner Foerster and Black Liberation Army member Zayd Malik Shakur dead. Assata Shakur was wounded in the incident. She was arrested and convicted of murdering Foerster, as well as seven other felony charges related to the shooting. She was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "In 1979, Shakur escaped the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey.

    "summary": "Two men were seen in a Texas yogurt shop just before four teenage girls were killed there in 1991, and some wonder whether identifying them will lead to answers in the unsolved case.",
    "story": [
      "CASE UPDATE: In September 2025, one of the original investigators in the Austin, Texas, yogurt shop murders told \"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty exclusively that Robert Eugene Brashers, a serial killer and rapist who is deceased, has been\u00a0identified as a suspect\u00a0in the case.",
      "[This story was originally posted on Feb. 5, 2022. It was updated on August 2, 2025.]",
      "It has been more than 30 years since four teenage girls were murdered in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop and the case remains unsolved. At one point, there were arrests and then convictions, but those convictions were later overturned on appeal, and ultimately, new DNA technology raised doubts about the involvement of those initial arrestees.",
      "The case has left investigators at what appears to be a standstill, but as correspondent Erin Moriarty reported in this week's \"48 Hours,\" there is a theory that two never-identified men seen in the yogurt shop on the night of the murders may have been involved in the unsolved killings that have haunted Austin for decades.",
      "On December 6, 1991, 17-year-old Eliza Thomas, 13-year-old Amy Ayers, and two sisters, 17-year-old Jennifer Harbison and 15-year-old Sarah Harbison, were tied up and shot in the head in an \"I Can't Believe It's Yogurt!\" shop in Austin.",
      "The city had never seen a crime quite like it. Eliza and Jennifer had been working in the yogurt shop that night. They were getting ready to close when Jennifer's sister, Sarah, and their friend, Amy, met them there to head home. Investigators believe at least two men entered the shop and committed the brutal crime before setting the place on fire, destroying much of the evidence.",
      "John Jones worked for the Austin Police Department at the time of the crime and was the lead investigator on the case. He has since retired. Jones told Moriarty that as part of the early investigation, he and his team tracked down customers who were in the yogurt shop on the day of the crime to see if they noticed anything suspicious. According to Jones, multiple customers described two men who \"looked out of place\" sitting in the shop just before it was due to close. Neither man was reported to have purchased frozen yogurt \u2014 instead, only a drink.",
      "\"They never have been identified. And we did everything. \u2026 We even hypnotized some folks,\" Jones told Moriarty.",
      "Despite investigators' efforts, that lead went nowhere and eventually the case went cold. Then, in 1999, nearly eight years after the murders, there was a break in the case when new investigators decided to re-examine a different old lead.",
      "Robert Springsteen, Michael Scott, Maurice Pierce and Forrest Welborn were only teenagers at the time of the crime. They, too, had landed on Jones' radar early on after one of them, Maurice Pierce, was arrested with a gun at a mall near the yogurt shop in the days after the crime. Back then, the men were questioned by Jones and his team but were subsequently released for lack of evidence.",
      "In 1999, the new investigators decided to re-question the men. Two of them, Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott, confessed to the yogurt shop murders and implicated Pierce and Welborn in the process. All four men were subsequently arrested.",
      "But it wasn't long before Springsteen and Scott recanted their confessions, saying they were coerced. Charges were ultimately dropped against Pierce and Welborn due to lack of evidence.",
      "Springsteen and Scott were the only two to go on trial. They were both convicted, but years later, their convictions were overturned on constitutional grounds. The Sixth Amendment gives defendants the right to confront accusers and in Scott and Springsteen's trials, their confessions were used against one another, but they weren't allowed to question each other in court.",
      "Prosecutors intended to retry Springsteen and Scott, but before doing so, they ordered DNA tests on vaginal swabs taken from the victims at the time of the murders. By this point, investigators had come to believe at least one of the victims had been sexually assaulted, and prosecutors wanted to take advantage of a fairly new type of DNA testing called Y-STR testing. It searches for male DNA only.",
      "No one expected what it would reveal. As a result of the testing, a partial male DNA profile was obtained from one of the victims, but to the surprise of the prosecutor's office, the DNA sample did not match any of the four men who had been arrested. Charges were dropped against Springsteen and Scott, and they were released from prison after spending 10 years behind bars.",
      "Attorney Amber Farrelly worked on both Scott and Springsteen's defense teams. She is adamant that police had it all wrong when they arrested Scott, Springsteen, Welborn and Pierce. She told \"48 Hours\" she believes those two unidentified customers from the yogurt shop are who police should really be fixated on.",
      "While working on Scott and Springsteen's defense teams, Farrelly was tasked with sifting through old police records, including those interviews Jones and his colleagues had conducted with customers who visited the yogurt shop on the day of the murders.",
      "\"They (police) have accounted for and interviewed 52 people that were in the yogurt shop that day,\" Farrelly told \"48 Hours'\" Erin Moriarty.",
      "Farrelly says several of those customers mentioned the two men who were seen sitting in the yogurt shop just before it was due to close that night.",
      "\"We have no names to them. And when you look at \u2014 when you step back and you look and you think, 'They've talked to 52 people and didn't miss one person from 4:30 until 11:00 at night. And several people talk about a guy or two guys, and they describe them in the same manner? And we don't know who those two guys are? And they've never called in? \u2026 That raises, in my opinion, the suspicion\u2026 that these are the gentlemen who did it,\" Farrelly said.",
      "\"Were those two men who've never been identified the last people in the yogurt shop, as far as you know?\" Moriarty asked Farrelly.",
      "\"Absolutely,\" Farrelly responded.",
      "Farrelly says the men were described as \"kind of leaned over the table, talking to each other and kind of whispering, like they didn't want anybody to hear what they were saying.\"",
      "She says that one of the men was described as having light, short hair, \"like a dirty blonde,\" and was said to have been about 5'6\" tall and in his late 20s or early 30s. She says the other man was described as being \"bigger,\" and both were observed wearing big coats. One, she says, is thought to have had a green \"Army fatigue kind of looking jacket\" and the other is thought to have had a black jacket. According to Farrelly, the men are believed to have been driving a green car that evening.",
      "John Jones, the former lead investigator on the case, is still haunted by the unsolved yogurt shop murders even though he has long retired. He told \"48 Hours\" he still wonders about those unidentified customers.",
      "\"Yeah, it's kind of a question to me that to this day, they haven't been identified,\" he said. \"Is that evidence that they did it? No, but that's evidence that we really need to talk to them.\"",

The Austin Police Department soon developed a task force dedicated solely to solving the crime.

      "The men were only teenagers at the time of the crime. They were first questioned just days after the murders when one of them, Maurice Pierce, was arrested at a mall not far from the yogurt shop with a .22 caliber gun \u2014 one of the same types of weapons believed to have been used in the killings.",
      "All four were released back then for lack of evidence, but in 1999, when a new team of investigators were tasked with taking a fresh look at the old case, they obtained confessions from two of the four men, Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott.

The Sixth Amendment gives defendants the right to confront accusers and in Scott and Springsteen's trials, their confessions were used against one another, but they weren't allowed to question each other in court.",
      "Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County, Texas, district attorney at the time, was intent on retrying Springsteen and Scott. But before doing so, her office decided to take advantage of what was then a fairly new type of DNA testing called Y-STR testing. It was a way of searching for and extracting male DNA only. Y-STR testing was ordered on vaginal swabs taken from the victims at the time of the murders. By this point, investigators had come to believe that at least one of the victims had been sexually assaulted. As a result of the Y-STR testing, a partial male DNA profile was obtained from one of the girls, but to the surprise of the district attorney's office, the DNA sample did not match any of the four men who were arrested.",
      "CeCe Moore, a DNA expert and genetic genealogist whom we interviewed for this week's \"48 Hours,\" told correspondent Erin Moriarty that Y-STR DNA is a tool sometimes used in criminal cases. Moore explained it \"can eliminate almost everyone. \u2026 Everyone but the suspect.\"",
      "\"If their Y-STR does not match, they did not contribute that DNA?\" Moriarty asked Moore.",
      "\"Because of\u2026 where that DNA was found, yes, in this case, it's very important,\" Moore said.",
      "Still, prosecutors were determined to retry Springsteen and Scott. But before doing so, they wanted to figure out who that mystery DNA belonged to.",
      "District Attorney Lehmberg says more than 100 men \u2014 such as crime scene investigators and personnel from the medical examiner's office who might have come in contact with the body and possibly been a source of contamination \u2014 were tested. It was all to no avail. In 2009, with no matches, the charges against Springsteen and Scott were dropped. After nearly 10 years behind bars, they were released, but not exonerated, leaving open the possibility they could be retried at a later time.",
      "For years, officials kept trying to track down the source of the mystery DNA. Then, in 2017, an Austin police investigator searched a public online DNA database used for population studies to see if he could get a hit. Unbelievably, he did. It seemed to be the most promising lead in years, but there was a problem. The seemingly matching sample in the public database had been submitted anonymously by the FBI and had no name attached to it. When officials in Austin contacted the FBI in an effort to get a name, the FBI would not provide it, citing privacy laws.",
      "Frustrated, city officials reached out to U.S. Congressman Michael McCaul, who is from Austin, for help. McCaul pressed the FBI, and \"48 Hours\" has learned that in early 2020, the FBI agreed to work with the Austin Police Department to see if further testing could be done on that Y-STR DNA from the crime scene.",
      "\"48 Hours\" has learned that initially, the sample from the crime scene was not very detailed and had only 16 markers, but more advanced testing in 2020 came up with an additional nine markers, bringing the total marker count to 25. However, this more advanced testing revealed that the sample from the crime scene no longer proved to be a match to the sample in the public DNA database. In a letter to Congressman McCaul obtained by \"48 Hours,\" the FBI explained the new results \"conclusively exclude the male donor of the FBI's sample \u2026 as such, the FBI Y-STR profile is not an investigative lead.\"",
      "\"And that was the greatest disappointment because we really thought we had it,\" Congressman McCaul told Moriarty.",

      "According to McCaul, some of the actual Y-STR DNA from the sample found on the victim in the yogurt shop case still exists.",
      "\"It's very limited and \u2026 that's why we're waiting for the science to improve on this, because there's very little left,\" he said.",
      "With DNA research advancing so quickly, McCaul hopes that one day that sample of DNA obtained over 30 years ago will finally solve the case.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday allowed President Trump's administration to withhold more than $4 billion in foreign aid funding, granting its request for emergency relief in a dispute over money that Congress has already approved.",
      "The high court's decision follows an order that Chief Justice John Roberts had issued earlier this month, which temporarily froze a district court injunction requiring the Trump administration to spend the money Congress appropriated for foreign-aid projects by the end of September. The court appeared to divide 6-3, with Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court's three liberals, dissenting.",
      "The Supreme Court said in an unsigned order that the harm to the executive branch's ability to conduct foreign affairs appears to outweigh the potential harm faced by the plaintiffs, which are organizations and businesses that receive funding for foreign aid projects. It added that the decision \"should not be read as a final determination on the merits. The relief granted by the Court today reflects our preliminary view, consistent with the standards for interim relief.\"",
      "The legal fight over foreign aid",
      "The dispute before the justices involves a tranche of more than $4 billion Congress approved last year for overseas development assistance, peacekeeping operations and to promote democracy globally, among other priorities. Mr. Trump notified Congress last month that he is seeking to claw back $4.9 billion before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30 through a maneuver known as a \"pocket rescission.\"",
      "The Government Accountability Office has said the move is illegal.",
      "But the Supreme Court said in its decision that at this stage in the proceedings, the government \"has made a sufficient showing\" that the Impoundment Control Act, the mechanism for the president to move to cancel congressionally approved federal funding, precludes the plaintiffs' suit. That lawsuit sought to make the president comply with appropriations law passed last year.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Kagan said the stakes in the case are high, as it involves the allocation of power between the executive branch and Congress.",
      "\"[T]he consequence of today's grant is significant. I appreciate that the majority refrains from offering a definitive view of this dispute and the questions raised in it,\" she wrote. \"But the effect of its ruling is to allow the Executive to cease obligating $4 billion in funds that Congress appropriated for foreign aid, and that will now never reach its intended recipients. Because that result conflicts with the separation of powers, I respectfully dissent.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled in early September that the administration's refusal not to spend congressionally approved funds is likely illegal under a federal law governing the agency rule-making process. The judge said the Trump administration could withhold the funding only if Congress rescinded it through duly enacted legislation.",
      "The dispute was brought by nonprofit organizations and development companies in February after the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause of foreign development assistance to review whether programs were consistent with the president's foreign policy.",
      "It has since ping-ponged through the courts, including the Supreme Court back in March. Then, the high court split 5-4 in deciding to leave in place an order from Ali that required the Trump administration to pay roughly $2 billion in invoices for foreign-aid work that had already been performed.",
      "In the latest development in the case, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled last month that the nonprofits and businesses could not sue on grounds the administration violated the separation of powers by unilaterally declining to spend congressionally approved foreign-aid funds. The panel voted 2-1 to wipe away an order from Ali that had prohibited the government from withholding the money Congress appropriated last year for foreign assistance programs.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit panel later issued an amended opinion that opened up an avenue for the nonprofits and businesses to seek relief on different legal grounds. On the heels of that decision, Mr. Trump informed Congress of his plan to rescind the $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding, which he said supported \"wasteful\" programs that did not align with his \"America First\" foreign policy agenda.",
      "The plaintiffs then filed a new request for preliminary relief with Ali, and the judge found that the Trump administration had a duty to comply with Congress's directives by spending the $4 billion by the end of September, when the fiscal year ends.",
      "The Trump administration asked the D.C. Circuit to freeze Ali's latest order. After the appeals court declined to do so, the administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene.",
      "In a filing with the high court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the district court's injunction \"raises a grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers.\"",
      "\"The President can hardly speak with one voice in foreign affairs or in dealings with Congress when the district court is forcing the Executive Branch to advocate against its own objectives,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "The solicitor general said Ali's injunction \"puts the executive branch at war with itself\" by requiring it to spend the same $4 billion that the president wants to claw back.",
      "But lawyers for the plaintiffs said that the government has been obligated to spend the money approved by Congress for specific purposes since at least March 2024. They wrote in a filing that the appropriations legislation enacted by Congress last year remains binding on the executive branch.",
      "\"[T]he upshot of the government's theory is that Congress's signature law meant to control impoundments actually provided the President vast new powers to impound funds, and made it virtually impossible to challenge impoundments in court,\" the lawyers said. \"Congress would not have enacted such a self-defeating statute.\"",
      "The plaintiffs warned that allowing the president to withhold the money for foreign assistance would threaten the viability of groups that receive federal dollars for projects overseas. For one of the organizations, Democracy International, 98% of its revenues in 2024 came from awards from the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to court filings. Lawyers warned the company would be at risk of bankruptcy if the expiring appropriations are not spent.",
      "\"The pocket rescission of democracy promotion funds is an existential threat to Democracy International,\" the plaintiffs wrote.",

    "summary": "Humberto became a hurricane on Friday over the central Atlantic, the National Hurricane Center said.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Humberto, the eighth named storm to emerge this hurricane season, is currently swirling over waters just north of the Caribbean as a Category 3 storm. While forecasts as of Friday predict Humberto won't ever touch land, there is a possibility it could interact with another system developing nearby in the western Atlantic.",
      "That's an unlikely outcome, said CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan. But if such a collision does occur, it could produce what's called\u00a0the Fujiwhara effect, a rare phenomenon in which two different storms merge and become entangled around a newly formed, common center.",
      "How the process plays out depends on the characteristics of the storms involved, according to the National Weather Service. The forecasting agency describes the Fujiwhara effect on its website as \"an intense dance\" between two tropical storms that can happen when they get close enough to each other on their respective tracks to reach a common point and either join together or spin around each other for a period of time before continuing along their individual paths.",
      "In the latter scenario, the storms involved must be comparably strong or large.",
      "\"Typically when one system is stronger than the other, the smaller and weaker system will get overrun by the larger, stronger one and completely eliminate it,\" Nolan said.",
      "Similar systems \"will dance around each other\" before going their separate ways, she continued, adding: \"Very rarely has a larger system absorbed a smaller one and become larger or stronger, but it is scientifically possible.\"",
      "Humberto grew into a tropical storm Wednesday night while traveling over open waters in the central tropical Atlantic, and then gained hurricane status early Friday morning. Forecasters expect it to move northwest over the next few days and strengthen along the way, the National Hurricane Center said. It's one of two systems in the region that could potentially impact parts of the southeastern United States, including coastal areas from Florida to North Carolina, according to Michael Brennan, director of the hurricane center.",
      "Officials at the center said Wednesday that they were monitoring a second storm churning near Humberto over the northeastern Caribbean, which would likely become a tropical depression later in the week and a tropical storm, named Imelda, over the weekend. That system is expected to strengthen as it tracks toward the Bahamas \u2014 driving up the chances of storm surge, wind and rainfall striking coastal parts of the southeastern U.S.",
      "\"With the two tropical troubles currently north of the Caribbean, these two may interact under the Fujiwhara effect in the days ahead,\" said Nolan. However, because the developing system \"appears to be much weaker than Humberto and several miles away from it,\" an interaction between the two \u2014 if one even takes place at all \u2014 may not result in a tangled gravitational \"dance.\"",
      "In the event Humberto and the second system do collide, it's possible the paths they're expected to travel will change, Nolan added, but only slightly.",

    "summary": "Senate Democrats are escalating their demands for information about White House border czar Tom Homan and any involvement he has had in federal contracts.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are escalating their demands for information about White House border czar Tom Homan and any involvement he has had in federal contracts, following allegations that he accepted $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents posing as businessmen last year.",
      "In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that was first obtained by CBS News, seven Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee called for the release of Department of Homeland Security contracts, communications and other materials tied to the allegations. The group of lawmakers, which includes ranking member Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, set an Oct. 10 deadline for the department to respond.",
      "CBS News reported earlier this week that investigators examined whether Homan took the money in September 2024 in return for promises of government action if President Trump returned to office. One source briefed on the matter said investigators were focused on a bag of money given to Homan. MSNBC first reported that the transaction was caught on video as part of an FBI sting, and that Homan indicated he could help the undercover agents win government contracts. Homan did not disclose any such payment on his White House ethics filings, and Justice Department sources told CBS News the probe involved FBI and public integrity investigators before it was closed by Trump appointees.",
      "\"If true, this alleged conduct by a senior government official is unacceptable,\" the Democratic senators wrote, warning that the administration's decision to end the case \"raises further concerns that the Administration is weaponizing our system of justice to protect the President's friends and to persecute his political foes.\" The letter also points to the $170 billion Congress recently appropriated for border security and immigration enforcement, stressing that \"our homeland security should not be for sale.\"",
      "Democrats noted that Homan previously worked as a consultant for GEO Group, a private prison company that is one of ICE's largest contractors, saying his relationship with the company could be a conflict of interest. Homan was an official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the first Trump term and was named border czar shortly after the 2024 election.",
      "In an appearance on Fox News this week, Homan insisted that he did nothing wrong.",
      "\"Look, I did nothing criminal. I did nothing illegal,\" he said. \"You're talking about a guy who spent 34 years enforcing the law.\"",
      "On Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Homan never took the money. She called the investigation, which was initiated by the prior administration and dropped by the Trump administration, \"another example of the weaponization of the Biden Department of Justice against one of President Trump's strongest and most vocal supporters.\" Justice Department leaders have also said investigators found no credible evidence of wrongdoing.",
      "The Senate Democrats are asking DHS to hand over all contracts and grants Homan has been involved in since Jan. 20, 2025; his communications on contract awards; full GEO Group contract files; contacts between GEO Group and federal officials; and records of meetings with former clients while serving as border czar.",
      "A DHS spokesperson referred questions about the demand to the White House. A White House spokesperson pointed to statements defending Homan and saying he \"has not been involved with any contract award decisions.\"",
      "\"He is a career law enforcement officer and lifelong public servant who is doing a phenomenal job on behalf of President Trump and the country,\" said Abigail Jackson, the White House deputy press secretary.",
      "The letter follows a flurry of similar moves this week. Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee called for Homan to testify, and Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee opened an inquiry into the closure of the investigation. The same group of Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee pressed Attorney General Pam Bondi to release information about the Homan investigation by Oct. 8.",
      "With Republicans in control of the House and Senate, the inquiries are unlikely to go far, since Democrats do not wield subpoena power in the minority. But the investigations could gain steam if Democrats win back either chamber in next year's midterm elections.",

Prosecutors had expressed concern about Siebert's possible ouster over his failure to bring a case against another Trump adversary, New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "President Trump, in a social media post after Siebert's departure from the office, had pressed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi about prosecutions against political foes including Comey, James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California, calling them \"guilty as hell.\"",
      "Mr. Trump praised one of his own former defense lawyers, Lindsey Halligan, calling her \"a really good lawyer,\" and told Bondi in the post, \"We can't delay any longer.\"",
      "Halligan was sworn in\u00a0as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia on Monday, replacing Siebert in the office. She has no prior experience as a prosecutor.",
      "Three days after Halligan took over the key prosecutorial role, Comey was indicted on two counts \u2014 one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice, related to Senate testimony he gave almost five years ago. The indictment bears Halligan's signature alone. Comey\u00a0denies wrongdoing.",
      "In a letter sent Friday to Bondi, House Judiciary Committee Democrats requested copies of Siebert's performance evaluations, and they're seeking records that would show any backchannel communication between the White House and Justice Department officials over the Comey matter.",
      "The letter from the panel's Democrats requests \"all communications between any official or employee at the Justice Department and any official or employee at the White House, including President Trump, regarding prosecution referrals to the Justice Department involving current or former public officials, including but not limited to Letitia James, James Comey, Senator Adam Schiff, and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, from January 20, 2025, to the present.\"",
      "Before she became an interim U.S. attorney, Halligan was a Trump White House aide who was also his defense lawyer.",
      "Committee Democrats are also requesting records about Halligan. Their letter to the Justice Department asks for \"All documents regarding the selection and appointment of Lindsey Halligan as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, including her application materials, any vetting documents, any communications about her qualifications, and any promises or commitments she may have made to the White House or the Justice Department regarding prosecuting any specific individuals.\"",
      "Because they're in the minority and lack congressional subpoena authority, Democrats' requests for documents are not likely to be granted by the Trump administration. But their letter presents them with the opportunity to register their dismay with the administration's actions.",
      "In the letter to Bondi, House Judiciary Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin wrote, \"President Trump \u2014 with you as a willing partner \u2014 is obliterating centuries of prosecutorial independence and steering the Justice Department into dangerous new territory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had expressed his displeasure with Siebert, saying Friday: \"I want him out.\"",
      "The president criticized Siebert because he had the support of both of Virginia's Democratic senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner.",
      "A U.S. attorney nominee requires the backing of the two senators who represent the state to advance through the Senate Judiciary Committee. It seems unlikely Kaine and Warner would support Halligan. Both senators told the Washington Post they'd review her nomination, but Kaine said that neither of them has backed a U.S. attorney nominee who lacks prosecutorial or Justice Department experience.",

      "\"No matter the political atmosphere, YouTube will continue to enable free expression on its platform, particularly as it relates to issues subject to political debate,\" the letter read, noting that a number of accounts were kicked off the platform between 2023 and 2024 for violating misinformation rules that don't exist anymore. Now, it said, \"YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect.\"",

    "story": [
      "A digital reconstruction of a million-year-old skull suggests humans may have diverged from our ancient ancestors 400,000 years earlier than thought and in Asia, not Africa, a study found.",
      "The findings, published Thursday, are based on a reconstruction of a crushed skull discovered in China in 1990 and have the potential to resolve the long-standing \"Muddle in the Middle\" of human evolution, researchers said.",
      "But experts not involved in the work cautioned that the findings were likely to be disputed and pointed to ongoing uncertainties in the timeline of human evolution.",
      "The skull, labelled Yunxian 2, was previously thought to belong to a human forerunner called Homo erectus.",
      "But modern reconstruction technologies revealed features closer to a species previously thought to have existed only later in human evolution, including the recently discovered Homo longi and our own Homo sapiens.",
      "\"This changes a lot of thinking,\" said Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum, London, who was part of the research team.",
      "\"It suggests that by 1 million years ago, our ancestors had already split into distinct groups, pointing to a much earlier and more complex human evolutionary split than previously believed,\" he added.",
      "The findings shocked the research team.",
      "\"From the very beginning, when we got the result, we thought it was unbelievable. How could that be so deep into the past?\" Xijun Ni, a professor at Fudan University who co-led the analysis, told BBC News. \"But we tested it again and again to test all the models, use all the methods, and we are now confident about the result, and we're actually very excited.\"",
      "If the findings are correct, it suggests there could have been much earlier members of other early hominins, including Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, the researchers said.",
      "It also \"muddies the waters\" on long-standing assumptions that early humans dispersed from Africa, said Michael Petraglia, director of Griffith University's Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"There's a big change potentially happening here, where east Asia is now playing a very key role in hominin evolution,\" he told the Agence France-Presse.",
      "\"A lot of questions\"",
      "The research, published in the journal Science, used advanced CT scanning, structure light imaging and virtual reconstruction techniques to model a complete Yunxian 2. The team then printed replicas on a 3D printer, according to BBC News.",
      "The scientists relied in part on another similar skull to shape their model, and then compared it to over 100 other specimens.",
      "The resulting model \"shows a distinctive combination of traits,\" the researchers said, some of them similar to Homo erectus, including a projecting lower face.",
      "But other aspects, including its apparently larger brain capacity, are closer to Homo longi and Homo sapiens, according to the study.",
      "\"Yunxian 2 may help us resolve what's been called the 'Muddle in the Middle,' the confusing array of human fossils from between 1 million and 300,000 years ago,\" Stringer said in a press release.",
      "Much about human evolution remains debated, and Petraglia said the study's findings were \"provocative\" though grounded in solid work.",
      "\"It's sound, but I think the jury's still out. I think there will be a lot of questions raised,\" he said.",
      "Andy Herries, an archeologist at La Trobe University, said he was not convinced by the conclusions and that genetic analysis had shown fossil morphology, or shape, was \"not always a perfect indicator for human evolution.\"",
      "\"They've got this interpretation that I just don't really think is taking into account the genetic histories of these things that we do know,\" he told AFP.",
      "Dr. Aylwyn Scally, an evolutionary geneticist at Cambridge University, told BBC News that although the study's conclusions were plausible, they were far from certain, and that more evidence was needed to be sure.",
      "\"That picture is still quite unclear to us, so if the conclusions of this research are supported by other analyses, ideally from some genetic data, then I think we would start to be increasingly confident about it,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The findings are only the latest in a string of recent research that has complicated what we thought we know about our origins.",
      "Homo longi, also known as \"Dragon Man,\" was itself only named as a new species and close human relative in 2021, by a team that included Stringer.",
      "The authors said their work illustrates the complexity of our shared history.",

      "\"When they need to arrest someone and there isn't a good enough reason to do so, that's where they find the excuse,\" one source told the British newspaper.",
      "The Guardian reported that leaked Microsoft files suggested a large proportion of the sensitive data was potentially being stored in Microsoft data centers in Ireland and the Netherlands.",

      "In October last year, a team of German scientists went to a previously uncharted dump site in the Baltic Sea's Luebeck Bay and sent an unmanned submersible 20 meters down to the seafloor.",

      "The study noted that \"whether the dominance of the\u00a0Bifidobacterium [beneficial gut bacteria] related genus is fully attributable or not to the yogurt diet cannot be completely confirmed since that would have required a longitudinal study with sample collection over several years. However, we believe that it is likely that a beneficial effect of yogurt ingestion via modulation of the gut ecosystem could have contributed to her well-being and advanced age.\"",
      "Branyas once posted on social media about her love for yogurt, saying it \"gives life\" \u2014 and hers was a long one. She was born in 1907 in San Francisco and had lived in Spain since she was 8. She survived two world wars and two pandemics, and had three children and 13 great-grandchildren.",
      "In addition to living a long life, she also lived a healthy one \u2014 free of cancer, cardiovascular disease or dementia, according to Esteller.",
      "The picture that emerges from studying Branyas \"shows that extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked and that both processes can be distinguished and dissected at the molecular level,\" the study, published in Cell Reports Medicine, says.",
      "Researchers said that to conduct the study, \"samples from the subject were obtained from four different sources: total peripheral blood, saliva, urine, and stool at different times.\"",
      "It also noted some limitations, including that aging and extreme longevity \"are probably highly individualized processes,\" so \"drawing broadly applicable conclusions from a single subject should be taken with caution.\""

    "story": [
      "A number of incursions by unidentified drones across Denmark that caused the temporary shutdown of two airports and affected military installations were part of a \"hybrid attack,\" the country's defense minister said Thursday. Police in neighboring Norway, meanwhile, said they had seized a drone near Oslo's airport, the AFP news agency reported, and police said more drone activity was reported in Denmark later on Thursday, according to local media.",
      "A public prosecutor in Norway said Thursday that there was nothing to immediately suggest any link between the Oslo incident and the drones seen in Denmark, according to AFP.",
      "While neither Danish nor Norwegian officials have accused anyone of responsibility, the incidents come with many European nations on alert following Russian drone and fighter jet incursions into Poland, Romania and Estonia.",
      "At a press conference alongside Denmark's justice minister and police, Minister of Defense Troels Lund Poulsen said that what he called a \"professional actor\" had been responsible for the drone incursions in that country.",
      "Poulsen said different types of drones had been spotted at various locations, including near critical infrastructure and military areas, and appeared to be part of a \"systematic\" attack carried out by a \"professional actor.\" He did not give further details on what he meant by that term, or who he may have been referring to, but added that \"there is still no direct military threat to Denmark.\"",
      "Poulsen said Denmark was considering requesting consultations under NATO's Article 4, which allows member states to discuss issues of concern with the rest of the alliance. He noted that the country had already reached out to NATO and was planning to reach out to the European Union to discuss the drones.",
      "He said there was no evidence that Russia was behind that attack.",
      "A series of drone incursions in Denmark",
      "On Wednesday, Denmark's second biggest airport, Billund, was closed for an hour, and another airport used for both commercial and military flights was closed for three hours, police said, citing drone sightings, according to local media and the Reuters news agency.",
      "Unidentified drones were also seen overnight near two other airports and an air base, which is home to some of Denmark's F-35 and F-16 fighter jets, Reuters reported.",
      "The national police said the drones followed similar patterns to others that halted flights for four hours at Copenhagen Airport earlier in the week, according to Reuters. After that incident, Jens Jespersen of the Copenhagen Police said the those responsible seemed to be showing off their skills, adding that the number, large size and flight patterns of the unidentified drones combined indicated \"that it is a capable actor. Which capable actor, I do not know.\"",
      "On Tuesday, in response to those earlier incidents, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she could \"certainly not rule out in any way that it is Russia\" behind the drone activity, calling it \"the most serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure to date.\"",
      "She said the motive of the attacks was likely, \"the obvious: To disrupt and create unrest. To cause concern. To see how far you can go and test the limits,\" according to Politico.",
      "Russia dismisses \"unfounded accusations\" over potential involvement",
      "During a briefing Tuesday in Moscow, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed allegations that Russia could be responsible for the drone incursions.",
      "\"Each time they make unfounded accusations, frankly, it leads to the continuation of such statements no longer being taken into account, because each time we hear unfounded accusations,\" Peskov said, according to Russia's state-run Interfax news agency. \"Perhaps a country that takes a serious position should not make such unfounded accusations time and again.\"",
      "Russia's embassy in Denmark, in a statement Thursday, said \"incidents involving reported disruptions at Danish airports are a staged provocation. Undoubtedly, they will be used as a pretext for further escalating tension in the interests of forces seeking by all means to prolong the Ukrainian conflict and extend it to other countries.\"",
      "\"The Russian side firmly rejects the absurd speculations of involvement in the incidents,\" the embassy said.",
      "Russian drones were detected in airspace over Poland and Romania this month, and three Russian fighter jets were intercepted in Estonian air space last Friday.",
      "Denmark's justice minister, Peter Hummelgaard, said Thursday that \"new capabilities to detect and neutralize drones must be acquired,\" and that the incursions into Demark's air space should be seen as \"a long series of deeply worrying episodes across Europe,\" local media reported.",

    "summary": "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been sentenced to prison for criminal conspiracy, over a plot linked to former Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014\u00a0A Paris court on Thursday sentenced former French\u00a0President Nicolas Sarkozy to five years in prison after finding him guilty of criminal conspiracy in an alleged scheme to finance his 2007 campaign with funds from Libya. In a surprise decision, the court ruled that Sarkozy will be incarcerated even if he appeals, but it also said the date of the sentencing would come later, sparing the 70-year-old the humiliation of being led from the courtroom in handcuffs.",
      "The court found Sarkozy guilty of criminal association in a plot from 2005 to 2007 to finance his campaign with funds from Libya, in exchange for diplomatic favors. It cleared him of three other charges, including passive corruption, illegal campaign financing and concealment of the embezzlement of public funds.",
      "Sarkozy denounced the ruling and said he would appeal.",
      "\"This injustice is a scandal,\" he said.",
      "\"I ask the French people \u2014 whether they voted for me or not, whether they support me or not \u2014 to grasp what has just happened. Hatred truly knows no bounds,\" the former president said, adding that if he does end up behind bars, he'll do so, \"with my head held high.\"",
      "The court also found two of Sarkozy's closest associates when he was president \u2014 former government ministers Claude Gu\u00e9ant and Brice Hortefeux \u2014   guilty of criminal association, likewise acquitting them of some other charges.",
      "Overall, the ruling suggested that the court believed the men had conspired to seek Libyan funding for Sarkozy's 2007 campaign, but that judges weren't convinced the conservative leader himself was directly involved in the funding effort, or that any Libyan money ended up being used in his winning campaign.",
      "The chief judge, in an hours-long reading of the lengthy verdict, said Sarkozy had allowed his close associates to reach out to Libyan authorities, \"to obtain or try to obtain financial support in Libya for the purpose of securing campaign financing.\"",
      "The court said it couldn't determine with certainty that any Libyan money ended up financing Sarkozy's campaign.",
      "Sarkozy stood as the judge read out the verdict. He was accompanied by his wife, singer and model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, in the courtroom, which was also filled with reporters and members of the public. Sarkozy sat in the front row of the defendant's section, and his three adult sons were also in the room.",
      "Sarkozy, who was elected in 2007 but lost a bid for reelection in 2012, denied all wrongdoing during a three-month trial earlier this year, which involved 11 co-defendants, including three former ministers.",
      "Despite multiple legal scandals that have clouded his presidential legacy, Sarkozy remains an influential figure in French right-wing politics\u00a0and in entertainment circles, by virtue of his marriage to Bruni-Sarkozy.",
      "The roots of a scandal",
      "The accusations against him go back to 2011, when a Libyan news agency and the country's former dictatorial leader\u00a0Muammar Qaddafi himself said the Libyan state had secretly funneled millions of euros into Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign.",
      "In 2012, French investigative outlet Mediapart published what it said was a Libyan intelligence memo referencing a 50 million-euro funding agreement. Sarkozy denounced the document as a forgery and sued for defamation. The court said Thursday that it \"now appears most likely that this document is a forgery.\"",
      "Investigators also looked into a series of trips to Libya made by people close to Sarkozy when he served as France's interior minister, from 2005 and 2007, including his chief of staff.",
      "In 2016, Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine told Mediapart that he had delivered suitcases filled with cash from Tripoli to the French Interior Ministry under Sarkozy. He later retracted his statement. That reversal is now the focus of a separate investigation into possible witness tampering.",
      "Both Sarkozy and his wife have been preliminarily charged with involvement in alleged efforts to pressure Takieddine. That case has not gone to trial yet.",
      "Takieddine, who was one of the co-defendants in the Sarkozy case, died Tuesday in Beirut at the age of 75. He fled to Lebanon in 2020 and did not attend the trial.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Sarkozy had knowingly benefited from what they described as a \"corruption pact\" with Qaddafi's government.",
      "Libya's longtime dictator was toppled and killed in an uprising in 2011, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country.",
      "The trial shed light on France's back-channel talks with Libya in the 2000s, when Qaddafi  was seeking to restore diplomatic ties with the West. Before that, Libya was considered a pariah state.",
      "Sarkozy has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated and reliant on forged evidence. During the trial, he denounced a \"plot\" that he said was staged by \"liars and crooks,\" including the \"Qaddafi  clan.\"",
      "He suggested that the allegations of illegal campaign financing were retaliation for his call as France's president for Qaddafi's \u00a0 removal. Sarkozy was one of the first Western leaders to push for military intervention in Libya in 2011, when Arab Spring pro-democracy protests swept the Arab world.",
      "\"What credibility can be given to such statements marked by the seal of vengeance?\" Sarkozy asked in comments during the trial.",
      "In June, Sarkozy was stripped of his Legion of Honor medal, France's highest civilian award, after his conviction in a separate case.",
      "Earlier, he was found guilty of corruption and influence peddling for trying to bribe a magistrate in 2014 in exchange for information about a legal case in which he was implicated.",
      "Sarkozy was sentenced to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet for one year. He was granted a conditional release in May due to his age, which allowed him to remove the electronic tag after he wore it for just over three months.",
      "In another case, Sarkozy was convicted last year of illegal campaign financing in his failed 2012 reelection bid. He was accused of having spent almost twice the maximum legal amount and was sentenced to a year in prison, of which six months were suspended.",
      "Sarkozy has denied the allegations. He has appealed that verdict to France's highest Court of Cassation, and that appeal is pending",

      "There were no casualties, but three vehicles were damaged by the collapse, regional Governor Chadchart Sittipunt said, adding that officials believe the sinkhole was caused by construction work at an underground train station.",
      "Videos of the collapse show a section of the road slowly sinking, pulling down several electricity poles and damaging water pipes. Cars tried to back away as the hole grew larger and completely severed the four-lane road. One edge of the hole stopped in front of a police station, exposing its underground structure.",
      "People were evacuated from the police station and other buildings. A nearby hospital said it would close the outpatient services for two days, although Bangkok city officials said the hospital's structure was not affected.",
      "Officials cut electricity and water in the area as a precaution. Chadchart said crews were working to fix the hole as quickly as possible, fearing heavy rain could cause further damage. Bangkok is experiencing its rainy season, which typically extends from May through October.",
      "Emergency workers used a crane with a large harness to remove a pickup truck that was left perched precariously on the edge of the precipice, and at least one other truck could be seen inside the roughly 160-foot-deep hole.",
      "Noppadech Pitpeng, a 27-year-old hospital worker who lives nearby, told the French news agency AFP that he was frightened by a rumbling sound Wednesday morning, which woke him up.",

      "Al-Sharaa, who has past ties to al Qaeda and the Islamic State, spoke with Margaret Brennan, on assignment in Syria for \"60 Minutes,\" ahead of his historic address to the United Nations in New York. Al-Sharaa took power after ousting former Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad following nearly 14 years of civil war. In December, the U.S. removed a $10 million bounty off al-Sharaa's head. In July, the U.S. lifted its terrorist designation of the rebel group he led.",

      "\"Bombing the presidential palace amounts to nothing less than a declaration of war on Syria,\" he told Brennan. \"What if the backyard of the White House was bombed? The United States would wage war against whoever targeted the White House backyard for the next 20 years.\"",

      "\"There are borders and international standards that must be respected,\" he said. \"There are international laws, the United Nations and the Security Council that we turn to, to protect those standards. Otherwise, the world would fall into massive chaos.\"",
      "On Wednesday, al-Sharaa became the first Syrian head of state to speak at the U.N. General Assembly in nearly 60 years. In his speech, he spoke of the brutality endured by the Syrian people under the Assad regime and described what he called a \"historic opportunity to bring stability, peace, and prosperity to Syria and the entire region.\" He also warned of regional instability stemming from Israel's actions.",
      "In his nearly 10-minute speech, al-Sharaa told world leaders that Israeli policies and actions \"contradict\" the international community's support for Syria. He said Syria is committed to reaching a security agreement with Israel to lower tensions.",
      "The U.S. has been trying to broker an arrangement between Syria and Israel that is similar to a 1974 ceasefire agreement with the Assad regime. After the collapse of the Assad regime in December, Israel invaded territory in southern Syria and created what it calls a \"buffer zone\" beyond the lines of the 1974 agreement. Al-Sharaa wants Israel to return any lands seized since the Assad regime fell, and to have U.N. peacekeepers monitor the new agreement.",
      "An Israeli official declined to comment on al-Sharaa's remarks but confirmed that negotiations with Syria are continuing.",

      "\"Yes, I was 10, 11, 12, you know, whatever, but I was feeling, you know, twice that age, which was helpful, so I didn't have a panic attack with all the adult responsibility,\" he continued. \"There were moments of deep stress when it came a big grading period at school. If you don't maintain a C average, you lose your work permit, which comes up every six months. And so if I didn't have my work permit I would lose my job on the show. And if I lost my job on the show, maybe we didn't make the mortgage payment and all the people on the show might be out of work so studying for exams was probably even more stressful than kids regularly go through.",
      "\"In retrospect, I wouldn't change anything about my childhood at all, but\u2026 I wouldn't be comfortable putting my kids through that because I think I got away with it,\" Bateman added.",

That prompted a temporary shutdown at LaGuardia Airport in New York. Issues also materialized in Newark, N.J., Atlanta and Philadelphia. Fear of a major air disaster prompted lawmakers and the first Trump administration to terminate the shutdown.",

The House and Senate usually meet during a shutdown. But major committee hearings are often postponed. Lawmakers continue earning their paychecks. That\u2019s because the 27th Amendment prohibits \"varying the compensation\" of lawmakers without an intervening election. Some lawmakers make a point of saying they won\u2019t accept pay during a shutdown. They may try to defer their compensation or even donate it to charity.",

It\u2019s widely believed that former President Bill Clinton won his standoff with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., in 1995-1996. Clinton rode easily to reelection in the fall of 1996. Gingrich seemed to bleed support on Capitol Hill after the shutdown. But Gingrich secured significant spending reforms that ultimately resulted in a federal surplus a few years later.

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the latest scam takes exploitation of a trusted platform to a new level. Instead of sending generic or suspicious-looking emails, attackers are now abusing Apple's iCloud Calendar invite system to deliver phishing content directly from Apple's own email servers.",
      "This clever tactic allows the fraudulent messages to bypass spam filters and appear more legitimate to unsuspecting users. The goal is to alarm you into calling a scammer's fake support number under the pretense of disputing a fraudulent PayPal transaction. Once contacted, you are manipulated into granting remote access to your devices or sharing sensitive data.",

      "NEW EVITE PHISHING SCAM USES EMOTIONAL EVENT INVITATIONS TO TARGET VICTIMS",
      "Scammers exploit Apple\u2019s iCloud Calendar to deliver phishing invites that bypass spam filters. (Brent Lewin/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How the scam uses iCloud Calendar invites to bypass security",
      "The heart of this scam lies in abusing Apple's official infrastructure to lend credibility to a phishing attempt. Instead of using a suspicious or easily flagged email address, the attackers send calendar invites from Apple's genuine domain, noreply@email.apple.com, as reported by Bleeping Computer.",
      "The attacker embeds the phishing message in the \"Notes\" section of the calendar event, making it appear as a legitimate notification. They send the calendar invite to a Microsoft 365 email address they control, which is part of a mailing list. As a result, the invite is automatically forwarded to multiple real targets, broadening the scam\u2019s reach.",
      "Typically, when emails are forwarded, SPF (Sender Policy Framework) checks fail because the forwarding server isn't listed as an authorized sender. However, Microsoft 365 uses a technique called the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS), which rewrites the return path so that the message still passes SPF checks.",
      "This makes the email appear fully legitimate to both the recipient's inbox and automated spam filters. As a result, the message is far more likely to reach a user's inbox without being flagged, increasing the chance the victim will take the bait.",
      "SCAMMERS ARE USING DOCUSIGN EMAILS TO PUSH APPLE PAY FRAUD",
      "Cybercriminals leverage Microsoft 365 forwarding and Apple\u2019s email domain to outsmart filters. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Why these phishing scams are particularly dangerous",
      "What makes this campaign especially dangerous is the sense of legitimacy it conveys. Because Apple\u2019s official servers send the email directly, users are far less likely to suspect foul play. The message itself aims to panic the recipient by falsely claiming a large PayPal transaction occurred without the recipient's consent. The message includes a phone number to \"contact support\" and dispute the charge, but, in reality, it connects the victim to a scammer.",
      "Once the victim calls the number, the scammer poses as a technical support agent and attempts to convince the caller that the computer has been compromised. The next step is typically to ask the victim to download remote access software under the guise of issuing a refund or securing the account.",
      "In reality, this access is used to steal banking information, install malware or exfiltrate personal data. Because the original message passed security checks and seemed credible, victims often don't think twice before acting.",

      "Fraudsters are hijacking iCloud Calendar invites to trick users into calling fake support lines. (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from iCloud Calendar scammers",
      "I have listed some useful steps you can take to protect yourself from falling victim to these increasingly sophisticated phishing scams:",
      "If you receive an unexpected calendar invite, especially one containing a strange message or alarming claims, don't open it or respond. Legitimate companies rarely send payment disputes or security warnings through calendar invites. Always verify suspicious claims by logging into your official account directly.",
      "Phishing scams often include phone numbers that connect you to fraudsters posing as support agents. Instead of calling the number in the message, use official contact details found on the company's official website.",
      "Antivirus programs protect your computer from malware and phishing sites by blocking suspicious downloads and warning you about unsafe websites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Also, keeping your antivirus updated ensures it can defend against the latest threats.",

      "Hackers are able to send you these phishing emails because they have your data. Using a personal data removal service helps scrub your personal information from data broker websites. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to gather details about you and craft convincing, targeted phishing attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Scammers are taking phishing attacks in a disturbing new direction by manipulating trusted platforms to deliver malicious content. The safest approach is to treat any unexpected calendar invite, especially those with alarming messages or strange contact numbers, with extreme caution. Never call the number provided in the message or click on any links. Instead, go directly to official websites or your account's official dashboard to verify suspicious activity.",

Alef Aeronautics announced formal agreements with Half Moon Bay and Hollister airports to begin test operations of a road-legal, vertical-takeoff flying car.

      "Alef will start with its \"Model Zero Ultralight\" and eventually move to its commercial Model A. The Model A will drive, take off vertically, fly forward, land vertically and maneuver on both roads and runways. Alef will alert other aircraft before its carplanes move on the ground or in the air.

      "Overpayment scams are on the rise, and they can leave victims thousands of dollars in debt. The setup usually looks harmless: someone sends you a check for more than the agreed amount, asks you to forward the difference and disappears once the check bounces. Below are five of the most common overpayment scams you need to watch for today.",

      "FBI WARNS SENIORS ABOUT BILLION-DOLLAR SCAM DRAINING RETIREMENT FUNDS, EXPERT SAYS AI DRIVING IT",
      "1. The dog walker overpayment scam",
      "Bob from Harrison, Ohio, recently shared how he was nearly tricked by a scammer posing as a pet owner. The con began with a request for dog sitting. Bob was promised $250 for care and food, but then a fake check for $4,358 arrived.",
      "The scammer instructed Bob to send $4,000 of it to an \"appliance retailer.\" Why an appliance retailer when the service was for dog sitting? Scammers often use a third party to make the request sound more believable. If they simply asked for the money back, it would raise red flags. By inventing another company, whether a retailer, shipping service or contractor, they add urgency and legitimacy to the story. In reality, that \"retailer\" is just another front that the scammer controls. Here's the catch: the check appears to be real, but it's actually counterfeit. The bank may release the funds temporarily, but once it bounces, you're on the hook for the entire amount.",
      "Making a payment by scanning a QR code with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip: If you're asked to forward money to a third party, especially one unrelated to the original deal, treat it as a scam. Keep the check and envelope as evidence, and report it to the FTC and your state attorney general.",
      "2. The online marketplace scam",
      "Selling a couch, bike or electronics online? Some buyers \"accidentally\" send too much. They then ask you to return the difference through Zelle, Venmo or a wire transfer. Once the check or payment reverses, you've lost both the product and the money you returned.",
      "Tip: Always insist on verified payment methods. If a buyer pushes you for a refund quickly, walk away.",
      "FAKE AGENT PHONE SCAMS ARE SPREADING FAST ACROSS THE US",
      "Scammers may try to recruit buyers into buying gift cards before a false check they provided bounces. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3. The mystery shopper scam",
      "You might get an email or letter offering a job as a mystery shopper. They send you a large check to \"test\" stores by buying gift cards. You're asked to send the gift card numbers back as proof of purchase. After the bank reverses the fake check, you've lost the money you spent on those gift cards.",
      "Tip: Real companies never pay upfront with extra funds or ask for gift card codes by email.",
      "4. The rental deposit scam",
      "Scammers target renters by mailing a check for more than the deposit or rent. They claim it was a mistake and ask you to refund the difference. The check later bounces, leaving you stuck.",
      "Tip: Only accept payments through secure online portals or in person with verified funds.",
      "5. The work-from-home equipment scam",
      "This one lures jobseekers. The \"employer\" sends a large check to buy office equipment, then directs you to forward the extra funds to a vendor. Of course, the check is fake, and the supposed vendor is also the scammer.",
      "Tip: Legitimate employers provide equipment directly or reimburse verified expenses, not through overpayments.",

      "Scammers target remote workers by promising to provide a stipend for work-from-home tech. (iStock)",
      "How to protect yourself from overpayment scams",
      "Now that you've seen how these scams play out, from fake dog sitting gigs to marketplace frauds and bogus job offers, it's clear they all follow the same playbook. Someone sends you too much money and pressures you to forward the extra. That \"extra\" never existed, and once the check bounces, you're left holding the bag. The good news is, there are clear steps you can take to protect yourself and keep your money safe.",
      "Every scam in this article, from the dog walker hoax to rental deposit tricks, begins with an overpayment that looks harmless. If someone pays you more than you're owed, it's not a mistake. It's a scam. Do not respond or send money to any third party. Save the check and envelope as evidence, then report it.",
      "Scammers count on you trusting what you see in your account. In Bob's case, his $4,358 check looked real because the bank showed it as \"available.\" But available isn't the same as cleared. Always ask your bank to confirm when funds are fully verified before you spend a dime.",
      "Urgency is the scammer's strongest weapon. Marketplace fraudsters, renters and fake employers will pressure you to \"fix\" the mistake right away. Slow down, double-check and don't let anyone force you into quick action.",
      "Whether it's for rent, freelance work or selling a used item, scammers prefer paper checks because they're easy to fake. Stick with secure, traceable payment platforms or in-person verified funds. That way, you don't get stuck when a check bounces.",
      "If you receive a suspicious check, save everything: the envelope, emails, texts and any names used. In the dog sitting scam, Bob's saved emails and the scammer's phone number became valuable evidence. This documentation helps law enforcement and protects you if the scammer tries again under another identity.",
      "Scammers often find victims by scraping personal details from online data brokers. That's how they target renters, pet sitters or jobseekers. Using a personal data removal service can limit your exposure and make you harder to target in the first place. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many banks let you set fraud alerts for large deposits or unusual transactions. Turning these on gives you a chance to review suspicious activity before a scammer pressures you into acting on it.",
      "Just like Bob did when he cut contact with the fake pet owner, reporting scams helps protect others. File with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov and your state attorney general. You can also alert your local police and community groups to stop scammers from targeting someone else.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Overpayment scams prey on trust and urgency. They can pop up in online sales, job offers, rental agreements and even friendly community boards. By knowing the warning signs, you can stop scammers before they reach your wallet. Stay cautious whenever you're asked to deposit more than expected and forward the extra. If it sounds strange, it's probably a scam.",

There is a partition between the driving cab and the main cabin. The star of the show is an L-shaped couch that runs over six feet long. And it's not just any couch. It is deep, plush and inviting. It's the kind of seating where you can stretch out on without bumping into a dinette table or a cabinet corner.",

      "Bedtime gets an upgrade",
      "When the sun goes down, that beautiful lounge transforms. A double bed lowers from the ceiling, turning the room into a proper bedroom without having to rearrange cushions or fold anything in a weird way. In the morning, it lifts right back up, making space for coffee and conversation. It is a smooth trick that makes the van feel more like a studio apartment than a rolling compromise. Neither the couch nor the bed needs to sacrifice comfort the way sofa beds typically do.",
      "Laundry on the road",
      "Let's talk about the washer and dryer. Yes, really. A compact Tiny Wash unit is built right into the wardrobe. It handles just enough for a quick refresh, and it actually dries, too. No more hanging socks from cabinet knobs or relying on campground and public laundromats. For extended trips, this little feature is a money saver and an absolute game changer.",

This setup is ready for real cooking, not just boiling water or reheating prepackaged meals. If you like to eat well on the road, this one is built with you in mind.",
      "A bathroom that feels like a bathroom",
      "At the rear of the van, the bathroom doesn't feel like an afterthought. It has a sink, a full-standing shower and a macerating toilet. Instead of cramming it all into a tiny box, Robeta gave it a soft curtain enclosure that keeps the look minimal and the space functional. It feels clean, intentional and refreshingly roomy.",
      "Power to keep you out there",
      "This luxury van even has the chops for off-roading. The Ananya packs a 10-kilowatt-hour EcoFlow power system with stackable batteries and 450 watts of solar. You can stay off the cord for days without blinking. Add in a 160-liter freshwater tank, diesel heat and hot water via Webasto, and the freedom to wander suddenly looks very comfortable. These amenities are remarkable for a camper van this size.",

You can wash clothes on the road, sleep in a proper bed and stay powered up for days without plugging in. This means you can explore remote places without giving up the little luxuries that make travel enjoyable. In short, you get the freedom of the open road with the comfort of a high-end apartment.",
      "Stay connected while you roam",
      "When you're traveling in a camper van, nothing kills the vibe faster than losing cell service, especially if you rely on your phone for maps, music, work or keeping in touch. Thankfully, there are two handy solutions to keep you connected: cell phone boosters and mobile hotspots.",
      "Cell phone boosters amplify weak signals from nearby towers, making calls clearer, boosting data speeds and reducing dropped calls. They're ideal for rural drives, national parks or even just passing through patchy areas. Installation typically involves an outside antenna to capture the signal, an amplifier to boost it and an inside antenna to rebroadcast it inside your van.",
      "Mobile hotspots, on the other hand, turn a cellular signal into a private Wi-Fi network for your devices. They're perfect for working remotely from the road, streaming movies or sharing the internet with multiple passengers. Many can run off your phone plan or use a dedicated SIM card for more robust coverage.",
      "Pro tip:\u00a0If your adventures often take you far from towns or highways, a cell phone booster is your best bet for call reliability. If you need strong Wi-Fi for work or entertainment, pair it with a mobile hotspot for the ultimate on-the-road connectivity.",

      "Social platforms are built for speed and visibility. Anyone can create an account in minutes, post content instantly and connect with strangers worldwide. This openness is what makes social media engaging, but it is also what makes it ripe for abuse. Fraudsters exploit the fact that posts, comments and messages are consumed quickly and often without much scrutiny.",
      "Verification systems that were once meant to help users identify legitimate accounts have also lost some of their power. On platforms where checkmarks can be purchased, scammers can buy credibility without earning it. Add in the algorithms that reward viral content and sudden spikes in engagement, and you get the perfect environment for fraud to spread unnoticed.",
      "Scammers know people often lower their guard on social media. In these spaces, users share personal details, build emotional ties with influencers and trust posts that look familiar.

Clicking a bad link or handing over credentials can snowball into long-term consequences. Once scammers get access to your information, it can be sold on dark web marketplaces, used to open fraudulent accounts or leveraged for identity theft.",

If it does not recognize the page, that is a red flag that you are looking at a fake.

      "Earlier this year, Australian police arrested a passenger for running a malicious Wi-Fi network both at an airport and during a flight. The setup looked just like the airline's own Wi-Fi service, but it wasn't. Instead, it was what cybersecurity researchers call an \"evil twin,\" a fake hotspot designed to trick people into handing over their credentials.",
      "The idea isn't new, but the setting is. For years, fake Wi-Fi networks have been a common trick in cafes, hotels, and airports. What makes this case stand out is that the attacker took it to the skies, exploiting the growing reliance on in-flight Wi-Fi for entertainment and internet access.",

      "What is an evil twin Wi-Fi attack?",
      "An evil twin hotspot is a wireless network that impersonates a legitimate one by copying its name, also known as the SSID. When multiple networks with the same name exist, your phone or laptop often connects to the one with the stronger signal, which is usually the attacker's.",
      "Travelers check their phones while navigating delays and flight cancellations at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on July 19, 2024, in Austin, Texas. (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)",
      "Once connected, victims are often redirected to a fake login or landing page. In this case, the malicious portal requested passengers' email addresses, passwords, or even social media credentials under the pretense of granting access to the airline's entertainment system. The stolen information could then be used for account takeovers, identity theft, or further attacks.",
      "Why travel Wi-Fi is a prime target",
      "Travel creates a perfect storm for these kinds of attacks. Whether you're in a hotel, airport, cruise ship or airplane, you often have limited choices for getting online. Mobile data may be patchy or expensive, which pushes people toward the available Wi-Fi networks. Because these services feel official and are tied to trusted brands, travelers tend to assume they're safe and let their guard down when login requests pop up.",
      "Another trend adds to the risk. Travel providers are increasingly moving entertainment and services onto personal devices instead of offering built-in options. Airlines replace seatback screens with streaming portals, cruise lines promote app-based services and hotels direct guests to digital check-in platforms. All of these require a Wi-Fi connection, which means more people are logging on than ever before.",

      "Why you need a VPN for in-flight Wi-Fi security",
      "One of the best defenses against rogue Wi-Fi is a Virtual Private Network, or VPN. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, making it far harder for attackers to intercept your data even if you connect to the wrong hotspot.",
      "There is a catch, though. In-flight Wi-Fi systems often require you to disable your VPN temporarily to access the onboard portal. Even then, a VPN remains an important safeguard. Once you have cleared the login page and, if you have paid, connected to the internet, enabling your VPN ensures that any browsing, messaging, or app traffic stays private.",

      "A VPN is important, but it isn't the only defense you should rely on. Here are some other ways to stay safe when connecting midair:",
      "Before you even think about connecting to in-flight Wi-Fi, make sure your device has a strong antivirus installed. It's your first line of defense against malicious sites and apps that attackers may try to push through fake portals. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Most phones and laptops are set to reconnect automatically to familiar networks. This makes it easier for a fake hotspot with the same name to trick your device. Before you board, switch off auto-connect and manually choose the correct airline Wi-Fi.",
      "When browsing in-flight, check for the padlock icon in your browser's address bar. HTTPS encrypts the connection between your device and the website, making it harder for attackers on public Wi-Fi to intercept your data.",
      "Even with precautions, in-flight Wi-Fi should be treated as untrusted. Avoid logging in to sensitive accounts like online banking or work systems. Stick to light browsing, streaming or messaging until you're back on a secure connection.",
      "Outdated operating systems and apps often have security holes attackers exploit. Before your trip, install the latest updates on your phone, tablet or laptop. Many updates include security patches that protect you against known vulnerabilities.",
      "When possible, switch your device to airplane mode and then enable only Wi-Fi. This reduces exposure from other radios (like Bluetooth or cellular roaming) that attackers sometimes target on flights.",
      "Some fake in-flight portals use pop-ups or redirects designed to trick you into entering login details or clicking on malicious links. If a page asks for unnecessary information, like your full Social Security number, banking details or unrelated logins, treat it as a red flag. Close the page immediately and don\u2019t click.",

As airlines push more passengers toward in-flight Wi-Fi, attackers are finding ways to exploit that dependency. Next time you fly, think twice before blindly connecting to the first Wi-Fi network that pops up. Sometimes, the safest choice is to stay offline until you land.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior national correspondent William La Jeunesse reports on the growing \u2018assassination culture\u2019 on the political left, with reaction from Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer.",
      "The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah has thrust political violence back into the national spotlight. Prosecutors have charged 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in the Sept. 10 killing of Kirk as he addressed an audience at Utah Valley University.",
      "Kirk\u2019s assassination is the most high-profile attack yet in what terrorism researchers call a surge in left-wing violence.",
      "A new report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) found that \"the number of terrorist incidents involving left-wing extremists so far this year puts 2025 on pace to be the left\u2019s most violent year in more than three decades.\"",
      "For the first time in over 30 years, left-wing attacks and plots outnumber those from the far right. The study tracks 750 terrorist incidents in the U.S. between 1994 and July 2025.",

      "The report defines terrorism as \"violence or threats by nonstate actors meant to achieve political goals and spread fear.\" Analysts say the rise on the left is driven mostly by attacks on government facilities and partisan plots aimed at conservative leaders. As the report notes, \"despite the rise in incidents, the lethality of left-wing attacks remains very low.\"",
      "One example came on July 4, when a group of black-clad suspects armed with rifles and fireworks stormed the ICE Prairieland Detention Facility in Alvarado, Texas. Prosecutors say the attackers sprayed anti-ICE graffiti, shot a police officer in the neck and exchanged fire with correctional officers before fleeing. Fourteen suspects have since been charged with attempted murder of federal officers and firearms offenses.",
      "In January, Capitol Police arrested Riley Jane English, 24, on the National Mall.

      "In March, arsonists set fire to the Republican Party of New Mexico headquarters, leaving behind graffiti that read \"ICE = KKK\".",
      "The violence so far has been less lethal than right-wing or jihadist terrorism that dominated past decades. CSIS reports that, since 2020, only two people have been killed in left-wing attacks before Kirk\u2019s death, Aaron Danielson in Portland in 2020 and UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in 2024.",
      "Thompson was fatally shot in December 2024. Federal prosecutors allege Luigi Mangione carried out the assassination and charged him with murder, stalking and firearms violations. A judge later threw out terrorism charges, but the Department of Justice has described the case as \"politically motivated.\"",
      "Charlie Kirk speaks before he was assassinated during Turning Point's visit to Utah Valley University in Orem Sept. 10. (Tess Crowley/The Deseret News via AP)",
      "By comparison, right-wing terrorism has caused higher death tolls in recent years. Experts warn that the lull is likely temporary.",
      "\"Right-wing terrorism could easily return to previous high levels,\" the study cautioned.",
      "Researchers urge vigilance in how leaders respond. The CSIS report warns that sweeping crackdowns on nonviolent groups risk fueling more extremism.",

      "A high-ranking Syrian government official confirmed to Fox News Digital that al-Sharaa will use the opportunity at the U.N. to present Syria\u2019s vision for stability, reconstruction, and reconciliation.",
      "\"The most important issues he will raise include the need to lift all forms of unilateral sanctions that continue to hinder Syria\u2019s recovery, the importance of combating terrorism in all its forms, the return of displaced Syrians and refugees, and the advancement of a genuinely inclusive political process rooted in the will of the Syrian people,\" the Syrian official said.",
      "Al-Sharaa, who led the Islamist rebel group Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) to victory over Assad, ditched his military fatigues for a Western-style suit and has been on a charm offensive, hosting European and Western diplomats and politicians in hopes of bringing Syria out from its international pariah status.",

      "Trump called al-Sharaa a \"young, attractive, tough guy,\" announcing that the U.S. would lift sanctions in place since the Assad era and even discussed normalizing relations.",
      "Hall noted that al-Sharaa might be looking to secure a security pact between Israel and Syria along the UNGA sidelines, emphasizing that he seeks a Syria that is at peace with its neighbors and doesn't want to position Syria to be a threat to any outside forces, particularly Israel.",
      "He will also be looking to secure much-needed reconstruction aid to rebuild a country ravaged by 13 years of civil war. The cost for reconstruction is estimated to be between $250 and $400 billion, and 16.7 million people, or 75% of the population, are in dire need of humanitarian assistance, according to the U.N.",

      "ISLAMIST GROUP RUNNING SYRIA HAS MIXED RECORD OVER GOVERNANCE IN PROVINCE, RULED WITH 'IRON FIST'",

One month after taking power, Syrian security forces seized a shipment of heavy ammunition destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon, once a key ally of the Assad regime and Iran\u2019s Axis of Resistance.",
      "While optimism for a new Syria remains high, some caution it\u2019s still too soon to judge al-Sharaa as a Western ally given his terrorist past.",
      "\"Al-Sharaa is not a democrat. He ruled Idlib without power-sharing. So far, in terms of control of vital government functions like security, foreign affairs, intelligence and justice, he has put loyalists in place,\" former U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford told Fox News Digital.",
      "Ford, who was the last U.S. ambassador in Damascus in 2011, said the crucial question is whether, over time, individual political and civil liberties will be respected and that people maintain, as they have now, the freedom to organize and protest.",

      "\"Al-Sharaa's heavy hand ruling Idlib prior to Assad's fall has been lighter in Damascus, Aleppo and elsewhere. But so far, there is more political freedom to speak and protest in Syria than in many other countries in the region, such as Egypt, Algeria and some Gulf states,\" Ford added.",
      "Ambassador Barbara Leaf, who served as assistant secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, visited Damascus and met with Shara in December, becoming the highest-ranking official to meet with Syrian leadership since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011.",
      "Leaf, a distinguished diplomatic fellow with the Middle East Institute, told Fox News Digital about her initial contact with Shara right after HTS overthrew Assad. Her mission was to get eyes on him, to assess him and to send a clear signal on U.S. expectations if he was going to lead a new Syria.",
      "\"My takeaway from the meeting was that he came across as somebody who was very well-prepared for the discussion. He had clearly anticipated all of the topics that I raised and he had pretty thoughtful responses with a readiness to engage,\" she said.",

      "Al-Sharaa made a point several times to say that Syria would no longer be a threat or a staging point for threats against its neighbors, including Israel, and that he would not allow the Iranians, Hezbollah or Palestinian groups, to use Syrian territory to conduct terrorist activities, the ambassador said.",
      "\"I came to the sense that he was already making a shift from being a military commander to being a politician, to being a political leader,\" Ambassador Leaf noted.",
      "While Ambassador Leaf highlighted his pragmatism, his true intentions as the new leader of Syria remain murky.",
      "The ambassador said that it appears al-Sharaa has traveled a trajectory away from his jihadist terrorist past, but it remains a question how far he is willing to go to effectuate what she believes is an intention to form an Islamist style of governance.",

      "\"Does he want to formulate a kind of Islamist governance, conservative governance and social order that, frankly, Syria has not seen? And would he be willing to use force to get there? That's an unknown,\" the ambassador cautioned.",
      "What\u2019s concerning for Ambassador Leaf and others is that many of the people serving in key roles in the transitional government are close associates of al-Sharaa and others affiliated with HTS and other allied armed rebel groups.",
      "\"Al-Sharaa is still engaged in a careful balancing act within his own government between liberal opposition voices, former regime bureaucrats and more Islamist proponents aligned still with HTS\u2019 mission and principles,\" Caroline Rose, director of The New Lines Institute, told Fox News Digital.",

      "EVANGELICAL LEADER SAYS US MUST PROTECT SYRIAN CHRISTIANS FROM ATTACKS BY JIHADI TERRORISTS",
      "Rose, who traveled to Syria earlier this year, said that Syria's complex political dynamics have led not only to gridlock, but even incapacity in times of crisis, \"such as failure to rein in radical Sunni fighters during violent outbreaks in Latakia and Suwayda, but also policies appeasing more conservative elements of al-Sharaa\u2019s support network, such as the ruling requiring full-body swimwear at Syrian pools and beaches.\"",
      "While Syria\u2019s new government has looked to consolidate control over a restive society, Shara\u2019s forces had to manage a fragile society divided along ethnic and religious lines.",
      "Syria has experienced a wave of sectarian violence since the revolution to overthrow Assad. Government security forces retaliated after forces loyal to the Assad regime launched an attack in the coastal city of Latakia, Assad\u2019s hometown. In total, around 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were massacred, according to the U.N. Most of the victims from the Alawites, a minority group in Syria, which the Assad family belonged to, as well as from the Druze community.",
      "It was the worst episode of violence since the overthrow of Assad in December 2024.",

      "Clashes between Bedouin tribes, Druze militias and government forces in Suweida led to hundreds of deaths and drew in Israeli military intervention \u2014 to protect Syria's Druze minority. A ceasefire was eventually agreed to but the spiraling ethnic violence highlights Syria's rocky transition.",
      "The country's dwindling Christian community has also felt the brunt of extremist violence. In June, the Islamic State was suspected of carrying out a deadly suicide bombing at a Greek Orthodox church in Syria, which killed 22 worshipers and injured 63 others. Christians have also been attacked and, in some cases, killed, allegedly by forces tied to the al-Sharaa government.",

      "The two appeals, arising from cases in Washington state and New Hampshire, will likely determine once and for all whether the contentious proposal can move forward.",

      "Analysts are already warning that U.S. consumers could see higher prices due to new tariffs President Donald Trump plans to impose on drug product imports as soon as next week.",
      "But a series of exemptions may blunt the ultimate impact.",
      "In a Truth Social post late Thursday, Trump said that any branded or patented pharmaceutical products brought into the U.S. would face a 100% tariff starting Oct. 1.",
      "U.S. imports of pharmaceuticals totaled about $213 billion in 2024, a threefold increase from a decade earlier, according to data from the United Nations Comtrade Database.",
      "With Asia alone accounting for just over 20% of those imports by value, U.S. consumers could see a \u201cmeaningful commercial hit,\u201d Louise Loo, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics research group, said in a note to clients.",
      "Previous studies have shown that U.S. annual spending per capita on prescription drugs is about double the rest of the developed world. In July, Trump announced a plan to \u201cget Americans the best prices in the world for prescription drugs\u201d that involved asking major drugmakers to match low prices they offer elsewhere in the world.",
      "However, it is not clear what actions the pharma firms have taken to begin addressing that demand. The pharmaceutical industry is already warning that the new tariffs could derail further drug development while also raising prices.",
      "\u201cEvery dollar spent on tariffs is a dollar that cannot be invested in American manufacturing or the development of future treatments and cures,\u201d Alex Schriver, senior vice president for PhRMA, the drug industry\u2019s primary lobbying group, said in a statement. \u201cMedicines have historically been exempt from tariffs because they raise costs and could lead to shortages.\u201d",
      "Despite those warnings, a significant share of drug products could wind up being exempted from the new import duties.",
      "The tariffs will not affect so-called generic drugs, which account for 9 out of 10 prescriptions filled in the U.S., according to the Food and Drug Administration. Assuming generics remain tariff-free, the impact to consumers could be more limited than feared.",
      "Trump also specified that any drug companies that currently have, or have committed to building, U.S.-based drug-making facilities would be exempted from tariffs. That\u2019s a category that includes numerous major drugmakers.",
      "\u201cMany pharmaceutical companies have facilities in the U.S., so it may be relatively easy to superficially expand those facilities to avoid tariffs being applied,\u201d Paul Donovan, chief global economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note to clients.",
      "Analysts at JPMorgan agreed: \u201cWhile there remains very limited details, we note that this will likely lead to a majority of pharma products being excluded from any tariffs\u201d because most major companies have recently increased or have started to increase their U.S. manufacturing facilities.",
      "On the White House website, the administration maintains a \u201crunning list of new U.S. investment\u201d from private companies. At least 15 pharmaceutical or drug makers are listed with investments ranging from new manufacturing facilities, tens of billions in expanded U.S. production and increased R&D spending. Many of those announcements would appear to meet the requirements laid out by Trump to avoid the new tariff.",
      "Two major European drugmakers, Roche and Novartis, said in statements that they expected little to no impact from the newly announced duties.",
      "\u201cWe are working to ensure that all major Novartis medicines for U.S. patients are manufactured in the U.S.,\u201d Novartis said in a statement. \u201cThe announced 100% tariff should not have an impact.\u201d Roche pointed to ongoing factory construction in the U.S., with multiple sites being expanded and upgraded in Kentucky, Indiana, New Jersey and California.",
      "Trump has signaled since at least April that drug imports would face tariffs. In anticipation, major drugmakers have indicated they have been stockpiling supplies, analysts said.",
      "As a result, consumers are unlikely to feel immediate effects even though the tariffs are set to kick in next week.",
      "\u201cWe think there may have been significant inventory accumulation this year,\u201d Neil Shearing, group chief economist with Capital Economics, said in a note.",
      "This summer, Trump placed a maximum 15% tariff on most pharmaceuticals coming in from the European Union, which accounts for 60% of drugs imported by the U.S. E.U. officials believe that this agreement will shield it from the 100% duties, though they said they could not be certain. The White House confirmed to Reuters Friday that the tariffs wouldn't apply to countries with negotiated deals.",
      "\u201cThis clear all-inclusive 15% tariff ceiling for E.U. exports represents an insurance policy that no higher tariffs will emerge for European economic operators,\u201d a European Commission spokesperson told NBC News on Friday.",
      "Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Harris, who also acts as trade minister, said his country is \u201cstudying the impact of this announcement\u201d but added that he believed the 15% cap on pharma tariffs remained in place. Ireland alone accounts for 24% of pharma imports to the U.S."

      "Sinclair and Nexstar, the broadcast station owners that took \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d off the air amid criticism of the host\u2019s comments about the assassination of Charlie Kirk, said that the show will return Friday night on their ABC affiliates.",
      "\u201cOur objective throughout this process has been to ensure that programming remains accurate and engaging for the widest possible audience,\u201d Sinclair said in a statement on Friday afternoon.",
      "\u201cWe take seriously our responsibility as local broadcasters to provide programming that serves the interests of our communities, while also honoring our obligations to air national network programming,\u201d said the company, which owns and operates 30 ABC affiliate stations in 27 markets.",
      "Roughly three hours later, Nexstar said it was also bringing back Kimmel's program on its dozens of ABC affiliates.",
      "Sinclair and Nexstar, which together own 70 ABC affiliates across the U.S., announced last week they would pre-empt airings of Kimmel\u2019s talk show after the comedian criticized Republicans for their response to Kirk\u2019s killing. Federal Communications Chairman Brendan Carr, who regulates the broadcast television industry, accused Kimmel of \u201cthe sickest conduct possible.\u201d",
      "Disney, the owner of ABC, briefly suspended Kimmel before resuming production on his show on Tuesday. The return episode drew more than 6 million total viewers \u2014 even though it wasn\u2019t available in more than a quarter of U.S. households thanks to the Nexstar and Sinclair blackouts.",
      "Sinclair insisted Friday that its \u201cdecision to preempt this program was independent of any government interaction or influence.\u201d",
      "\u201cFree speech provides broadcasters with the right to exercise judgment as to the content on their local stations,\u201d the company said. \u201cWhile we understand that not everyone will agree with our decisions about programming, it is simply inconsistent to champion free speech while demanding that broadcasters air specific content.\u201d",
      "Sinclair said it pitched various proposals to Disney during \u201congoing and constructive discussions,\u201d including the hiring of a \u201cnetwork-wide independent ombudsman,\u201d though the Magic Kingdom has \u201cnot yet adopted these measures.\u201d",
      "Disney has not made editorial or content concessions to Sinclair or Nexstar, according to a source familiar with the discussions.",
      "Sinclair made other public demands last week. The company called on Kimmel to \u201cissue a direct apology to the Kirk family\u201d and \u201cmake a meaningful personal donation\u201d to Kirk\u2019s family and Turning Point USA, the conservative activist organization he founded.",
      "Four Democratic lawmakers announced Tuesday they are opening a probe into Nexstar and Sinclair focused on whether their decisions to pull Kimmel\u2019s show \u201crelate to regulatory issues pending with the Trump administration.\u201d",
      "Nexstar is seeking FCC approval for a proposed $6.2 billion merger with a rival, Tegna. Sinclair is exploring merger options for its broadcast business, according to CNBC.",
      "Kimmel has been at the center of a national firestorm after he commented on the political motivations of the man suspected of killing Kirk at an event at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10.",
      "\u201cThe MAGA gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\u201d Kimmel said on his Sept. 15 show.",
      "Investigators had not yet released details about the suspect\u2019s possible motive at the time. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox has said the suspect grew up in a conservative household in Utah but later became influenced by what he characterized as \u201cleftist ideology.\u201d",
      "In the opening minutes of Tuesday\u2019s comeback episode, Kimmel, 57, passionately defended free speech and mocked President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cThis show is not important,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cWhat is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this.\u201d",
      "He also attempted to smooth tensions.",
      "\u201cYou understand that it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man,\u201d Kimmel said, his voice breaking. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything funny about it.\u201d"

      "Black liberation activist and American fugitive Assata Shakur, who escaped to Cuba more than 45 years ago after she was convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper, died in Havana, the government announced Friday.",
      "She was 78.",
      "Shakur, who changed her name from Joanne Chesimard, died Thursday from health ailments and advanced age, according to a short statement released by the Cuban Foreign Ministry.",
      "\u201cWords cannot describe the depth of loss that I am feeling at this time. I want to thank you for your loving prayers,\u201d her daughter Kakuya Shakur wrote in a Facebook post.",
      "Shakur was involved in a shootout during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1973. State Trooper Werner Foerster, the second officer responding to the scene, found a loaded gun on the driver of the car, according to previous NBC News reporting. Shakur was in the front passenger seat and another man was seated behind her.",
      "There was an exchange of gunfire. James Harper, the state trooper who initially pulled the group over, said he saw Shakur shoot Foerster in the stomach with the officer's gun after he tussled with the driver, who also shot Foerster in the arm.",
      "Shakur and two men she was with returned to the car and drove five miles down the New Jersey Turnpike. One of the men with them, James Coston, died in the car. As they dumped Coston's body on the side of the road, police caught up to the group. Shakur was arrested while the driver fled and was found nearly two days later.",
      "Shakur, who was sentenced to life in prison, denied shooting Foerster. To supporters, she was an activist jailed for crimes she did not commit.",
      "In a statement, Foerster's family said her death did not bring any joy to them, but did bring \"a measure of closure to a tragedy that has deeply affected our family and community.\"",
      "\"While this development marks the end of a long and painful chapter, it does not erase the profound loss we continue to feel each day,\" the family said. \"The pain of losing Werner is something we carry every single day. His absence is felt in every quiet moment, every family gathering, and every milestone he should have been here to witness.\"",
      "Shakur was born Joanne Deborah Byron in Queens, New York, on July 16, 1947. After what she described in her autobiography as a troubled childhood, she became involved in political activism at the Borough of Manhattan Community College and City College of New York. She was a member of the revolutionary Black Liberation Army, as well as the Black Panther Party. At 21, she married Louis Chesimard, though their marriage lasted only a year.",
      "Shakur was serving a life sentence at the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey after being convicted in 1977 of murder in Foerster's death. She had also been implicated in armed robbery and other crimes. She escaped from prison on Nov. 2, 1979, with the help of members of the Black Liberation Army who posed as visitors. She turned up a few years later in Cuba, where the island\u2019s leader at the time, Fidel Castro, granted her political asylum. She published an autobiography in 1987.",
      "Because Cuba repeatedly refused to extradite her to the U.S., Shakur and other fugitives living in Cuba became a major sticking point in negotiations between the U.S. and the communist-run island after President Barack Obama re-established diplomatic relations between the two countries.",
      "Then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Shakur should be returned to New Jersey after the ceremonial reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Cuba in 2015.",
      "Gov. Phil Murphy and state Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan said in a statement Friday that their offices have worked with the State Department in previous attempts to bring Shakur back to New Jersey to face accountability for Foerster's killing and for fleeing the country.",
      "\"We will vigorously oppose any attempt to repatriate Chesimard's remains to the United States,\" they wrote.",
      "Shakur became the first woman on the FBI\u2019s list of most wanted terrorists in 2013. She was added to the list on the anniversary of Foerster\u2019s death. There was a $2 million reward for information leading to her arrest.",
      "Supporters of Shakur, who was rapper Tupac Shakur's godmother through her brother Mutulu Shakur, believed she was a target of law enforcement for her involvement with the Black Liberation Army.",
      "In a 1998 interview with NBC New York in Havana, Shakur said she had never killed anyone and was found guilty in an \u201cunfair trial\u201d by an all-white jury.",
      "\u201cI was shot with my arms in the air, then shot again in the back and left on the ground to die,\u201d she said. \u201cNext thing I knew, they were coming by me and saying, \u2018Is she dead yet, is she dead yet?\u2019\u201d",
      "She said she was later taken to a hospital, where she was beaten and tortured by state troopers who she said would stick their hands in her wounds and ask if it hurt.",
      "\u201cAmerican racism has done to another Black person what it has done to Black people down through the years,\u201d Shakur\u2019s defense attorney William Kunstler said in 1977. \u201cThe reality is, this beautiful young Black woman never had a chance, but we, like liberal fools, still had hopes.\u201d"

      "\"Dick has lived in Malibu for about 30 years and is an awesome human being,\" Springfield continued. \"I thought I was doing well at 76, but Dick got up from the chest press machine and did a little dance step before I left! Amazing!\"",

      "Van Dyke, who celebrates his 100th birthday on Dec. 13, shared a video shortly after his 99th birthday last year to demonstrate how he stays in such amazing shape.",

      "\u201cI am acutely aware that I can go any day now,\u201d he says in the video. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know why it doesn\u2019t concern me. I\u2019m not afraid of it. I have that feeling totally against anything intellectual I have, that I am going to be all right.\u201d",
      "Van Dyke added that he considers himself \u201cone of those lucky people who got to do for a living what I would have done anyway.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you think how lucky I am,\" the actor says, \"I got to do what I do: play and act silly.\""

    "story": [
      "Jesse Williams is stepping out of the \u201cGrey\u2019s\u201d and into the light with his new Prime Video series, \u201cHotel Costiera.\u201d",
      "Filmed at a real-life luxury hotel on Italy\u2019s Amalfi Coast, Williams throws away his bedside manner to embody Daniel De Luca, a U.S. Marine intelligence officer who now works to solve crimes as fixer for the hotel\u2019s owner, Augusto (Tommaso Ragno), and his daughter Adele (Maria Chiara Giannetta).",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Williams, 44, admits it was refreshing to take a step back from \u201cserious subjects\u201d and jump into something more \u201ccomedic\u201d and \u201clight.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a big part of the appeal. It was a place to play, be light, fun, funny, creative \u2026 amidst all the chaos in the world,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cA lot of my life is around serious subjects. So it was nice to be able to have my work be a little bit different, something where we can kind of take an old school format and do some action. I like to be physical and do something comedic, as well as something with a little bit of stakes.\u201d",
      "Taking big swings is not something new to Williams. The actor made a lasting impression during his Broadway debut in the 2022 revival of the play \u201cTake Me Out.\u201d The production, which also starred Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Patrick J. Adams and Michael Oberholtzer, among others, won a Tony Award for best revival of a play that year, and gave Ferguson his first Tony for best featured actor in a play.",
      "That same year, Williams also took a turn on another murder mystery series when he was cast as a guest star on Season 3 of \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d and played Tobert, a cameraman and documentary filmmaker.",
      "But his time around, Williams, who fans came to know and love as Dr. Jackson Avery on \"Grey\u2019s Anatomy\" for 12 seasons, says he was focused on doing something across the pond.",
      "\u201cI was really interested in storytelling outside of the country, like traveling somewhere and putting together a cast from other countries and having this kind of cultural melange to play with. I thought that it was a good time for this,\u201d he tells TODAY.com.",
      "To accomplish this feat, Williams enlisted a dialect coach to help him learn the romance language.",
      "\u201cI had somebody on Zoom, before I left the country, and then there was somebody on set, just helping me,\u201d he says of his processes to speak the language in occasional scenes. \u201cI kind of had to learn the fundamentals of the language, learn the language, syntax construction, and then my lines, which are always changing, and have to be malleable.\u201d",
      "But don\u2019t expect the actor to be fluent in the millennium-old tongue. \u201cI\u2019m no good with languages,\u201d Williams says laughing, adding \u201cSome people can just adjust and pick it up pretty quickly. I would not say that\u2019s a strong suit for me ... it was work.\u201d",
      "Over the course of six episodes, viewers will see Williams solve different cases as he simultaneously looks into the disappearance of the hotel owner\u2019s younger daughter, Alice (Amanda Campana). Though her family doubts something\u2019s amiss, Daniel believes that she\u2019s in trouble.",
      "While Williams\u2019 character appears to have no issues solving mysteries and being the disarming sleuth, the \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d alum says he doesn\u2019t have much in common with the Marine-turned-fixer.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s so institutionally trained, it\u2019s very opposite of me,\u201d he tells TODAY.com. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine putting myself through the things that he\u2019s put himself through in terms of working his way up the ranks of the military and the culture there. So that\u2019s where we differ. I think a willingness to find the humor in things is, probably, a place that we overlap.\u201d",
      "As for solving crimes? Williams says he\u2019s \u201cobservant\u201d \u2014 but it's going to be a stretch if you expect him to solve an actual murder.",
      "\u201cI think I do pick up on body language and certainly attention to detail,\u201d he says thoughtfully, before emphasizing that he\u2019d only make a \u201cdecent detective.\u201d",
      "Shorter than the traditional 10 or 12 episode series, \u201cHotel Costiera\u201d is an sufficient tease for fans who love murder mysteries and crime dramas, but it will undoubtedly leave them wanting for more. Williams says there\u2019s an easy fix for that. He tells TODAY.com that while the limited series closes the loop in the final episode, the show is \u201cpoised for a whole lot of story.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mysterious, interesting material in that coastline, in the history of a country that\u2019s thousands of years old and still has the structures to prove it,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we could be doing there.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo binge away and we\u2019ll have a chance to keep telling you stories,\u201d he quips.",
      "\u201cHotel Costiera,\u201d also starring Jordan Alexandra and Antonio Gerardi, is now available to stream on Prime Video."

      "Van Der Beek, who has six kids with his wife, then recalled how Olivia handled matters when she once \u201cscrewed up\u201d getting his ticket for her high school football game.",
      "\u201cYou did something remarkable. Something I\u2019d like to THINK you learned from me (but recognize that might be wishful thinking): You immediately took responsibility.

Apologized succinctly, then did what you could to fix it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI was more proud of how you handled the mess-up than if you\u2019d done it all perfectly the start.\u201d",

      "\u201cKeep taking big swings, kiddo. Risk imperfection,\u201d he wrote. \u201cKeep dreaming big and most importantly, be true to who you are.

    "summary": "Here are 7 books to read after Buckeye by Patrick Ryan, according to the author.",
    "story": [
      "Read With Jenna's September 2025 pick, \"Buckeye\" by Patrick Ryan, is a long and sweeping epic, covering decades in American history and how it coincides with two families.",
      "When you're done, you might be left craving either more about American history, world wars or a family epic. Luckily, author Ryan recommended seven books that inspired \"Buckeye\" and may be followups to the book.",
      "Below, find out what Ryan had to say about the books, which range from fiction to nonfiction.",
      "Ordinary People: A Novel",
      "\"You might have seen the film adaptation, which is one of my favorite films ever. Still, even if you\u2019re very familiar with the story it tells, if you haven\u2019t read this novel, I can\u2019t recommend it highly enough. A short and very intimate investigation into a family in the wake on one tragedy and headed toward another, told in the present tense. The interiority of the characters is utterly convincing, and what the novel says about forgiveness is gut-wrenching. It\u2019s a gem of a novel.\"",
      "The Last Of The Doughboys: The Forgotten Generation and Their Forgotten World War",
      "\"This is a fascinating and compulsively readable account of Richard Rubin\u2019s project to interview every living First World War veteran \u2014 written by Rubin himself. What these nonagenarians and centenarians have to say, and the way they say it (drawing from memories that are still very close to them) will hold you on the edge of your seat and occasionally move you to tears.\"",
      "Soldier From The War Returning: The Greatest Generation's Troubled Homecoming",
      "\u201cChilders writes the true, intimate and sometimes astonishing lives of three men who come home from the Second World War and find themselves struggling to re-assimilate. It\u2019s not just their stories, though; it\u2019s also the stories of their families and a myth-shattering portrait of a country ill-equipped to accommodate what we now call PTSD.\"",
      "Nicholas Nickleby (Penguin Classics)",
      "\"Whenever I ask someone if they\u2019ve read this book, the answer is almost always no. Even people who loved 'David Copperfield' and Oliver Twist. I know there\u2019s only time for so many Dickens novels in your life \u2014 I think I\u2019ve read less than half of them\u2014but if you\u2019re up for a wonderful, long, entertaining, emotional family drama with plenty of characters and lots of twists and turns, I recommend this one.\"",
      "Plainsong",
      "Eventide",
      "\"Two seemingly quiet novels set in the small fictional town of Holt, Colorado. In a no-nonsense voice but lyrical voice, these books dive deep into the hearts and psychologies of characters you\u2019ll fall in love with and care about \u2014 including two elderly brothers who are hats-off unforgettable.\u201c",
      "Tell Me Everything: Oprah's Book Club: A Novel",
      "\"No one nails character as exactly as Elizabeth Strout, and this is the novel where she takes all the characters she\u2019s been writing about for years and brings them into one narrative. Time is the wind in the sail of this beautiful book, and no one \u2014 not even Olive Kitteridge \u2014 can stop it.\"",
      "Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam",
      "\"A heartbreaking and fascinating collection of more than 200 letters written by American soldiers in Vietnam. Each letter is followed by a short update on what happened to the writer \u2014including where the men who came home are now, and what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s a devastating and necessary book. Collectively, it makes a defining voice from that war that the country couldn\u2019t hear while it was happening.\""

      "\"I didn't expect to get the Golden Buzzer. I honestly had no expectation,\" Sanchez said. \"Sofia (Vergara) saw something special in me, and that really meant the world.\"",

      "Sanchez said that the baby would \"kick hard\" every time she sang \"Golden Hour\" by JVKE.",
      "\"That song 'Golden Hour' was really special to me, because she was kind of like helping me, or just there really with me during that song,\" she says.",
      "Now that she is nearing the end of her pregnancy, Sanchez says she is excited to begin a new chapter.",
      "\"I'm excited to pour out everything that I've gone through with this experience and just throughout the year fully out into my music and just share it with the world,\" she says. \"Hopefully with each and every platform that I'm given, I inspire people who are also struggling with following their dreams. I just hope to inspire people.\"",
      "\u201cIt's been a long, a long journey, but I'm so grateful for every single minute of it \u2014 just getting a chance to sing in front of America again and see what they think of me and my creativity. I cannot believe that I am the winner of Season 20.\u201d"

      "Nate Bargatze is reflecting on his Emmys hosting duties and the donation bit that divided the internet.",
      "During his Sept. 23 \u201cNateland\u201d podcast episode, the comedian said that the Boys & Girls Club of America donation was \u201cfun\u201d but knows that some people didn\u2019t like the execution.",
      "In an attempt to keep acceptance speeches short during the Sept. 14 Emmy Awards, Bargatze said he would be donating $100,000 to the organization. However, every time a speech went over the allotted 45-seconds, money would be deducted. If they kept it short, money would be added.",
      "While it seemed good in theory, the show ended with the number in the red because the final speeches took up a lot of time.",
      "\u201cA lot of reviews did not like the Boys & Girls Club thing,\u201d Bargatze told his pals Brian Bates, Aaron Weber and Dusty Slay during the podcast, adding that the idea \u201ccame from a real place of heart.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody at home loved it,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt was fun, it was entertaining seeing money go down and all this.\u201d",
      "He said, he \u201cwasn\u2019t trying to put anyone on the spot\u201d or \u201ctrying to make someone donate money.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut in my head I kinda thought, \u2018Make it fun,\u2019\u201d he continued, noting that the children\u2019s presence or the donation wasn\u2019t \u201ca tool,\u201d he was just trying to find a way to make speeches shorter.",
      "\u201cHonestly, what I thought would happen in the room, I thought it was going to be Netflix donating or Apple. The shows that won,\u201d he said, not expecting 15-year-old \u201cAdolescence\u201d star and winner Owen Cooper covering what had been deducted for his speech going over.",
      "\u201cIn my head, I pictured it as they could then go long, but then be a hero,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it was like a win-win. Then the night becomes about love and you\u2019re giving to these kids that are there and all this kind of stuff. I don\u2019t know if I just didn\u2019t explain it enough in the room.\u201d",
      "At the end of the night, CBS donated $100,000 and Bargatze put in his own $250,000, making the grand total $350,000.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna give that money at the end,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking I was gonna have to. But the way it went, I was like, \u2018Well, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not gonna not.\u2019\u201d",
      "He said that this donation moment has been his biggest controversy, joking, \u201cIt is pretty funny my only controversial thing is the Boys and Girls Club got $350,000.\u201d",
      "Overall, Bargatze said he doesn't regret doing the bit, but would have just better explained the situation. He said he wanted it to be a \u201cgiving night\u201d and thanked his fans and friends for tuning in.",
      "He said that he knew he was the \u201coutsider,\u201d but that \u201cthe biggest thing that showed was that the ratings went up.\u201d",
      "According to Variety, the 2025 Emmys had 7.4 million viewers, an 8% increase from last year's 6.9 million viewers. The magazine reported that it was the most-watched Emmys since 2021."

Despite Stabler separating from, and nearly divorcing, his wife, nothing romantic ever happened between him and Benson back then.",
      "Cragen was the one who broke the news to Benson in the show\u2019s 13th season that Stabler resigned and wasn\u2019t coming back. Ten years later, Stabler returned to Benson\u2019s life, and his wife died. Since then, the two have shared a few close moments, including a near-kiss in Benson\u2019s kitchen.",
      "Now, \u201clove you\u201d is not something these two casually say to each other. In fact, the only other time Stabler said \u201cI love you\u201d to Benson was during a PTSD spiral on \u201cLaw & Order: Organized Crime\u201d after his wife died from injuries sustained in a car bombing.",
      "At the time, his children and Benson staged an intervention for Stabler amid his erratic behavior following Kathy\u2019s death. Stabler pushed away their concerns, and Benson asked, \u201cElliot, tell us what you need.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, while staring at Benson as his kids watched.",
      "Benson looked shocked as his kids just stared. After a few seconds, he added, \u201cI love all of you.\u201d",
      "In a later season of \u201cOrganized Crime,\u201d Stabler drunkenly confessed to an old friend that there is a woman he is in love with. While he never shared her name, Benson really was the only person he could\u2019ve been talking about, since he hasn\u2019t seriously dated anyone since Kathy died. She also hasn\u2019t dated anyone since Stabler returned to her life.",
      "The closest Benson came to opening up about her feelings for Stabler was during a chat in Season 24 with friend Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish) after they relaxed with wine for some girl talk during a case.",

      "Season 24 concluded in May with the murder of a man named Carter Mills, who was acquitted in the death of a model. Mills\u2019 DNA on the victim also happened to match evidence from an unsolved 12-year-old case: the murder of ADA Samantha Maroun\u2019s sister, Christina.",
      "After Mills was shot and killed following the acquittal, which came after EADA Nolan Price (Hugh Dancy) didn\u2019t look the other way on a key piece of evidence, the police turned its focus to Maroun.",

      "\u201cI think at the end of the day, I love playing \u2014 finally playing or showing \u2014 a side of Maroun that is maybe a bit more dark and not all out there,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I think that she\u2019s very opinionated and very emotional. And it\u2019s all out there. She doesn\u2019t hide it.",

      "In last season's finale, their boss, District Attorney Nicholas Baxter (Tony Goldwyn), even used a personal story as an example during a conversation with Price about looking the other way on a piece of evidence in a case that may have cleared the suspect \u2014 trying to teach Price, a stickler for following the rules of law, that sometimes it\u2019s OK to be human in the job.",

      "Those consequences are a result of Price sticking to the law. That piece of evidence he turned over was also a personal betrayal to Maroun, as he had to report she tampered with the witness identification process in the case against Mills.",

      "\u201cI feel like it\u2019s surprisingly difficult to step outside of your own, from outside of your own perspective, and see anything a little bit differently. We all think that we\u2019re really open-minded, but actually, we\u2019re mostly blinking,\u201d Dancy says, as Halevi agrees.",
      "Dancy likes that \u201ceverybody gets nudged a little bit out of their comfort zone\u201d in the debut episode and is \u201cforced to look at the law from a slightly (different) angle.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf she did it, I like her. If she didn\u2019t do it, I like her,\u201d she explains. \u201cI think being guilty and being likable \u2026 could go together.\u201d",
      "\u201cCould be compatible,\u201d Dancy says.",

      "In the closing minutes, Price does step outside of his comfort zone and looks at the law differently. He overhears Maroun speaking to Mills\u2019 girlfriend, Julia, a lawyer who stood by his side through his trial and becomes the police\u2019s suspect in the shooting after Maroun is cleared. The girlfriend\u2019s legal team argues Julia killed her boyfriend in advance as an act of self-defense because \u201che was going to kill her that night\u201d and she \u201cdid what she had to do\u201d by killing him first.",
      "Julia later says Mills raped her, which leads Price to tell her and her lawyer they\u2019d accept a guilty plea for man 1, which is also a move Baxter asked Price about: Was he doing this to \u201cplacate\u201d Maroun after the Mills acquittal or because it\u2019s \u201cthe right legal move\u201d?",
      "When Maroun and Julia are left in a moment alone, Maroun says she feels \u201cterrible\u201d about everything and Julia acknowledges she knows what Mills did to Maroun\u2019s sister.",
      "Julia gets emotional and apologizes, saying, \u201cHe thought that he could do whatever he wanted. He thought that he was above the law. That\u2019s why I did what I did. That\u2019s why I waited outside his damn condo, so that I could \u2014\u201d Maroun tells her to stop talking as Price overhears them from outside the room.",
      "Maroun eventually tells Price what Julia said, aware that this would change everything about the case \u2014 just like Price choosing to turn over the evidence in the case against Mills led to an acquittal.",
      "In a scene mirroring his earlier conversation with Baxter, Price asks Maroun what she thinks they should do. Maroun says they could share what she overheard, or they could both pretend not to have heard what Julia said and \u201caccept the damn plea and move on.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust because we can win the case based on a letter of the law, doesn\u2019t mean we need to,\u201d she adds.",
      "Price ultimately agrees, thanking Maroun for \u201cbeing so honest.\u201d",
      "Halevi says she believes her character \u201creally taps into\u201d Price\u2019s heart, which is a sentiment Dancy agrees with, and \u201cmakes him explore the law\u201d from a different angle.",
      "She also sees Maroun as \u201cthe extreme of empathy\u201d and Price as \u201cthe extreme of the letter of the law\u201d and that the two \u201cmeet in the middle.\u201d",
      "The case brings the legal team of Baxter, Price and Maroun together in a way, but also introduces a new sort of dynamic into the group.",
      "\u201cI feel like that\u2019s what happens in real life,\u201d Halevi says. \u201cYou build really strong relationships with the people that challenged the relationship. Then you get disappointed, and you are forced to build trust.\u201d",
      "Goldwyn points out the events of the Mills case created \u201cthis strange tension\u201d between Baxter and Price, that they \u201cboth kind of see the world quite differently.\u201d",
      "Dancy agrees, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a little less resolved between the two of us, because even going back to that story that he told me, which is supposedly a story about his own personal experience. So, it was kind of a human connection, turned out to be a fabrication.",
      "\u201cSo from my perspective, it\u2019s like, \u2018Wait, so you just made something up so that I would cut corners in order to win the case.\u2019\u201d",
      "Goldwyn interjects, \u201cYou don\u2019t know that it was a fabrication.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have good reason to believe it was a fabrication,\u201d Dancy says, as they all laugh."

      "\u201cI was surprised at how brave it is to end each character the way that you chose to,\u201d Gadon told Martin while speaking with TODAY. \u201cYou could have taken a much easier route, but you didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "How does \u2018Wayward\u2019 end?",
      "In the final episode, what\u2019s been a reasonably spooky look at the underbelly of an institution and the weird graduates who now live in Tall Pines veers more deeply into the cult the Academy has created in town, and even some body horror.",
      "Several characters\u2019 endings go unresolved. Does Alex brain his partner on the force Dwayne (Brandon Jay McLaren) with a huge rock? What happens to Laura and Alex\u2019s baby? Was Leila responsible for her sister\u2019s death, or are those false memories Evelyn induces in her? Does Evelyn, whom Alex overdosed with her own drug, survive the watery basement? Does the Academy survive all this? What about the best friends, Leila and Abby?",
      "That last one is tied up with the show\u2019s final scenes, which revolve around Alex and Laura\u2019s baby\u2019s arrival. The girls do get out of the Academy, but the memories about her sister\u2019s death, and her role in it, lead Leila to apparently allow herself to be captured again. What\u2019ll happen to her now remains unclear. But Abby, who had arranged with Alex to use Alex\u2019s car to escape, makes it to the car.",
      "Meanwhile, Alex bursts in on the baby\u2019s birth at the last moment, which is being witnessed by several townspeople. When the baby is born, the little girl is almost immediately passed around the townspeople for skin-on-skin contact with everyone. See, this isn\u2019t just Alex and Laura\u2019s baby \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s everyone\u2019s,\u201d says an exhausted Laura.",
      "Is Alex on board with this cultish, weird world? Yes and no \u2014 because the show provides two endings. In one, Alex waits until Laura is asleep and takes the baby to where Abby is about to drive off with the car. The two leave together, escaping the clutches of Tall Pines.",
      "But wait! Not so fast. What we\u2019ve seen is \u2014 almost certainly \u2014 a possible future. Just as it seems that Alex, Abbie and the newborn are going to run off to a new, more sane world, the scene returns to Alex and Laura\u2019s home. We see Alex looking troubled and uncertain, but he walks to the open front door, and closes it rather than leave. Tall Pines has now acquired a new resident, it seems. But Abby, at least, does get away in the car \u2014 with Alex and Laura\u2019s dog Toast in tow.",
      "\u201cI like people who make bad choices,\u201d Martin told TODAY, \u201cbut I also relate to all of their choices.\u201d"

      "Screening rates jumped almost 20% in the years that followed, with doctors calling it the \"Couric effect.\"",
      "\"It's something that I'm really proud of,\" Couric told TODAY's Craig Melvin and Sheinelle Jones on Thursday. Craig's brother, Lawrence Meadows, died from colon cancer at 43 in 2020.",

      "Couric accompanied Jimmy Kimmel when he underwent his screening in 2018. She and her second husband, John Molner, also got \"his and her colonoscopies,\" Couric said. \"It was very romantic.\""

      "\u201cTo put something out based on purported satellite photography it\u2019s not pertinent in order to create frameworks that are not based in reality. In fact, would it not be easier and much more tangible and verifiable to have inspections in person on the ground?\u201d he added.",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, limited the scope of what Pezeshkian could accomplish during his time in New York when he said in an address on Tuesday that Iran would not talk directly to the U.S. about its nuclear program and would not negotiate on the issue of ballistic missiles or uranium enrichment.",

      "Facing down a mass walkout and mounting diplomatic pressure, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Friday to \u201cfinish the job\u201d as he defied growing isolation over his military\u2019s  devastating assault on the Gaza Strip.",
      "Netanyahu was met by a mix of jeers and applause as he spoke to a half-empty room at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. He instead directed his address to Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, Hamas fighters battling his troops and the host of world leaders who have moved to recognize Palestine as a state.",
      "He reserved praise for President Donald Trump, who told reporters moments after Netanyahu finished his speech: \u201cI think we have maybe a deal on Gaza.\u201d The president, who will meet with his close ally next week, offered little further detail on talks, which have frequently broken down in the past.",
      "The United States has stood by Israel while a growing list of countries have condemned its offensive in the besieged Palestinian territory. Netanyahu also branded as \u201cshameful\u201d the decision by a wave of countries to formally recognize a Palestinian state.",
      "He touted Israel\u2019s military operations across the Middle East and vowed to press ahead with the assault on Gaza.",
      "\u201cThe final remnants of Hamas are holed up in Gaza City,\u201d the Israeli leader said of his military\u2019s ground offensive in the famine-stricken area. \u201cThey vow to repeat the atrocities of Oct. 7 again and again and again. This is why Israel must finish the job.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu added that while \u201cWestern leaders may have buckled under the pressure,\u201d he guaranteed that \u201cIsrael won\u2019t.\u201d",
      "He spoke after scores of delegates walked out of the room as he approached the podium.",
      "Netanyahu said his speech was being broadcast through loudspeakers across Israel\u2019s border with Gaza, in hopes of reaching hostages who remain held in the enclave \u2014 and claimed it was being carried on cellphones of Palestinians across the territory after they were taken over by Israel\u2019s intelligence services.",
      "\u201cWe have not forgotten you, not even for a second. The people of Israel are with you,\u201d Netanyahu said to the hostages, whose families have staged angry protests accusing him of endangering their loved ones by refusing to agree to a peace deal.",
      "In a message to any Hamas members who might see the broadcast, he said, \u201cLay down your arms. Let my people go.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you do, you will live. If you don\u2019t, Israel will hunt you down,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cIt will be a mark of shame on all of you,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu also rejected the growing condemnation of Israel, which sees his country facing the allegation of genocide before the International Court of Justice as well as from a growing number of experts and rights groups.",
      "In a sign of that isolation the Israeli leader took an unusual route to New York, with his flight path appearing to avoid countries that could enforce an international arrest warrant against him for alleged war crimes in Gaza.",
      "Israeli forces have ramped up their assault on Gaza City, forcing the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people while others stay put under near-daily deadly strikes.",
      "In response countries including France and the United Kingdom have formally recognized Palestine as a state, leading Trump to issue a firm warning.",
      "\u201cI will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. No, I will not allow it. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Trump told reporters Thursday, having earlier privately assured Arab leaders on the subject.",
      "Asked whether he had discussed the issue with Netanyahu, Trump said, \u201cWhether I spoke to him or not, I did, but I\u2019m not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s been enough. It\u2019s time to stop now,\" he said.",
      "Trump issued the rare admonishment after far-right members of Netanyahu's fragile government coalition called for the move.",
      "Palestinians envision the West Bank as a key territory for an internationally recognized state, alongside Gaza and east Jerusalem. Annexation of the territory, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967, would further imperil that cause.",
      "Trump also presented his 21-point plan for peace to Arab leaders, with his special envoy Steve Witkoff saying the meeting was \u201cproductive\" and that a breakthrough could be imminent.",
      "Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, is looking to play a senior role in running postwar Gaza under a peace plan, the Financial Times newspaper reported.",
      "Blair's office declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was among the leaders to address the U.N. General Assembly, though he was forced to deliver his address by video after the U.S. last month revoked his visa, along with those of other Palestinian Authority officials.",

      "With a series of unprecedented Russian incursions into NATO countries\u2019 airspace setting off alarm bells throughout Europe, the nuclear-powered carrier has been launching squadron after squadron of fighter jets as part of a multinational operation known as Neptune Strike.",
      "Two NATO officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive operational matters, told NBC News that the jets were taking off for assignments somewhere in Eastern Europe, where tensions have been high after a spate of Russian incursions.",
      "Nerves jangled further on Wednesday when German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told his country\u2019s parliament, the Bundestag, that Russia continued to test the line and overflew a German warship in recent days.",
      "A German military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not allowed to publicly discuss sensitive military matters, confirmed that Russian jets flew close to the frigate called Hamburg. He added that the ship, which is currently operating in the Baltic Sea, was taking part in Neptune Strike, among other things.",
      "The flyby came two days after NATO met to discuss Russia\u2019s recent violation of Estonian airspace with three MiG-31 fighter aircraft. The meeting was convened after Estonia requested consultations under Article 4, a mechanism that prompts urgent talks among allies.",
      "Earlier this month, there was also widespread anger after a number of Russian drones entered Polish airspace during an attack on Ukraine, where President Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces have been at war for more than three and a half  years. A drone also reportedly entered Romanian airspace.",
      "The U.S. and its allies have been weighing a tougher response toward the Kremlin; NATO leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week condemned the Kremlin for a spate of \u201cescalatory\u201d incidents and vowed to defend the alliance.",
      "President Donald Trump also said Tuesday that NATO countries should shoot down Russian military aircraft if they enter their airspace as he met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Pressed on whether the U.S. would back up NATO allies in such a situation, Trump said \u201cit depends on the circumstance.\u201d",
      "Heading to a summit with Putin in Alaska last month, Trump said he wanted a ceasefire. Since then, Moscow has expanded its drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, while seemingly ignoring his overtures for further dialogue to end the conflict.",
      "Meanwhile, out at sea, the level of military cooperation seems unimpeded by political currents, as the Ford takes part in Neptune Strike. NATO has said it is not a military exercise, instead calling it an \u201cenhanced vigilance activity.\u201d",
      "On the Ford, it was all-systems-go as squadron after squadron of F-18 fighter jets took off and landed within minutes of each other. The pace on the flight deck was frenetic aboard the nuclear-powered ship, which weighs around 100,000 tons and has a crew of between 4,500 and 4,700.",
      "No ship in the U.S. fleet can launch more jets faster. The dramatic thump of the ship\u2019s four electromagnetic catapults which shoot them into the sky is constant and can be heard throughout the ship.",
      "\u201cSeveral of those aircraft are going a long distance to drop live weapons on a close air support range that is to the northeast of here,\u201d the Ford carrier strike group commander, Rear Adm. Paul Lanzilotta, said after a squadron took off.",
      "The purpose of the \u201cactivity\u201d is to demonstrate large-scale coordination in multiple theaters, NATO says. It has been run several times a year since it started in 2020.",
      "Lanzilotta also stressed that this week\u2019s maneuvers were not a response to recent events in Eastern Europe, but had been planned long in advance. This is part of the core message that NATO intends to send, he said.",

      "These Western powers may be hoping to breathe new life into the idea as a way to resolve the conflict, but Israel's hard-line government has instead vowed to retaliate while pressing ahead with its deadly assault on Gaza City that has forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon said both Israel and the U.S. would boycott Monday's summit, branding it a \"circus.\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decried the moves as a \"huge reward to terrorism\" and vowed there \"will be no Palestinian state.\"",

      "Palestinian statehood, which would see an internationally recognized state in territories seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War, is now formally recognized by around 75% of U.N. member countries. But that recognition remains largely symbolic.",
      "Gershon Baskin, an Israeli who has acted as a mediator with Hamas for decades and a staunch advocate of a two-state solution, said that he welcomed the growing recognition. But without further action, including sanctions against Israel, he said the move will do little to \"change the lives of Palestinians\" on the ground.",
      "\"It's really a step in the right direction,\" Baskin said in a phone interview Monday of the summit at the General Assembly. But, calling Israel's offensive in Gaza \"a genocide,\" he said, \"the most important thing now ... is to end the war in Gaza and that comes before everything else.\"",
      "It is unclear how effective Monday\u2019s summit will be in advancing efforts to end the war in the face of furious opposition from Israel and the U.S., which blocked Palestinian officials from even attending the U.N. gathering.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday handed another win to the Trump administration by allowing it to withhold $4 billion in spending on foreign aid that was appropriated by Congress.",
      "A federal judge had ruled that the administration would have to spend the funds by the end of the month, but the Supreme Court's decision puts that on hold.",
      "\u201cThis result further erodes separation of powers principles that are fundamental to our constitutional order. It will also have a grave humanitarian impact,\" said Nicolas Sansome, a lawyer with Public Citizen Litigation Group, which represents nonprofit groups that sued.",
      "The brief order noted that the government has made a \"sufficient showing\" that the groups that sued were barred from bringing the lawsuit in question under a law called the Impoundment Control Act.",
      "The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, also noted that \"the asserted harms to the Executive\u2019s conduct of foreign affairs appear to outweigh the potential harm\" to the plaintiffs, which are various groups that receive foreign aid funds.",
      "The court has now granted 20 emergency applications filed by the administration since President Donald Trump\u2019s second term began in January. The volume of emergency filings and the rate at which the court has ruled in the administration's favor are both unprecedented. The latter has sparked criticism from within the legal community, including lower court judges.",
      "A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.",
      "The three liberals on the court dissented, with Justice Elena Kagan writing that the legal issue in the case has not been presented before, meaning the court was working in \"uncharted territory.\"",
      "Yet again, the majority nevertheless granted the emergency request made by the government without hearing oral arguments or issuing a fully reasoned decision, she added.",
      "\"We therefore should have denied this application, allowed the lower courts to go forward, and ensured that the weighty question presented here receives the consideration it deserves,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts had on Sept. 9 issued a temporary stay that put the lower court ruling on hold while the Supreme Court decided what next steps to take.",
      "The Trump administration, which has aggressively sought to exert its power over Congress in recent months, has notified lawmakers of its intention not to spend the funds.",
      "This action has sparked a debate over whether the president has such authority, as under the Constitution, it is the role of Congress to allocate money for the president to spend.",
      "After the Supreme Court decision, Democrats quickly urged Congress to reassert its authority to control spending even as lawmakers are engaged in a budget fight that could lead to a government shutdown.",
      "\"Republicans should join Democrats to stand up for our power of the purse,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wa. and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. said in a joint statement.",
      "The Trump administration has already taken swift action to unravel the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government department that traditionally handed out billions of dollars a year in foreign aid to tackle such issues as access to water and disease prevention.",
      "The money at issue was appropriated by Congress for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. The Trump administration has said it wants to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid, but will spend another $6.5 billion that Congress appropriated.",
      "The Impoundment Control Act was passed in 1974 to regulate the president\u2019s control over the budget. That followed efforts by then-President Richard Nixon to withhold spending on programs he did not support.",
      "The Trump administration says it can withhold the money via a process known as \"rescission,\" in which the president informs Congress of his intention not to spend certain funds.",
      "But with little time left before the funds expire, Congress is unlikely to respond, even if it wanted to. Republicans who broadly support Trump's policies control both chambers and are in the process of trying to fund the government for the next fiscal year before Oct. 1; otherwise, the government will shut down.",
      "The administration's decision to wait until the end of the fiscal year to notify Congress is a legally questionable tactic that has been called a \"pocket rescission\" and has not been used in nearly 50 years.",
      "Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali had ruled on Sept. 3 that the administration must spend the money unless Congress acts to withdraw it.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in a court filing that Ali's ruling imposed unacceptable restrictions on the president by, among other things, forcing the administration to engage in diplomatic discussions with other countries over how to spend the money",
      "The underlying lawsuit challenging Trump's rescission was brought by various groups led by the Global Health Council.",
      "Their lawyers said in court papers that the administration's legal arguments would turn the Impoundment Control Act on its head by reaching the conclusion that \"Congress\u2019s signature law meant to control impoundments actually provided the President vast new powers to impound funds, and made it virtually impossible to challenge impoundments in court.\""

      "\u201cWords cannot describe the depth of loss that I am feeling at this time. I want to thank you for your loving prayers,\u201d her daughter Kakuya Shakur wrote in a Facebook post.",
      "Shakur was involved in a shootout during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1973. State Trooper Werner Foerster, the second officer responding to the scene, found a loaded gun on the driver of the car, according to previous NBC News reporting. Shakur was in the front passenger seat and another man was seated behind her.",
      "There was an exchange of gunfire. James Harper, the state trooper who initially pulled the group over, said he saw Shakur shoot Foerster in the stomach with the officer's gun after he tussled with the driver, who also shot Foerster in the arm.",
      "Shakur and two men she was with returned to the car and drove five miles down the New Jersey Turnpike. One of the men with them, James Coston, died in the car. As they dumped Coston's body on the side of the road, police caught up to the group. Shakur was arrested while the driver fled and was found nearly two days later.",
      "Shakur, who was sentenced to life in prison, denied shooting Foerster. To supporters, she was an activist jailed for crimes she did not commit.",
      "In a statement, Foerster's family said her death did not bring any joy to them, but did bring \"a measure of closure to a tragedy that has deeply affected our family and community.\"",
      "\"While this development marks the end of a long and painful chapter, it does not erase the profound loss we continue to feel each day,\" the family said. \"The pain of losing Werner is something we carry every single day. His absence is felt in every quiet moment, every family gathering, and every milestone he should have been here to witness.\"",
      "Shakur was born Joanne Deborah Byron in Queens, New York, on July 16, 1947. After what she described in her autobiography as a troubled childhood, she became involved in political activism at the Borough of Manhattan Community College and City College of New York. She was a member of the revolutionary Black Liberation Army, as well as the Black Panther Party. At 21, she married Louis Chesimard, though their marriage lasted only a year.",
      "Shakur was serving a life sentence at the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey after being convicted in 1977 of murder in Foerster's death. She had also been implicated in armed robbery and other crimes. She escaped from prison on Nov. 2, 1979, with the help of members of the Black Liberation Army who posed as visitors. She turned up a few years later in Cuba, where the island\u2019s leader at the time, Fidel Castro, granted her political asylum. She published an autobiography in 1987.",
      "Because Cuba repeatedly refused to extradite her to the U.S., Shakur and other fugitives living in Cuba became a major sticking point in negotiations between the U.S. and the communist-run island after President Barack Obama re-established diplomatic relations between the two countries.",
      "Then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Shakur should be returned to New Jersey after the ceremonial reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Cuba in 2015.",
      "Gov. Phil Murphy and state Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan said in a statement Friday that their offices have worked with the State Department in previous attempts to bring Shakur back to New Jersey to face accountability for Foerster's killing and for fleeing the country.",
      "\"We will vigorously oppose any attempt to repatriate Chesimard's remains to the United States,\" they wrote.",
      "Shakur became the first woman on the FBI\u2019s list of most wanted terrorists in 2013. She was added to the list on the anniversary of Foerster\u2019s death. There was a $2 million reward for information leading to her arrest.",
      "Supporters of Shakur, who was rapper Tupac Shakur's godmother through her brother Mutulu Shakur, believed she was a target of law enforcement for her involvement with the Black Liberation Army.",
      "In a 1998 interview with NBC New York in Havana, Shakur said she had never killed anyone and was found guilty in an \u201cunfair trial\u201d by an all-white jury.",
      "\u201cI was shot with my arms in the air, then shot again in the back and left on the ground to die,\u201d she said. \u201cNext thing I knew, they were coming by me and saying, \u2018Is she dead yet, is she dead yet?\u2019\u201d",
      "She said she was later taken to a hospital, where she was beaten and tortured by state troopers who she said would stick their hands in her wounds and ask if it hurt.",
      "\u201cAmerican racism has done to another Black person what it has done to Black people down through the years,\u201d Shakur\u2019s defense attorney William Kunstler said in 1977. \u201cThe reality is, this beautiful young Black woman never had a chance, but we, like liberal fools, still had hopes.\u201d"

      "North Korea is close to developing an intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the United States with a nuclear weapon, South Korea\u2019s president said Thursday \u2014 though he added that it has yet to master the last, crucial step.",
      "North Korea has been ramping up its missile testing since talks between President Donald Trump and leader Kim Jong Un collapsed in 2019 amid disagreements over U.S.-led sanctions on the isolated state. Trump has said repeatedly since returning to office that he would like to resume diplomacy with Kim.",
      "Speaking in New York on Thursday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said North Korea appears to already have enough nuclear weapons for \u201cregime survival,\u201d and that it continues to produce nuclear material and develop ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the continental U.S.",
      "\u201cIt seems not to have succeeded yet, but only one final step remains \u2014 so-called atmospheric re-entry technology,\u201d Lee said at an investment summit at the New York Stock Exchange. \u201cThat, too, is likely to be solved soon.\u201d",
      "If the status quo is allowed to continue, North Korea will add roughly 15 to 20 nuclear warheads each year, Lee said, and its ICBM technology will advance to the point where it has more warheads than it needs to defend itself.",
      "\u201cWhat then of the excess? The concern is that they will export them,\u201d he said.",
      "Lee reiterated a proposal he made in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, calling for a phased solution to the North Korean nuclear issue that recognizes that denuclearization is not going to be achieved in the near future.",
      "Instead, he said, the goal should be for North Korea to first freeze its nuclear weapons program, then reduce it and ultimately dismantle it.",
      "Achieving this will require Kim to negotiate with someone he trusts, and Trump \u201cis uniquely positioned to be that counterpart,\u201d Lee said.",
      "\u201cIf peace can be forged on the world\u2019s last divided peninsula, it will be a truly world-historical achievement in peacebuilding \u2014 a genuine peacemaker\u2019s accomplishment,\u201d he said.",
      "North Korea has made significant advances in its nuclear and ballistic missile programs in the absence of talks.",
      "Last year, it tested its biggest ICBM yet, the Hwasong-19, which experts say could reach anywhere in the U.S. \u2014 although they are skeptical that North Korea has the ability to guide the missile and protect a nuclear warhead as it re-enters the atmosphere.",
      "Kim has also deepened his country\u2019s military cooperation with Russia, sending artillery and thousands of troops to support President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "The North Korean regime now says the U.S. and others have no choice but to accept it as a nuclear weapons state.",
      "On Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister Chung Dong-young said North Korea was operating a total of four uranium enrichment facilities, including the only declared site at Yongbyon, about 60 miles north of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.",
      "Chung also said North Korea appeared to have sharply increased its stockpile of highly enriched uranium for use in building nuclear weapons.",
      "Kim said Sunday that while he had \u201cgood personal memories\u201d of his meetings with Trump, there was no reason to resume talks unless the U.S. \u201cabandons its delusional obsession with denuclearization.\u201d",
      "He has also dismissed Lee\u2019s overtures toward peace, including the   suspension of propaganda leaflet drops from the air and loudspeaker broadcasts along the border between the two Koreas, which technically remain at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty.",
      "Lee\u2019s phased solution of exchange, normalization and denuclearization \u2014 known as \u201cEND\u201d \u2014 is a clear departure from the international community\u2019s previous approach of \u201cdenuclearization first,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, distinguished chair professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, South Korea.",
      "His proposal is \u201cthe last meaningful attempt at peace under the current circumstances,\u201d Yang said in a text message to NBC News.",
      "It comes after a White House meeting between Lee and Trump last month that was generally considered successful, with Trump telling reporters he would like to meet with Kim this year.",
      "\u201cThe chemistry between President Trump and President Lee could create the most favorable conditions for North Korea to come to the negotiating table and engage in rational dialogue,\u201d Yang said."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he would not let Israel annex the occupied West Bank.",
      "\"I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. No, I will not allow it. It\u2019s not going to happen,\" Trump told reporters in a press gaggle.",
      "Asked whether he had discussed the issue with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump replied, \"Whether I spoke to him or not, I did, but I\u2019m not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank. There\u2019s been enough. It\u2019s time to stop now.\"",
      "Before the public statement about the issue, Trump had previously assured Arab leaders that he will not allow Israel to annex the already occupied West Bank, sources told NBC News, amid fears of retaliation from the U.S. ally after a host of countries moved to recognize Palestinian statehood.",
      "Trump made the earlier comments on Tuesday, according to two sources who were in the room, as he presented his 21-point plan for peace in the Middle East to Arab leaders gathered in New York for the United Nations General Assembly. The comments were first reported by Politico.",
      "Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff said the meeting with leaders from countries including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Egypt and Turkey was \u201cproductive.\u201d He said a breakthrough could be imminent in efforts to bring an end to the war in the Gaza Strip, where Israel has continued a deadly military campaign to take over Gaza City.",
      "\u201cWe presented what we call the Trump 21-point plan for peace in the Mideast, in Gaza,\u201d Witkoff said at the Concordia Annual Summit, a conference on the sidelines of the General Assembly.",
      "\u201cI think it addresses Israeli concerns, as well as the concerns of all the neighbors in the region. And we\u2019re hopeful, and I might say even confident, that in the coming days, we\u2019ll be able to announce some sort of breakthrough,\u201d he added.",
      "It was not immediately clear what advances might have been made, with past promises of progress in talks failing to yield a deal to end Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza and see hostages still held in the enclave released.",
      "The spiraling conflict in the Middle East has been a focal point of the General Assembly this week, with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas addressed the gathering Thursday, albeit by video after the U.S. last month revoked his visa, along with those of other Palestinian Authority officials.",
      "Palestinians in Gaza \u201chave been facing a war of genocide, destruction, starvation and displacement\u201d by Israel, he said, although he added that Palestinians rejected Hamas' terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023 and that action did not represent their people.",
      "Laying out his vision for what government would look like once the war was over, Abbas said Hamas would have \"no role to play in governance\" in Gaza. Abbas, as the head of the Palestinian Authority, has been at odds with Hamas since the Islamist militants won municipal elections and forced their more moderate rivals out of Gaza in 2007.",
      "The Palestinian Authority, which partly controls the occupied West Bank, was \u201cready to bear full responsibility for governance and security\u201d in the enclave, Abbas said.",
      "Speaking with Gulf foreign ministers Wednesday during the assembly, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: \u201cWe understand very clearly that the situation in Gaza, the situation with Israel and Gaza, is a key concern for everyone in this room here today.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe want this conflict to end,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want it to end immediately.\u201d",
      "Rubio added that \u201csome very important work is ongoing, even as we speak, and hoping to achieve this as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s assurances to Arab leaders that he would not let Israel annex the West Bank came after right-wing members of Netanyahu\u2019s fragile government coalition called for the move as a string of countries, including France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Portugal formally recognized Palestine as a state.",
      "Palestinians envision the West Bank as a core territory for an internationally recognized Palestinian state, alongside Gaza and east Jerusalem. Annexation of the territory, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967, would further imperil that cause.",
      "Netanyahu, who was traveling to New York on Thursday before addressing the General Assembly on Friday and meeting Trump next week, has declared that there will never be a Palestinian state under his watch.",
      "Trump told the U.N. this week that the recognition moves risked rewarding Hamas.",
      "Israel has already pushed ahead with a widely condemned settlement plan that would effectively split the West Bank in two, further fracturing what Palestinians envision as their future state.",
      "Deadly settler violence and Israeli military operations have also increased in the Palestinian territory.",
      "UAE leaders have said annexation of the West Bank would be a red line for the influential Gulf state, blocking any future recognition of Israel and preventing the completion of Trump\u2019s landmark Abraham Accords that sought to establish diplomatic normalization between Israel and several Arab states."

    "story": [
      "Microsoft has cut off some services to a unit in Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry after investigating allegations that it was using Microsoft cloud products for the mass surveillance of Palestinians.",
      "In a blog post published Thursday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said the move came after reviewing an Aug. 6 report from The Guardian that said an Israel Defense Forces intelligence unit had used the company\u2019s Azure storage service to collect and store recordings of Palestinian civilians\u2019 phone calls.",
      "Azure is Microsoft\u2019s primary cloud-computing service, with millions of monthly active users around the globe. However, the Guardian \u2014 citing interviews with 11 sources, including at Microsoft and among Israeli intelligence officials \u2014 alleged that the unit had access to \u201ca customised and segregated area\u201d within Azure\u2019s cloud platform.",
      "Smith did not directly corroborate that assertion but said the company\u2019s review had found evidence that \u201csupports elements of the Guardian\u2019s reporting,\u201d including the use of Azure storage capacity in the Netherlands and of certain artificial intelligence services. Smith did not provide additional details.",
      "Microsoft has since informed Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry, which oversees the IDF and its intelligence units, that it was disabling the unit\u2019s ability to use parts of Azure\u2019s cloud storage service. Microsoft did not name the unit it was targeting in its action, but The Guardian report was centered on Unit 8200, seen as Israel\u2019s equivalent to the U.S. National Security Agency. NBC News has not confirmed that report.",
      "\u201cWe do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades.\u201d",
      "Smith said Microsoft would continue other work designed to \u201cprotect the cybersecurity of Israel and other countries in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry said it had no comment. In response to The Guardian\u2019s August report, an Israeli official first said its work with companies such as Microsoft was based on \u201clegally supervised agreements,\u201d but then later stated that \u201cMicrosoft is not and has not been working with the IDF on the storage or processing of data.\u201d",
      "The Guardian article was the latest in a yearslong series of media reports alleging that the IDF has been using software products created by U.S. tech giants, including Microsoft, in its war in the Gaza Strip. The reports have led to internal protests by Microsoft employees, some of whom have subsequently been terminated, according to documents reviewed by CNBC. Late last month, Microsoft said it asked police to remove people it said had improperly entered its headquarters as part of a protest action.",
      "Microsoft has said it doesn\u2019t retaliate against employees who express their views but would respond to anyone deemed to have made threats.",
      "The reports about the use of Microsoft products by Israel\u2019s military have helped fuel a protest group, No Tech for Apartheid, created in 2021, aimed at pressuring Silicon Valley businesses to cut ties with Israel. The group includes a Microsoft-focused offshoot, No Azure for Apartheid, that has focused on the Redmond, Washington-based corporation.",
      "In a statement, a representative for No Azure for Apartheid celebrated the announcement, calling it \u201csignificant and unprecedented,\u201d but noting that \u201cMicrosoft has only disabled a small subset of services to only one unit in the Israeli military. The vast majority of Microsoft\u2019s contract with the Israeli military remains intact.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign in response to Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks \u2014 which it has said killed approximately 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals and led to some 251 hostages being taken \u2014 has killed nearly 65,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials."

      "One of the biggest subjects of censorship is homosexuality, which despite being decriminalized in China has been the target of a government crackdown in recent years, even though surveys shows the public is increasingly supportive of LGBTQ people.",
      "In 2021, Chinese authorities banned \u201ceffeminate\u201d behavior from screens, and fans complained in 2022 when they noticed the removal of an LGBTQ storyline from the TV sitcom \u201cFriends,\u201d which is highly popular in China. At least 10 scenes with gay references were also dropped from the Chinese version of the 2018 biopic \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d about the rock musician and Queen frontman Freddie Mercury.",

      "LONDON \u2014 The mayor of London has labeled Donald Trump \"racist, sexist and Islamophobic\" after the president used a United Nations General Assembly address to call him a \"terrible mayor\" and falsely claim the city wanted to be governed by Islamic law.",
      "\"I think Donald Trump has shown he is racist, he is sexist, he is misogynistic and he's Islamophobic,\" Sadiq Khan told reporters Wednesday.",
      "The pair have traded many barbed comments since Khan was elected to lead London in 2016 \u2014 Khan strongly criticized the president the same year for pledging a travel ban on a number of majority-Muslim countries, which was enacted in 2017. Trump called the Londoner and former member of Parliament \"a nasty person\" in a July news conference.",
      "\"I think people are wondering what it is about this Muslim mayor who leads a liberal, multicultural, progressive, successful city that means I appear to be living in Donald Trump's head, rent free,\" Khan said.",
      "Trump used a section of his speech to the U.N on Tuesday to take swipes at various member states and the institution itself.",
      "\"I look at London, where you have a terrible mayor, terrible, terrible mayor, and it's been changed, it's been so changed,\" he said. \"Now they want to go to Sharia law. But you are in a different country, you can't do that.\"",
      "Initially, Khan's team at City Hall released a statement saying: \"We are not going to dignify his appalling and bigoted comments with a response.\"",
      "But Wednesday, speaking from the top deck of a London bus, Khan said he was thankful for the \"record numbers of Americans\" coming to live in London, which he said was the highest since records began. \"There must be a reason for that,\" he said.",
      "Khan's pointed criticism was in contrast to the approach taken by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Last week saw King Charles III and Starmer welcome Trump and first lady Melania Trump for a lavish state visit \u2014 an unprecedented second official trip to Britain for a sitting president.",
      "Particularly after Trump launched a global trade war, with tariffs impacting scores of close allies including the United Kingdom, very few world officials have seemed willing to so openly criticize the president or his policies.",
      "Asked whether Britain should be extending such friendship to Trump, Khan said: \"If you have a best friend, you should expect more from them \u2014 it's very different to an acquaintance or somebody who's a distant friend.\"",
      "While he said the U.K. and the U.S. have important economic and military ties, Khan said such a relationship should mean one side has the confidence to call out the other. \"I think that President Trump is wrong in many, many ways,\" he said.",
      "Davis Ingle, a spokesman for the White House, said in a statement: \u201cMayor Khan clearly suffers from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome and has done a terrible job as mayor. His ridiculous open border and unchecked immigration policies have allowed violent crime to run rampant in his city.\u201d",
      "Khan, who represents Britain's Labour Party and is characterized as being on the center-left, social democratic wing of the party, won a third third term in office in 2024.",
      "The prevalence of Sharia law in the U.K. features in many right-wing conspiracy theories about the role of Muslims in the country, often partnered with the similarly false assertion that parts of big cities are dangerous \"no-go areas\" for non-Muslims.",
      "In reality, there are Sharia councils, which base decisions on traditional Muslim beliefs and religious texts, but they have no legal jurisdiction \u2014 as a government review found in 2018.",
      "Anger persists over the president's comments about London: Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour lawmaker who now represents Khan's old constituency in south London, has called for the U.S. ambassador to the U.K. to be summoned over the remarks."

    "summary": "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian lashed out at the U.S and Israel for their June attacks at a speech in the U.N. after the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ruled out talks with President Donald Trump one day earlier.",
    "story": [
      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian lashed out at the U.S and Israel for their attacks in June during a speech at the United Nations on Wednesday, one day after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the country, ruled out talks with President Donald Trump about Iran's nuclear program.",
      "\u201cThe aerial assaults of [Israel] and the United States of America against Iran\u2019s cities, homes and infrastructure, precisely at a time when we were treading the path of diplomatic negotiations, constituted a grave betrayal of diplomacy and a subversion of efforts towards the establishment of stability and peace,\u201d he said.",
      "At the podium, Pezeshkian held up a book with the words \u201cKilled By Israel\u201d printed on the front and leafed through pages with pictures of families and children.",
      "There have been calls among moderates in Iran for direct talks with Trump, but on Tuesday Khamenei rejected negotiations with the U.S. about the country's nuclear program and in many ways set the parameters of what Pezeshkian could discuss in New York.",
      "\u201cIn my view, negotiating with America about the nuclear issue and maybe other issues is an absolute dead end,\u201d Khamenei said in an address, adding that Iran would not stop uranium enrichment because it would not be acceptable to the people of the country, according to his official website.",
      "He added, \u201cThis negotiation will be beneficial for the current American president. He will hold his head high, say I threatened Iran and I brought them to the negotiating table. He will be proud of this in the world. But for us it\u2019s an absolute loss and has no benefit.\u201d",
      "Khamenei also said on Tuesday that Iran does not intend to build a nuclear weapon, a point that Pezeshkian highlighted in his speech Wednesday, and that it will not negotiate on its ballistic missile program.",
      "But a White House official told NBC News on Wednesday that the U.S. is still open to talks with Iran. \u201cIran continues to defy its nuclear commitments. The United States is fully coordinated with our E3 partners and stands firm in holding Iran accountable,\u201d the official said. The E3 is a reference to Britain, France and Germany.",
      "The official added, \u201cAt the same time, the United States remains available for direct engagement with Iran \u2014 in furtherance of a peaceful, enduring resolution to the Iran nuclear issue.\u201d",
      "Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said Wednesday that Iran is in a tough position and that the administration wants to negotiate with it, according to Reuters.",
      "\"We're talking to them,\" Witkoff said when asked if there is a diplomatic path forward with Iran.",
      "But the hard line drawn by Khamenei against talks with Trump about the nuclear issue could significantly ramp up tensions with the U.S. and Israel.",
      "The value of the Iranian rial against the U.S. dollar hit a record low Wednesday after Khamenei\u2019s remarks.",
      "Moderate voices in Iran pushing for direct talks with the U.S. were hoping to stave off more devastating attacks on the country by either the Israeli or U.S. military, which pummeled the Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites in late June with airstrikes, including the first combat use of massive \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs.",
      "Trump, addressing the United Nations on Tuesday, said the attacks had targeted \u201cIran\u2019s key nuclear facility, totally obliterating everything.\u201d But analysts have raised questions about the extent of the damage caused by the attacks and the whereabouts of the approximately 880 pounds of enriched uranium that Iran is thought to have produced.",
      "The Israeli attacks, which Israeli officials said were intended to stop the Islamic Republic from obtaining a nuclear weapon, also hammered nuclear targets but expanded to include energy infrastructure and even the country's notorious Evin prison, and killed more than 1,000 people, according to state media.",
      "Even if Iran does not talk to the U.S. directly, Pezeshkian and his foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, only have until Sep. 27 to negotiate a diplomatic solution with Britain, France and Germany before they face a \u201csnapback\u201d of sanctions. Negotiated under the 2015 nuclear deal, the snapback would lead to an arms embargo, freezing of assets outside the country and restrictions on enriching uranium, among other penalties.",
      "The sanctions could hit at a time when the country is reeling from an economic crisis, which critics blame on current sanctions as well as corruption and mismanagement.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron met with Pezeshkian on the sidelines of the U.N. meeting in New York on Wednesday and posted on X that a diplomatic solution to avoid snapback could still be reached if Iran allows full access to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, is transparent about its stockpile of enriched materials and resumes negotiations.",
      "\"An agreement remains possible. Only a few hours are left,\" Macron wrote. \"It is up to Iran to respond to the legitimate conditions we have set.\"",
      "After meeting with Macron, Pezeshkian also said that an agreement is possible in a post on X.",
      "\"If there is a commitment to fairness and what is right and ensuring the interests of both sides then a definite solution is within reach,\" he wrote.",
      "In recent months, Pezeshkian has been fighting for his political, and actual, life. He narrowly escaped an Israeli attack on a meeting of top officials in June, and his conservative critics have pressed him hard on the economy as well as restrictions on social freedoms.",
      "Security forces kicked off a massive crackdown during and after the war. The crackdown was ostensibly to ferret out spies, but in many cases the security forces used the war as a pretext to detain ethnic and religious minorities as well as Afghan migrants, according to Amnesty International. A police spokesman said in mid-August that 21,000 people had been arrested in the 12-day period of the war and observers say that more arrests have subsequently taken place and pending executions have been expedited.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re targeting already marginalized groups even further, and that\u2019s one way for them to exert and show the control that they have and try to retain their power while also instilling fear in the population,\u201d said Nassim Papayianni, an Iran campaigner at Amnesty International. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about scapegoating. So essentially they are trying to use the conflict as a way to ramp up the crackdown and the arrests.\u201d",
      "With Pezeshkian\u2019s hands tied on the international stage by the supreme leader and his hard-line opponents pressing a crackdown on real and perceived enemies at home, the Iranian president appears more isolated than at any point since assuming his position last year."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is suddenly bullish when it comes to Ukraine\u2019s chances of repelling Russia\u2019s invasion and regaining all its territory, yet the shift in rhetoric means little unless he is prepared to ramp up pressure on the Kremlin, diplomats and foreign officials say.",
      "Thus far, Trump hasn\u2019t taken these essential steps, they added.",
      "Trump\u2019s social media post Tuesday upended the conventional thinking about his view of the war, now in its fourth year. Back in February, he told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he didn\u2019t have the \u201ccards\u201d in a peace negotiation and that his country was in \u201cbig trouble.\u201d",
      "Now, Trump says that Russia is the one that is in \u201cbig economic trouble\u201d and that its failure to swiftly conquer its smaller neighbor has revealed it to be a \u201cpaper tiger.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia Military and Economic situation and, after seeing the Economic trouble it is causing Russia, I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,\u201d he wrote in his post Tuesday.",
      "\u201cRussia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win,\u201d Trump added. \u201cThis is not distinguishing Russia.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s aim in releasing the statement was to exert \u201cmaximum public pressure on Russia to get them to the table for a deal\u201d to end the war, according to a senior Trump administration official.",
      "Next steps will depend on how Russia responds, said the official, who did not lay out any specific policy changes happening now.",
      "There are different ways to construe Trump\u2019s statement. One is that he\u2019s grown tired of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s persistence in shelling Ukraine and is prepared to step up coercive measures aimed at getting Russia to pull back.",
      "\u201cTrump concluded Putin is not interested in peace,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump confidant, said in an interview Wednesday. Calling Trump\u2019s post and his speech to the United Nations General Assembly a \u201cgame-changer,\u201d Graham added, \u201cThere was a belief in Moscow that Trump is on their side, but the president made it clear that Ukraine will have all it needs as long as it needs.\u201d"

      "Organizers of a flotilla carrying aid for Gaza have reported explosions near their boats and seeing multiple drones around the fleet, which is made up of more than 500 people, including prominent environmental activist Greta Thunberg.",
      "Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which was sailing near Greece early Wednesday, according its online tracker, also had its communications \u201cjammed,\u201d its organizers said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe are witnessing these psychological operations first-hand, right now, but we will not be intimidated,\u201d they added. \u201cSumud\u201d in Arabic means \u201csteadfastness\u201d or \u201csteadfast perseverance.\u201d",
      "\"The international waters felt like a battlefield,\" human rights activist Yasemin Acar, who is onboard the Alma vessel as part of the flotilla, told NBC News in a video call Wednesday, describing the overnight ordeal. \"There were bombs after bombs ... and no one came to help.\"",
      "In an online video GSF shared overnight, a bright light can be seen piercing the darkness, before a loud blast rings out. Organizers said that the video was recorded from one of its boats, Spectre, and that it captured one of the explosions heard by crew members.",
      "In a separate video posted by Acar, music from the pop group ABBA, whose members, like Thunberg, hail from Sweden, can be heard ringing out.",
      "\"They started jamming our comms by playing ABBA songs, you know, to interfere with our radio,\" Acar said, adding that the crew \"couldn't even reach the Coast Guard\" because of the apparent interference.",
      "\u201cIt was horrific that this can happen in international waters, close to Greece. I mean, in Europe,\" she said.",
      "Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto condemned the incident Wednesday, saying he had directed a navy ship to offer assistance, Reuters reported. Acar confirmed Italy had offered assistance and was expected to \"safeguard\" the flotilla during at least part of its journey.",
      "Israel\u2019s military and a spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry condemned the flotilla Monday. Without providing evidence, Oren Marmorstein, a spokesperson for the ministry, said on X it was \u201corganized by Hamas\u201d and \u201cintended to serve Hamas.\u201d",
      "He added that Israel would not allow the flotilla to \u201center an active combat zone and will not allow the breach of a lawful naval blockade.\u201d",
      "Marmorstein also called for the flotilla to dock at Israel\u2019s Ashkelon Marina and unload aid there for it to be transferred to Gaza.",
      "But GSF has argued that Israel is violating international law in Gaza, rendering its blockade illegal.",
      "The flotilla, which is carrying more than 500 people from more than 40 countries, set sail from Barcelona late last month in a bid to \u201cbreak the illegal siege of Gaza.\u201d",
      "Gaza has been under an Israeli naval blockade since 2007, when Hamas took power.",
      "GSF said this month that two of its boats had been attacked by drones while it was stationed in Tunisia.",
      "The Tunisian Interior Ministry said at the time that reports that a drone hit a boat at its Sidi Bou Said port had \u201cno basis in truth\u201d and that a fire broke out on the vessel itself, according to Reuters.",
      "Israeli forces continue their devastating assault on Gaza City, where scores of people have been killed in recent days and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. Deaths from starvation have also continued to rise, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led attacks in 2023, when 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, Palestinian health officials say, more than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, while much of the enclave has been reduced to rubble.",
      "This week, Tom Barrack, the U.S. special envoy to Syria and ambassador to Turkey, accused Israel of \u201cattacking everybody\u201d in an interview with The National, the state-owned English-language daily newspaper based in the United Arab Emirates.",
      "He named Syria and Lebanon among those attacked, as well as Tunisia, in an apparent reference to the alleged attack on the aid flotilla.",
      "\u201cPersonally, I hate what\u2019s happened in Gaza on all sides,\u201d Barrack told the newspaper. \u201cFor the Palestinians, for the Israelis, for the Jordanians, for the Lebanese, for the Syrians, for the Turks. You know ... it\u2019s a mess.\u201d",
      "\u201cIsrael is a valued ally,\u201d he said. \u201cWe subsidize them\" by $4 billion to $5 billion a year. \"It has a special place in America\u2019s heart, and we\u2019re living with the confusion of what\u2019s happening in this transition.\u201d",
