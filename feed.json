      "Minneapolis musician Tyka Nelson, Prince\u2019s only full sibling, died Monday",
      "NEW YORK -- Minneapolis musician Tyka Nelson, Prince's only full sibling, died Monday at North Memorial Health in Robbinsdale, Minnesota, her son President Nelson confirmed to The Associated Press. She was 64.",
      "A cause of death was not immediately available, and President Nelson said he doesn't expect to know \u201cfor a couple of days.\u201d",
      "Born to jazz musician John L. Nelson and Mattie Della Shaw in 1960, two years after Prince, Nelson was a singer-songwriter, releasing four albums across her career, starting with 1988's \u201cRoyal Blue.\" That album produced her biggest hits, \u201cMarc Anthony\u2019s Tune,\u201d which spent 11 weeks on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, peaking at No. 33, and \u201cL.O.V.E.,\" which spent seven weeks on the chart and topped at No. 52.",
      "At the time, she told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis, \u201cThe album is basically about love relationships between a man and a woman. I\u2019m royal blue because I can\u2019t find him,\u201d she said.",
      "It's an alternative to her brother's chosen color of purple. Of their relationship, she said: \u201cThe funniest thing is people say, \u2018How does it feel to be Prince\u2019s sister?\u2019 They don\u2019t actually realize what they\u2019re saying. I\u2019ve been Prince\u2019s sister ever since I got here on Earth.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press described her \u201cRoyal Blue\u201d album as \"mostly adult-contemporary or easy-listening\" material, \u201cfar removed from Prince and the so-called Minneapolis sound. Hers is a mature, romantic sound aimed at 25- to 45-year-olds.\u201d",
      "Then came 1992's \u201cYellow Moon, Red Sky,\u201d 2008's \u201cA Brand New Me,\u201d and finally, 2011's \u201cHustler.\u201d",
      "Nelson is survived by two sons, President and Sir, and five grandchildren.",
      "\u201cBorn 1960, the daughter of Mattie and John Nelson, she was best known as Prince\u2019s sister and worked to keep his legacy alive with his fans attending fan and industry events,\u201d President Nelson shared in a statement. \u201cServices will be private, and in lieu of flowers, the family has asked that you take care of one another.\u201d",
      "According to the Star Tribune, Nelson was scheduled to retire and perform a farewell concert at the Dakota in downtown Minneapolis in June. Illness caused her not to take the stage. A few days before the concert, she said she had a mixtape on the way and was working on a memoir.",
      "Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose in 2016 at his home in Minneapolis. He was 57. He had no will, and his six siblings inherited equal interests in the estate: Tyka Nelson and five half-siblings \u2014 Sharon Nelson, Norrine Nelson, John R. Nelson, Omarr Baker and Alfred Jackson.",
      "Tyka Nelson, Baker and Jackson, the three youngest, sold their stake to a music publishing company called Primary Wave Music, LLC, which later assigned its interests to an affiliate, Prince OAT Holdings LLC. Jackson has since died.",
      "Representatives for Paisley Park, Prince\u2019s private estate which is also a museum, studio, and concert venue in Chanhassen, Minnesota, did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment.",

      "Conservative podcaster Megyn Kelly delivered a fiery speech supporting Donald Trump before he gave what was billed as his \u201cclosing message.\"",
      "Conservative podcaster Megyn Kelly delivered a fiery speech supporting Donald Trump during an event billed as his \u201cclosing message\u201d on Monday night, a full-circle moment after the former president and the onetime Fox News star feuded bitterly during Trump's 2016 campaign.",
      "Invited to the stage in Pittsburgh, Kelly defended Trump against recent controversies, including his repeated pledge to be the \u201cprotector\u201d of women, and pressed his case on border security and his opposition to transgender athletes participating in sports.",
      "\u201cHe got mocked by the left by saying he would be a protector of women,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cHe will be a protector of women and it\u2019s why I\u2019m voting for him. He will close the border and he will keep the boys out of women\u2019s sports where they don\u2019t belong.\u201d",
      "Trump stood to the side, grinning and beaming, as he listened to the commentator he once called \u201cnasty.\u201d",
      "Afterward, she posted a selfie with the former president on X that was captioned in part: \"God bless him. Go vote for him!\"",
      "Kelly was a popular Fox News host in 2016 when she questioned Trump during the first debate of the Republican primary about whether he had the temperament to be president.",
      "Trump largely dismissed Kelly\u2019s question at the debate, but later he went directly after her, first overnight on Twitter and later in interviews.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s not very tough and not very sharp,\u201d Trump told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cI don\u2019t respect her as a journalist.\u201d",
      "Referring to Kelly\u2019s questions during the debate, Trump said, \u201cThere was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\u201d The comment was widely viewed as a sexist reference to menstruation.",
      "Trump later boycotted another debate on Fox because Kelly was one of the moderators.",
      "Kelly left Fox for NBC News. She was taken off the air following an uproar when she suggested it was OK for white people to wear blackface on Halloween.",
      "She now hosts a SiriusXM satellite radio show that she has built into one of the highest-ranked on Chartable\u2019s list of news podcasts.",
      "\u201cAll that nonsense between us,\u201d Kelly said last year, \u201cis under the bridge.\u201d",
      "Kelly\u2019s appearance with Trump comes as early voting suggests a gender gap that favors Democrat Kamala Harris.",
      "Kelly was critical of some of the speakers who delivered crude and racist comments at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally last month. One suggested that Harris, who is vying to become the first woman, Black woman and person of South Asian descent to be elected president, began her career as a prostitute.",
      "The speakers, Kelly said, \u201ctook what was an amazing celebration of Trump, exciting and well-attended and hugely enthusiastic, and gave themselves a big black eye.\u201d"

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Pop superstar Taylor Swift returned to Arrowhead Stadium on Monday night to see the Kansas City Chiefs and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after wrapping up the U.S. leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.",
      "It wound up being a good night for both of them.",
      "Swift was able to celebrate Kelce's big night, which included 14 catches for 100 yards in a driving rain, along with a victory for the Chiefs. They trailed by a touchdown in the fourth quarter, scored twice to take the lead, then headed to overtime, where they won the coin toss and drove for a touchdown that gave them a 30-24 win.",
      "Kelce, who had fumbled earlier in the game, had two of his catches on the decisive drive in overtime. His total receptions was a career-best for a regular-season game, matching a 14-catch performance in a 2023 playoff win over Jacksonville, while his 16 targets from Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was just one shy of his career high.",
      "\u201cHe does a great job of finding space,\u201d Mahomes said, \u201cand I think with having DeAndre (Hopkins) out there, it takes pressure off where not all the attention is on him the entire time. And whenever he gets going, man, he's hard to stop.\u201d",
      "Swift is finally getting a chance to stop herself after playing the last of three shows at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Sunday to conclude the U.S. portion of her tour. The rest of her tour heads to Canada with the first of six shows at Rogers Centre in Toronto on Nov. 14 and three shows in December at BC Place in Vancouver, British Columbia.",
      "Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. Since then, the two have spent plenty of time together, often with cameras following every move.",
      "Swift's arrival in a black outfit and Chiefs coat Monday night came on the eve of the presidential election, in which the 14-time Grammy winner has thrown her support behind Vice President Kamala Harris. That generated a stir when Harris' rival, Donald Trump, began to reference Swift's friend and Mahomes' wife, Brittany, as a supporter of his campaign.",
      "Patrick Mahomes has declined to endorse anyone in the election, instead urging people to register to vote.",

      "PARIS -- As dusk falls over the City of Light, a new spectacle is illuminating Saint-Sulpice church, a monument whose interiors are even larger than Notre Dame's \u2014 and arguably just as breathtaking.",
      "The cavernous walls of the neoclassical gem on Paris' Left Bank are coming alive with 360-degree video projections, sparkling cutting-edge technology and actors, all telling the story of the church and its place in French history.",
      "Blending centuries of intrigue, revolution and family drama, the show reimagines the Saint-Germain district during the Fronde, the 17th-century civil war, and the lead-up to the French Revolution.",
      "\u201cParis C\u0153ur de Lumi\u00e8res\u201d (Paris Chancel of Lights), which runs until Nov. 23, transforms the church\u2019s sprawling 6,000-square-meter (65,000-square-foot) interior into a digital stage through advanced video mapping.",
      "\u201cFrom a technological standpoint, it\u2019s a laser scan of the entire building that allows us to reconstruct the space in three dimensions,\u201d director Damien Fontaine explained.",
      "\u201cWe then \u2018unfold\u2019 it like origami ... and put it back into 3D to be projected as a single unified image. We have over 45 projectors, each covering a part of the vaults, a section of a pillar, or a piece of the nave. It\u2019s ... a mosaic of images to form one large picture.\u201d",
      "Projections transform stone carvings into animated storytellers, while immersive soundscapes, paired with an original score, wrap the audience in a sensory experience.",
      "The actors brought history to life. Over 350 performers and volunteers, clad in more than 500 historical costumes, move among the audience portraying local families and rivalries, threading personal narratives into the broader history.",
      "Many of those who volunteered themselves marveled at learning about little known aspects of French history.",
      "Anne Dubosc, a 65-year-old amateur actress, played Anne of Austria, mother of Sun King Louis XIV.",
      "\u201cShe was a remarkable woman, very involved in politics and religion,\u201d Dubosc said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realized how important she was. If Louis XIV became the man he was, it was partly thanks to this woman, this mother who was like a tigress, doing everything to protect her son and teaching him to be a great statesman.\u201d",
      "Performing in Saint-Sulpice, she added, was extraordinary: \u201cIt\u2019s exceptional. You lose track of what\u2019s happening, of where fiction ends and history begins.\u201d",
      "Her historic costume shaped her performance \u2014 literally.",
      "\u201cI have a corset that squeezes me so tightly,\u201d she said. \u201cYou realize there\u2019s a very 18th-century way of holding yourself, of carrying your shoulders and neck, which gives a natural majesty. The costume really impacts how you carry your body, and that posture influences your mind, giving character to this woman of state.\u201d",
      "The production underscored a growing trend in Paris of using light technology to show off the city's storied church interiors. A similar illuminations display took place at Saint-Eustache church until September, featuring video projections, lighting effects and spatialized electronic soundtrack.",

In Philadelphia, the finale of Harris' daylong dash across Pennsylvania, performers and presenters included DJ Cassidy, Fat Joe and Ricky Martin, while Gaga sang a soulful \u201cGod Bless America\u201d and Winfrey brought first-time voters to the stage.",

      "At his own rally in Pittsburgh, which overlapped with Harris' event in the city, the former president criticized Harris for one celebrity endorsement in particular: Beyonc\u00e9. He spoke dismissively about Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s appearance at a Harris rally with Harris in Houston last month, drawing boos for the megastar from his supporters.",
      "\"Beyonc\u00e9 would come in. Everyone\u2019s expecting a couple of songs. There were no songs. There was no happiness,\u201d Trump said.",

      "Peter Ames Carlin writes a cultural history of the rock bank in \u201cThe Name of This Band is R",
      "The best way to read \u201cThe Name of This Band is R.E.M.\u201d is with a pair of headphones and a collection of the band's albums on streaming services or CDs. Opt for the cassettes or vinyl if you want to go old school.",
      "Peter Ames Carlin's book isn't just a cultural biography of the band going back to its formation in the-then sleepy college town of Athens, Georgia. It's also a poetic meditation on what made so many of the band's songs stand out, and continue to shine.",
      "\u201cIt was a new kind of post-punk, alternative music that straddled obscurity and directness, dissent and delicacy, unapologetic and unashamed pure pop,\u201d he writes about the reaction to the band's music in the early 1980s.",
      "Carlin's book offers plenty of behind the scenes details and trivia about R.E.M.'s rise. Fans will enjoy reading about how record executives were wary of making \u201cLosing My Religion,\u201d the band's iconic hit, the first single from its album \u201cOut of Time.\u201d",
      "It's also a fascinating history of a different era in music before social media created viral stars, when bands like R.E.M. rose up through college radio. The early sections of the book offer a vivid description of the music scene in Athens and the band's beginning.",
      "The book also explores the band's political activism, including their work on environmental causes and promotion of the Rock the Vote campaign.",
      "The band members didn't agree to interviews for Carlin's book, and that's one of the few weaknesses of what is an otherwise well-researched history. Anyone hoping to discover major new revelations about the band and its members will likely be disappointed, but Carlin ably demonstrates the impact R.E.M.'s music has had and why its history is worth revisiting.",

      "A former Denver elections worker has filed a federal lawsuit, alleging she was fired for speaking out on TV about her safety concerns",
      "DENVER -- A former Denver elections worker who says she was fired for speaking out about her safety concerns on comedian Jon Stewart's show filed a federal lawsuit Monday, alleging election officials wanted to silence her and violated her First Amendment rights.",
      "Virginia Chau, a lawyer who worked as a polling center supervisor during elections, spoke in 2022 about threats made against election workers and the lack of training for them during a panel discussion on the short-lived streaming show \u201cThe Problem with Jon Stewart.\u201d",
      "Nationally, election officials have increased security in the lead-up to Election Day both to protect their workers and to protect voting procedures and ballots. Election offices and workers have been the target of harassment and threats since the 2020 presidential election, mainly by people supporting former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies that the election was stolen from him because of fraud.",
      "According to Chau's lawsuit, the Denver elections division director R. Todd Davidson told her she was being removed as a supervisor because of her comments on the show and said she could be a hotline representative instead because no one from the public would recognize her in that job. The move would have been a demotion, the lawsuit said, and Chau refused to accept the new position.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Denver clerk and recorder Paul Lopez did not respond to Chau's request to reconsider her termination.",
      "\u201cInstead of heeding Ms. Chau\u2019s call for more resources and training for election officials facing threats to their personal safety, Defendants decided instead to retaliate against one of their best, and most passionate, election workers,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The suit was filed against the city, its elections director and clerk and recorder. It asks for Chau to be reinstated and for unspecified damages.",
      "A spokesperson for Lopez's office, Mikayla Ortega, and a representative of the city attorney's office, Melissa Sisneros, said their offices do not comment on pending litigation."

      "TOKYO -- Nintendo, the Japanese video game maker behind the Super Mario franchise, said Tuesday that its profit fell 60% in the first half of the fiscal year, as demand waned for its Switch console, now in its eighth year since going on sale.",
      "Kyoto-based Nintendo Co. reported a 108.7 billion yen ($715 million) profit for the April-September period, as sales slipped 34% from the previous year to 523 billion yen ($3.4 billion).",
      "More than 74% of its sales revenue came from overseas, according to Nintendo, which didn\u2019t break down quarterly numbers.",
      "Global Switch sales during the period dropped to 4.7 million machines from 6.8 million units the previous year.",
      "But Nintendo said in a statement that Switch sales were still growing and vowed to stick to its goal of selling a Switch console to each and every individual, not just one Switch per every household.",
      "Nintendo stuck to its earlier projection for a 300 billion yen ($2 billion) profit for the full fiscal year through March 2025, down nearly 29% from the previous fiscal year.",
      "Annual sales were forecast to drop 23% to1.28 trillion yen ($8.4 billion).",
      "It also lowered its Switch sales projection for the fiscal year to 12.5 million units from an earlier forecast to sell 13.5 million.",
      "Nintendo and other game and toy makers rake in their biggest profits during the Christmas shopping season, as well as New Year\u2019s, a holiday celebrated with fanfare in Japan, when children receive cash gifts from grandparents and other relatives.",
      "Nintendo has not yet announced details on a successor to the Switch.",
      "Among its million-seller game software titles for the fiscal half were \u201cPaper Mario RPG,\u201d which sold 1.95 million units since going on sale in May, and \u201cLuigi Mansion 2 HD,\u201d hitting nearly 1.6 million in sales.",
      "Overall, more than 70 million Switch games were sold during the period, for a total of nine titles that became million-sellers, including products from third-party manufacturers, or makers that aren\u2019t Nintendo.",
      "Still, that was down from more than 97 million games sold the previous year.",
      "The release of a Super Mario Brothers movie lifted sales in the previous fiscal year, while the absence of such a movie this fiscal year negatively impacted the latest results, Nintendo said. Revenue also declined in its mobile-game offerings and IP-related businesses, it said.",

      "DALLAS -- A pair of ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d is on the auction block nearly two decades after a thief stole the iconic shoes, convinced they were adorned with real jewels.",
      "Online bidding has started and will continue through Dec. 7, Heritage Auctions in Dallas announced in a news release Monday.",
      "The auction company received the sequin-and-bead-bedazzled slippers from Michael Shaw, the memorabilia collector who originally owned the footwear at the heart of the beloved 1939 musical. Shaw had loaned the shoes in 2005 to the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota.",
      "That summer, someone smashed through a display case and stole the slippers. Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018.",
      "Now the museum is among those vying for the slippers, which were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only four remain.",
      "Grand Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival. The funds will supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to purchase the slippers.",
      "The man who stole the slippers, Terry Jon Martin, was 76 when he was sentenced in January to time served because of his poor health. He admitting to using a hammer to smash the glass of the museum\u2019s door and display case in what his attorney said was an attempt to pull off \u201cone last score\u201d after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value.",

      "\u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d is enjoying another weekend at the top of the box office charts",
      "\u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d enjoyed another weekend at the top of the box office. The Sony release starring Tom Hardy added $26.1 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "It was a relatively quiet weekend for North American movie theaters leading up to the presidential election. Charts were dominated by big studio holdovers, like \u201cVenom 3,\u201d \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d and \u201cSmile 2,\u201d while audiences roundly rejected the Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and Robert Zemeckis reunion \u201cHere.\u201d Thirty years after \u201cForrest Gump,\u201d \u201cHere\u201d opened to only $5 million from 2,647 locations.",
      "\u201cVenom 3\u201d only fell 49% in its second weekend, which is a notably small drop for a superhero film, though it didn\u2019t exactly open like one either. In two weeks, the movie has made over $90 million domestically; The first two opened to over $80 million. Globally, the picture is brighter given that it has already crossed the $300 million threshold.",
      "Meanwhile, Universal and Illumination\u2019s \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d continues to attract moviegoers even six weeks in (and when it\u2019s available by video on demand), placing second with $7.6 million. That's up 11% from last weekend. The animated charmer has made over $121 million in North America and $269 million worldwide.",
      "\"'The Wild Robot' has quietly been this absolute juggernaut for the fall season,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cFor that film to see an increase after six weeks is astounding.\u201d",
      "\u201cSmile 2\u201d landed in third place with $6.8 million, helping to push its worldwide total to $109.7 million.",
      "The time-hopping \u201cHere,\u201d a graphic novel that was adapted by \u201cForrest Gump\u201d screenwriter Eric Roth, was financed by Miramax and distributed by Sony\u2019s TriStar. With a fixed position camera, it takes audiences through the years in one living room. Critics were not on board: In aggregate it has a lousy 36% on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cIt was a slow weekend anyway, but it didn\u2019t resonate in a way that many thought it might,\" Dergarabedian said. \"There are a lot of films out there for the audience that \u2018Here\u2019 was chasing.\"",
      "Despite playing in almost 1,000 more locations, \u201cHere\u201d came in behind Focus Features' papal thriller \u201cConclave,\u201d which earned $5.3 million. Playing in 1,796 theaters, \u201cConclave\u201d dropped only 20% from its debut last weekend and has made $15.2 million so far. Two Indian films also cracked the top 10 in their debuts, \u201cBhool Bhulaiyaa 3\u201d and \u201cSingham Again.\u201d",
      "Overall box office continues to lag behind 2023 by almost 12%. But holiday moviegoing will likely give the industry an end-of-year boost with titles like \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d on the way.",
      "\u201cIn a couple of weeks, it\u2019ll get a lot more competitive,\u201d Dergarabedian said.",
      "Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s film \u201cA Real Pain,\u201d a comedic drama about cousins on a Holocaust tour in Poland, launched in four theaters this weekend in New York and Los Angeles. It made an estimated $240,000, or $60,000 per screen, which is among the top three highest per theater averages of the year. Searchlight Pictures will be expanding the well-reviewed film nationwide in the coming weeks, going wide on Nov. 15 to over 800 theaters.",
      "Box office charts don\u2019t always paint a full picture of the moviegoing landscape, however. This weekend several relatively high-profile films playing in theaters did not report full grosses for various reasons, including the Clint Eastwood film \u201cJuror #2,\u201d Steve McQueen\u2019s WWII film \u201cBlitz\u201d and the Cannes darling \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d Netflix, which is handling \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d never reports box office. Apple Original Films is following suit with \u201cBlitz,\u201d a likely awards contender, which is in theaters before hitting Apple TV+ on Nov. 22.",
      "\u201cJuror No. 2\u201d is a Warner Bros. release, and a well-reviewed one at that. The film directed by Eastwood stars Nicholas Hoult as a juror on a murder case who faces a big moral dilemma. Domestic ticket sales were withheld. The studio did say that it earned $5 million from international showings, where it played on 1,348 screens.",
      "Even major studios withhold box office numbers occasionally. Earlier this year, Disney did not report on the Daisy Ridley movie \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea.\u201d Results were most notably withheld during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"It\u2019s really up to the distributors,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cOften times the reason that certain movies may not be reported is that there\u2019s a chance that the quality of the movie will be conflated with the box office number.\u201d",
      "Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore, were:",
      "1. \u201cVenom: The Last Dance,\u201d $26.1 million.",

      "After decades in romantic comedies, Hugh Grant has spent the last few years playing narcissists, weirdos and murders, often to the greatest acclaim of his career",
      "NEW YORK -- After some difficulties connecting to a Zoom, Hugh Grant eventually opts to just phone instead.",
      "\u201cSorry about that,\u201d he apologizes. \u201cTech hell.\u201d Grant is no lover of technology. Smart phones, for example, he calls the \u201cdevil\u2019s tinderbox.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re killing us. I hate them,\u201d he says. \u201cI go on long holidays from them, three or four days at at time. Marvelous.\u201d",
      "Hell, and our proximity to it, is a not unrelated topic to Grant\u2019s new film, \u201cHeretic.\u201d In it, two young Mormon missionaries (Chloe East, Sophie Thatcher) come knocking on a door they\u2019ll soon regret visiting. They\u2019re welcomed in by Mr. Reed (Grant), an initially charming man who tests their faith in theological debate, and then, in much worse things.",
      "After decades in romantic comedies, Grant has spent the last few years playing narcissists, weirdos and murders, often to the greatest acclaim of his career. But in \u201cHeretic,\u201d a horror thriller from A24, Grant\u2019s turn to the dark side reaches a new extreme. The actor who once charmingly stammered in \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral\u201d and who danced to the Pointer Sisters in \u201cLove Actually\u201d is now doing heinous things to young people in a basement.",
      "\u201cIt was a challenge,\u201d Grant says. \u201cI think human beings need challenges. It makes your beer taste better in the evening if you\u2019ve climbed a mountain. He was just so wonderfully (expletive)-up.\u201d",
      "\u201cHeretic,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, is directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, co-writers of \u201cA Quiet Place.\u201d In Grant\u2019s hands, Mr. Reed is a divinely good baddie \u2014 a scholarly creep whose wry monologues pull from a wide range of references, including, fittingly, Radiohead's \u201cCreep.\"",
      "In an interview, Grant spoke about these and other facets of his character, his journey from rom-com idol to horror villain and his abiding affection for \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d",
      "GRANT: Yes, thank you. It\u2019s not easy for any actor.",
      "GRANT: It\u2019s hard to remember which was the writers, which was me. But I\u2019m pretty sure doing the Jar Jar Binks impersonation was my idea.",
      "GRANT: No, I didn\u2019t. I just thought it would be fun if the character did that because it\u2019d be just weird. And, in fact, what\u2019s odd about me is that I\u2019ve never seen a \"Star Wars\u201d film.",
      "GRANT: I can\u2019t. They\u2019re too frightening for me. I watched \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d when I was too young and I\u2019ve been in counseling ever since. I watched one by mistake recently, which was \u201cMidsommar.\u201d I thought it looked like a jolly, Swedish comedy. I put it on one evening for my Swedish wife who needed cheering up and she\u2019s still very, very traumatized.",
      "GRANT: It\u2019s fascinating, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t know. Maybe these are the end of times, the end days, the apocalypse. We know it deep down but for some reason we won\u2019t confront it. I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s wonderful that it sends people into the cinemas.",
      "GRANT: It is. Talk about the end of days. To me, one of the gloomiest signs or omens is the gradual closing of cinemas \u2014 and not just that, where I live in London, but the closing of bars. The bar where I met my wife, which was party night every night of the week, is now largely closed. I think the fact that we\u2019re all staying in, staring at our devil\u2019s tinderboxes is deeply tragic, or watching things on streaming by ourselves with maybe one or two other family members. These things should be collective experiences.",
      "GRANT: My ability to gauge what\u2019s entertaining, I used to be very proud of it. In the old days, my old career, I used to say, \u201cI\u2019m not so proud of my acting but I\u2019m proud of the fact that the films I\u2019ve done, on the whole, have been entertaining and I\u2019ve been good at choosing them.\u201d And then, suddenly overnight, I became very bad at choosing them. I don\u2019t know, I lost the zeitgeist, I suppose. That can happen. Now, I feel like I\u2019ve found something again. If the character amuses me and I think I\u2019m going to enjoy being that person, then I tend to do the job. Sometimes, when actors are enjoying it, it works.",
      "GRANT: Yes, I\u2019ve got nothing else to go on. And I\u2019m not the lead character, the film doesn\u2019t rest on me. I don\u2019t have to worry that much if it does well, medium or badly. I just go by: Do I think I\u2019m going to have some fun in this?",
      "GRANT: The big shift was after \u201cDid You Hear About the Morgans?\u201d That was sort of officially the end of romantic comedy for me. Nothing much happened after that in showbiz terms. I went off and did political campaigning and I was quite happy, in fact. But in drips and drabs, strange little projects, like the Wachowskis' \u201cCloud Atlas,\u201d then Stephen Fears came along with \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d and \u201cA Very English Scandal.\u201d \u201cPaddington 2.\u201d These interesting, complex, often not very nice, narcissistic weirdos started to emerge from the woods.",
      "GRANT: Looking back, I was very lucky. I had Richard Curtis on the one hand, who is not only a gifted comic writer \u2013 he can just do flat-out comedy like \u201cBlack Adder\u201d \u2013 but he\u2019s an unrecognized dramatist. Those comedies are based on pain. The comedy is there to deal with pain. It\u2019s people with unrequited love, lost love, bereavement, brothers with mental illness \u2014 proper pain. So I was lucky with him.",
      "And I think I was very lucky with Marc Lawrence who just had a wonderful gift for the celebration of life. He actually likes people, which is so weird. So films like \u201cMusic and Lyrics\u201d have a very sustaining and uplifting buoyancy to them. He\u2019s an unrecognized talent.",
      "GRANT: You know who really loves them? The most surprising person in the world. Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino pushed his way through a crowd at a party in London once to say, (does Tarantino impression) \u201cMan, I loved \u2018Music and Lyrics\u2019 and \u2018Two Weeks Notice.\u2019\u201d He told me the whole plot of both films and how he was watching one of them on a plane and the plane landed and he had to rush off to a DVD shop to buy the disc so he could watch the end of it. I thought maybe he was joking but I don\u2019t think he was. Someone told me at his cinema here in Hollywood, a rather cool, 35mm-showing theater, he\u2019s been showing \u201cMusic and Lyrics,\u201d no less.",
      "GRANT: Yes, my enthusiasm for that film has spread. I\u2019ve just been invited to a 60th anniversary next year in Salzburg. I might go. I might wear lederhosen. Or I might wear a white dress with a blue satin sash, as I did in school when I played Brigitta Von Trapp.",
      "GRANT: Yeah, I was at all-boys English school and I played, I think, the third youngest daughter.",
      "GRANT: The older I get the more I love song and dance. I find myself watching a lot more Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, things like that. Because life is so stressful and the news is so ghastly that it\u2019s hard to watch very serious stuff and pick yourself up afterwards. I did watch \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d coming over from London the other day. And I have to say that\u2019s just about as good as filmmaking gets. Short of \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d obviously.",
      "GRANT: Yes, weirdly it has, and it\u2019s hard to say why. Is it a sort of exorcism or something? I don\u2019t know. Way back in my 20s, when I started out acting, the only thing I thought I could ever bring to entertainment was doing silly characters, doing voices. I did them as a kid to the point where I drove people mad. I was never myself. My parents and my school teachers used to say, \u201cCome on, just drop it. Who\u2019s the real Hugh Grant?\u201d So it was a bit weird to have a career as a leading-man romantic comedies where I didn\u2019t get to be anyone unusual or weird. So I feel like this is something I can do, and quite like doing. At the same time, I learned some tricks of film acting and got a little bit better.",
      "GRANT: The big thing for me was I learned to trust myself a bit more when you\u2019re actually in front of the camera. There\u2019s a terrible danger when people do film acting. They\u2019re so frightened of this big, pressure moment that\u2019s coming up that they sort of pre-rehearse and think, \u201cI\u2019m going to say the line this way, and it\u2019s excellent that way, and I shall just try to reproduce that on the day.\u201d But that\u2019s no good. You\u2019ve got to reinvent it on the day.",
      "The prep work should not be how you\u2019re going to say the lines, the prep work should be \u2014 well, for me, anyway \u2014 a kind of absurdly prolonged in-depth marinade like a piece of old meat that you leave soaking for weeks and months in sauce until it\u2019s full of flavor. So my marinade takes the form of very, very painstaking, minute examination of the script: Why do I say this? Why do I do this? What happened in childhood for this person to behave like this? What was his mother like? What was his father like?",
      "In the case of Mr. Reed in \u201cHeretic,\u201d it\u2019d be: Let\u2019s look at some serial killers. Let\u2019s look at some cult leaders. Let\u2019s look at some atheists. It\u2019s funny how important costume is. Suddenly some thing, one thing, one visual, physical thing makes you go: That\u2019s him. With Mr. Reed it was the idea of double denim. I don\u2019t actually wear double denim in the film but I realized, yes, he\u2019s Mr. Double Denim. He thinks he\u2019s a groovy teacher at university, the one who\u2019s down with the kids, making jokes.",
      "GRANT: Yeah, that\u2019s true. But doing it on those romantic comedies, I\u2019m not sure I really got anywhere particularly. I wasn\u2019t really creating monsters. It\u2019s easier when you\u2019re creating monsters. I\u2019m fascinated by the bizarre, weird distortions that human beings twist themselves into emotionally, intellectually, physically from the trials and tribulations of life. I\u2019m not sure that any of my characters in the romantic comedies were sufficiently twisted to fully get my juices flowing.",
      "GRANT: Not necessarily from the point of view of religion. But there is a part of me \u2014 probably a not very attractive part of me \u2014 that likes to smash people\u2019s idols. Anyone I feel is being a bit too smug or too pretentious, I don\u2019t like to see that. I like to just take them apart a little bit. My mother did it. She didn\u2019t like me or my brother being too up and she\u2019d find some way to bring us back to ground level.",
      "GRANT: I agree.",
      "GRANT: It\u2019s a very good question that I do not have the answer to. As a matter of fact, there is one thing sitting on my desk in the other room here which is pretty weird and relatively fresh. I agree, I\u2019m not quite sure where to go from here. Maybe it\u2019s song and dance."

      "To mark 30 years of his career, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli has released a new compilation album, \u201cDuets,\u201d featuring previously released and new collaborations across some of his best-known work",
      "NEW YORK -- It's one of the most immediately recognizable voices on the planet: Andrea Bocelli's tenor is beloved across generations, cultures and borders, known to induce tears in as few as three simple words: \u201cCon Te Partir\u00f2,\u201d or in its English performance, \u201cTime to Say Goodbye.\u201d",
      "This year, he's celebrating the 30th anniversary of his career with a new compilation album, \u201cDuets,\u201d featuring both previously released and brand-new collaborations of his best-known work \u2014 as well as a few surprising contemporary covers \u2014 and the release of a new concert film, \u201cAndrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration,\u201d which will arrive in theaters on Friday.",
      "So, why duets?",
      "\u201cI've loved voices since when I was a child, and I like very much to share the stage with the best artists and voices. So, this album, there are the best duets that I did in my life,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cFrom the first, \u2018The Prayer\u2019 with Celine Dion, until the last, like \u2018Perfect\u2019 with Ed Sheeran and many, many others. And the album has been remastered and remixed. So, I hope the sound can be better.\"",
      "He says: \u201cThe most important thing in voices... is to be recognizable, to give emotion.\"",
      "Sheeran was an interesting collaboration because when Bocelli first attempted to sing \u201cPerfect,\" the English singer-songwriter wasn't a fan. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like what I did because I sang in a pop style,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHe wanted to listen to my voice, like in an operatic style.\u201d So, Sheeran traveled to Bocelli's home in Tuscany, and the song was transformed. \u201cHe was right because this song had a huge success.\u201d",
      "When asked if there is anyone he would've loved to add to the \u201cDuets\u201d collection, Bocelli says of course \u2014 but \u201cthey passed away before I began to sing. For example, I would like very much to sing with Maria Callas or (Renata) Tebaldi or Magda Olivero. Many great, incredible singers. They are not anymore with us, unfortunately.\u201d",
      "Three decades into his career, Bocelli has performed for presidents, popes, and sold-out stadiums across the globe \u2014 in addition to having sold nearly 90 million records worldwide, according to a press release. \u201cReality exceeded my wildest dreams,\u201d he says.",
      "How he reflects on that time should come as no surprise. \u201cI like to sing to the future. Honestly, I don\u2019t like to think with nostalgia to the past,\" he says. \u201cMy first time on stage, for me it is like yesterday. The time is gone so quickly, so fast. And, yeah, now I like to think to the future.\u201d",
      "So, what, then, does he hope becomes his legacy in the next 30 years, 300 years? \u201cIn Italy, we have a very famous expression: The people that come after us will judge us,\u201d he says with a translator. \u201cSo I can\u2019t force the judge(ment) of the people. But I feel that my audience has a big affection for me, and this is my goal. When somebody in the street comes to me and says (to) me, \u2018Thank you for your voice, for your music,\u2019 I think mission is accomplished.\"",
      "Across \u201cDuets,\u201d Bocelli sings in Italian, English, French and Spanish. \u201cThere are many languages, but it\u2019s so difficult. I remember the day I tried to sing in Chinese, only few lines, but it has been so hard for me,\u201d he laughs.",
      "He also performs across genres, working with everyone from Latin superstars like Karol G and Jennifer Lopez to country musicians like Chris Stapleton and Shania Twain. \u201cI would like to try to sing jazz,\" he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s too difficult for me because you must live in an atmosphere, to learn step by step, day by day. I like jazz but it\u2019s too far from the experience of my life.\u201d",
      "There is little he hasn't done across these last three decades, but the ultimate goal now, he says, is steeped in faith. \u201cI have been very lucky and I reached the affection of the people. Now I must try to deserve the affection of the God. It\u2019s more difficult.\"",
      "But he will continue to perform for those who love him. On Dec. 4, Bocelli's U.S. tour kicks off in San Diego and runs through the month, before commencing again in February and June 2025. The final dates will be held in Napa Valley, California, on June 21 and 22."

    "summary": "Quincy Jones has died at age 91",

      "Quincy Jones has died at age 91",
      "Quincy Jones, the multitalented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson\u2019s historic \u201cThriller\u201d album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.",
      "Jones\u2019 publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family. Jones was to have received an honorary Academy Award later this month.",
      "\u201cTonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones\u2019 passing,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cAnd although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.\u201d",
      "Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and leaving behind a vast musical catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American song and rhythm. Over the past half century, it was hard to find a music lover who did not own at least one record with Jones\u2019 name on it or someone in the music, television or movie industries who did not have some connection to him.",
      "Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for \u201cRoots\u201d and \u201cIn the Heat of the Night,\u201d organized President Clinton\u2019s first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of \u201cWe Are the World.\u201d",
      "In a career that began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 rpm, singling out any work seems unfair. But honors likely go to his productions with Jackson on \u201cOff the Wall,\u201d \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cBad,\u201d albums universal in their style and appeal. Jones\u2019 versatility and imagination fit perfectly with the bursting talents of Jackson as he sensationally transformed from child star to the \u201cKing of Pop.\u201d On such classic tracks as \u201cBillie Jean\u201d and \u201cWanna Be Startin\u2019 Somethin\u2019,\u201d Jones and Jackson drew upon disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For \u201cThriller,\u201d some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-defying \u201cBeat It\u201d and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.",
      "\u201cThriller\u201d sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone, helped Jackson become the first major Black artist to have a video played on MTV and influenced countless performers.",
      "\u201cMichael had the look and the voice, and I had every sound you can think of,\u201d Jones would explain.",
      "The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography \u201cQ\u201d: 28 Grammys (out of 80 nominations), an honorary Academy Award and an Emmy for \u201cRoots.\u201d He also received France\u2019s Legion d\u2019Honneur and the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy. In 2001, Jones was named a Kennedy Center Honoree for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, \u201cListen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones,\u201d and his memoir made him a bestselling author.",
      "\u201cDespite all the Grammys and the special awards and testimonials that maturity bestows, it will always be the values you carry within yourself \u2014 of work, love, and integrity \u2014 that carry the greatest worth, because these are what get you through with your dreams intact, your heart held firm and your spirit ready for another day,\u201d he wrote in his book.",
      "Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, telling Oprah Winfrey that \u201cThere are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don\u2019t. Nothing\u2019s in between.\u201d Jones\u2019 mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem \u201csenseless\u201d for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting.",
      "Music was his passion, and, almost literally, his salvation. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano.",
      "\u201cI went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \u201cThat\u2019s where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.\u201d",
      "Within a few years he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band.",
      "\u201cWe had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,\u201d Jones later told Musician magazine. \u201cThat\u2019s when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.\u201d",
      "His survivors include actor Rashida Jones and five other daughters: Jolie Jones Levine, Rachel Jones, Martina Jones, Kidada Jones and Kenya Kinski-Jones; son Quincy Jones III; brother Richard Jones and sisters Theresa Frank and Margie Jay.",

      "Three clucks to Sy Montgomery, who 14 years after publishing \u201cBirdology,\u201d is still finding ways to make money off the charming stories she told in that book about various avian species. \u201cWhat the Chicken Knows,\u201d subtitled \u201cA New Appreciation of the World\u2019s Most Familiar Bird\u201d was a chapter in \u201cBirdology,\u201d but is being re-released as a mini hardcover.",
      "Readers who haven\u2019t read it will be, briefly, captivated. In just 67 pages (16 of which are glossy color photographs) Montgomery introduces us to her \u201cLadies,\u201d the ever-changing flock of hens she raised on her New Hampshire farm for decades starting in the 1980\u2019s. Blending her personal experiences as queen of the coop with everything you\u2019ve ever wanted to know about chicken behavior, it\u2019s a fun and informative way to spend an hour.",
      "Here\u2019s a sampling of what you\u2019ll learn: Chickens outnumber people 4:1, they have more in common, anatomically, with dinosaurs than humans, you can mail order up to 350 different varieties of chicks, and roosters really are much meaner than hens. Montgomery sprinkles in those facts and plenty more as she shares stories about how her chickens behaved over the years and what they taught her about \u201chow rich and varied their lives are, as fraught and joyous and changeable as our own.\u201d",
      "Montgomery is wary of anthropomorphizing her feathered friends, so while she names them, she also tells plenty of stories that could be rebranded for a TV show called \u201cWhen Chickens Attack!\u201d The funniest involves her minister, who makes the mistake of running his hand down one of the hens\u2019 backs, a gesture that makes them assume a distinctive mating crouch. Across the yard, Alex \u201csaw a moral travesty, an insult to his roosterhood: the minister was trying to have sex with his hen.\u201d The minister survives the bloody \u201cspurs first\u201d attack to the back of his calves, but learns to tend his own flock.",
      "\u201cWhat the Chicken Knows\u201d joins \u201cA Hummingbird\u2019s Gift\u201d and \u201cThe Hawk\u2019s Way\u201d as standalone mini-books pulled from the pages of \u201cBirdology.\u201d Each has a new introduction by the author and would make nice stocking stuffers for bird lovers in anyone\u2019s life.",

      "LONDON -- British prosecutors say they have been given a file of evidence from police about alleged sexual offenses by comedian Russell Brand and are considering whether to charge him.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service said late Saturday that \u201cwe have been passed a file by the police to consider a charging decision in this case. Any decision to charge is made independently, based on the evidence and in line with our legal test.\u201d",

      "In September 2023, British media outlets Channel 4 and the Sunday Times published claims by four women of being sexually assaulted or raped by Brand between 2006 and 2013, at the height of his fame. The accusers have not been identified.",

My life changed forever for the better after meeting him. I had never experienced, nor have since, anyone who\u2019s heart was so filled with love. He walked around with his heart wide open, and he treated everybody as if they were the most important person he\u2019d ever met. He was the Light. No shadows. He was love lived out loud in human form and he was the first person I ever loved unconditionally.

He was friends with George Martin, the Beatles\u2019 producer and, between the two of them, produced some very fine music. Quincy or \u2018Quince\u2019 or \u2018Q\u2019, as he was known, always had a twinkle in his eye and had a very positive, loving spirit which infected everyone who knew him. His work with Michael Jackson is, of course, legendary and he had so many other strings to his musical bow,\u201d Paul McCartney on Instagram.",

Forever inspired by the incomparable Quincy Jones,\u201d Dr. Dre, on Instagram.",

      "The orchestra said Monday it issued a notice of non-reengagement to the two effective Sept. 21, 2025.",
      "Wang and Muckey were fired in September 2018 following allegations of misconduct dating to 2010. Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians filed a grievance and the two were ordered reinstated in April 2020 by arbitrator Richard I. Bloch. Both men deny any wrongdoing.",
      "New York Magazine in April detailed allegations and the two were placed on paid leave. They then sued the orchestra and the union.",
      "Local 802's executive board said in a nine-page decision issued Tuesday that every member of the orchestra's nine-member dismissal review committee \u201cexpressed revulsion at the abuse of power and pattern of behavior.\u201d",
      "Philharmonic executive adviser Deborah Borda said 11 women made accusations against Wang and three against Muckey during the latest investigation.",
      "\u201cIt found that both gentlemen had been involved in sexual abuse and rape as well as abuse of power,\u201d Borda said. \u201cThis is all new information that came out and I think the reason is that people were afraid to speak up before and they are not now.\u201d",
      "Borda said some of the allegations were made by students.",
      "Steven J. Hyman, a lawyer for Muckey, accused the union of a \"baseless smear campaign, ignoring clear evidence to the contrary.\"",
      "\u201cLocal 802\u2019s decision is deeply troubling and raises serious questions about potential collusion with the philharmonic in their effort to terminate Matthew Muckey without just cause,\u201d Hyman said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThey reference an alleged encounter from 2008 with a young woman, claiming she did not provide meaningful consent; however, contemporaneous text messages directly contradict this allegation.\u201d",
      "Alan S. Lewis, a lawyer for Wang, called the union's decision \u201cshameful.\u201d",
      "\u201cTroublingly, the philharmonic has gone down the road of public character assassination instead of due process, throwing a lot of mud against the wall to see what sticks,\u201d he wrote Monday in an email to The Associated Press. Lewis described the most serious allegation against Wang involving a person unaffiliated with the orchestra and \"with whom, more than a decade ago, Liang had a long-term consensual relationship.\u201d",
      "He called the other allegations against Wang false.",
      "The philharmonic this spring hired Tracey Levy of Levy Employment Law to investigate and issued a letter of non-re-engagement on Oct. 15 following Levy\u2019s conclusions that the orchestra said were based on new accusations. Muckey said in his lawsuit the New York Magazine story contained \"a reiteration of the same 2010 allegations.\"",
      "The guild's executive committee decision said in Wang's case 11 witnesses \u201ctestified to specific instances of rape, sexual assault, grooming of a young female musician, inappropriate touching and comments, unwelcome kissing, and other sexually harassing behavior.\u201d",
      "The report said a woman six years younger than Muckey testified they \u201chad sex when she was 18 years old and was too incapacitated by alcohol to voluntarily consent.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile the allegations concerning Muckey are not as numerous as those involving Wang, we cannot ignore the fact that they demonstrate a similar abuse of power and failure to acknowledge the importance of a woman\u2019s consent to sexual relations,\u201d the report said.",
      "Under the orchestra\u2019s labor contract, the philharmonic must give notice of a non-reengagement by the Feb. 15 prior to the season in question. The two had the right to contest the decision, which the orchestra said must be \u201cappropriate\u201d under the collective bargaining agreement instead of a \u201cjust cause\u201d standard.",
      "\u201cLocal 802\u2019s decision is not to arbitrate the termination,\u201d local 802 president Sara Cutler wrote in an email to the orchestra members on Monday.",
      "The executive board's unanimous report said it was not determining whether criminal conduct took place but only \u201cwhether the notices of non-reengagement were appropriate.\u201d",
      "\u201cConsidering the 11 witnesses who testified about Wang\u2019s pattern of sexual violence and harassment over many years, we do not credit his denials or failure to remember these events,\u201d the report said. \u201cWith respect to Muckey, we similarly do not find his denials sufficient to overcome the testimony of the witness whom the investigator found credible and the pattern of conduct she described. Additionally, the lack of any contrition and the absence of any empathy shown towards the victims reinforces our view that the dismissal was appropriate.\u201d",
      "The report said two-thirds of the orchestra members had said they would refuse to appear on stage with the two.",
      "Muckey was hired by the orchestra in June 2006 and was given tenure in January 2008. Wang was hired as principal oboe in September 2006.",
      "\u201cThey are barred from the building,\u201d Borda said. \u201cThey will never appear on the stage again with the philharmonic.\u201d"

      "The former president was asked twice after casting his ballot in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday about a question that the state's voters are considering. If approved, it would prevent state lawmakers from passing any law that penalizes, prohibits, delays or restricts abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks.",
      "If it\u2019s rejected, the state\u2019s restrictive six-week abortion law would stand.",

      "Voters are getting a say on abortion policy in Tuesday's election with ballot measures and elections to offices from president to local prosecutors",
      "WASHINGTON -- Voters in nine states are deciding whether their state constitutions should guarantee a right to abortion, weighing ballot measures that are expected to spur turnout for a range of crucial races.",
      "Passing certain amendments in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota likely would lead to undoing bans or restrictions that currently block varying levels of abortion access to more than 7 million women of childbearing age who live in those states.",
      "The future legality and availability of abortion hinges not only on ballot measures, as policies could shift depending on who controls Congress and the presidency. Same with state governments \u2014 including legislatures that pursue new laws, state supreme courts that determine the laws' constitutionality, attorneys general who decide whether to defend them and district attorneys who enforce them.",
      "If all the abortion rights measures pass, \"it\u2019s a sign of how much of a juggernaut support for reproductive rights has become,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Law and an expert on the history of reproductive rights in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf some of them fail,\" she added, \"then you\u2019re going to see some conservatives looking for guidance to see what the magic ingredient was that made it possible for conservatives to stem the tide.\u201d",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on all seven measures that have appeared since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the nationwide right to abortion. That decision opened the door to bans or restrictions in most GOP-controlled states \u2014 and protections of access in most of those controlled by Democrats.",
      "The abortion rights campaigns have a big fundraising advantage this year. Their opponents' efforts are focused on portraying the amendments as too extreme rather than abortion as immoral.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Four more bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before women often realize they\u2019re pregnant. Despite the bans, the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen slightly, because of the growing use of abortion pills and organized efforts to help women travel for abortion. Still, advocates say the bans have reduced access, especially for lower-income and minority residents of the states with bans.",
      "The bans also are part of a key argument in the presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris calls them \u201cTrump abortion bans,\u201d noting former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in overturning Roe v. Wade. Harris, meanwhile, has portrayed herself as a direct, consistent advocate for reproductive health and rights, including Black maternal health.",
      "Trump has struggled to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights, leaning on his catch-all response that abortion rights should be left up to individual states.",
      "His shifting stances on reproductive rights include vowing in October to veto a national abortion ban, just weeks after the presidential debate when he repeatedly declined to say. Trump also has regularly taken credit for appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "After voting in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday, Trump was asked twice how he voted on the abortion measure there \u2014 and didn't answer directly. The first time he said he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d The second time, he snapped at a reporter, saying \u201cyou should stop talking about that.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s attempt to find a more cautious stance on abortion echoes the efforts of many Republican congressional candidates as the issue has emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP. In competitive congressional races from coast to coast, Republicans distanced themselves from more aggressive anti-abortion policies coming from their party and its allies, despite their records on the issue and previous statements opposing abortion rights.",
      "While the ballot questions have similar aims, each one occupies its own political circumstances.",
      "There\u2019s an added obstacle to passing protections in reliably Republican Florida: Supporters of the amendment must get at least 60% of the vote.",
      "Passing it there and rolling back a 6-week ban that took effect in May would be a blow to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, who has steered state GOP funds to the cause and whose administration has weighed in, too, with a campaign against the measure, investigators questioning people who signed petitions to add it to the ballot and threats to TV stations that aired one commercial supporting it.",
      "Nebraska has competing ballot measures. One would allow abortion further into pregnancy. The other would enshrine in the constitution the state\u2019s current law, which bars most abortions after 12 weeks \u2014 but would allow for further restrictions.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure would allow some regulations related to the health of the woman after 12 weeks. Because of that wrinkle, most national abortion-rights groups are not supporting it.",
      "In some states, notably Missouri, passing amendments may not expand access immediately. Courts would be asked to invalidate the bans; and there could be legal battles over that. Clinics would need to staff up and get licenses. And some restrictions could remain in effect.",
      "Arizona, a battleground in the presidential election, bans abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The ballot measure there gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a strict abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "In the Democratic-controlled Colorado and Maryland, the ballot measures would largely put existing policies into the state constitutions, though Colorado\u2019s version could also remove financial barriers to abortion. It would take 55% of the vote to pass there.",
      "Measures maintaining access also are on the ballot in Montana, where a U.S. Senate race could help determine control of the chamber, and Nevada, a battleground in the presidential election.",
      "In Nevada, where control of the state government is divided, the ballot measure would have to be passed this year and again in 2026 to take effect.",
      "New York also has a measure on the ballot that its supporters say would bolster abortion rights. It doesn\u2019t contain the word \u201cabortion\u201d but rather bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d"

      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the hospitality industry had \u201ctaken a real battering in recent years\u201d and it is not \u201cthe right time\u201d to ban smoking outside pubs.",
      "The bill also proposes to restrict vape flavors and ban bright vape packaging aimed at children, to combat \u201ca cynical industry that has sought to addict a new generation of children to nicotine,\u201d Streeting said.",
      "It also continues a plan by the previous Conservative government, which was ousted in July\u2019s general election, to raise the minimum age for buying tobacco by one year each year, so that no one born after Jan. 1, 2009 will ever be able to buy cigarettes legally in Britain.",
      "It is currently illegal to sell cigarettes, tobacco products or vapes to people under 18.",
      "If passed \u2013 as is likely because of the governing Labour Party\u2019s large majority in Parliament -- the bill would give Britain some of the toughest anti-smoking measures in the world.",
      "The government said the bill \u201cbreaks the cycle of addiction and paves the way for a smoke-free U.K.\u201d",
      "The number of people who smoke in Britain has declined by two-thirds since the 1970s, but some 6.4 million people \u2014 or about 13% of the population \u2014 still smoke, according to official figures.",
      "Authorities say smoking causes some 80,000 deaths a year in the U.K, and remains the number one preventable cause of death, disability and poor health."

      "An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution could bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes.\u201d",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution that would bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes\" is up for a final vote Tuesday amid debate over how much it might affect future abortion and transgender rights.",
      "Supporters and opponents disagree sharply about the potential legal impact of the Equal Rights Amendment, also known as Proposition 1.",
      "New York\u2019s constitution currently forbids discrimination based on race, creed or religion. The amendment would add language that says someone cannot be denied civil rights because of their national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes or \u201creproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d",
      "Democratic leaders put the amendment on the ballot partly in hopes of boosting turnout by voters passionate about protecting abortion access, in an election year where U.S. House races in New York could help decide which party controls Congress.",
      "Several other states also have abortion-related constitutional amendments on their ballots Tuesday. Most of those ballot questions address head-on when it should be legal to end a pregnancy. But in New York, state lawmakers took the indirect approach of writing the amendment as an antidiscrimination measure.",
      "Democrats who support the amendment have argued that the new language would create a legal framework where any restrictions on abortion would amount to an unconstitutional form of discrimination in medical care. The New York City Bar Association has agreed with that assessment, as have some other legal experts.",
      "Still, the fact that the amendment itself does not use the word abortion has caused headaches for its supporters. It also opened the door for opponents to claim its other language would lead to a raft of unintended consequences.",
      "Republicans have run a strong messaging campaign against the amendment, choosing not to focus on what protections it might provide for abortion, but to target other parts of the proposal. Their main attack line has been to argue the amendment would provide a constitutional right for transgender athletes to play on girls\u2019 sports teams.",
      "They\u2019ve also argued that its language on national origin could result in noncitizens being allowed to vote, that its ban on age discrimination might take away price discounts for senior citizens, and that it could also wind up stopping parents from having a say in their child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Previous state court decisions have found that existing language in the state constitution bars noncitizens from voting. And the New York City Bar Association says the amendment would not block existing state laws requiring parental consent for a child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Legal battles are already underway in New York over whether existing state and federal laws give transgender people the right to play on sports teams that match the gender identity.",
      "Democrats in the state legislature voted to put the amendment on the 2024 ballot after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters elsewhere have shown support for abortion access in previous elections. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll recently found that 7 in 10 Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.",
      "Uncertainty over the New York amendment\u2019s impact on abortion was pronounced enough, however, that it caused even the state Board of Elections to throw up its hands. The board is responsible for writing simple explanations of proposed amendments that voters will see on their ballots. But rather than interpret the measure or include the word abortion in its description, the board decided to reiterate the amendment\u2019s language verbatim.",
      "Supporters of the amendment objected and filed lawsuit, but the judge in the case, David A. Weinstein, eventually declined to make the board rewrite its description, in part because he could not say for certain how courts would interpret the amendment\u2019s language.",
      "Abortion is currently legal in New York up through 24 weeks from the beginning of pregnancy. After that, it is only legal if the pregnant person\u2019s life, physical health or mental health is at risk, or if a medical provider determines the fetus is not viable. Although there is no defined time frame, viability is a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus.",
      "Democrats have firm control of state government in New York, making any new abortion restrictions unlikely in the near future.",
      "Backers of the proposal argue that if the amendment passes it would create a strong layer of abortion protections in New York that would be difficult for a future legislature to repeal. That's because New York requires the legislature to pass an amendment to the constitution two times before it goes to voters for final approval."

      "Nebraska has a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot, including two competing ones pertaining to abortion abortion rights",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Nebraska will have a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot Tuesday, including two competing ones that address abortion rights. Nebraska is the first state to feature competing abortion amendments on the same ballot since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending the nationwide right to abortion and allowing states to decide for themselves.",
      "Initiative 434, which appears at the top of the ballot list, would enshrine in the state constitution Nebraska\u2019s current 12-week abortion ban, which the Legislature passed in 2023 and which includes exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to protect the life of the pregnant woman.",
      "Appearing last on the list is Initiative 439, which would amend the constitution to guarantee the right to have an abortion until viability \u2014 the standard under Roe that is the point at which a fetus might survive outside the womb. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation. The measure includes some exceptions, including allowing abortions later in pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant woman.",
      "Because they\u2019re competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the one that gets the most \u201cfor\u201d votes would be adopted, the secretary of state\u2019s office said.",
      "Elections officials expect the competing measures to help drive high voter turnout, along with the hotly contested presidential race.",
      "Abortion is on the ballot in several other states, as well. Coming into the election, voters in all seven states that have decided on abortion-related ballot measures since the reversal of Roe have favored abortion rights, including in some conservative states.",
      "The measure that would enshrine the 12-week ban in the constitution has been bankrolled by some of Nebraska's wealthiest people, including Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts, who previously served as governor and donated more than $1.1 million. His mother, Marlene Ricketts, gave $4 million to the cause. Members of the Peed family, which owns publishing company Sandhills Global, also gave $1 million.",
      "The effort organized under the name Protect Women and Children is heavily backed by religious organizations, including the Nebraska Catholic Conference, a lobbying group that has organized rallies, phone banks and community townhalls to drum up support for the measure.",
      "The effort to enshrine viability as the standard is called Protect Our Rights Nebraska and has the backing of several medical, advocacy and social justice groups. Planned Parenthood has donated nearly $1 million to the cause, with the American Civil Liberties Union, I Be Black Girl, Nebraska Appleseed and the Women\u2019s Fund of Omaha also contributing significantly to the roughly $3.7 million raised by Protect Our Rights.",
      "Two measures, Initiative 437 and Initiative 438, would legalize the possession and use of medical marijuana, and allow for the manufacture, distribution and delivery of it.",
      "Initiative 437 would let patients and caregivers possess up to 5 ounces (142 grams) of marijuana if recommended by a doctor. Initiative 438 would create the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, which would oversee the private groups that would manufacture and dispense marijuana.",
      "The initiatives have been challenged in court over allegations that the petition campaign to put them on the ballot broke election rules. That means a judge could invalidate them even if voters approve them.",
      "Also on the ballot, Referendum Measure 435 asks voters to retain or repeal a new conservative-backed law that allocates millions of dollars in taxpayer money to fund private school tuition.",
      "And Initiative 436 would require all Nebraska employers to provide at least 40 hours of paid sick leave to their employees."

      "Orlando Harris\u2019 family pleaded with Missouri police to confiscate the 19-year-old\u2019s bullet-proof vest, ammunition and AR-15-style rifle. They knew his mental health was fragile after more than one suicide attempt. But the best officers could do in a state with some of the most expansive gun rights is suggest Harris keep the weapon in a storage unit.",
      "Nine days later, Harris entered his former St. Louis high school and declared, \u201cAll of you are going to die.\u201d",
      "A new 456-page police report details the efforts Harris' family took to try to take his gun away in the days before he walked into Central Visual Arts and Performing Arts High School on Oct. 24, 2022, when he killed a student and a teacher and wounded seven others before he was fatally shot by police.",
      "Missouri is not among the 21 states with a red-flag law. Also known as extreme risk protection orders, red-flag laws are intended to restrict the purchase of guns or temporarily remove them from people who may hurt themselves or someone else.",
      "The case highlights how hard it is for law enforcement to restrict gun access, even when there are clues something is deeply amiss.",
      "After an Army reservist killed 18 people in October 2023 in Lewiston, Maine, an investigation found missed opportunities to intervene in the shooter\u2019s psychiatric crisis. And before a 14-year-old was charged in a deadly shooting this fall at his Georgia high school, a deputy talked to him about an online threat and family warned of an \u201cextreme emergency.\u201d",
      "The investigation report in Harris' case shows the first time he attempted suicide was in the fall of 2021, just before he was scheduled to leave for college. Pandemic disruptions, the arrest of a friend in a homicide and a car wreck all may have contributed to his depression, his family and former boss told investigators.",
      "The police report makes no mention of him attending college. Instead, he worked in the cafeteria at a senior facility, where he sometimes discussed guns with coworkers.",
      "The following August he met with a Washington University psychiatry resident, telling her he thought about shooting people at his old school. He said those thoughts lasted for just one evening and went away, and that there was no planning and he didn\u2019t want to do it.",
      "But soon after, Harris began a countdown to the shooting. His plans included detailed maps of the school and a plan to target teachers, students and the LGBTQ community. He also had plans to burn down his family's home with them inside.",
      "The psychiatrist prescribed medications, but Harris didn\u2019t fill the prescriptions. The report says they developed an emergency plan.",
      "Washington University did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Harris then stopped showing up for appointments.",
      "On Oct. 8, he tried to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer in St. Charles, Missouri, but the transaction was blocked by an FBI background check. The report doesn't explain why, and police didn't respond to an email from the AP. The FBI merely provided a list of the 12 reasons for a denial with no other details.",
      "Then on Oct. 10, Harris drove to a nearby suburb to pay a man $580 in cash for the rifle used in the shooting.",
      "Harris\u2019 family grew more concerned on Oct. 15, when two packages from gun and ammunition suppliers arrived. One of his sisters, Noneeka Harris, opened them, finding a body armor vest, magazine holsters and magazines. She then searched his bedroom and found the rifle inside an old TV box.",
      "Harris' mother, Tanya Ward, called BJC Mental Health Services and staff there \u201cdeemed the situation as an immediate threat.\u201d They advised her to take the items to the police department and tell officers about her son\u2019s mental illness.",
      "Police at the station told her they couldn\u2019t take the firearm because Harris was of legal age to possess it. They said she should head home and an officer would meet them there. By the time she returned, Harris was home and insistent that he keep the gun.",
      "His mother was adamant that the gun not be in the house, so the officers suggested a storage unit. The report said the officers also advised her on steps she needed to take to have her son deemed mentally unstable.",
      "Federal law has banned some mentally ill people from buying guns since 1968, including those deemed a danger to themselves or others, who have been involuntarily committed, or judged not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.",
      "Ultimately, the firearm and other items were loaded into the trunk of Harris' sister's vehicle, including a box of ammunition that arrived the next day. She later drove her brother to a storage facility, which was about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the high school.",
      "She told police she \u201cknew something was going to happen.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 24, shots rang out as Harris entered his former high school.",
      "It is unclear why Harris targeted the school. A security officer recalled him as somewhat popular and his grade school principal said he wasn\u2019t bullied, according to the investigative report. But as he fired at a dance class, one student told police she heard someone yell, \u201cI hate this school. I hate everybody.\u201d",
      "Fatally wounded, Alexzandria Bell initially ran toward the entrance before slumping to the ground, a security officer reassuring the 10th grader that help was on the way. But then she went quiet.",
      "One class jumped out a window to escape after their physical education teacher, 61-year-old Jean Kuczka, stood between them and Harris. Kuckza was killed.",
      "Harris eventually made his way to the third floor, hiding in a computer lab. The first officer to charge into the lab had a daughter at the school.",

      "Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution \u2014 a vote that could cement access after the presidential battleground came close to a near-total ban earlier this year.",
      "Arizona is one of nine states with abortion on the ballot.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates are hoping for a win that could expand access beyond the state's current 15-week limit to the point of fetal viability, a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Doctors say it's sometime after 21 weeks, though there's no defined time frame.",
      "Advocates also are counting on the measure to drive interest among Democrats to vote the party line up and down the ballot. When Republicans running in tough races address the ballot measure, they generally don\u2019t dissuade voters from supporting it, though some like Senate candidate Kari Lake say they\u2019re personally voting against it. GOP U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani, whose battleground congressional district encompasses Tucson, ran an ad saying he rejects \"the extremes on abortion.\u201d",
      "Arizona has been whipsawed by recent legal and legislative battles centered on abortion. In April, the state Supreme Court cleared the way for enforcement of a long-dormant 1864 law that banned nearly all abortions. The Legislature swiftly repealed it.",
      "In addition to the abortion ballot measure itself, the issue could sway state legislative races and lead to elimination of the voice voters have over retention of state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices.",
      "Arizona for Abortion Access, the coalition leading the ballot measure campaign, has far outpaced the opposition campaign, It Goes Too Far, in fundraising. Opponents argue that the measure is too far-reaching because its physical and mental health exemption post-viability is so broad that it effectively legalizes abortion beyond viability. The measure allows post-viability abortions if they are necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the mother.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, abortion-rights supporters prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions, including in conservative-leaning states.",
      "Voters in Arizona are divided on abortion. Maddy Pennell, a junior at Arizona State University, said the possibility of a near-total abortion ban made her \u201cdepressed\u201d and strengthened her desire to vote for the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cI feel very strongly about having access to abortion,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle Lee, an independent Arizona voter, does not support the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cAll abortion is pretty much, in my opinion, murder from beginning to end,\u201d Lee said.",
      "The Civil War-era ban also shaped the contours of tight legislative races. State Sen. Shawnna Bolick and state Rep. Matt Gress are among the handful of vulnerable Republican incumbents in competitive districts who crossed party lines to give the repeal vote the final push \u2014 a vote that will be tested as both parties vie for control of the narrowly GOP-held state Legislature.",
      "Both of the Phoenix-area lawmakers were rebuked by some of their Republican colleagues for siding with Democrats. Gress made a motion on the House floor to initiate the repeal of the 1864 law. Bolick, explaining her repeal vote to her Senate colleagues, gave a 20-minute floor speech describing her three difficult pregnancies.",
      "While Gress was first elected to his seat in 2022, Bolick is facing voters for the first time. She was appointed by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to fill a seat vacancy in 2023. She has not emphasized her role in the repeal vote as she has campaigned, instead playing up traditional conservative issues \u2014 one of her signs reads \u201cBolick Backs the Blue.\u201d",
      "Another question before voters is whether to move away from retention elections for state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices, a measure put on the ballot by Republican legislators hoping to protect two justices who favored allowing the Civil War-era ban to be enforced.",
      "Under the existing system, voters decide every four to six years whether judges and justices should remain on the bench. The proposed measure would allow the judges and justices to stay on the bench without a popular vote unless one is triggered by felony convictions, crimes involving fraud and dishonesty, personal bankruptcy or mortgage foreclosure.",
      "Shawnna Bolick\u2019s husband, Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick, is one of two conservative justices up for a retention vote. Justice Bolick and Justice Kathryn Hackett King, who were both appointed by former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, sided with the high court\u2019s majority to allow the enforcement of the 1864 near-total ban. Abortion-rights activists have campaigned for their ouster, but if the ballot measure passes they will keep their posts even if they don\u2019t win the retention election."

      "The last three hospitals still partially functioning in northern Gaza have been encircled by Israeli troops and caught amid fighting for weeks",
      "JERUSALEM -- They were built to be places of healing. But once again, three hospitals in northern Gaza are encircled by Israeli troops and under fire.",
      "Bombardment is pounding around them as Israel wages a new offensive against Hamas fighters that it says have regrouped nearby. As staff scramble to treat waves of wounded, they remain haunted by a war that has seen hospitals targeted with an intensity and overtness rarely seen in modern warfare.",
      "All three were besieged and raided by Israeli troops some 10 months ago. The Kamal Adwan, al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals still have not recovered from the damage, yet are the only hospitals even partially operational in the area.",
      "Medical facilities often come under fire in wars, but combatants usually depict such incidents as accidental or exceptional, since hospitals enjoy special protection under international law. In its yearlong campaign in Gaza, Israel has stood out by carrying out an open campaign on hospitals, besieging and raiding at least 10 of them across the Gaza Strip, some several times, as well as hitting multiple others in strikes.",
      "It has said this is a military necessity in its aim to destroy Hamas after the militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. It claims Hamas uses hospitals as \u201ccommand and control bases\u201d to plan attacks, to shelter fighters and to hide hostages. It argues that nullifies the protections for hospitals.",
      "\u201cIf we intend to take down the military infrastructure in the north, we have to take down the philosophy of (using) the hospitals,\u201d Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said of Hamas during an interview with The Associated Press in January after the first round of hospital raids.",
      "Most prominently, Israel twice raided Gaza City\u2019s Shifa Hospital, the biggest medical facility in the strip, producing a video animation depicting it as a major Hamas base, though the evidence it presented remains disputed.",
      "But the focus on Shifa has overshadowed raids on other facilities. The AP spent months gathering accounts of the raids on al-Awda, Indonesian and Kamal Adwan Hospitals, interviewing more than three dozen patients, witnesses and medical and humanitarian workers as well as Israeli officials.",
      "It found that Israel has presented little or even no evidence of a significant Hamas presence in those cases. The AP presented a dossier listing the incidents reported by those it interviewed to the Israeli military spokesman\u2019s office. The office said it could not comment on specific events.",
      "The Israeli military has never made any claims of a Hamas presence at al-Awda. When asked what intelligence led troops to besiege and raid the hospital last year, the military spokesman\u2019s office did not reply.",
      "In recent weeks, the hospital has been paralyzed once again, with Israeli troops fighting in nearby Jabalia refugee camp and no food, water or medical supplies entering areas of northern Gaza. Its director Mohammed Salha said last month that the facility was surrounded by troops and was unable to evacuate six critical patients. Staff were down to eating one meal a day, usually just a flat bread or a bit of rice, he said.",
      "As war-wounded poured in, exhausted surgeons were struggling to treat them. No vascular surgeons or neurosurgeons remain north of Gaza City, so the doctors often resort to amputating shrapnel-shattered limbs to save lives.",
      "\u201cWe are reliving the nightmares of November and December of last year, but worse,\u201d Salha said. \u201cWe have fewer supplies, fewer doctors and less hope that anything will be done to stop this.\u201d",
      "The military, which did not respond to a specific request for comment on al-Awda hospital, says it takes all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties.",
      "Last year, fighting was raging around al-Awda when, on Nov. 21, a shell exploded in the facility's operating room. Dr. Mahmoud Abu Nujaila, two other doctors and a patient\u2019s uncle died almost instantly, according to international charity Doctors Without Borders, which said it had informed the Israeli military of its coordinates.",
      "Dr. Mohammed Obeid, Abu Nujaila\u2019s colleague, recalled dodging shellfire inside the hospital complex. Israeli sniper fire killed a nurse and two janitors and wounded a surgeon, hospital officials said.",
      "By Dec. 5, al-Awda was surrounded. For 18 days, coming or going became \u201ca death sentence,\u201d Obeid said.",
      "Survivors and hospital administrators recounted at least four occasions when Israeli drones or snipers killed or badly wounded Palestinians trying to enter. Two women about to give birth were shot and bled to death in the street, staff said. Salha, the administrator, watched gunfire kill his cousin, Souma, and her 6-year-old son as she brought the boy for treatment of wounds.",
      "Shaza al-Shuraim said labor pains left her no choice but to walk an hour to al-Awda to give birth. She, her mother-in-law and 16-year-old brother-in-law raised flags made of white blouses. \u201cCivilians!\u201d her mother-in-law, Khatam Sharir, kept shouting. Just outside the gate, a burst of gunfire answered, killing Sharir.",
      "On Dec. 23, troops stormed the hospital, ordering men ages 15 to 65 to strip and undergo interrogation in the yard. Mazen Khalidi, whose infected right leg had been amputated, said nurses pleaded with soldiers to let him rest rather than join the blindfolded and handcuffed men outside. They refused, and he hobbled downstairs, his stump bleeding.",
      "\u201cThe humiliation scared me more than death,\u201d Khalidi said.",
      "The hospital\u2019s director, Ahmed Muhanna, was seized by Israeli troops; his whereabouts remain unknown. One of Gaza\u2019s leading doctors, orthopedist Adnan al-Bursh, was also detained during the raid and died in Israeli custody in May.",
      "In the wreckage from the November shelling, staff found a message that Abu Nujaila had written on a whiteboard in the previous weeks.",
      "\u201cWhoever stays until the end will tell the story,\u201d it read in English. \u201cWe did what we could. Remember us.\u201d",
      "Several blocks away, on Oct. 18, artillery hit the upper floors of Indonesian Hospital, staff said. People fled for their lives. They'd already been surrounded by Israeli troops, leaving doctors and patients inside without enough food, water and supplies.",
      "\u201cThe bombing around us has increased. They\u2019ve paralyzed us,\" said Edi Wahyudi, an Indonesian volunteer.",
      "Two patients died because of a power outage and lack of supplies, said Muhannad Hadi, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Palestinian territories.",
      "Tamer al-Kurd, a nurse at the hospital, said around 44 patients and only two doctors remain. He said he was so dehydrated he was starting to hallucinate. \u201cPeople come to me to save them. \u2026 I can\u2019t do that by myself, with two doctors,\u201d he said in a voice message, his voice weak. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, the Israeli military said it had facilitated the evacuation of 29 patients from Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals.",
      "The Indonesian is Northern Gaza\u2019s largest hospital. Today its top floors are charred, its walls pockmarked by shrapnel, its gates strewn with piled-up rubble \u2014 all the legacy of Israel's siege in the autumn of 2023.",
      "Before the assault, the Israeli army claimed an underground command-and-control center lay beneath the hospital. It released blurry satellite images of what it said was a tunnel entrance in the yard and a rocket launchpad nearby, outside the hospital compound.",
      "The Indonesia-based group that funds the hospital denied any Hamas presence. \u201cIf there\u2019s a tunnel, we would know. We know this building because we built it brick by brick, layer by layer. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Arief Rachman, a hospital manager from the Indonesia-based Medical Emergency Rescue Committee, told the AP last month.",
      "After besieging and raiding the hospital, the military did not mention or show evidence of the underground facility or tunnels it had earlier claimed. When asked if any tunnels were found, the military spokesman's office did not reply.",
      "It released images of two vehicles found in the compound \u2014 a pickup truck with military vests and a bloodstained car belonging to an abducted Israeli, suggesting he had been brought to the hospital on Oct. 7. Hamas has said it brought wounded hostages to hospitals for treatment.",
      "During the siege, Israeli shelling crept closer and closer until, on Nov. 20, it hit the Indonesian\u2019s second floor, killing 12 people and wounding dozens, according to staff. Israel said troops responded to \u201cenemy fire\u201d from the hospital but denied using shells.",
      "Gunfire over the next days hit walls and whizzed through intensive care. Explosions sparked fires outside the hospital courtyard where some 1,000 displaced Palestinians sheltered, according to staff. The Israeli military denied targeting the hospital, although it acknowledged nearby bombardment may have damaged it.",
      "For three weeks, wounded poured in \u2014 up to 500 a day to a facility with capacity for 200. Supplies hadn\u2019t entered in weeks. Bloodstained linens piled up. Doctors, some working 24-hour shifts, ate a few dates a day. The discovery of moldy flour on Nov. 23 was almost thrilling.",
      "Without medicines or ventilators, there was little doctors could do. Wounds became infected. Doctors said they performed dozens of amputations on infected limbs. Medics estimated a fifth of incoming patients died. At least 60 corpses lay in the courtyard. Others were buried beneath a nearby playground.",
      "\u201cTo see patients dying before your eyes because you don\u2019t have the ability to help them, you have to ask yourself: \u2018Where is humanity?\u2019\u201d asked Dergham Abu Ibrahim, a volunteer.",
      "Kamal Adwan Hospital, once a linchpin of northern Gaza\u2019s health system, was burning on Thursday of last week.",
      "Israeli shells crashed into the third floor, igniting a fire that destroyed medical supplies, according to the World Health Organization, which had delivered the equipment just days before. The artillery hit water tanks and damaged the dialysis unit, badly burning four medics who tried to extinguish the blaze, said the hospital\u2019s director, Hossam Abu Safiya.",
      "In videos pleading for help over the past weeks, Abu Safiya had fought to maintain his composure as Israeli forces surrounded the hospital. But last weekend, there were tears in his eyes.",
      "\u201cEverything we have built, they have burned,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201cThey burned our hearts. They killed my son.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 25, Israeli troops stormed the hospital after what an Israeli military official described as an intense fight with militants nearby. During the battle, Israeli fire targeted the hospital\u2019s oxygen tanks because they \u201ccan be booby traps,\u201d the official said.",
      "Israeli forces withdrew after three days, during which Palestinian health officials said nearly all of Kamal Adwan's medical workers were detained, an Israeli drone killed at least one doctor and two children in intensive care died when generators stopped working.",
      "Days later, a drone struck Abu Safiya\u2019s son in nearby Jabalia. The 21-year-old had been wounded by Israeli snipers during the first military raid on Kamal Adwan last December. Now he is buried in the yard of the hospital, where just Abu Safiya and one other doctor remain to treat the dozens of wounded pouring in each day from new strikes in Jabalia.",
      "The Israeli military said troops detained 100 people, some who were \u201cposing as medical staff.\u201d Soldiers stripped the men to check for weapons, the military said, before those deemed militants were sent to detention camps. The military claimed that the hospital was \"fully operational, with all departments continuing to treat patients.\u201d It released footage of several guns and an RPG launcher with several rounds it said it found inside the hospital.",
      "Kamal Adwan staff say more than 30 medical personnel remain detained, including the head of nursing, who is employed by MedGlobal, an American organization that sends medical teams to disaster regions, and Dr. Mohammed Obeid, the surgeon employed by Doctors without Borders who previously worked at al-Awda Hospital and had moved to Kamal Adwan.",
      "The turmoil echoed Israel\u2019s nine-day siege of Kamal Adwan last December. On Dec. 12, soldiers entered and allowed police dogs to attack staff, patients and others, multiple witnesses said. Ahmed Atbail, a 36-year-old who had sought refuge at the hospital, said he saw a dog bite off one man\u2019s finger.",
      "Witnesses said the troops ordered boys and men, ranging from their mid-teens to 60, to line up outside crouched in the cold, blindfolded and nearly naked for hours of interrogation. \u201cEvery time someone lifted their heads, they were beaten,\u201d said Mohammed al-Masri, a lawyer who was detained.",
      "The military later published footage of men exiting the hospital. Al-Masri identified himself in the footage. He said soldiers staged the images, ordering men to lay down rifles belonging to the hospital guards as if they were militants surrendering. Israel said all photos released are authentic and that it apprehended dozens of suspected militants.",
      "As they released some of the men after interrogation, soldiers fired on them as they tried to reenter the hospital, wounding five, three detainees said. Ahmed Abu Hajjaj recalled hearing bursts of gunfire as he made his way back in the dark. \u201cI thought, this makes no sense \u2014 who would they be shooting at?\u201d",
      "Witnesses also said a bulldozer lumbered into the hospital compound, plowing into buildings. Abu Safiya, Abu Hajjaj and al-Masri described being held by soldiers inside the hospital as they heard people screaming outside.",
      "After the soldiers withdrew, the men saw the bulldozer had crushed tents that previously sheltered some 2,500 people. Most of the displaced had evacuated, but Abu Safiya said he found bodies of four people crushed, with splints from recent treatment in the hospital still on their limbs.",
      "Asked about the incident, the Israeli military spokesman\u2019s office said: \u201cLies were spread on social media\u201d about troops\u2019 activities at the hospital. It said bodies were discovered that had been buried previously, unrelated to the military\u2019s activities.",
      "Later, the military said Hamas used the hospital as a command center but produced no evidence. It said soldiers uncovered weapons, but it showed footage only of a single pistol.",
      "The hospital\u2019s director, Dr. Ahmed al-Kahlout, remains in Israeli custody. The military released footage of him under interrogation saying he was a Hamas agent and that militants were based in the hospital. His colleagues said he spoke under duress.",
      "Hagari, the military spokesperson, said hospitals \u201cprovide a life of their own ... to the (Hamas) war system.\u201d He said hospitals were linked to tunnels allowing fighters movement. \u201cAnd when you take it, they have no way to move. Not from the south to the north.\u201d",
      "Despite often suggesting hospitals are linked to Hamas' underground networks, the military has shown only one tunnel shaft from all the hospitals it raided \u2014 one leading to Shifa's grounds.",
      "In a report last month, a U.N. investigation commission determined that \u201cIsrael has implemented a concerted policy to destroy the health-care system of Gaza.\u201d It described Israeli actions at hospitals as \u201ccollective punishment against the Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Some patients now fear hospitals, refusing to go to them or leaving before treatment is complete. \u201cThey are places of death,\u201d Ahmed al-Qamar, a 35-year-old economist in Jabalia refugee camp, said of his fear of taking his children to the hospital. \u201cYou can feel it.\u201d",
      "Zaher Sahloul, the president of MedGlobal who has also worked in Gaza during the war, said the sense of safety that should surround hospitals has been destroyed.",

      "Robert F",
      "PHOENIX -- PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent proponent of debunked public health claims whom Donald Trump has promised to put in charge of health initiatives, said Saturday that Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected president.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Kennedy made the declaration Saturday on the social media platform X alongside a variety of claims about the heath effects of fluoride.",
      "\u201cOn January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S\u200b. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,\u201d Kennedy wrote. Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, \u201cwant to Make America Healthy Again,\u201d he added, repeating a phrase Trump often uses and links to Kennedy.",
      "Trump told NBC News on Sunday that he had not spoken to Kennedy about fluoride yet, \u201cbut it sounds OK to me. You know it\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "The former president declined to say whether he would seek a Cabinet role for Kennedy, a job that would require Senate confirmation, but added, \"He\u2019s going to have a big role in the administration.\u201d",
      "Asked whether banning certain vaccines would be on the table, Trump said he would talk to Kennedy and others about that. Trump described Kennedy as \"a very talented guy and has strong views.\u201d",
      "The sudden and unexpected weekend social media post evoked the chaotic policymaking that defined Trump\u2019s White House tenure, when he would issue policy declarations on Twitter at virtually all hours. It also underscored the concerns many experts have about Kennedy, who has long promoted debunked theories about vaccine safety, having influence over U.S. public health.",
      "In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and continued to promote it even after fluoride toothpaste brands hit the market several years later. Though fluoride can come from a number of sources, drinking water is the main source for Americans, researchers say.",
      "Officials lowered their recommendation for drinking water fluoride levels in 2015 to address a tooth condition called fluorosis, that can cause splotches on teeth and was becoming more common in U.S. kids.",
      "In August, a federal agency determined \u201cwith moderate confidence\u201d that there is a link between higher levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQ in kids. The National Toxicology Program based its conclusion on studies involving fluoride levels at about twice the recommended limit for drinking water.",
      "A federal judge later cited that study in ordering the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to further regulate fluoride in drinking water. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen cautioned that it\u2019s not certain that the amount of fluoride typically added to water is causing lower IQ in kids, but he concluded that mounting research points to an unreasonable risk that it could be. He ordered the EPA to take steps to lower that risk, but didn\u2019t say what those measures should be.",
      "In his X post Saturday, Kennedy tagged Michael Connett, the lead attorney representing the plaintiff in that lawsuit, the environmental advocacy group Food & Water Watch.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine organization has a lawsuit pending against news organizations including The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy is on leave from the group but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",
      "What role Kennedy might hold if Trump wins on Tuesday remains unclear. Kennedy recently told NewsNation that Trump asked him to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and some agencies under the Department of Agriculture.",
      "But for now, the former independent presidential candidate has become one of Trump's top surrogates. Trump frequently mentions having the support of Kennedy, a scion of a Democratic dynasty and the son of former Attorney General Robert Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy.",
      "Kennedy traveled with Trump Friday and spoke at his rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin.",
      "Trump said Saturday that he told Kennedy: \u201cYou can work on food, you can work on anything you want\" except oil policy.",
      "\u201cHe wants health, he wants women\u2019s health, he wants men\u2019s health, he wants kids, he wants everything,\" Trump added."

      "Maryland is the first state to sign an agreement with the federal government designed to improve health care and lower costs",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland became the first state on Friday to join a federal program designed to improve health care quality and equity while lowering costs for all health care payers, including Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers.",
      "It builds on Maryland\u2019s Total Cost of Care Model, which sets a per capita limit on Medicare\u2019s total cost of care in Maryland and encompasses the state\u2019s unique all-payer hospital payment system, which reduces per capita hospital expenditures and supports improved health outcomes, as encouraged by the Affordable Care Act.",
      "This new federal framework, known as the AHEAD model, has been designed to deliver high-quality health care through greater coordination, with a focus on health equity and social needs to support underserved patients.",
      "\u201cThe AHEAD model is the next chapter in health care, so we are proud to be writing that new chapter right here in the state of Maryland,\u201d said Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat who signed the agreement with U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure.",
      "Since the 1970s, Maryland has had a hospital all-payer system that enables the state to set its own rates for hospital services, and all payers must charge the same rate for services at a given hospital.",
      "It\u2019s designed to provide equitable access to care, eliminate the need for charity hospitals and ensure patients are treated the same regardless of insurance status. State law authorizes the system, which bases costs on rates set by hospitals. It has continued to be the foundation of each subsequent evolution of the Maryland health care model.",
      "\u201cMaryland has this unique system that we\u2019ve developed over a period of decades now,\u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, told reporters after a news conference in Annapolis. \u201cWe\u2019re taking it to the next level by signing this AHEAD agreement, and the bottom line is it helps us accomplish three top priorities: equity, quality, affordability. That\u2019s the goal.\u201d",
      "The Maryland Department of Health will now begin planning to implement the AHEAD model starting Jan. 1, 2025. That will include establishing targets for cost growth, quality and equity improvements, population health, and primary care investments as well as identifying regional partnerships to drive AHEAD goals.",
      "Sen. Ben Cardin said the agreement keeps in place state policy that health care providers receive the same pay for services, so hospitals have incentives to provide equal care, whether you have private insurance, government insurance, or no insurance.",
      "\u201cSecondly, we are now committed to making sure that we have the most effective quality care,\u201d said Cardin, a Democrat. \u201cSo, we invest in primary care. We invest in early detection, prevention, so that we can keep you healthier, so you don\u2019t have to spend as much time with health care needs.\u201d",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has selected five other states \u2014 Vermont, Connecticut, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and regions of New York\u2014 for participation in the AHEAD Model.",
      "\u201cMaryland\u2019s participation in the AHEAD Model is a critical step forward in improving the overall health of its residents, supporting primary care, transforming health care in communities throughout the state, and addressing disparities in the health care system,\u201d Brooks-LaSure said."

      "Louisiana\u2019s new law categorizing two widely used abortion drugs as controlled dangerous substances is being challenged in a state court lawsuit by a physician, a pharmacist, two women who had difficult pregnancies and others",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana's new law categorizing two widely used abortion drugs as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances\u201d was challenged in a state court lawsuit Thursday by a physician, a pharmacist and others who say the legislation sets up needless, dangerous delays in treatment during medical emergencies.",
      "Although there already was a near-total abortion ban in Louisiana, including by medication, the reclassification of the drugs \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol, which have other critical reproductive health care uses \u2014 went into effect earlier this month. Proponents of the law said more oversight and control over the drugs was needed to prevent coerced abortions. They have used as an example a Texas case in which a pregnant woman was given seven misoprostol pills by her husband without her knowledge. The baby survived.",
      "Doctors critical of the law have said it could harm patients facing emergency complications such as postpartum hemorrhages by requiring medical personnel to go through extra steps and more stringent storage requirements to use the drugs.",
      "\u201cEven short delays in accessing misoprostol can be life-threatening for postpartum hemorrhage patients,\u201d says the lawsuit. It says the law violates the Louisiana Constitution in multiple ways, including a prohibition on discrimination based on a person's physical condition.",
      "Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill said she had not seen the lawsuit as of Thursday afternoon. \u201cI can\u2019t respond to a lawsuit we have not seen, but I\u2019m confident this law is constitutional,\" she said in a statement. \"We will vigorously defend it.\u201d",
      "In addition to the physician and the pharmacist, who the lawsuit says is pregnant, the plaintiffs in the case include the Birthmark Doula Collective, an organization of people trained to provide pregnancy care before, during and after birth.",
      "Other plaintiffs include Nancy Davis, a woman who was denied an abortion in Louisiana and traveled out of state for one after learning her fetus would not survive. A woman who said she was turned away from two emergency rooms instead of being treated for a miscarriage is also part of the lawsuit.",
      "Prior to the reclassification, a prescription was still needed to obtain mifepristone and misoprostol in Louisiana. The new law reclassified the pills as \u201cSchedule IV drugs,\u201d putting them in the same category as the opioid tramadol and other substances that can be addictive.",
      "The new classification means that if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years.",
      "The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "The legislation is a first-of-its-kind law in the U.S. While GOP Gov. Jeff Landry, many Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion groups have touted the new classification, doctors have warned of deadly delays that the law could cause.",
      "Under the new classification, doctors say there are extra steps and more stringent storage requirements, which could slow access to the drugs in emergency situations. Beyond inducing abortions, the pills are also used to treat miscarriages, induce labor and stop hemorrhaging.",
      "Prior to the law, some doctors said that misoprostol would be stored in a box in the hospital room, on the delivery table or in a nurse's pocket. But under the new requirements of the classification, the drugs may be down the hall in a locked container or potentially in-house pharmacy at smaller hospitals.",

      "\u201cProviding affordable access to health care for low-income workers is a smart investment in our workforce, and it is exactly the business-minded approach that all of you would take in your own individual businesses,\u201d White said.",
      "The three-month legislative session begins in early January.",
      "White said some of his other big goals for the session are phasing out the state income tax, reducing the 7% sales tax on groceries and enacting a plan to let children attend public schools outside the districts where they live.",
      "Hosemann said the Senate will propose a reduction in the grocery tax. He did not list a phase-out of the income tax or a school choice plan among his policy priorities. He mentioned that Mississippi is already in a years-long process of reducing its personal income tax under a law enacted in 2022."

      "QUETTA, Pakistan -- A powerful bomb attached to a motorcycle exploded near a vehicle carrying police officers assigned to protect polio workers in restive southwest Pakistan on Friday, killing nine people including five nearby children, and wounding 17 other people, officials said.",
      "Local police chief Fateh Mohammad said the attack occurred in Mastung, a district in Balochistan province. He said a motorized rickshaw carrying schoolchildren was nearby when the bombing happened, resulting in the deaths of five children, a police officer and two passersby.",
      "Some of the wounded were moved to a hospital in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, said Wasim Baig, a spokesman for the health department. He said seven people died on the spot, while two men who had been critically wounded died at a hospital.",
      "No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack on police, but suspicion is likely to fall on separatist groups and Pakistani Taliban that have stepped up attacks on security forces and civilians in recent months.",
      "The police chief in Mastung, Rehmat Ullah, said a police van came under attack when it was heading to a health center to escort polio workers for the door-to-door campaign that began on Monday to vaccinate 45 million children under 5, following a surge in new cases.",
      "Pakistan has recorded 41 polio cases across 71 districts so far this year.",
      "The latest attack came days after militants attacked a health center used in the ongoing anti-polio campaign in northwestern district of Orakzai, triggering a shootout that left two policemen dead. Three of the attackers were also killed in the exchange of fire.",
      "Militants in Pakistan often target police and health workers during campaigns against polio, claiming the vaccination drives are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped.",
      "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the chief minister of Balochistan, Sarfraz Bugti, both denounced the bombing and vowed to continue the war against insurgents until they are eliminated from the country.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the attack, calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d and urging the government to investigate and ensure those responsible are brought to justice and held accountable, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.",

      "Many refugees in Uganda are struggling to get by without the food assistance they once depended on",
      "RWAMWANJA, Uganda -- For months, Agnes Bulaba, a Congolese refugee in Uganda, has had to get by without the food rations she once depended on. Her children scavenge among local communities for whatever they can find to eat.",
      "\u201cAs a woman who\u2019s not married, life is hard,\u201d Bulaba told The Associated Press. Some locals \u201ckeep throwing stones at us, but we just want to feed our kids and buy them some clothes,\u201d said the mother of six, who often works as a prostitute to fend for her family.",
      "Uganda is home to more than 1.7 million refugees, the largest refugee-hosting country in Africa, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Despite being renowned for welcoming those fleeing neighboring violence, Ugandan officials and humanitarians say dwindling international support coupled with high numbers of refugees have put much pressure on host communities.",
      "Approximately 10,000 new arrivals enter Uganda each month, according to U.N. figures. Some have recently fled the war in Sudan, but most are from neighboring South Sudan and Congo.",
      "Bulaba is among tens of thousands in Rwamwanja, a refugee settlement in southwestern Uganda. As in other settlements across the east African country, refugees there are given small plots of land to cultivate as they are slowly weaned off total dependence on humanitarian food rations.",
      "Since 2021, as funding consistently declined, the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program has prioritized the most vulnerable groups for food assistance, in food items or cash, which can be as little as $3. After spending three months in Uganda, refugees are eligible to get 60% rations, and the number falls by half after six months. Only new arrivals get 100% food assistance, leaving the vast majority of some 99,000 refugees in Bulaba's settlement vulnerable to hunger and other impoverishment.",
      "In 2017, the Ugandan government and the U.N. held a summit in Kampala, the capital, and appealed for $8 billion to deal with the sharp influx of refugees from South Sudan at the time. Only $350 million was pledged.",
      "Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, visited Uganda last week in a trip partly aimed to underscore the funding shortage.",
      "The international community \u201cshould not take Uganda\u2019s generosity and the global public good it provides for granted,\u201d Grandi said in a statement at the end of his visit. \u201cServices here are overstretched. Natural resources are limited, and financial support is not keeping pace with the needs.\u201d",
      "He also said international support \"is urgently needed to sustain Uganda\u2019s commitment to refugees,\u201d urging donors and humanitarian partners to \u201ccome together with the government to address the needs of refugees and the generous communities hosting them.\u201d",
      "Refugees in Uganda have access to the same hospitals as locals, and their children can attend school. While this helps integrate them into the Ugandan community, sometimes the competition for limited resources sparks tension. However, violence is rarely reported.",
      "Hillary Onek, the Ugandan government minister in charge of refugees, said during Grandi\u2019s visit that local officials need support to help refugees become more self-reliant. Though he said the country was \u201coverloaded\u201d with refugees, he cited several training options to help refugees become self-sufficient, including carpentry, bricklaying and metal welding.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to be innovative,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the fact that funding for refugee programs dwindled over the years, there is not enough money to meet their demands, not even giving them enough food to eat.\u201d",
      "Onek said the alternative is \u201cto survive on your own, using your skills, using whatever capacity you have.\u201d",
      "But Bulaba, the Congolese refugee who has been in Uganda since 2014 after fleeing violence in her home country with her two children, said she can't find a job. She has since had four other children who often go barefoot and without appropriate clothing. She misses the cash-for-food stipend she used to get.",

    "story": [
      "Some people who took a new schizophrenia drug for one year improved with only a few side effects, but many dropped out of the research",
      "Some people who took a new schizophrenia drug for a year improved with only a few side effects, but many dropped out of the research, the company announced Thursday.",
      "The results underscore the difficulties in treating schizophrenia, a severe mental illness that can cause people to hear voices, feel paranoid and withdraw from others. High dropout rates are typical in schizophrenia drug studies.",
      "Finding a drug that works can be a long ordeal punctuated by crises and hospitalizations. Side effects of existing medications \u2014 weight gain, tremors, restlessness \u2014 cause some people to stop taking medicine and relapse.",
      "There's been great hope among doctors for Cobenfy, which was approved in September, because it acts in the brain differently than other schizophrenia drugs. Instead of blocking dopamine receptors, Cobenfy\u2019s main ingredient, xanomeline, works on a different receptor that indirectly blocks dopamine release.",
      "Cobenfy also contains trospium, which blocks some of the side effects. The most common are nausea, vomiting and indigestion. In contrast to the weight gain seen with other schizophrenia drugs, people lost a few pounds while taking Cobenfy, made by Bristol Myers Squibb.",
      "Dr. John Krystal of Yale University has led research on other schizophrenia drugs but was not involved in the new studies. He noted that just 10% to 20% of participants in the new studies dropped out because of side effects.",
      "\u201cThat is pretty good,\u201d he said, noting that fewer or milder side effects could mean people will stay in treatment longer. That could mean fewer problems associated with untreated mental illness: substance use, homelessness and unemployment.",
      "So why did some patients stick with treatment while others dropped out? Krystal said it will be important to understand more about that as doctors start prescribing the drug.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved Cobenfy on the strength of two encouraging company-sponsored five-week trials and other safety data. The latest results announced Thursday at the Psych Congress meeting in Boston come from two longer studies, providing a fuller picture.",
      "In one study, focused on severely ill patients, 78% dropped out, leaving only 35 people for the final analysis. In the other, focused on more stable people, 51% left the study, leaving 283 who took the drug for a year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not any higher or any lower than what we typically see\u201d in schizophrenia studies, said Dr. Greg Mattingly of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Mattingly is a consultant for Bristol Myers Squibb and a researcher on one of the studies.",
      "In the more severely ill group, 69% of people had a meaningful improvement in their symptoms at the end of the year. In the other group, 30% saw a meaningful benefit.",
      "Results of interviews with a sample of study participants conducted by an independent research team and shared by Bristol Myers Squibb showed the likelihood of continuing treatment. After six months, 36 said they would continue taking Cobenfy after the trial if given the option; 10 said they would not. Some participants said the drug reduced the voices while others said it didn't work for them.",
      "The estimated yearly cost for Cobenfy is $22,500 compared to $540 for a generic antipsychotic. Krystal and others worry that insurers will require people to try cheaper drugs first before covering Cobenfy. Most patients\u2019 out-of-pocket costs will be much lower, depending on insurance and other factors.",
      "One cheaper generic called clozapine is widely considered one of the best treatments for schizophrenia, Krystal said. It is underused in the U.S. compared to some other countries because of a cumbersome blood testing program.",
      "The FDA started the blood tests to watch for the risk of severe neutropenia, a rare side effect which can be fatal. But doctors and families have told the FDA that patients have relapsed when their clozapine was withheld or delayed because of the testing requirements.",
      "Sally Littlefield, 29, of Alameda, California, said what works for her is a monthly injection of a long-acting antipsychotic medication. Littlefield, who has schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, wants to learn more about the experiences of people who've taken Cobenfy and not just from players with a financial stake.",
      "Mindy Greiling of Roseville, Minnesota, wants to see data on how Cobenfy compares to clozapine, which works for her 47-year-old son, Jim. Weight gain was a problem for him, but since taking diabetes medication, he\u2019s back to his normal weight, Greiling said.",
      "Cobenfy \u201cis getting a lot of ballyhoo, as any new drug does,\u201d Greiling said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a nonstarter for me unless it turns out that it\u2019s better than clozapine.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- The British government has apologized for the death of a 9-year-old girl who is believed to be the first person in the U.K. to have air pollution listed on her death certificate, after a decade-long battle that highlighted the risks vehicle emissions pose to children in low-income communities.",
      "The apology was part of a settlement announced Thursday in a lawsuit filed by the mother of Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who developed severe asthma just before her 7th birthday and suffered severe seizures before she died on Feb. 15, 2013. The government also made an undisclosed financial settlement.",
      "\u201cAlthough this isn\u2019t going to bring Ella back, we finally accept this is acknowledgement of what happened to her, and to put the issue of air pollution firmly on the map, that it\u2019s a public health crisis \u2026 and something needs to be done about it,\u2019\u2019 Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, Ella\u2019s mother, said after meeting with government officials. \u201cToday it is finally over, but I am going to continue, and I have been reassured by the government that they\u2019re going to be continuing to work with me to clean up the air.\u201d",
      "Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah fought to reopen the coroner\u2019s inquest into Ella\u2019s death after the so-called Dieselgate scandal revealed how Volkswagen obscured the true level of emissions released by its diesel-powered vehicles. Research by the Royal College of Physicians later showed that about 40,000 deaths can be attributed to outdoor air pollution each year in the U.K., with the burden falling most heavily on low-income communities close to busy roads and other major sources of emissions.",
      "Ella grew up just 25 meters (yards) from the South Circular Road, a major conduit for traffic along the southern edge of central London.",
      "Britain\u2019s High Court in May 2019 set aside the findings of the original inquest, which attributed Ella\u2019s death to asthma.",
      "In December 2020, a second inquest found that air pollution was a contributing factor in Ella\u2019s death, along with acute respiratory failure and severe asthma.",
      "Throughout her illness, Ella was exposed to levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter that exceeded World Health Organization guidelines, Deputy Coroner Philip Barlow ruled. There was also a \u201crecognized failure\u201d to bring nitrogen dioxide levels within the limits set by European Union and domestic law.",
      "\u201cElla\u2019s mother was not given information by health professionals about the health risks of air pollution and its potential to exacerbate asthma,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cIf she had been given this information, she would have taken steps which might have prevented Ella\u2019s death.\u201d",
      "The child's estate, which is administered by her mother, sued the Environment Department, the Department for Transport and the Department of Health and Social Care for compensation over Ella\u2019s illness and premature death.",
      "The government on Thursday described Ella\u2019s death as a \u201ctragedy,\u201d and said her mother\u2019s public campaign for better air quality had \u201cmade a considerable impact.\u201d",
      "Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said Environment Minister Emma Hardy reaffirmed her commitment to pass legislation that will bring the U.K. in line with WHO standards, according to a statement released by her law firm, Hodge Jones & Allen.",
      "\u201cOn behalf of the government departments who were party to the claim, we again take this opportunity to say we are truly sorry for your loss and to express our sincerest condolences to you as Ella\u2019s mother, to her siblings, and to everyone who knew her,\u2019\u2019 the government said in the statement. \u201cTo lose a loved one at such a young age is an immeasurable loss.\u201d"

      "A regional public health department in Idaho is no longer providing COVID-19 vaccines to residents in six counties after a narrow decision by its board.",
      "Southwest District Health appears to be the first in the nation to be restricted from giving COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccinations are an essential function of a public health department.",
      "While policymakers in Texas banned health departments from promoting COVID vaccines and Florida's surgeon general bucked medical consensus to recommend against the vaccine, governmental bodies across the country haven't blocked the vaccines outright.",
      "\u201cI'm not aware of anything else like this,\u201d said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials. She said health departments have stopped offering the vaccine because of cost or low demand, but not based on \u201ca judgment of the medical product itself.\u201d",
      "The six-county district along the Idaho-Oregon border includes three counties in the Boise metropolitan area. Demand for COVID vaccines in the health district has declined \u2014 with 1,601 given in 2021 to 64 so far in 2024. The same is true for other vaccines: Idaho has the highest childhood vaccination exemption rate in the nation, and last year, the Southwest District Health Department rushed to contain a rare measles outbreak that sickened 10.",
      "On Oct. 22, the health department\u2019s board voted 4-3 in favor of the ban \u2014 despite Southwest's medical director testifying to the vaccine's necessity.",
      "\u201cOur request of the board is that we would be able to carry and offer those (vaccines), recognizing that we always have these discussions of risks and benefits,\u201d Dr. Perry Jansen said at the meeting. \u201cThis is not a blind, everybody-gets-a-shot approach. This is a thoughtful approach.\u201d",
      "Opposite Jansen's plea were more than 290 public comments, many of which called for an end to vaccine mandates or taxpayer funding of the vaccines, neither of which are happening in the district. At the meeting, many people who spoke are nationally known for making the rounds to testify against COVID vaccines, including Dr. Peter McCullough, a Texas cardiologist who sells \u201ccontagion emergency kits\u201d that include ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine \u2014 drugs that have not been approved to treat COVID-19 and can have dangerous side effects.",
      "Board Chairman Kelly Aberasturi was familiar with many of the voices who wanted the ban, especially from earlier local protests of pandemic measures.",
      "Aberasturi, who told The Associated Press that he's skeptical of COVID-19 vaccines and national public health leaders, said in the meeting and in an interview with the AP that he was supportive of but \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the board's decision.",
      "He said the board had overstepped the relationship between patients and their doctors \u2014 and possibly opened a door to blocking other vaccines or treatments.",
      "Board members in favor of the decision argued people can get vaccinated elsewhere, and that providing the shots was equivalent to signing off on their safety. (Some people may be reluctant to get vaccinated or boosted because of misinformation about the shots despite evidence that they\u2019re safe and have saved millions of lives.)",
      "The people getting vaccinated at the health department \u2014 including people without housing, people who are homebound and those in long-term care facilities or in the immigration process \u2014 had no other options, Jansen and Aberasturi said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been homeless in my lifetime, so I understand how difficult it can be when you\u2019re ... trying to get by and get ahead,\u201d Aberasturi said. \u201cThis is where we should be stepping in and helping.",

It would allow regulations of abortions after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy if they relate to the health of the woman.",
      "\u201cWe find ourselves being caught between being way too extreme on the right end of the spectrum and not extreme enough on the left end of the spectrum,\u201d said Rick Weiland, co-founder of Dakotans for Health. \u201cWe think we're right in the middle.\u201d",
      "The anti-abortion campaign in South Dakota, like those elsewhere, is focused largely on portraying the amendment as too extreme. The Think Big money provided a new chance to do that.",
      "\u201cSouth Dakotans don\u2019t want extreme Chicago, San Francisco, and New York views tainting our great state,\u201d Life Defense Fund spokesperson Caroline Woods said in a statement.",
      "One anti-abortion group reported a $25,000 contribution last week from South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem's political action committee.",
      "Nebraska has competing ballot measures.",
      "One would allow abortion until viability, considered to be somewhere after 20 weeks. The other would bar abortion in most cases after the first 12 weeks \u2014 echoing current state law, but also allowing for a stricter one.",
      "The side pushing to keep restrictions is leading the fundraising race, with at least $9.8 million. One prominent family has supplied more than half of that. Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts has contributed more than $1 million, and his mother, Marlene Ricketts, has chipped in $4 million.",
      "The campaign for more access has raised at least $6.4 million.",
      "In most places, abortion-rights supporters have a big fundraising lead.",
      "In Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, Montana and Nevada, the opponents had each reported raising less than $2 million before Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, the groups promoting the questions in those states have all collected at least $5 million.",
      "The ballot questions have different circumstances.",
      "Missouri's amendment would open the door to blocking the state's current ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Proponents of the measure have raised more than $30 million to opponents' $1.5 million.",
      "In Arizona, passing the abortion amendment would roll back a ban after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy and instead allow it until fetal viability, and later in some cases. The state's Supreme Court ruled this year that an 1864 ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy could be enforced, but the Legislature promptly repealed it.",
      "Colorado is one of the few states that already has no gestational limits on when during pregnancy abortion can be obtained. Montana allows abortion until viability.",
      "Opponents of Nevada's measure have not reported any spending. To take effect, the amendment needs to pass this year and again in 2026.",
      "Fundraising has been low on both sides in Maryland, though Pritzker's fund says it's sending money there, and New York, where a ballot measure doesn't mention abortion specifically but would bar discrimination based on \"pregnancy outcomes and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\"",

      "The Fairness Project, which promotes progressive ballot measures, has contributed more than $30 million to abortion amendment campaigns since last year.",
      "Several other abortion-rights groups have contributed $5 million or more. No single entity on the anti-abortion side has reported giving that much.",
      "Groups that funded the majority of last year\u2019s campaign against an Ohio abortion-rights amendment that voters approved are absent from this year's list of big contributors.",
      "The Concord Fund, part of a network of political groups centered around conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, didn't show up in campaign finance reports until Wednesday, when a Missouri filing showed the group gave $1 million the day before to a group opposing the ballot measure there. Leo was a driving force in securing nominations of Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe.",
      "Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America has not been active on abortion ballot measures this year, but it is pumping money into the presidential race in support of Republican Donald Trump.",

      "Americans can start signing up Friday for health care coverage offered through the Affordable Care Act marketplace for 2025",
      "WASHINGTON -- Americans can start signing up Friday for health care coverage offered through the Affordable Care Act marketplace for 2025, days before a presidential election that could threaten eligibility and raise costs for millions of those in the program.",
      "The future of \u2018Obamacare\u2019 has emerged as a key issue in the closing days of the presidential campaign, with a top GOP leader promising this week to overhaul the program should Republican Donald Trump win the presidency.",
      "Billions of dollars in tax credits are also at stake. Established during the COVID-19 pandemic, the money has expanded eligibility for millions of Americans, made health insurance coverage more affordable for many and dramatically boosted enrollment.",
      "Nearly all of the 21 million people in the program have benefited from those subsidies, which expire next year, the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cAmericans can actually look at health care not as a privilege, but now as a right,\u201d said Becerra, who is going to the political swing state of Arizona on Friday to mark the beginning of open enrollment. \u201cI don't think anyone wants to have a right yanked away from them to have affordable health insurance coverage.\u201d",
      "But significant changes to the program are almost certain if Trump wins the White House and Republicans take control of Congress in Tuesday's contentious elections. They are threatening to scale back \u201cObamacare,\u201d a signature achievement of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat.",
      "On Monday, a key Trump ally, House Speaker Mike Johnson, declared \u201cNo Obamacare\u201d during a Pennsylvania campaign stop, promising \u201cmassive reform\u201d under a Trump presidency with a Republican-controlled Congress.",
      "\u201cHealth care reform\u2019s going to be a big part of the agenda,\u201d Johnson said in a video first obtained by NBC News.",
      "Johnson\u2019s office later issued a statement saying that he had no plans to completely repeal the landmark legislation, but the comments still underscored how Johnson is working closely with Trump to potentially remake the federal government and its social programs if Republicans sweep into power.",
      "Trump has only said that he has \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d to change the Affordable Care Act, which he was unable to successfully scuttle altogether during his previous term in office. In recent months, Republicans have raised concerns about spending and fraud.",
      "Enrollment under the Biden administration surged, after years of declines during the Trump administration, dropping to a low of 11 million on Trump's watch. But taxpayers have had to pour billions of dollars more into the Affordable Care Act to achieve that increase. That money has helped pay for subsidies to cut premiums by nearly half for many of those enrolled in the program.",
      "Congress would need to pass a new law to continue offering those subsidies, which could cost as much as $335 billion over the next decade. Some Republicans have already balked at that figure.",
      "Democrats have cautioned voters that Republicans will try to revive an attempt to kill the Affordable Care Act altogether, with the warnings growing more dire as Election Day nears.",
      "In Wisconsin, Vice President Kamala Harris issued the warning again, telling reporters that Johnson's remarks prove Republicans plan to gut the health care coverage. \u201c It has been a part of Donald Trump\u2019s agenda for a very long time,\" Harris said. \u201cHe has made dozens of attempts to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And now we have further validation of that agenda from his supporter, the speaker of the House.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration has expanded the program in other ways that Harris is likely to continue, but Trump is sure to pull back on. For example, the administration poured more money into hiring health insurance navigators who help enroll people into coverage.",
      "The White House also implemented a new rule that expands eligibility for the program to immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. About 100,000 of those immigrants, also called \u201cDreamers\u201d are expected to sign up for the coverage for the first time during enrollment this year.",
      "Republican attorneys general in 15 states have sued to block their enrollment.",
      "Open enrollment for the coverage ends on Jan. 15, but to have coverage in the new year you must enroll by Dec. 15.",
      "\u2014-",

      "There's little to distinguish the village of Thulasendrapuram from any other rural community in Tamil Nadu, except its connection to a woman who could become America's first leader with South Asian roots.",
      "As millions of Americans vote, Harris has people rooting for her from thousands of miles away in a village surrounded by rice paddies and coconut trees, where her mother's family has ancestral ties. They talk about her at the local tea shop. Banners and billboards bearing her face are seen throughout the community.",
      "\u201cOur deity is a very powerful God. If we pray well to him, he will make her victorious,\u201d said M. Natarajan, the temple priest that led the prayers in front of the image of Hindu deity Ayyanar, a form of Lord Shiva.",
      "Harris\u2019 maternal grandfather was born in the village, about 350 kilometers (215 miles) from the southern coastal city of Chennai, more than 100 years ago. As an adult, he moved to Chennai, where he worked as a high-ranking government official until his retirement.",

      "Other than trips during her childhood, Harris hasn\u2019t visited India much \u2014 particularly not since becoming vice president \u2014 but she has often spoken emotionally about her ties to her late mother\u2019s country of birth. On Tuesday, she released a campaign video highlighting her mother, who arrived in the U.S. at age 19 and became a cancer researcher.",
      "Titled \u201cMother,\u201d the video ends with a narrator saying: \u201cThis daughter of Shyamala, this daughter of the American story, is ready to lead us forward.\u201d",
      "Harris has often talked about how she was guided by the values of her Indian-born grandfather and mother. She has also spoken of her love of south Indian food, especially a type of steamed rice cake called idli.",
      "Harris\u2019 name is engraved in a list of donors \u2014 her aunt Sarala Gopalan gave money to the temple in her name \u2014 along with that of her grandfather. Outside, a large banner wishes \u201cthe daughter of the land\u201d success in the election.",
      "On Tuesday, the village temple also received rare international visitors: two American tourists and one from the U.K., all wearing black t-shirts that said \u201cKamala Freakin Harris.\u201d",
      "Manikandan Ganesan, a villager who runs a small store near the temple, said Harris\u2019 bid for the presidency has made the village famous. He hopes Harris will eventually visit them.",
      "\u201cEven if she mentioned that she would visit our village, it would make us very happy,\u201d Ganesan said. \u201cHer victory itself will be a big source of happiness for us.\u201d",

Some said they had hardly eaten, with aid cut off for weeks to the most isolated and heavily destroyed part of the territory.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s privacy watchdog on Tuesday fined social media company Meta 21.6 billion won ($15 million) for illegally collecting sensitive personal information from Facebook users, including data about their political views and sexual orientation, and sharing it with thousands of advertisers.",
      "It was the latest in a series of penalties against Meta by South Korean authorities in recent years as they increase their scrutiny of how the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, handles private information.",
      "Following a four-year investigation, South Korea\u2019s Personal Information Protection Commission concluded that Meta unlawfully collected sensitive information about around 980,000 Facebook users, including their religion, political views and whether they were in same-sex unions, from July 2018 to March 2022.",
      "It said the company shared the data with around 4,000 advertisers.",

      "The company categorized ads to identify users interested in themes such as specific religions, same-sex and transgender issues, and issues related to North Korean escapees, said Lee Eun Jung, a director at the commission who led the investigation on Meta.",
      "\u201cWhile Meta collected this sensitive information and used it for individualized services, they made only vague mentions of this use in their data policy and did not obtain specific consent,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Lee also said Meta put the privacy of Facebook users at risk by failing to implement basic security measures such as removing or blocking inactive pages. As a result, hackers were able to use inactive pages to forge identities and request password resets for the accounts of other Facebook users. Meta approved these requests without proper verification, which resulted in data breaches affecting at least 10 South Korean Facebook users, Lee said.",
      "In September, European regulators hit Meta with over $100 million in fines for a 2019 security lapse in which user passwords were temporarily exposed in an un-encrypted form.",

      "The commission said then that the two companies didn\u2019t clearly inform users or obtain their consent to collect data about them as they used other websites or services outside their own platforms. It ordered the companies to provide an \u201ceasy and clear\u201d consent process to give people more control over whether to share information about what they do online.",
      "The commission also hit Meta with a 6.7 billion won ($4.8 million) fine in 2020 for providing personal information about itsx users to third parties without consent."

      "Qatar is voting in a snap poll to decide whether to end its limited voting for legislative seats",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Qatar voted in a snap poll Tuesday to decide whether to end its limited voting for legislative seats, a measure likely to pass and end the country's short-lived experiment in electing members of the advisory Shura Council.",
      "Voting took place as the world's attention focused on the U.S. presidential election, with even Qatar\u2019s state-funded satellite news network Al Jazeera offering brief acknowledgments of the vote wedged between coverage of the U.S. election and the Mideast wars. Though Qatar's ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, announced last month a vote would take place, it was only Sunday that authorities announced the date of the poll.",
      "Voting ran for 12 hours and ended at 7 p.m. local time. Results are expected on Wednesday. All Qatari employees in the country were also granted permission to leave work from 11 a.m. to vote.",
      "Qatar's state news agency described the voting as \u201can enthusiastic atmosphere and a historic moment, clearly confirming everyone\u2019s keenness to make this national celebration a success.\u201d",
      "The vote will \u201cstrengthen the social fabric in the most beautiful image and form, which honestly represents an important stage in the country\u2019s victorious march and its national unity,\u201d the news agency added.",
      "Qatar first introduced plans for legislative elections in its 2003 constitution, but authorities repeatedly postponed implementing the vote. The country finally held elections for two-thirds of the Shura Council, which drafts laws, approves state budgets and advises the ruler, in October 2021.",
      "The elections came after the end of a boycott of Qatar by Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that tore the Gulf Arab states apart. It also came about a year ahead of Qatar hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, an event that drew intense scrutiny from the West of the country's treatment of foreign laborers and its system of governance.",
      "Qatar remains an important nation to the West as it hosted the Taliban and assisted in the chaotic 2021 NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan and as a mediator as the Israel-Hamas war rages in the Gaza Strip and has expanded to Lebanon.",
      "But the elections created problems in the energy-rich nation. Electoral law distinguishes between born and naturalized Qatari citizens and bars the latter from electoral participation. Human Rights Watch described the system as \u201cdiscriminatory,\u201d excluding thousands of Qataris from running or voting. The disqualifications sparked minor protests that led to several arrests.",
      "In announcing the vote on changing the constitution, Sheikh Tamim said: \u201cThe contest between candidates for membership in the Shura Council took place within families and tribes, and there are different views regarding the repercussions of such competition on our norms, traditions, as well as the conventional social institutions and their cohesion.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe contest assumes an identity-based character that we are not equipped to handle, with potential complications over time that we would rather avoid,\" he added.",
      "The vote marks yet another rollback in the hereditarily ruled Gulf Arab states of halting steps to embrace representational rule following efforts by the United States to push harder for democratic reforms in the Middle East after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Hopes for democracy in the region also rose in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring.",
      "In May, the ruler of oil-rich Kuwait dissolved his country\u2019s parliament for as much as four years. While the Kuwaiti parliament had struggled, it represented the Gulf Arab state\u2019s most free-wheeling legislative body and could challenge the country\u2019s rulers."

      "The protest started peacefully but some demonstrators later hurled plastic bottles and bricks at the headquarters of Vucic\u2019s ruling Serbian Progressive Party and smeared red paint on posters of the Serbian president and the prime minister \u2014 a message that they have blood on their hands.",
      "The protesters removed most of the Serbian national red, blue and white national flags that were apparently hung on the headquarters to prevent it from an attack. That triggered an angry reaction from the president.",
      "\u201cOur Serbian tri-color has been destroyed, hidden and removed by all those who do not love Serbia,\u201d Vucic wrote on X. \u201cTonight, in Novi Sad, this is being done by those who tell us that they love Serbia more than us, the decent citizens of this country.\u201d",
      "As protests wound down later in the evening, Vucic made a surprise trip to Novi Sad and made a brief appearance before his several hundred supporters gathered outside the party headquarters.",
      "Critics of Serbia\u2019s populist government have attributed the disaster to rampant corruption in the Balkan country, a lack of transparency and sloppy work during renovation work on the station building which was part of a wider railway deal with Chinese state companies.",
      "The accident happened without warning. Surveillance camera footage showed the massive canopy on the outer wall of the station building crashing down on the people sitting below on benches or going in and out.",
      "Officials have promised full accountability and, faced with pressure, Serbia\u2019s construction minister submitted his resignation on Tuesday.",
      "Prosecutors have said that more than 40 people already have been questioned as part of a probe into what happened. Many in Serbia, however, doubt that justice will be served with the populists in firm control of the judicial system and the police.",
      "Opposition parties behind Tuesday\u2019s protest said they are also demanding the resignation of Vucevic and that documentation be made public listing all the companies and individuals involved.",
      "The victims included a 6-year-old girl. Those injured in the roof collapse remained in serious condition on Tuesday.",
      "The train station has been renovated twice in recent years. Officials have insisted that the canopy had not been part of the renovation work, suggesting this was the reason why it collapsed but giving no explanation for why it was not included.",
      "The Novi Sad railway station was originally built in 1964, while the renovated station was inaugurated by Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest."

      "On Tuesday, voters also will be asked for a seventh time about Puerto Rico\u2019s political status. The nonbinding referendum offers three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated.",

      "MALMO, Sweden -- A Swedish court sentenced on Tuesday a far-right politician to four months in jail for two counts of \u201cincitement against an ethnic group\u201d after making hateful comments at political rallies two years ago.",
      "The Danish-Swedish 42-year-old man, who was not named but has been identified by Swedish media as Rasmus Paludan, founder and head of the Danish nationalist anti-immigration party Stram Kurs, had been previously convicted and sentenced by a Danish court on a similar charge, the Malmo District Court said.",
      "In 2022, Paludan made his offensive remarks directed at Muslims, Arabs and Africans during protests that he led in the southern city of Malmo in 2022, the court said. He also burned a copy of the Quran, Islam's holy book, on at least one occasion. In response, a violent wave of riots swept the country.",
      "Some observers also say Paludan\u2019s actions may have momentarily risked Sweden\u2019s chances of joining NATO after increasing political tensions with Turkey. Sweden joined the alliance in March this year.",
      "The court in a statement Tuesday said Paludan's remarks against Muslims \u201ccannot be excused as criticism of Islam or as political campaign work.\u201d",
      "Chief Councilor Nicklas S\u00f6derberg, the court\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cIt is permitted to publicly make critical statements about, for example, Islam and also Muslims, but the disrespect of a group of people must not clearly cross the line for a factual and valid discussion.\"",
      "He added that during the Malmo rallies in April and September 2022 \u201cthere was no question of any such discussion,\u201d and that Paludan\u2019s public statements \u201conly amounted to insulting Muslims.\"",
      "The court took particular interest in whether the politician knew the protests were filmed and published on Facebook. Paludan had said that he wasn't aware of it but the district court disagreed and said his \u201cactions at the gatherings would be downright illogical if he didn\u2019t know about the publication on Facebook.\u201d",
      "Paludan, a lawyer by profession, told Swedish media outlets that he wasn\u2019t surprised by the verdict.",
      "\u201cIt was expected. We will appeal,\u201d the Swedish newspaper Expressen cited him as saying."

      "Now he plans to be a farmer, he said Tuesday.",
      "In a statement of support last month from Cambodian media organizations and civil society groups, Mech Dara was praised as \u201ca front-line investigative journalist whose stories over the last decade have uncovered corruption, environmental destruction, and human trafficking at scam compounds across the country, and has consistently pushed for accountability and justice.\u201d",

      "Mech Dara recalled he spent 12 years working as journalist, for the Cambodia Daily and the Phnom Penh Post, two once-vibrant English-language newspapers forced to shut down under government pressure, and the Voice of Democracy radio and website, which was closed by the government last year. Now 36 years old, he had since then been working as a freelancer.",
      "\u201cIn fact, I had been determined to keep working as a journalist for many years to come,\u201d he said, \u201cand to overcome all the obstacles I would meet.\"",
      "But a few weeks spent in jail, with poor prospects of prevailing in court, changed his mind. Cambodia\u2019s government has long been accused of using the judicial system to persecute critics and political opponents.",
      "Mech Dara was arrested on Sept. 30 by a posse of military police at a toll booth as he was returning with his family to the capital Phnom Penh from a seaside holiday. The next day, he was formally charged with incitement to commit a felony or cause social disorder for items he posted online in late September. The offense carried a penalty of imprisonment for six months to two years, along with a fine.",
      "Mech Dara said his initial, all-night interrogation was rough. He was in handcuffs and flanked by two policemen armed with AK-47 assault rifles as he was questioned. And they walked him up and down from the ground floor to the second floor, again and again, threatening him repeatedly.",
      "Matters didn\u2019t improve when he was sent to pre-trial detention at the Kandal provincial prison.",
      "He neither slept nor ate well in the narrow, overcrowded cell where he was kept for more than three weeks. He said he saw prisoners slapping and punching each other and fainting, and heard of others dying. It made him wonder \u201cwhether or not I could see tomorrow and if the next day it could be me.\"",
      "Adding to his concerns were his existing health problems, including Hepatitis B.",
      "At the same time, he realized that the prospects of earning a living as a reporter were shrinking, especially because as a freelance journalist it was difficult to get licensed by the Information Ministry,.",
      "His situation took a new turn on Oct. 23, when Fresh News, a pro-government media outlet, published a video of him in an orange prison uniform, apologizing to Prime Minister Hun Manet and former Prime Minister Hun Sen, who is now president of the Senate. Hun Manet succeeded his long-serving father as prime minister last year but so far has shown little more tolerance for criticism.",
      "In a minute-long clip, Mech Dara stated he had posted five instances of false information in the past that were harmful to Cambodia and its leaders, and he promised not to post false information in the future.",
      "The next day he was released on bail.",
      "The most recent adjustment to his situation came on Monday, when Hun Manet on his Facebook page shared two photographs of him and Mech Dara, one in which they hugged each other, and another of them sitting face to face,.",
      "Hun Manet said he had met Mech Dara and they talked about several topics, such as freedom of expression and the responsibility of journalists to publish true information, and to adhere to their professional code of ethics.",

The costume really impacts how you carry your body, and that posture influences your mind, giving character to this woman of state.\u201d",
      "The production underscored a growing trend in Paris of using light technology to show off the city's storied church interiors.

      "LILLE, France -- A French court found 18 people guilty Tuesday in a major migrant-smuggling trial that shed light on the lucrative but often deadly clandestine business of transporting people on flimsy boats across the perilous sea from France to the U.K.",
      "The defendants were swept up in a pan-European police operation in 2022 that led to dozens of arrests and the seizure of boats, life jackets, outboard engines, paddles, and cash.",
      "The court in Lille, northern France, sentenced one of the ringleaders, Mirkhan Rasoul, a 26-year-old from Iraq, to 15 years in prison and a fine of 200,000 euros ($218,000). Rasoul attended the trial in a secured plexiglass box and under the surveillance of armed police.",
      "Other sentences ranged from two years to 10 years in prison.",
      "\u201cThese sentences are obviously very severe,\u201d said Kamel Abbas, a lawyer who represented one of the defendants already imprisoned in France. \u201cThat\u2019s a testimony of the scale of the case, and of the intention to severely punish the smugglers.\u201d",
      "Most of the defendants were not in court for the verdicts and sentencing. Some attended the trial remotely from various prisons in northern France, while others are not in custody. Fourteen of the 18 defendants were from Iraq, with the others from Iran, Poland, France and the Netherlands.",
      "Each of the defendants, except for the one from France, was given a ban on remaining on French territory after serving their sentence.",
      "Craig Turner, deputy director of the British National Crime Agency (NCA), involved in the arrest of one of the defendants, said the network was one of the most prolific organizers of crossings.",

      "WICHITA, KANSAS -- Sobs of relief broke out in a federal courtroom in Kansas on Monday as dozens of people whose life savings had been embezzled by a bank CEO learned that federal law enforcement had recovered their money.",
      "\"I just can\u2019t describe the weight lifted off of us,\u201d said Bart Camilli, 70, who with his wife Cleo had just learned they\u2019d recover close to $450,000 \u2014 money Bart began saving at 18 when he bought his first individual retirement account. \u201cIt\u2019s life-changing.\u201d",
      "In August, former Kansas bank CEO Shan Hanes was sentenced to 24 years after stealing $47 million from customer accounts and wiring the money to cryptocurrency accounts run by scammers. Prosecutors said Hanes also stole $40,000 from his church, $10,000 from an investment club and $60,000 from his daughter\u2019s college fund and lost $1.1 million of his own in the scheme. Deposits were \u201cjettisoned into the ether,\u201d said prosecutor Aaron Smith.",
      "Hanes' Heartland Tri-State Bank, drained of cash, was shut down by federal regulators and sold to another financial institution. Customers\u2019 savings and checking accounts amounting to $47.1 million were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which paid off their losses.",
      "But there were still 30 shareholders of the community-owned rural bank Hanes helped found \u2014 including his close family friends and neighbors \u2014 who thought they lost $8.3 million in investments: well-planned retirements were upended, funds for long-term eldercare gone, education funds and bequests for children and grandchildren zeroed out.",
      "On Monday the shareholders stood to cheer federal Judge John W. Broomes in Wichita after he told them, one at a time, that they\u2019d be paid back in full. The FBI recovered the funds from a cryptocurrency account held by Tether Ltd. in the Cayman Islands.",
      "During an earlier sentencing hearing, these victims had called Hanes a \u201cdeceitful cheat and a liar,\u201d and \u201cpure evil.\u201d",
      "Margaret Grice came to court Monday figuring she\u2019d get $1,000 back. Instead, she learned she\u2019d be recovering almost $250,000, her entire 401(k).",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just really thrilled,\u201d she said. \u201cI can breathe.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said Hanes, who was the CEO of Heartland Tri-State Bank in Elkhart, Kansas, lost the money in a scam referred to as \u201cpig butchering,\u201d or the way pigs are fattened before slaughter. In the scam, a third party gains a victims' trust and, over time, convinces them to invest all of their money into cryptocurrency, which immediately disappears. U.S. and U.N. officials say these schemes are proliferating, with scammers largely in Southeast Asia increasingly taking advantage of Americans.",
      "Hanes started buying what he thought was $5,000 in cryptocurrency in late 2022, communicating with someone who had reached out on WhatsApp, according to court records. A few months later he transferred over his church and investment club funds. Records show the scam accelerated in the summer of 2023, when Hanes wired $47.1 million out of customer accounts in 11 wire transfers over just eight weeks. Each transfer, he thought, was necessary to end the investment and cash out, court records said. He watched, on a fake website, as the money appeared to grow to more than $200 million.",
      "\u201cHe was to take some of the money, and the rest of the money was supposed to go back to the bank,\u201d his attorney John Stang explained. \u201cNow it's fiction, it didn't exist. We all know that now ... It failed big time.\u201d",
      "Hanes, who was not in court Monday, apologized at an earlier sentencing hearing.",
      "\u201cFrom the deepest depth of my soul, I had no intention of ever causing the harm that I did,\" he said. \u201dI\u2019ll forever struggle to understand how I was duped and how what I thought was just getting the money back was making it worse.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Hanes wasn\u2019t just the victim of a scam, he crossed a line when he began taking customers' money and violating banking regulations. He pleaded guilty to embezzlement by a bank officer in May.",
      "His prominent standing in his hometown of 2,000 made it easier for him to get away with it, a Federal Reserve System investigation found; he had been on the school board, volunteered as a swim meet official, and served on the Kansas Bankers Association.",
      "He also was a banking leader beyond his rural community. In recent years, he testified to Congressional committees about the importance of local banks in farming communities, and he served as a director for the American Bankers Association, which represents almost all banking assets in the U.S.",
      "On Monday, prosecutors said the FDIC wanted to be paid back for the insurance claims it reimbursed to bank customers. But Judge Broomes said the economic circumstances of shareholders \u201cwho became insolvent because of a fraud scheme\u201d justified paying them back first, before the FDIC recovers anything.",
      "Hanes, 53, may be in his late 70s when he is released and is unlikely to be able to pay the FDIC the $47.1 million still owed.",
      "In a court filing, Hanes and his attorney tried to explain what had happened.",
      "\u201cMr. Hanes made some very bad choices after being caught up in an extremely well-run cryptocurrency scam,\u201d they said. \u201cHe was the pig that was butchered.\u201d"

      "It was the latest in a series of penalties against Meta by South Korean authorities in recent years as they increase their scrutiny of how the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, handles private information.",
      "Following a four-year investigation, South Korea\u2019s Personal Information Protection Commission concluded that Meta unlawfully collected sensitive information about around 980,000 Facebook users, including their religion, political views and whether they were in same-sex unions, from July 2018 to March 2022.",
      "It said the company shared the data with around 4,000 advertisers.",
      "South Korea\u2019s privacy law provides strict protection for information related to personal beliefs, political views and sexual behavior, and bars companies from processing or using such data without the specific consent of the person involved.",

      "The company categorized ads to identify users interested in themes such as specific religions, same-sex and transgender issues, and issues related to North Korean escapees, said Lee Eun Jung, a director at the commission who led the investigation on Meta.",
      "\u201cWhile Meta collected this sensitive information and used it for individualized services, they made only vague mentions of this use in their data policy and did not obtain specific consent,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Lee also said Meta put the privacy of Facebook users at risk by failing to implement basic security measures such as removing or blocking inactive pages. As a result, hackers were able to use inactive pages to forge identities and request password resets for the accounts of other Facebook users. Meta approved these requests without proper verification, which resulted in data breaches affecting at least 10 South Korean Facebook users, Lee said.",
      "In September, European regulators hit Meta with over $100 million in fines for a 2019 security lapse in which user passwords were temporarily exposed in an un-encrypted form.",

    "summary": "Factory workers at Boeing have voted to accept a contract offer and end their strike after more than seven weeks",

      "Factory workers at Boeing have voted to accept a contract offer and end their strike after more than seven weeks",
      "SEATTLE -- Factory workers at Boeing have voted to accept a contract offer and end their strike after more than seven weeks, clearing the way for the company to restart idled Pacific Northwest assembly lines.",
      "But the strike was just one of many challenges the troubled U.S. aerospace giant faces as it works to return to profitability and regain public confidence.",
      "Boeing\u2019s 33,000 striking machinists disbanded their picket lines late Monday after leaders of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers district in Seattle said 59% of union members who cast ballots agreed to approve the company\u2019s fourth formal offer, which included a 38% wage increase over four years.",
      "Union machinists assemble the 737 Max, Boeing\u2019s bestselling airliner, along with the 777 or \u201ctriple-seven\u201d jet and the 767 cargo plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington. Resuming production will allow Boeing to generate much-needed cash, which it has been bleeding.",
      "\u201cEven for a company the size of Boeing, it is a life-threatening problem,\u201d said Gautam Mukunda, lecturer at the Yale School of Management.",
      "The union said its workers can return to work as soon as Wednesday or as late as Nov. 12. Boeing CEO Kelly  Ortberg has said it might take \u201ca couple of weeks\u201d to resume production in part because some workers might need retraining.",
      "As the machinists get back to work, management will have to address a host of other problems. The company needs to get on better financial footing. But while doing so, it also needs to prioritize the quality of its workmanship and its relationships with employees and suppliers, analysts said.",
      "Boeing has been managing itself to meet short-term profit goals and \u201csqueezing every stakeholder, squeezing every employee, every supplier to the point of failure in order in order to maximize their short-term financial performance,\u201d Mukunda said. \u201cThat is bad enough if you run a clothing company. It is unacceptable when you are building the most complex mass-produced machines human beings have ever built.\u201d",
      "Above all, Boeing needs to produce more planes. When workers are back and production resumes, the company will be producing about 30 737s a month, and \u201cthey must get that number over 50. They have to do it. And the people who are going to do that are the workers on the factory floor,\u201d Mukunda said.",
      "Another challenge will be getting the company's fragile supply chain running again, said Cai von Rumohr, an aviation analyst at financial services firm TD Cowen. Suppliers that were working ahead of Boeing\u2019s schedule when the strike began may have had to lay workers off or finance operations on their own.",
      "\"There are lots of nasty questions in terms of complexities that go into revamping the supply chain,\u201d he said.",
      "One way Boeing could generate cash would be to sell companies that don\u2019t fit directly in the business, such as flight information provider Jeppesen Sanderson, which it bought in 2000 for $1.5 billion, von Rumohr said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019d lose some earnings but they\u2019d get a lot of cash to reduce their debt,\u201d he added. \u201cThey really need to get to a more stable position where they have a solid credit rating.\u201d",
      "Ortberg acknowledged the challenges ahead in a message to employees after they voted to end the walkout.",
      "\u201cThere is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company,\" he said.",
      "The average annual pay of Boeing machinists is currently $75,608 and eventually will rise to $119,309 under the new contract, according to the company. The union said the compounded value of the promised pay raise would amount to an increase of more than 43% over the life of the agreement.",
      "Reactions were mixed even among union members who voted to accept the contract.",
      "Although she voted \u201cyes,\u201d Seattle-based calibration specialist Eep Bola\u00f1o said the outcome was \u201cmost certainly not a victory.\u201d Bola\u00f1o said she and her fellow workers made a wise but infuriating choice to accept the offer.",
      "\u201cWe were threatened by a company that was crippled, dying, bleeding on the ground, and us as one of the biggest unions in the country couldn't even extract two-thirds of our demands from them. This is humiliating,\" she said.",
      "For other workers like William Gardiner, a lab lead in calibration services, the revised offer was a cause for celebration.",
      "\u201cI'm extremely pumped over this vote,\u201d said Gardiner, who has worked for Boeing for 13 years. \u201cWe didn't fix everything \u2014 that's OK. Overall, it's a very positive contract.\u201d",
      "Along with the wage increase, the new contract gives each worker a $12,000 ratification bonus and retains a performance bonus the company wanted to eliminate.",
      "President Joe Biden congratulated the machinists and Boeing for coming to an agreement that he said supports fairness in the workplace and improves workers\u2019 ability to retire with dignity. The contract, he said, is important for Boeing\u2019s future as \u201ca critical part of America\u2019s aerospace sector.\u201d",
      "A continuing strike would have plunged Boeing into further financial peril and uncertainty. Last month, Ortberg announced plans to lay off about 17,000 people and a stock sale to prevent the company\u2019s credit rating from being cut to junk status.",
      "The labor standoff \u2014 the first strike by Boeing machinists since an eight-week walkout in 2008 \u2014 was the latest setback in a volatile year for the aerospace giant.",
      "Boeing came under several federal investigations this year after a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Federal regulators put limits on Boeing airplane production that they said would last until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at the company.",
      "The door-plug incident renewed concerns about the safety of the 737 Max. Two of the planes had crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. The CEO at the time, whose efforts to fix the company failed, announced in March that he would step down. In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving regulators who approved the 737 Max.",

      "His brother managed to survive, clinging to a fence. He and his family had been caught in traffic driving home to Paiporta on Valencia's southern outskirts, Tarazona said. They had no chance to escape when the tsunami-like wave quickly overflowed the nearby drainage canal and swept away everything in its path.",
      "\u201cThey did not have time to do anything,\u201d Tarazona told The Associated Press, a week after the Oct. 29 flash floods. \u201cMy brother was dragged away and ended up clinging to a fence.\" His sister-in-law \"could not get out and died with her little girl.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt all happened so fast,\u201d he said, tears coming to his eyes. \u201cIn half an hour the current had carried away the car. There was no time, no time. She managed to send me the location of their car hoping for a rescue.",

      "The destruction, however, went far beyond Paiporta and covers a huge swath of municipalities, above all on the southern flank of Valencia city on the Mediterranean coast. Seventy-eight localities had at least one person die from the floods. Police have expanded their search to the nearby marshes and coastline, where the waters carried some away.",
      "The residents, businesses and town councils of the affected localities can apply for financial help from a 10.6-billion-euro relief package from Spain's government. The regional Valencia government, which is being slammed for not alerting the populace of the danger in time, has asked the central government in Madrid for 31 billion euros to ensure the recovery.",
      "Over a week later, the cleanup goes on to get rid of tons of mud and debris that clog street after street, filling thousands of ground floors, destroying living rooms and kitchens. Neighborhoods were left without shops and supermarkets after all their products were ruined. Many houses still don\u00b4t have drinking water.",

      "Profit for the first nine months of 2024 was $83.9 billion, down from $94.5 billion the year before.",
      "Oil prices have been depressed over recent days as tensions in the Middle East appear to have receded slightly and as China's economy has slowed. Benchmark Brent crude traded Tuesday at around $75 a barrel.",
      "Aramco will pay dividends of $20.28 billion for the third quarter and a performance-linked dividend of $10.77 billion, the company said. It has said it hopes its overall dividend for the year will be over $124 billion.",
      "While a sliver of Aramco trades on the Tadawul, the vast majority is held by Saudi Arabia\u2019s government, fueling its expenditures and providing wealth to its Al Saud royal family. The company also serves as a bellwether for the global oil industry.",
      "Stock in Aramco traded around $7.31 a share Tuesday, down from a high this year of over $9. It has fallen over the past year as oil prices have dropped.",
      "Aramco has a market value of $1.7 trillion, making it the world\u2019s sixth-most valuable company behind Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet which owns Google, and Amazon.",
      "Aramco reported a $121 billion annual profit in 2023, down from its 2022 record due to lower energy prices.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s vast oil resources, located close to the surface of its desert expanse, make it one of the world\u2019s least expensive places to produce crude. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hopes to use the oil wealth to pivot the kingdom off oil sales, through projects such as his planned $500 billion futuristic desert city, called Neom. But lower oil prices have Saudi Arabia reportedly looking at curtailing some of those ambitions as the kingdom likely faces looming budget deficits.",
      "Meanwhile, activists criticized the profits amid global concerns about the burning of fossil fuels accelerating climate change."

      "A vocational school student in China who wowed the public in June by finishing near the top in the preliminary round of a math contest was helped by her teacher in violation of the rules, the organizers said this week.",
      "An investigation found that the math teacher's assistance broke a rule of \u201cno discussion with others,\u201d the Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition Organizing Committee said Sunday. It wasn't clear how much of a difference the help made.",

      "State police have destroyed tens of thousands of pounds of marijuana plants at greenhouses in northwestern New Mexico",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- State police have destroyed tens of thousands of pounds of marijuana plants at greenhouses in northwestern New Mexico, marking what regulators say is the largest seizure and destruction of cannabis in New Mexico since new possession and cultivation laws took effect in 2021.",
      "Authorities announced the operation Monday, saying dozens of agents were assigned to eradicate the plants in October. The state Cannabis Control Division had started the process of revoking the license of NNK Equity LLC, having filed a noncompliance order and a default order earlier this year.",
      "The company was accused of not posting its licenses on site, failing to obtain water rights for cultivation, not having cameras that could monitor certain areas of its operation and violating sanitation and health requirements.",
      "\u201cThe organization involved showed a blatant disregard for the laws of this state and we will prove that once this investigation is over,\u201d New Mexico State Police Chief Troy Weisler said in a statement.",
      "Jacob Candelaria, an Albuquerque attorney who represents NNK Equity, disputed the state's claims and accused regulators and state police of violating his client's civil rights. He said the state failed to properly serve notice of its intent to revoke the company's license and subsequently denied a request for a hearing on the merits of the case.",
      "He said clients Irving Lin and Bao Xue speak Mandarin Chinese and have limited ability to understand the written English language. Lin asked for a Chinese translation, but the attorney said regulators did not respond to his request.",
      "The Cannabis Control Division stated in filings related to the case that it complied with notice and hearing requirements and had afforded the company its due process rights.",
      "The company plans to ask a state district judge to set aside the order revoking the license and to order state regulators to hold a hearing, Candelaria said. He added that NNK Equity also plans to sue the state for destroying what he said amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars of private property.",
      "\u201cThe idea that law enforcement officers can destroy public property based upon a temporary restraining order \u2014 which can be entered without notice to all parties and before a hearing on the evidence \u2014 which was the case here, should concern all of us who believe in the Constitution.\u201d",
      "According to state regulators, NNK Equity was issued a license in December 2023 for a marijuana growing operation at a property in Waterflow, a rural area on the edge of the Navajo Nation and just south of the Colorado border. The region also made headlines earlier this year when state regulators cracked down on two other operations and Navajo Nation authorities ended up filing their own charges against two tribal members.",
      "In the latest case, the Cannabis Control Division conducted a compliance check in June and determined that NNK Equity had exceeded its allotted plant count. The New Mexico State Police Special Investigations Unit was brought in and later found plants at a second location that was not licensed.",
      "The violations outlined by state regulators also involve transportation and tracking requirements, which include assigning identifying numbers to each plant."

      "NEW YORK -- Bernard \u201cBernie\u201d Marcus, the co-founder of The Home Depot, a billionaire philanthropist, and a big Republican donor, has died. He was 95.",
      "Marcus died Monday in Boca Raton, Florida, surrounded by family, according to a Home Depot spokesperson.",
      "Marcus was Home Depot's CEO as it grew rapidly during its first two decades, and was chairman of the board until his retirement in 2002. Home Depot is now the world\u2019s largest home improvement chain. In recent years, he became an outspoken supporter of former President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cWe owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude to Bernie,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cHe was a master merchant and a retail visionary. But even more importantly, he valued our associates, customers and communities above all. He\u2019s left us with an invaluable legacy and the backbone of our company: our values and culture. \u201d",
      "The son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Marcus was born in 1929 and grew up in a tenement in Newark, New Jersey, according to a biography on the company's website. Marcus had aspirations of becoming a doctor, but his family couldn't afford medical school and he endeavored to become a pharmacist, receiving a degree from Rutgers University. Marcus used to say he'd skip classes to sell Amana freezers door-to-door, according to Home Depot.",
      "After college, Marcus worked at the manufacturing conglomerate O\u2019Dell\u2019s and the retail chain Vornado, quickly ascending the corporate ladder. By 1972, Marcus was chairman and president of Handy Dan Improvement Centers, part of the Daylin conglomerate. It was there that Marcus formed a lifelong friendship with Arthur Blank.",
      "The big moment in his career arrived after he was fired by Handy Dan in 1978, along with Blank. Marcus had dreamt of a one-stop shop for do-it-yourselfers. At age 49, Marcus, along with Blank, founded Home Depot. Investment banker Ken Langone helped to secure financing to get The Home Depot started, according to the company.",
      "The first Home Depot opened in Atlanta the following year and by 1981, the company went public and began selling stock. There are now more than 2,000 Home Depot stores and the company employs more than 500,000 people. In the past decade annual sales at Home Depot have doubled, reaching nearly $153 billion in 2023",
      "Marcus has financially supported various charities as well as Jewish and medical organizations through donations. He also built the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, one of the largest in the world. The company said that his philanthropic work will continue through The Marcus Foundation, with a focus on Jewish causes, children, medical research, free enterprise and the community.",
      "Marcus was a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump, donating nearly $5 million to the Republican Party between 2016 and 2020, according to OpenSecrets, an organization that tracks political spending. Last year, Marcus penned an op-ed for Real Clear Politics, a clearinghouse of elections data and analysis, that spelled out the reasons he was endorsing Trump for a second term.",

      "The market got a lift from a report showing growth accelerated last month for retailers, transportation companies and other businesses in the U.S. services industries. That was despite economists\u2019 expectations for a slowdown, and the Institute for Supply Management  said it was the strongest growth in more than two years.",
      "The report offered more hope that the U.S. economy will remain solid  and avoid a long-feared recession  following the worst inflation in generations.",
      "Excitement about the artificial-intelligence boom also helped lift the stock market, as it has for much of the last year. Software company Palantir Technologies jumped 23.5% after delivering bigger profit and revenue than analysts expected for the latest quarter. It\u2019s an industry known for thinking and talking big, and CEO Alexander Karp said, \u201cWe absolutely eviscerated this quarter, driven by unrelenting AI demand that won\u2019t slow down.\u201d",
      "It helped offset a 5.2% drop for NXP Semiconductors. The Dutch company fell to one of the largest losses in the S&P 500 after warning that weakness it saw in the industrial and other markets during the latest quarter is spreading to Europe and the Americas.",

      "The market\u2019s main event Tuesday was the election, even if the result may not be known for days or weeks as officials count all the votes. Such uncertainty could upset markets, along with an upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve on interest rates later this week. The widespread expectation is for it to cut its main interest rate for a second straight time.",
      "Despite all the uncertainty heading into the final day of voting, many professional investors suggest keeping the focus on the long term. The broad U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins  the White House, even if each party\u2019s policies can help and hurt different industries\u2019 profits.",
      "Since 1945, the S&P 500 has risen in 73% of the years where a Democrat was president and 70% of the years when a Republican was the nation\u2019s chief executive, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.",
      "The U.S. stock market has risen more in magnitude when Democrats have been president, in part because a loss under George W. Bush\u2019s term hurt the Republicans\u2019 average. Bush took over as the dot-com bubble was deflating and exited office when the 2008 global financial crisis and Great Recession were devastating markets.",
      "Besides who will be president, other questions hanging over the market include whether the White House will be working with a unified Congress or one split by political parties, as well as whether the results will be contested.",
      "The general hope among investors is often for split control of the U.S. government because that\u2019s more likely to keep the status quo and avoid big changes that could drive the nation\u2019s debt much, much higher.",
      "As for a contested election, Wall Street has some precedent to look back to. In 2000, the S&P 500 dropped 5% in about five weeks after Election Day before Al Gore conceded to George W. Bush. That, though, also happened during the near-halving of the S&P 500 from March 2000 to October 2002 as the dot-com bubble deflated.",
      "Four years ago, the S&P 500 rose the day after polls closed, even though a winner wasn\u2019t yet clear. And it kept going higher after former President Donald Trump refused to concede  and challenged the results, which created plenty of uncertainty. A large part of that rally was due to excitement about the potential for a vaccine for COVID-19, which had just shut down the global economy.",
      "The S&P 500 ended up rising 69.6% from Election Day 2020 through Monday, following President Joe Biden\u2019s win. It rallied to records as the U.S. economy bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic and managed to avoid a recession despite a jump in inflation.",
      "In the four years before that, the S&P 500 rose 57.5% from Election Day 2016 through Election Day 2020, in part because of cuts to tax rates signed by Trump.",
      "Investors have already made moves in anticipation of a win by either Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris. But Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, suggests not getting caught up in such pre-election moves, or even those immediately after the polls close, \u201cwhich we believe will face inevitable tempering, if not outright reversals, either before or after Inauguration Day.\u201d",
      "In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury initially rallied following Tuesday morning\u2019s strong report on U.S services businesses but pared the gain later in the day. It slipped to 4.28% from 4.29% late Monday.",
      "In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe and Asia. The moves were mostly modest outside of jumps of 2.3% in Shanghai and 2.1% in Hong Kong.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture says that students eligible for free or reduced price school meals cannot be charged processing fees beginning in 2027",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced price school meals cannot be charged processing fees beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \u201cprocessing fees\u201d for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can\u2019t afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department\u2019s policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\u201cUSDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\u201d said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \u201cWhile today\u2019s action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\u201d",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just massively inconvenient,\u201d said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\u201cA dollar here and there, I expected,\u201d she said. \u201cBut $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\u201d",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child\u2019s account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \u201cmay insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\u201d Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",

      "Leaders of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers district in Seattle said 59% of members who cast ballots agreed to approve the company\u2019s fourth formal offer and the third put to a vote.",
      "Organized labor has made itself heard over the past couple of years, and the number of actions taken by unions has soared. There were 470 work stoppages (466 strikes and four lockouts) involving approximately 539,000 workers last year, according to Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. The nearly 500 work stoppages resulted in approximately 24,874,522 strike days.",
      "While the number of work stoppages increased by only 9% between 2022 and 2023, the number of workers involved in those work stoppages skyrocketed 141% to well over a half million workers, according to Cornell.",
      "Unions including the UAW, the Teamsters and, most recently, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, say they made the sacrifices asked of them by their companies during the pandemic and previous periods of distress for different economic sectors. Workers have stood firm on demands of late, however, saying that now is the time for companies, which have been consistently posting billions of dollars in profits every year, to catch up and pay workers what they are owed.",
      "Here's a look at some recent standoffs between corporate America and workers.",
      "Late last year the United Auto Workers union overwhelmingly ratified new contracts with Ford and Stellantis, along with a similar deal with General Motors, that would raise pay across the industry and force automakers to absorb higher costs.",
      "The agreements, which run through April 2028, ended contentious talks that began in the summer of 2022 and led to six-week-long strikes at all three automakers.",
      "The new contract agreements were widely seen as a victory for the UAW. The companies agreed to dramatically raise pay for top-scale assembly plant workers, with increases and cost-of-living adjustments that would translate into 33% wage gains.",
      "Top assembly plant workers were to receive immediate 11% raises and would earn roughly $42 an hour when the contracts expire in April of 2028.",
      "Under the agreements, the automakers also ended many of the multiple tiers of wages they had used to pay different workers. They also agreed in principle to bring new electric-vehicle battery plants into the national union contract.",
      "UPS workers that are members of the Teamsters union approved a tentative contract with the package delivery company last year. The run-up to the approval was acrimonious, with labor negotiations that threatened to disrupt package deliveries for millions of businesses and households nationwide.",
      "After negotiations broke down in early July 2023, Atlanta-based UPS reached a contract agreement with the Teamsters just days before an Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "At the time the agreement was struck, full- and part-time union workers were set to get $2.75 more per hour in 2023, and $7.50 more in total by the end of the five-year contract. Starting hourly pay for part-time employees also got bumped up to $21, but some workers said that fell short of their expectations.",
      "UPS said at the time that by the end of the new contract, the average UPS full-time driver would make about $170,000 annually in pay and benefits. It was not clear how much of that figure benefits accounted for.",
      "As part of the deal, the delivery company also agreed to make Martin Luther King Jr. Day a full holiday, end forced overtime on drivers\u2019 days off and stop using driver-facing cameras in cabs, among a host of other issues. It eliminated a two-tier wage system for drivers and agreements on safety issues were also reached, including equipping more trucks with air conditioning.",
      "In September video game performers reached agreements with 80 individual games that have signed interim or tiered budget agreements with the performers\u2019 union and accepted the artificial intelligence provisions they have been seeking.",
      "The performers had been striking for over a month.",
      "Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists began striking in July after negotiations with game industry giants that began more than a year and a half ago came to a halt over AI protections.",
      "The interim agreement secures wage improvements, protections around \u201cexploitative uses\u201d of artificial intelligence and safety precautions that account for the strain of physical performances, as well as vocal stress. The tiered budget agreement aims to make working with union talent more feasible for independent game developers or smaller-budget projects while also providing performers the protections under the interim agreement.",
      "Thousands of hospitality union workers on the Las Vegas Strip reached a tentative deal with the Venetian and Palazzo resorts in August, a first for employees at the sprawling Italian-inspired complex that opened 25 years ago.",
      "The Culinary Workers Union announced on the social platform X that the deal came together after a year of negotiations. It covers over 4,000 hotel and casino workers, from housekeepers and cocktail servers to bartenders and porters.",
      "Bethany Khan, a union spokesperson, said the deal mirrors the major wins secured in recent contracts awarded to 40,000 hospitality workers at 18 Strip properties owned or operated by casino giants MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts.",
      "Those wins included a 32% pay increase over five years, housekeeping workload reductions and improved job security amid advancements in technology and artificial intelligence.",
      "The bump in pay under those contracts will amount to an average $35 hourly wage by the end of the contracts, according to the union. Workers at these properties were making about $26 hourly with benefits before winning their latest contracts in November.",
      "Unions representing 85,000 health care workers reached a tentative agreement with industry giant Kaiser Permanente in October 2023 following a strike over wages and staffing levels.",
      "The deal included setting minimum hourly wages at $25 in California, where most of Kaiser\u2019s facilities are located, and $23 in other states. Workers would also see a 21% wage increase over four years.",
      "The lead up to the tentative agreement included a three-day strike involving 75,000 workers in multiple states.",
      "The tentative agreement also included protective terms around subcontracting and outsourcing, as well as initiatives to invest in the current workforce and address a staffing crisis.",
      "Hollywood\u2019s actors voted to ratify a deal with studios in December 2023 that ended their strike after nearly four months, bringing an official finish to a labor strife that shook the entertainment industry for most of last year.",
      "Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists approved a three-year contract.",
      "Control over the use of artificial intelligence was the most hard-fought issue in the long, methodical negotiations. The contract called for a 7% general pay increase with further hikes coming in the second and third years of the deal.",
      "The agreement also included a hard-won provision that temporarily derailed talks: the creation of a fund to pay performers for future viewings of their work on streaming services, in addition to traditional residuals paid for the showing of movies or series.",
      "Some 45,000 dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports returned to work in October after their union reached a deal to suspend a strike that could have eventually caused shortages and higher prices if it had dragged on.",
      "A walkout would have shut down as many as 36 ports that handle almost half of the nation\u2019s cargo from ships entering and exiting the nation. Any such strike would eventually have led to shortages that would have hurt the U.S. economy if the walkout by the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association went on for more than a month.",
      "The dispute is not over, however. Longshoremen suspended its strike after three days, but that lasts only until Jan. 15, providing more time to negotiate a new contract. The union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and shipping companies, said in a joint statement that they have reached a tentative agreement on wages.",
      "Talks now turn to the automation of ports, which the unions says will lead to fewer jobs, and other sticking points."

    "title": "A TV as big as a bed? With the holidays approaching, stores stock more supersize sets",
    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 15:38:29 -0500",
    "summary": "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
    "story": [
      "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
      "NEW YORK -- For some television viewers, size apparently does matter.",
      "Forget the 65-inch TVs that were considered bigger than average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 8 feet diagonally. That's wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a king-size bed.",
      "Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year, according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise tepid television market, according to analysts.",
      "The 38,100 televisions of at least 97 inches sold between January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs \u2014 the 19 models range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 \u2014 and introduced displays in roughly 70% of its stores.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really taken off this year,\" Blake Hampton, Best Buy's senior vice president of merchandising, said.",
      "Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at least 97 inches was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its first 98-inch TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said.",
      "Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling business, recently bought a 98-inch Sony for his 14,000-square-foot house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 85-inch TV in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home and uses some to display digital art.",
      "\u201cWe just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking for and thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony. \u201cYou get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You\u2019re sitting watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can put yourself in the scene.\u201d",
      "The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through September period, Circana said.",
      "Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski, the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a year, Kowalski said.",
      "The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of two inches in both 2021 and 2022, and 85-inch TVs began gaining traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 98-inch TVs to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 110-115 inches are on the market right now, he said.",
      "\u201cYou get better resolution over time,\" Kowalski said. \"You get better picture quality. And so just over time, it\u2019s easier to produce those sets and improve the technology.\"",
      "Best Buy's Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as \u201cincredible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re watching YouTube TV content or \u2018 NFL Sunday Ticket,\u2019 you can actually get four screens up, and that\u2019s four 48-inch screens on it,\u201d he said.",
      "Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed its 98-inch lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every scene.",
      "James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment division of Samsung's U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and experience content is shifting.",
      "\u201cIt's even more so about watching TV as a shared experience,\u201d Fishler said. \u201cThey want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at home. \u201d",
      "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, its Sam\u2019s Club division, and Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens.",
      "TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach on home theater projectors, which create a 100- to 120-inch image that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without windows.",
      "\u201cA dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the purview of projectors,\u201d Andrew Sivori, vice president in the entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer. \"But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV.\"",
      "Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd. But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, \u201cIt\u2019s still a niche business.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of people just don\u2019t have the space to put one of those in,\u201d he added.",
      "Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make sure a 98-inch TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said.",
      "But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good news is that the recommended distance for a 98-inch TV is actually just 6-12 feet from the seating area. The rule of thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine the ideal viewing distance, Samsung's Fishler said.",
      "If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go?",
      "\u201cI think we'll have to wait and see,\u201d Fishler said.",
      "___",
      "This story was first published on Nov. 3, 2024. It was updated on Nov. 5, 2024 to correct that TV sizes are measured on the diagonal, not by width."

      "Private companies that provide both water and sewage have failed to update their often-Victorian infrastructure as populations have grown and demand swelled. Leaks are common, and during heavy rainfall companies discharge raw sewage into rivers, lakes and the sea. The number of discharges increased by more than 50% last year to a record 464,000 spills, according to the Environment Agency.",
      "Pollution from farm runoff also taints Britain\u2019s waterways, and climate change is making the situation worse by bringing more intense rain.",
      "Rower Imogen Grant, a gold medalist at the 2024 Olympic Games, said it was commonplace for rowers to get sick after training on the Thames.",

      "Elon Musk\u2019s X has been modified so that accounts you\u2019ve blocked on the social media platform can still see your public posts.",
      "X updated its Help Center page over the weekend to explain how blocking now works on the site. While you can still block accounts, those accounts will now be able to see your posts unless you have made your account private. They won't, however, be able to reply to them or repost them. Blocked accounts also won't be able to follow you and you won't be able to follow them, as has been the case before the policy change.",
      "In addition, if the owner of an account you blocked visits your profile on X, they will be able to learn that you have blocked them.",
      "X indicated that the change was aimed at protecting users who have been blocked.",
      "In a post on its Engineering account on the service, X said the blocking feature \u201ccan be used by users to share and hide harmful or private information about those they\u2019ve blocked. Users will be able to see if such behavior occurs with this update, allowing for greater transparency.\u201d",
      "But critics say the changes could harm victims and survivors of abuse, for instance. Thomas Ristenpart, professor of computer security at Cornell Tech and co-founder of the Clinic to End Tech Abuse, said it can be critical for the safety of survivors of intimate-partner violence to be able to control who sees their posts.",
      "\u201cWe often hear reports about posts to social media enabling abusers to stalk them or triggering further harassment,\u201d he said. \"Removing users\u2019 ability to block problematic individuals will be a huge step backwards for survivor safety.\u201d",
      "Since he took over the former Twitter in 2022, Musk has loosened policies the platform had put in place to clamp down on hate and harassment. In moves often said to be made in the name of free speech, he dismantled the company's Trust and Safety advisory group and restored accounts that were previously banned for hate speech, harassment and spreading misinformation. When a nonprofit research group documented a rise of hate speech on the platform, X sued them. The lawsuit was dismissed."

      "U.S. auto safety regulators have ended an investigation into Ford engine failures after the company replaced engines or extended the warranty on some vehicles",
      "DETROIT -- The U.S. government's auto safety regulator has ended a 2 1/2-year investigation into Ford engine failures after the company replaced engines or extended the warranty on some vehicles.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says in documents posted Monday on its website that its analysis traced the problem to intake valves that can fracture inside some 2.7-liter and 3-liter turbocharged engines.",
      "Documents say the probe opened in May of 2022 ended up covering more than 411,000 vehicles from the 2021 and 2022 model years including the Ford F-150 Bronco, Edge and Explorer as well as the Lincoln Aviator and Nautilus.",
      "The agency was looking into catastrophic engine failures caused by intake valves fracturing, dropping into the cylinder and hitting the piston.",
      "The documents say a forensic analysis of fractured valves found that when the they were made by a parts supplier, the temperature got too high, making them brittle and likely to fracture during normal engine use.",
      "An analysis of failure report data found that the faulty valves were made from May through October of 2021, the agency said. Ford contended that not all valves produced during this period were faulty and that a vast majority of the failures happened before the vehicles were driven 20,000 miles.",
      "An agency statistical analysis to predict the number of failures, and an analysis of failure reports \u201care generally consistent\u201d with Ford's determination that the valves would fail at low mileage, and the majority of vehicles with the faulty valves \u201chave already experienced a failure,\u201d the agency said.",
      "Earlier this year Ford recalled about 91,000 vehicles with valves made during the suspect period. They'll be tested and get a new engine if necessary. The company also extended the warranty on vehicles with valves made during the period to 10 years or 150,000 miles, the documents said.",
      "During the investigation, the agency said it found 396 customer complaints, 825 warranty claims and 936 engine replacements. There were no reported crashes or injuries."

      "SAO PAULO -- Max Verstappen's come-from-behind win in the pouring rain at the Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday didn't just put him a lot closer to a fourth straight Formula One title.",
      "After 10 races without a win, it also reminded everyone of why the Dutch driver is a three-time champion in the first place.",
      "Verstappen delivered one of the best performance of his career to move up from 17th at the start and clinch a victory that increased his lead over McLaren's Lando Norris from 44 to 62 points with just three grand prix races and a sprint race remaining.",
      "\u201cSimply lovely,\u201d Verstappen summed it up on the team radio.",
      "His fellow drivers were more effusive.",
      "\u201cAmazing,\u201d said seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes.",

      "With only 86 points up for grabs until the end of the season, Verstappen only needs to finish ahead of Norris in Las Vegas to secure the title in two weeks.",
      "The Red Bull driver had expected a tough weekend at Interlagos. He received a five-place grid penalty after changing his engine for the sixth time in the season; lost one point in Saturday\u2019s sprint race because of another penalty; and got unlucky during qualifying when the session was interrupted just as he was attempting to clock a fast lap, leaving him in 12th place.",
      "But then everything went right for him in the race.",
      "He surged past rivals at the start and had passed a handful of cars before the first lap was over. In a crash-ridden race where visibility was hindered by the constant spray of water from the cars in front, Verstappen kept overtaking car after car and ended up finishing almost 20 seconds ahead of second-placed Esteban Ocon of Alpine.",
      "\u201cIt was definitely an emotional win,\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cI was really motivated and put everything into this race and I surprised myself today as I wasn\u2019t expecting to finish in P1.\u201d",
      "The manner of the victory also sent a message to some of Verstappen's critics, who had described his driving style as being too aggressive.",
      "\u201c(Verstappen) silenced a few critics today,\u201d said former F1 champion Damon Hill, who himself was one of those critics.",
      "In his post-race press conference, the Red Bull driver also took a shot at some of the British journalists who have questioned his abilities in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cI have a quick question here. I appreciate all of you being here, but I don\u2019t see any British press,\u201d Verstappen said, drawing laughter. \u201cDo they have to run to the airport, or they don\u2019t know where the press conference is?\u201d",
      "Fans at Interlagos were also impressed by the Dutch driver's performance.",
      "Many of them, like Carlos Santos de Ara\u00fajo, 65, were hesitant to support Verstappen because of his ties to Nelson Piquet, the father of his girlfriend Kelly and the main rival of another Brazilian three-time F1 champion, the late local hero Ayrton Senna.",
      "Sunday'a race put Verstappen under a different light, de Ara\u00fajo said.",
      "\u201cNo one can be indifferent to what Max did today. I am sure he will think this the best race of his life, one of the best here at Interlagos,\u201d he said, wearing a Senna shirt and a Mercedes cap. \u201cHardcore F1 fans like me do like him as a driver, but today probably changed his status for us all. Anyone who thought he was just cold and sometimes arrogant will see the fighter that he was to win this. That adds to him being a champion.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Duke freshman Cooper Flagg turned in an all-around floor game against his home-state team in the seventh-ranked Blue Devils' season opener",
      "DURHAM, N.C. -- Cooper Flagg felt nerves and excitement ahead of his highly anticipated regular-season debut for No. 7 Duke in its famed Cameron Indoor Stadium. Coming out of the tunnel to see the opponent wearing the jersey of his home-state program \u2014 one with long ties to his family \u2014 added a little extra feeling.",
      "The nation's No. 1-ranked recruit and preseason Associated Press All-American had 18 points, seven rebounds, five assists and one flashy dunk to help the Blue Devils beat Maine 96-62 on Monday night.",
      "It came against a program where his mother played basketball, where the Newport, Maine, native went to games while he was growing up about 30 minutes away from the campus. And where his brother Ace \u2014 who was sitting behind the Black Bears bench while their parents sat behind the Duke sideline \u2014 will play next year.",
      "\u201cI think even for me, it was a little more emotional walking out seeing the Maine across their chest,\u201d Cooper Flagg said. \u201cObviously, that\u2019s a team that I grew up watching when I was young. Seeing them gave me a lot more emotions and knowing it was the first real game. It was definitely a high-emotion game for me, but I was able to just take it in stride and handle business.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-9 forward didn\u2019t have a hot-shooting start to a career that is all but certain to be a single-year stopover on the way to the NBA as a possible No. 1 overall pick. But he turned in an all-around floor game that had him making plays on the glass, as a facilitator and bringing the ball up in transition all the same.",
      "He made 6 of 15 shots in his roughly 30 minutes of work, making all six of his free throws but missing all four of his 3-point shots \u2014 including a couple in the first half that either rolled or rattled out. But he also glided across the court to make his presence felt within the flow of the game, including a pair of waved-off finishes after the whistle that would have counted as and-1s with continuation rules at the next level.",
      "\u201cI thought he was close to having 25 tonight honestly, with some of those finishes, a couple of open shots,\" said Duke coach Jon Scheyer, who outdueled two-time reigning national champion UConn to land Flagg. \"That\u2019s going to fall. I think the thing that\u2019s exiting for me watching him is just how he makes everybody better and how he plays every possession.\u201d",
      "Indeed, beyond the assists that came either with high-low entries to 7-foot-2 freshman Khaman Maluach or by skipping the ball across the defense, Flagg also drew eight of Maine's 19 team fouls on the night as a matchup problem for the America East program. He also showed plenty of zip, at one point diving on the floor for a steal after knocking the ball loose near halfcourt \u2014 with Duke up 29 points with about four minutes left.",
      "\u201cHe just goes out and has fun and plays basketball,\u201d junior point guard Tyrese Proctor said. \u201cHe doesn't overcomplicate his game. He just makes the right play and it's really fun to play with.\u201d",
      "Flagg's first college points came on free throws, his first field goal on a stickback with 6:25 before halftime. And yes, there was an impressive move that the \u201cCameron Crazies\u201d \u2014 and anyone else ready to dissect Flagg's every move \u2014 were ready to see when Flagg dribbled around defender Quion Burns, curled into the paint and took off from just outside the charge circle to throw down a full-extension dunk with his right hand.",
      "Flagg's night ended abruptly when he landed awkwardly in traffic on the baseline and stayed down with 3:28 left due to cramps, with trainer Jose Fonseca coming over to briefly work on his left leg. But Flagg soon hobbled back to the bench to watch the final minutes while chugging from a Gatorade water battle.",
      "Afterward, Scheyer said he was glad to hear that Flagg could \u201cadmit and say he was emotional\u201d about playing against Maine with all the ties to the program. And to listen to Black Bears coach Chris Markwood, the feeling was mutual in being on hand for the next step of Flagg's \u201cstorybook\u201d journey from small-town Maine to one of college basketball's famed arenas.",
      "\u201cI think we're a little bit in awe because you just don't see it happen a lot in the state of Maine,\" Markwood said. \"He's got a whole state behind him. Everybody is just cheering him along and can't wait to watch everything he does.\u201d",

    "summary": "The College Football Playoff selection committee will release its first rankings of the season on Tuesday night",
    "story": [
      "The College Football Playoff selection committee will release its first rankings of the season on Tuesday night",
      "After two months of college football comes the first chance to see if committee members in charge of setting the new, 12-team bracket for the playoff have been watching the same season unfold as everyone else.",
      "If they have, then Oregon \u2014 undefeated and a unanimous No. 1 in the latest AP Top 25 \u2014 will get top billing when the first of six sets of weekly rankings are revealed Tuesday evening.",
      "If not, then who would they pick? Miami, BYU and Indiana are the nation's top undefeated teams alongside the Ducks, but one thing the committee has made clear is that wins and losses are only one factor in determining its top 25. That list will eventually be used to slot teams into the final bracket that will be unveiled Dec. 8.",
      "Strength of schedule will also play a big factor and would account for teams with one loss, setting the table for the likes of Ohio State and Georgia potentially being ranked higher than the unbeaten.",
      "The playoff is expanding from four to 12 teams this year, college football's latest attempt to find a perfect way to crown a champion. That the expanded playoff adds eight more games that were then sold to ESPN for $7.8 billion certainly played a big role in these calculations.",
      "A committee of 13 people will pore over the results from the first 10 weeks of the season and rank the teams from 1 through 25. This is just a starting point, because none of these rankings are solidified until Dec. 8 \u2014 the date of the last poll, at which point the teams will be slotted into the bracket based on their ranking.",
      "Well, not exactly. The five best-ranked conference champions are guaranteed spots in the playoff no matter where they're slotted in the poll. And the top four are guaranteed first-round byes.",
      "So, for instance, let's say BYU wins the Big 12 and was ranked ninth by the CFP (that is its ranking in this week's AP poll). That means BYU would automatically move up to No. 4 in the CFP bracket, since the top four conference champs get byes. And if, for instance, Boise State wins the Mountain West, is ranked lower than 12 by the CFP but no other Group of Five school is ranked ahead of the Broncos, they would make the playoff anyway.",
      "There are seven at-large selections and no limit to the number of at-large bids a conference can receive.",
      "If Oregon isn't placed atop the standings, then the committee is watching a different sport than the rest of us. The Ducks have beaten five Big Ten opponents by three touchdowns or more and also have a one-point victory over Ohio State, ranked third by AP.",
      "It will be interesting to see what the committee does with Notre Dame, an independent with no way to win a conference (and a bye) that is 7-1 but also has a home loss to Northern Illinois in Week 2 on its resume.",
      "Also, Indiana is 9-0 and not finding much resistance on its less-than-brutal Big Ten schedule. Doubters will be looking at that Nov. 23 matchup against Ohio State.",
      "Once the bracket is set Dec. 8, here is what comes next:",
      "\u2014 Seeds five through eight will host seeds nine through 12 in first-round games on campus. Those games will be played on Dec. 20 (one game) and Dec. 21 (three).",
      "\u2014 The quarterfinals will be played in traditional bowl games on Dec. 31 (Fiesta Bowl) and Jan. 1 (Peach, Rose, Sugar). Where the top four seeds will be aligned as closely as possible with current and traditional bowl tie-ins. For example, the Big Ten champion would play in the Rose Bowl and the SEC champion likely plays in the Sugar Bowl.",
      "\u2014 The semifinals will also be played in bowl games. This season, that\u2019s Jan. 9 at the Orange Bowl and Jan. 10 at the Cotton Bowl.",
      "\u2014 The championship game will be played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on Jan. 20.",

      "Nothing went right in Derek Carr's return to the New Orleans Saints' lineup in Week 9",
      "Derek Carr's return to the New Orleans Saints' starting lineup couldn't have gone much worse.",
      "He lost his top target to a concussion when his pass over the middle sailed over his receiver. He lost to the worst team in the league and he became the first NFL quarterback to lose to 31 teams.",
      "A day later, he lost his head coach.",
      "These are not the Saints of Sean Payton and Drew Brees, to be sure. But Carr and Dennis Allen expeditiously raised hopes of parading another Lombardi Trophy down Bourbon Street when the Saints totaled 91 points in back-to-back blowouts of Carolina and Dallas to start the season.",
      "They scored on their first nine possessions in a 47-10 rout of the Panthers in the opener, then topped that a week later at Jerry World when they reached the end zone on their first half-dozen drives in a 44-19 jaw-dropper against the Cowboys.",
      "Those were heady times \u2014 and, as it turned out, fleeting.",
      "The Saints have lost seven straight games since Week 2 amid a flurry of injuries, including a strained oblique that sent Carr to the sideline for three weeks.",
      "Four of those losses were by double digits, among them a 33-10 Thursday night whooping from Payton and his new team, the resurgent Denver Broncos.",
      "The costliest loss was the Saints' 23-22 defeat in Charlotte on Sunday when Carr couldn't lead his team into field-goal range in the final minute and the Saints left town with the same 2-7 record as the Panthers, a team that's statistically dreadful and historically bad.",
      "So, Dennis Allen, who was previously fired by the then-Oakland Raiders in 2014, on Monday became the first coach in NFL history fired twice with the same quarterback starting both teams.",
      "In a written statement released by the team, Allen thanked team owner Gayle Benson and GM Mickey Loomis for his opportunity and said, \u201cI am sorry the results weren\u2019t better, because they were certainly deserved.\u201d",
      "Allen is the second NFL coach fired midseason in 2024. Jeff Ulbrich replaced Robert Saleh as interim coach after the Jets' 2-3 start and it took him a month to get his first victory.",
      "The caretaker in New Orleans is Darren Rizzi, who gets the Browns (2-7) at home in two weeks and the Giants (2-7) on the road in four, but he inherited a beat-up team and a quarterback who was eviscerated by former teammate Michael Thomas on social media after wide receiver Chris Olave's concussion Sunday.",
      "As he cut across the middle and reached for Carr's errant pass, Olave was sandwiched by safety Xavier Woods and cornerback Dane Jackson. While Woods was flagged for unnecessary roughness, Olave remained on the field for several minutes being attended to by trainers as the crowd went silent and players from both teams gathered around him. He was eventually placed on a backboard and taken to a hospital by ambulance.",
      "Thomas immediately castigated Carr on social media, saying Carr tends to \"just panic and throw the ball.\u201d He also reposted another message on X that suggested Carr should be fined for throwing a \u201chospital pass.\u201d",
      "Carr spoke for more than four minutes about Thomas\u2019 comments after the game.",
      "\u201cI have a pit in my stomach any time one of my teammates goes down because I love them that much,\u201d Carr said. \u201cNo matter if I like them or not, and I happen to love Chris Olave. We have a great relationship. I hate, and I don\u2019t like to use that word a lot, but I hate moments like that.\u201d",
      "Carr said Thomas, who has criticized Carr on social media before, seems to be the one teammate who hasn't gotten along with him in the NFL.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what I did to him,\u201d Carr said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he feels that way. I\u2019m sorry for whatever he\u2019s dealing with to make him feel like he\u2019s got do that. But he\u2019s never called me during all of this. My phone number has never changed. I\u2019ve in fact called him on different occasions just to try. Sometimes, you can try as hard as you want and it doesn\u2019t work out. And that\u2019s OK. ... But I wish him the best. I hope he gets on a team and does what he wants to do and loves it.\u201d",
      "Woods said after the game he didn\u2019t think it was a malicious hit, but officials told him he was penalized for hitting Olave in the head. \u201cIt was nothing dirty on my part, I was just playing football,\u201d Woods said.",
      "Entering the weekend, Carr was one of 10 QBs to have lost to 30 different teams, a club that includes Brees, Brett Favre, Joe Flacco and Matt Ryan. Now, Carr stands alone as the only QB to lose to 31 teams.",
      "The only team he hasn\u2019t lost to is his old team, the Raiders, whom the Saints host on Dec. 29.",
      "Another mea culpa came when former Eagles center Jason Kelce began ESPN's broadcast of \u201cMonday Night Countdown\" by acknowledging he shouldn't have returned an anti-gay slur to a Penn State football fan who heckled him Saturday about his brother, Travis, dating Taylor Swift.",
      "\u201cIn a heated moment, I chose to greet hate with hate,\u201d Jason Kelce said. \u201cAnd I don't think that's a productive thing.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 10:26:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The PGA Tour is likely to change eligibility for how many players get full cards",
    "story": [
      "The PGA Tour is likely to change eligibility for how many players get full cards",
      "The reason behind such a big change to PGA Tour eligibility is not much different from what it was some 40 years ago. Both were about trying to make the tour more competitive and to give real value to having a card.",
      "Of course, it involved money, too. That never changes.",
      "The PGA Tour board later this month will vote on whether to reduce the number of fully exempt players from 125 to 100, along with cutting from 30 to 20 the tour cards awarded to top finishers on the Korn Ferry Tour.",
      "It sounds even more cutthroat than golf already is, especially since it was in 1983 when the PGA Tour went the other direction.",
      "It used to be only the top 60 on the money list the previous year were exempt from qualifying for PGA Tour events. That changed to the top 125 in what became known as the all-exempt tour. Anyone who had a tour card could expect to tee it up just about wherever he wanted, instead of having to qualify every Monday.",
      "Those who didn't make it through qualifying put their clubs in the trunk and headed to the next stop. Back then, getting a PGA Tour card was the easy part.",
      "So the change wasn't about the rich getting richer. It was having a reasonable chance to make a good living.",
      "\u201cReally, when you get down to it, there aren't very many of us who make any money out here,\u201d the late Tom Weiskopf said at the start of the 1982 season. Craig Stadler wound up leading the money list that year with $446,462. Only 37 players topped $100,000 in earnings.",
      "\u201cThe all-exempt tour will give more people a chance to play more tournaments,\" Weiskopf said. \"There will be more people making money and, with 150 players able to play any time they want to, you're going to see the competitive level of the game go up.\u201d",
      "That's the idea behind the proposal the PGA Tour board is considering \u2014 and is likely to approve \u2014 when it meets in two weeks.",
      "With such a bloated membership, having a tour card often meant waiting until there was room to play. The regular season is three months shorter, so there is more urgency to play. Now factor in 125 cards, plus two-year exemptions to players who win, plus 30 cards for the Korn Ferry Tour, 10 cards for leading European tour members, five cards from Q-school, career money exemptions, medical exemptions. Whew.",
      "Not to be overlooked were the eight signature events with even smaller fields.",
      "More waiting.",
      "The reduction in cards \u2014 the change would take effect in 2026 \u2014 should be beneficial, at least for those who finish in the top 100 to keep full status.",
      "There is still the concept of meritocracy. Justin Thomas went from winning a major in 2022 to failing to qualify for the postseason in 2023. Matt McCarty started this year on the Korn Ferry Tour, won three times for an instant promotion and then won the Black Desert Championship in Utah to earn a two-year exemption and a spot in three majors next year.",
      "It's not going to be easy, nor is it supposed to be.",
      "There's an advantage for players who finished in the top 50 \u2014 a perk for success is another way to look at it \u2014 because they are guaranteed spots in all the signature events with a $20 million purse and elevated FedEx Cup points.",
      "The answer, of course, is to play better. It's a phrase no one likes to hear because it's true.",
      "\u201cTrust me, players hate hearing that,\u201d said Camilo Villegas, chairman of the 16-member Player Advisory Council that put forth the proposed changes. \u201cBut go to any sport, go to the business world, you've got to perform. If we perform, there's an opportunity to make an unbelievable living. You just keep working on your dream like you did when you were a kid.\u201d",
      "J.T. Poston, who won three weeks ago in Las Vegas, put a different spin on \u201cplay better.\u201d He was curious at the start of 2023 about how the signature events were going to work.",
      "For Poston, it was all about having the ball in his hand and his name on a tee sheet.",
      "\u201cAs long as there's a way you still have to perform to stay in, and there's an avenue for guys who aren't in to play their way in, I don't think there's an issue,\u201d Poston said.",
      "Golf still remains a mess. Top names have defected to Saudi-funded LIV Golf, meaning all the stars are together only four times a year at the majors. Even as the PGA Tour and the Public Investment Fund get closer to an investment deal, getting everyone back together more often remains complicated.",
      "With golf, it's always something.",
      "Even as the PGA Tour was moving to the all-exempt tour in 1983, one of the proposals was for a \u201csuper tour\u201d of 20 or 25 events with big purses (back then it was in the $400,000 range, which sounds like chump change in today's golf economy).",
      "A group of Dallas business contemplated a rival circuit for champions 40 and older, which never got off the ground. The tour created the \u201cTournament Players Series\u201d for players who didn't have full cards and for PGA club pros who had lost access to those Monday qualifiers.",
      "For such a virtuous sport, strife is never far behind. What hasn't changed is the best players find a way. All they need is a tee time. They still have that.",

      "Pop superstar Taylor Swift returned to Arrowhead Stadium to see the Kansas City Chiefs and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Pop superstar Taylor Swift returned to Arrowhead Stadium on Monday night to see the Kansas City Chiefs and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after wrapping up the U.S. leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.",
      "It wound up being a good night for both of them.",
      "Swift was able to celebrate Kelce's big night, which included 14 catches for 100 yards in a driving rain, along with a victory for the Chiefs. They trailed by a touchdown in the fourth quarter, scored twice to take the lead, then headed to overtime, where they won the coin toss and drove for a touchdown that gave them a 30-24 win.",
      "Kelce, who had fumbled earlier in the game, had two of his catches on the decisive drive in overtime. His total receptions was a career-best for a regular-season game, matching a 14-catch performance in a 2023 playoff win over Jacksonville, while his 16 targets from Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was just one shy of his career high.",
      "\u201cHe does a great job of finding space,\u201d Mahomes said, \u201cand I think with having DeAndre (Hopkins) out there, it takes pressure off where not all the attention is on him the entire time. And whenever he gets going, man, he's hard to stop.\u201d",
      "Swift is finally getting a chance to stop herself after playing the last of three shows at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Sunday to conclude the U.S. portion of her tour. The rest of her tour heads to Canada with the first of six shows at Rogers Centre in Toronto on Nov. 14 and three shows in December at BC Place in Vancouver, British Columbia.",
      "Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. Since then, the two have spent plenty of time together, often with cameras following every move.",
      "Swift's arrival in a black outfit and Chiefs coat Monday night came on the eve of the presidential election, in which the 14-time Grammy winner has thrown her support behind Vice President Kamala Harris. That generated a stir when Harris' rival, Donald Trump, began to reference Swift's friend and Mahomes' wife, Brittany, as a supporter of his campaign.",
      "Patrick Mahomes has declined to endorse anyone in the election, instead urging people to register to vote.",

      "Mike Williams struggled to establish a rapport with Aaron Rodgers on the New York Jets",
      "Mike Williams struggled to establish a rapport with Aaron Rodgers on the New York Jets.",
      "The Pittsburgh Steelers think the veteran wide receiver will fit in just fine with Russell Wilson and their offense.",
      "The teams announced Tuesday that the Jets agreed to trade Williams to the Steelers for a fifth-round pick in next year's draft, pending a physical.",
      "Williams struggled with production and building an on-field connection with Rodgers in his first season with New York. He became expendable when the Jets acquired Davante Adams from Las Vegas last month.",
      "Williams, who signed a one-year, $10 million contract with New York in the offseason as a free agent, had just 12 catches for 166 yards in nine games with the Jets. He had only a 6-yard reception on just two targets in his last two games.",
      "He heads from the scuffling Jets (3-6) to the first-place Steelers (6-2), who have been searching for a complement to top wideout George Pickens for months.",
      "\u201cMike's a good guy,\u201d Rodgers said during his weekly appearance on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d just as news of the trade was being reported. \u201cHe'll be good in that locker room. ... He's had a nice career, and sometimes a change of scenery is great for certain guys. It was great for me to kind of get re-enthused and stuff.",
      "\u201cWe kind of knew with Davante coming in, there would be less targets for everybody.\u201d",
      "The addition of Williams also gives the Steelers a big red zone target for Wilson, along with Pickens and tight end Pat Freiermuth. While Van Jefferson and Calvin Austin III have seen their production tick up since Wilson returned after missing the first six games with a calf injury, both lack Williams' size and his resume.",
      "\u201cIf this gives Mike more opportunities, that's awesome,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe wish Mike well.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-4 Williams spent his first seven NFL seasons with the Chargers, for whom he caught 309 passes for 4,806 yards and 31 touchdowns. He tore the ACL in his right knee in Week 3 last year and missed the rest of the season. The Jets brought Williams along slowly throughout the offseason and in training camp, but he never seemed to click with Rodgers when he got onto the field.",
      "\u201cMike\u2019s a quiet guy, just kind of goes about his business,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cMike had a rough injury last year, an ACL. That's tough to come back from and he worked his (butt) off all last season. He wasn't around for a lot of training camp and was working on the side. But I felt like he was getting better throughout the early part of the season. I felt like his speed was getting better and starting to feel more comfortable with it.\u201d",
      "In New York's 23-20 loss to Buffalo on Oct. 14, Rodgers threw to Williams during the final few minutes \u2014 but was intercepted when Taron Johnson intercepted the pass that was short of Williams and sealed the loss for the Jets. Rodgers later said Williams ran the wrong route. The wide receiver said he wasn't bothered by the quarterback's criticism and said the two spoke about it.",
      "But Williams then became the subject of trade rumors, especially after he sat out the first two days of practice that week with what the Jets said were \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d",
      "Six days after New York's loss to Buffalo, Williams caught a 15-yard pass in a 37-15 loss in Pittsburgh. And now he'll be playing for those Steelers.",
      "Pittsburgh has been looking for another outside receiver to put opposite Pickens since the team traded Diontae Johnson to Carolina in the offseason. The Steelers missed out on Brandon Aiyuk \u2014 who opted to remain in San Francisco \u2014 and couldn't land Adams or DeAndre Hopkins when both became available.",
      "Steelers coach Mike Tomlin acknowledged the team was looking to upgrade its roster in general for the stretch run, but also made it a point to acknowledge the rise in the quality of play of Austin and Jefferson.",
      "\u201cI just feel like we have a group that\u2019s hardworking and capable and can\u2019t wait to show the football world those capabilities,\u201d Tomlin said Tuesday shortly before the trade. \"And every time we step into a stadium, they get an opportunity to do so. And you seen some examples of it already.\u201d",
      "Just not enough to resist the chance to bring in Williams for a relatively low cost.",
      "The move actually leaves the Jets a bit short-handed at wide receiver. New York still has starters Adams and Garrett Wilson, along with backups Xavier Gipson, special teamer Irvin Charles and rookie Malachi Corley, who had his first NFL touchdown run overturned last Thursday night against Houston when he dropped the ball before he crossed the goal line.",
      "Allen Lazard, who had 30 receptions for 412 yards and is tied with Wilson with a team-leading five touchdown catches, is on IR with a chest injury.",

Meta approved these requests without proper verification, which resulted in data breaches affecting at least 10 South Korean Facebook users, Lee said.",

      "The commission said then that the two companies didn\u2019t clearly inform users or obtain their consent to collect data about them as they used other websites or services outside their own platforms. It ordered the companies to provide an \u201ceasy and clear\u201d consent process to give people more control over whether to share information about what they do online.",

      "\u201cThe use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,\u201d said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.",
      "Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.",
      "Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and \u201cvigorously defend\u201d approval of the project, \u201cwhich was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",
      "When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said \"this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat.\u201d The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status.",
      "\u201cWe find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\u201d the agency concluded.",
      "The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion.",
      "The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project \u201cwill result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014",

      "A small facility in Cyprus is hosting senior government officials from as far as Algeria, Iraq and Georgia for training by top U.S. experts to prevent the kinds of materials used to build weapons of mass destruction from crossing their borders",
      "LARNACA, Cyprus -- From as far as Algeria, Iraq and Georgia, an assortment of senior government officials converge on this small facility for training by top U.S. experts to prevent the kinds of materials used to build weapons of mass destruction from crossing their borders.",
      "In just its third year of operation, the U.S.-funded Cyprus Centre for Land, Open Seas and Port Security (CYCLOPS) has far exceeded expectations. From the dozen courses that officials were initially hoping to hold annually, demand has skyrocketed, with scheduled training sessions for next year expected to surpass 50, says the center\u2019s director Chrysilios Chrysiliou.",
      "So far, over 2,000 officials from 20 countries including Yemen, Libya, Armenia and Ukraine, have received training on radiological and nuclear detection for customs officers, methods of smuggling weapons of mass destruction, and chemical terrorism investigations among a host of other topics.",
      "On Monday, a group of Cypriot and Egyptian officials started a two-day seminar on maritime cybersecurity led by the U.S.-based Sandia National Laboratories.",
      "\u201cThis uniqueness has actually brought ... a lot of success which could not had been foreseen when Cyclops was initially being created,\u201d Chrysiliou told the Associated Press.",
      "According to Chrysiliou, key to the center\u2019s success has been the top-notch level of instruction participants receive from U.S.-based experts, including from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, that specialize in counter-proliferation programs.",
      "The center also boasts an array of the latest in cutting-edge detectors able to sniff out radiological, chemical and biological agents and explosives that countries in the wider region don\u2019t possess or have access to.",
      "\u201cHere, the participants have the opportunity to see the latest technology in in detecting all of the range of the threats,\u201d said Chrysiliou. \u201cIt\u2019s like a showcase of what exists out in the market.\u201d",
      "For instance, trainees are taught on how to detect and properly dispose of the radiological elements of discarded medical equipment that militants could use to fashion a weapon. Another emerging threat is the possible use of off-the-shelf drones to disperse chemical or biological agents over populated centers.",
      "CYCLOPS has been the product of ever-closer Cypriot-U.S. defense and security ties, earning plaudits from U.S. officials all the way up to the White House. During Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides\u2019 meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden last week, the center figured prominently as an example of enhanced bilateral security cooperation.",
      "The center was built on a $7 million U.S. government grant, $2 million of which was for the purchase of border security equipment. The island nation's proximity to the Middle East was seen as an asset to helping train officials from the region, whose options for such training would otherwise be very limited. The Cypriot government has secured another $5.6 million in European Union funding to expand the center and purchase additional high-tech equipment.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s such a huge interest by different agencies of the U.S. and the U.N. too, because they have seen the value of utilizing CYCLOPS because of its proximity to their neighboring countries,\u201d Chrysiliou said.",
      "Another selling point for the center is that it\u2019s situated a stone\u2019s throw away from Cyprus\u2019 main international airport of Larnaca and is close to top-flight accommodations that this tourism-reliant country is known for.",
      "The center's managers want to procure an expansive virtual reality system enabling officials to safely train on biological, chemical and radiological agents. Chrysiliou liaises daily with Kevin Keeler from the U.S. State Department\u2019s Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) program, who called the VR system a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d",
      "Although the center does have small quantities of radiological and other dangerous substances for training, a virtual simulator would greatly enhance the center\u2019s training capacity.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already put the word out about this new virtual simulator and we have agencies like, okay, how can we get on the schedule next year when it\u2019s not even been built yet? Yes, because it\u2019s a big factor in today\u2019s world,\u201d said Keeler.",
      "It\u2019s still early days for the center to count on headline-grabbing cases where WMD materials have been seized at any given border. Chrysiliou said what\u2019s equally important in acting as a potent deterrent is to send out the message that trained professionals \u201chave the means and the ways to check and stop you.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo if we teach Iraqis or Yemenis or Libyans or from other countries to do a better job in controlling their borders, in controlling the dispersion of weapons of mass destruction ... it makes their citizens much safer and more secure,\u201d said Chrysiliou."

      "A Japanese nuclear reactor that restarted last week for the first time in more than 13 years after it survived a massive earthquake and tsunami that badly damaged the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant has been shut down again due to an equipment problem",
      "TOKYO -- A Japanese nuclear reactor that restarted last week for the first time in more than 13 years after it had survived a massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that badly damaged the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant was shut down again Monday due to an equipment problem, its operator said.",
      "The No. 2 reactor at the Onagawa nuclear power plant on Japan\u2019s northern coast was put back online on Oct. 29 and had been expected to start generating power in early November.",
      "But it had to be shut down again five days after its restart due to a glitch that occurred Sunday in a device related to neutron data inside the reactor, plant operator Tohoku Electric Power Co. said.",
      "The reactor was operating normally and there was no release of radiation into the environment, Tohoku Electric said. The utility said it decided to shut it down to re-examine equipment to address residents' safety concerns. No new date for a restart was given.",
      "The reactor is one of three at the Onagawa plant, which is 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of the Fukushima Daiichi plant where three reactors melted following a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, releasing large amounts of radiation.",
      "The Onagawa plant was hit by a 13-meter (42-foot) tsunami triggered by the quake but was able to keep its crucial cooling systems functioning in all three reactors and achieve their safe shutdowns.",
      "All of Japan\u2019s 54 commercial nuclear power plants were shut down after the Fukushima disaster for safety checks and upgrades. Onagawa No. 2 was the 13th of the 33 still useable reactors to restart.",
      "Japan's government last year adopted a plan to maximize use of nuclear energy and is pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024. killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. It caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate."

      "It\u2019s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too.",
      "Returnless refunds are a tool that more retailers are using to keep online shoppers happy and to reduce shipping fees, processing time and other ballooning costs from returned products.",
      "Companies such as Amazon, Walmart and Target have decided some items are not worth the cost or hassle of getting back. Think a $20 T-shirt that might cost $30 in shipping and handling to recover. There are also single-use items, such as a package of plastic straws, that might be difficult to resell or medicines that could be unsafe to market again.",
      "Analysts say the companies offering returnless refunds do it somewhat sporadically, typically reserving the option for low-cost objects or ones with limited resale value. But some online shoppers said they've also been allowed to keep more pricey products.",
      "Dalya Harel, 48, received a return-free refund recently after ordering a desk from Amazon that cost roughly $300. When the desk arrived, she noticed it was missing some key pieces and would be impossible to put together, Harel said. She couldn't request a replacement and have it within a reasonable time for the office of her New York lice detection removal service because the item was out of stock.",
      "Harel, who routinely buys towels and other products from Amazon for her business, said her team reached out to the company's customer service line. She was pleasantly surprised to hear she would get a refund without having to send back the desk.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one less headache to deal with,\u201d Harel said. \u201cIt was really nice for us to not have to make an extra trip up to the post office.\u201d",
      "She used the desk pieces to create makeshift shelves in her office in Brooklyn.",
      "While the retail practice of letting customers keep merchandise and get their money back is not exactly a trade secret, the way it works is shrouded in mystery. Companies are not keen to publicize the circumstances in which they issue returnless refunds due to concerns over the potential for return fraud.",
      "Even if brands don't provide details about such policies on their websites, returnless refunds are expanding in at least some retail corners.",
      "Amazon, which industry experts say has engaged in the practice for years, announced in August that it would extend the option to the third-party sellers who drive most of the sales on the e-commerce giant's platform. Under the program, sellers who use the company\u2019s fulfillment services in the U.S. could choose to offer customers a traditional refund for purchases under $75 along with no obligation to return what they ordered.",
      "Amazon did not immediately respond to questions about how the program works. But publicly, it has pitched returnless refunds more directly to international sellers and those who offer cheaper goods. Items sold in an upcoming section of Amazon's website, which will allow U.S. shoppers to buy low-cost goods shipped directly from China, will also be eligible for returnless refunds, according to documents seen by The Associated Press.",
      "In January, Walmart gave a similar option to merchants who sell products on its growing online marketplace, leaving it up to sellers to set price limits and determine if or how they want to participate.",
      "China-founded e-commerce companies Shein and Temu say they also offer returnless refunds on a small number of orders, as does Target, the online shopping site Overstock and pet products e-tailer Chewy, which some customer said had encouraged them to donate unwanted items to local animal shelters.",
      "Wayfair, another online retailer cited by some customers as offering returnless refunds, did not reply to a request for comment on its policies.",
      "Overall, retailers and brands tend to be careful about how often they let customers keep items for free. Many of them are deploying algorithms to determine who should be given the option and who should not.",
      "To make the decision, the algorithms assess multiple factors, including the extent to which a shopper should be trusted based on prior purchasing \u2013 and returning \u2013 patterns, shipping costs and the demand for the product in the customer\u2019s hands, according to Sender Shamiss, CEO of goTRG, a reverse logistics company that works with retailers like Walmart.",
      "Optoro, a company that helps streamline returns for Best Buy, Staples and Gap Inc., has observed retailers assessing the lifetime value of a customer and extending returnless refunds as a type of unofficial, discreet loyalty benefit, according to CEO Amena Ali.",
      "The king of online retail appeared to verify the process works that way.",
      "In a statement, Amazon said it offers returnless refunds on a \u201cvery small number\u201d of items as a \u201cconvenience to customers.\u201d",
      "The company also said it's hearing positive feedback from sellers about its new program that authorized them to tell customers they could keep some products and still be reimbursed. Amazon said it was monitoring for signs of fraud and setting eligibility criteria for sellers and customers. It didn't provide additional details on what that encompassed.",
      "Some retailers also are stiffening the liberal return policies they long employed to encourage online orders. Shoppers who enjoyed making purchases on their computers or cellphones became accustomed to loading up their digital shopping baskets with the intent of returning items they ended up not liking.",
      "Shopping online also grew significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homebound consumers reduced their trips to stores and relied on sites like Amazon for everyday items. Retail companies have talked in recent years about returns becoming more expensive to process due to the growing volume, rising inflation and labor costs.",
      "Last year, U.S. consumers returned $743 billion worth of merchandise, or 14.5% of the products they purchased - up from 10.6% in 2020, according to the National Retail Federation. In 2019, returned merchandise was valued at $309 billion, according to loss prevention company Appriss Retail.",
      "Last year, roughly 14% of returns were fraudulent, costing retailers $101 billion in losses, according to a joint report from the National Retail federation and Appriss Retail. The problem spans from low-level forms of fraud - such as shoppers returning already worn clothing - to more complicated schemes by fraudsters who return shoplifted merchandise or items purchased on stolen credit cards.",
      "To deter excessive returns, some retailers, including H&M, Zara and J. Crew, started charging customers return fees in the past year. Others have shortened their return windows. Some shopping sites, such as the Canadian retailer Ssense, have threatened to kick frequent returners off their platforms if they suspect abuse of their policies.",
      "However, retailers don't all view frequent returners in the same way. Such customers could be seen as \u201cgood returners\u201d if they purchase \u2013 and keep \u2013 many more items than they send back, Ali said.",
      "\u201cOftentimes, your most profitable customers tend to be high returners,\u201d she said."

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 15:38:31 -0500",
    "summary": "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
    "story": [
      "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
      "NEW YORK -- For some television viewers, size apparently does matter.",
      "Forget the 65-inch TVs that were considered bigger than average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 8 feet diagonally. That's wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a king-size bed.",
      "Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year, according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise tepid television market, according to analysts.",
      "The 38,100 televisions of at least 97 inches sold between January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs \u2014 the 19 models range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 \u2014 and introduced displays in roughly 70% of its stores.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really taken off this year,\" Blake Hampton, Best Buy's senior vice president of merchandising, said.",
      "Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at least 97 inches was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its first 98-inch TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said.",
      "Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling business, recently bought a 98-inch Sony for his 14,000-square-foot house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 85-inch TV in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home and uses some to display digital art.",
      "\u201cWe just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking for and thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony. \u201cYou get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You\u2019re sitting watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can put yourself in the scene.\u201d",
      "The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through September period, Circana said.",
      "Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski, the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a year, Kowalski said.",
      "The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of two inches in both 2021 and 2022, and 85-inch TVs began gaining traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 98-inch TVs to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 110-115 inches are on the market right now, he said.",
      "\u201cYou get better resolution over time,\" Kowalski said. \"You get better picture quality. And so just over time, it\u2019s easier to produce those sets and improve the technology.\"",
      "Best Buy's Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as \u201cincredible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re watching YouTube TV content or \u2018 NFL Sunday Ticket,\u2019 you can actually get four screens up, and that\u2019s four 48-inch screens on it,\u201d he said.",
      "Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed its 98-inch lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every scene.",
      "James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment division of Samsung's U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and experience content is shifting.",
      "\u201cIt's even more so about watching TV as a shared experience,\u201d Fishler said. \u201cThey want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at home. \u201d",
      "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, its Sam\u2019s Club division, and Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens.",
      "TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach on home theater projectors, which create a 100- to 120-inch image that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without windows.",
      "\u201cA dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the purview of projectors,\u201d Andrew Sivori, vice president in the entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer. \"But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV.\"",
      "Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd. But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, \u201cIt\u2019s still a niche business.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of people just don\u2019t have the space to put one of those in,\u201d he added.",
      "Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make sure a 98-inch TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said.",
      "But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good news is that the recommended distance for a 98-inch TV is actually just 6-12 feet from the seating area. The rule of thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine the ideal viewing distance, Samsung's Fishler said.",
      "If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go?",

      "Indonesia\u2019s National Disaster Management Agency says that at least ten people have died as a series of volcanic eruptions widens on the remote island of Flores",
      "MAUMERE, Indonesia -- Indonesia\u2019s National Disaster Management Agency said Monday that at least 10 people have died as a series of volcanic eruptions widens on the remote island of Flores.",
      "The eruption at Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki around midnight spewed thick brownish ash as high as 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) into the air and hot ashes hit several villages, burning down houses including a convent of Catholic nuns, said Firman Yosef, an official at the Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki monitoring post.",
      "He said volcanic material was thrown up to 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from its crater, blanketing nearby villages and towns with tons of volcanic debris and forcing residents to flee.",
      "Rescuers were still searching for more bodies buried under collapsed houses, said Abdul Muhari, the National Disaster Management Agency\u2019s spokesperson. Muhari said all the bodies, including a child, were found with a 4-kilometer (2.4 mile) radius of the crater.",
      "He said at least 10,000 people have been affected by the eruption in six villages of Wulanggitang District, and four villages in Ile Bura district. Some have fled to relatives\u2019 houses while the local government is readying schools to use as temporary shelters.",
      "The country\u2019s volcano monitoring agency increased the volcano\u2019s alert status to the highest level and more than doubled the exclusion zone to a 7-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius after midnight on Monday as eruptions became more frequent.",
      "A nun in Hokeng village died and another was missing, said Agusta Palma, the head of the Saint Gabriel Foundation that oversees convents on the majority-Catholic island.",
      "\u201cOur nuns ran out in panic under a rain of volcanic ash in the darkness,\u201d Palma said.",
      "Photos and videos circulated on social media showed tons of volcanic debris covering houses up to their rooftops in villages like Hokeng, where hot volcanic material set fire to houses.",
      "Lewotobi Laki-laki is one of a pair of stratovolcanoes in the East Flores district of East Nusa Tenggara province known locally as the husband \u2014 \u201cLaki-laki\u201d means man \u2014 and wife mountains. Its mate is Lewotobi Perempuan, or woman.",
      "About 6,500 people were evacuated in January after Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki began erupting, spewing thick clouds and forcing the government to close the island's Frans Seda Airport. No casualties or major damage were reported, but the airport has remained closed since then due to seismic activity.",
      "In a video conference on Monday, Muhammad Wafid, the head of Geology Agency at the Energy and Mineral Resources ministry said there was a different character between January\u2019s eruption and Monday\u2019s eruption due to a blockage of magma in the crater, which reduced detectible seismic activity while building up pressure.",
      "\u201cThe eruptions that occurred since Friday were due to the accumulation of hidden energy,\u201d Wafid said.",
      "It\u2019s Indonesia\u2019s second volcanic eruption in as many weeks. West Sumatra province\u2019s Mount Marapi, one of the country\u2019s most active volcanos, erupted on Oct. 27, spewing thick columns of ash at least three times and blanketing nearby villages with debris, but no casualties were reported.",
      "Lewotobi Laki-laki is one of the 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, an archipelago of 280 million people. The country is prone to earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activity because it sits along the \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the Pacific Ocean. ___",

      "BEIJING -- Three Chinese astronauts returned to Earth on Monday after a six-month stay on the Tiangong space station, part of China\u2019s effort to be a global leader in space exploration.",
      "A parachute slowed their capsule's nighttime descent to a remote landing area in China's Inner Mongolia region. The crew emerged after touching down at 1:24 a.m. A Chinese national flag stuck in the ground near the capsule flapped in the wind.",
      "In recent years, the country's space program has brought back rocks from the moon and landed a rover on Mars. It aims to put a person on the moon by 2030, which would make China the second nation after the United States to do so.",
      "The space station astronauts returned after welcoming a replacement three-person crew last week for the latest six-month mission. The new team of one woman and two men will conduct experiments, carry out spacewalks and install equipment to protect the station from space debris.",
      "A space agency official said in April that Tiangong had maneuvered several times to avoid debris and had partially lost power when the solar wing's power cables were hit by debris, according to a report from the official Xinhua News Agency.",
      "China is among the countries that have created space debris, including the reported break-up of a rocket stage in August during the launch of the first 18 satellites for a global internet service similar to Starlink, the still-growing constellation of satellites operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX.",
      "Tiangong, which means Heavenly Palace, was completed two years ago and orbits the earth.",
      "Only Chinese astronauts have gone to the space station so far, but a space agency spokesperson said last week that China is in discussions to select and train astronauts from other nations to join the missions, Xinhua reported.",
      "Astronauts from several nations have traveled to the International Space Station, but China is blocked from that program mainly because of U.S. concerns over the military's involvement in China's space program.",
      "China laid out an ambitious plan last month to become a leader in space science research by 2050 in conjunction with its advances in space exploration."

      "ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine -- To be a parent in the Ukrainian front-line city of Zaporizhzhia means weighing your child\u2019s life against the Russian weapons within striking distance.",
      "Most rain death in an instant: the drones, the ballistic missiles, the glide bombs, the artillery shells. But Russian soldiers control another weapon they have never deployed, with the potential to be just as deadly: The nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.",
      "The NPP, as it\u2019s known, once produced more electricity than any other nuclear power plant in Europe. It fell to Russian forces in the first weeks of the full-scale invasion, and Russia has held its six reactors ever since. The plant has come under repeated attacks that both sides blame on the other.",
      "These twin dangers \u2014 bombs and radiation \u2014 shadow families in Zaporizhzhia. Most of the youngest residents of the city have never seen the inside of a classroom. Schools that had suspended in-person classes during the COVID-19 pandemic more than four years ago continued online classes after the war started in February 2022.",
      "So with missiles and bombs still striking daily, Zaporizhzhia is going on a building binge for its future, creating an underground school system.",
      "Construction has begun on a dozen subterranean schools designed to be radiation- and bomb-proof and capable of educating 12,000 students. Then, officials say, they will start on the hospital system.",
      "The daily bombs are a more tangible fear than radiation, said Kateryna Ryzhko, a mother whose children are the third generation in her family to attend School No. 88. The main building, dating to the Soviet era of the children\u2019s grandmother, is immaculate but the classrooms are empty. The underground version is nearly complete, and Ryzhko said she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to send her kids to class there. Nearly four years of online learning have taken their toll on kids and parents alike.",
      "\u201cEven classmates don\u2019t recognize each other,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only safe way to have an education and not be on screens.\u201d",
      "Within days of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Zaporizhzhia\u2019s 300,000 residents found themselves on the front lines. Unlike larger Ukrainian cities, like Kyiv or Kharkiv, there is no subway system that could do double-duty as a bomb shelter and few schools had basements where students could more safely attend classes.",
      "Many residents left \u2014 though some have returned. But the single-family homes and Soviet-style apartment blocks of Zaporizhzhia, the capital of the region that shares its name, filled nearly as quickly with Ukrainians fleeing areas seized by Russian forces, like the cities of Mariupol, Melitopol and Berdyansk.",
      "By the start of the school year in September 2022, which was supposed to mark the post-pandemic return to classrooms, schools were empty. Windows were boarded up to protect against bomb shockwaves, the lawns left unkempt. Fifty kilometers (31 miles) away, the nuclear reactor went into cold shutdown after intense negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Russian government.",
      "The IAEA has rotated a handful of staff on site ever since. There are risks even in cold shutdown, when the reactor is operating but not generating power. The main danger is that its external electrical supply, which comes from Ukrainian-controlled territory under constant Russian bombardment, will be cut off for a longer period than generators can handle.",
      "The nuclear plant needs electricity to keep crucial backups functioning, including water pumps that prevent meltdowns, radiation monitors and other essential safety systems.",
      "During a recent Associated Press trip to the Ukrainian-controlled zone closest to the nuclear plant, two airborne bombs struck electrical infrastructure in a matter of minutes as night fell. Russia has repeatedly struck at Ukraine\u2019s grid, attacks that have intensified this year. Highlighting the constant danger, electricity to the NPP was cut yet again for three days as emergency workers struggled to put out the fire. It was at least the seventh time this year that the plant was down to either a single electrical line or generator power, according to the global Nuclear Energy Agency.",
      "\u201cNuclear power plants are not meant to be disconnected from the grid. It\u2019s not designed for that. It\u2019s also not designed to be operating in cold shutdown for that long,\u201d said Darya Dolzikova, a researcher on nuclear policy at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accuses Russia of targeting nuclear plants deliberately. The 1986 meltdown in Ukraine\u2019s Chornobyl, on the northern border nearly 900 kilometers (550 miles) from Zaporizhzhia, increased the country\u2019s rates of thyroid disease among Ukrainian children far from the accident site and radiation contaminated the immediate surroundings before drifting over much of the Northern Hemisphere. To this day, the area around the plant, known in Russian as Chernobyl, is an \u201cexclusion zone\u201d off-limits except to the technical staff needed to keep the decommissioned site safe.",
      "Russian forces seized control of Chornobyl in the first days of the invasion, only to be driven back by Ukrainian forces.",
      "The Zaporizhzhia plant has a safer, more modern design than Chornobyl and there\u2019s not the same danger of a large-scale meltdown, experts say. But that doesn\u2019t reduce the risk to zero, and Russia will remain a threatening neighbor even after the war ends.",
      "An investment that might seem extreme elsewhere is more understandable in Ukraine, said Sam Lair, a researcher at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies.",
      "\u201cThey are there under a conventional air and missile attack from the Russians, and they have experience with the fact that those attacks aren\u2019t being targeted only at military targets,\u201d Lair said. \u201cIf I were in their position, I would be building them too.\u201d",
      "In addition, the Zaporizhzhia region received a European Union donation of 5.5 million iodine pills, which help block the thyroid\u2019s absorption of some radiation.",
      "Since the start of the war, Russia has repeatedly alluded to its nuclear weapons stockpile without leveling direct threats. In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would consider any attack by a country supported by a nuclear-armed nation to be a joint attack and stressed that Russia could respond with nuclear weapons to any attack that posed a \u201ccritical threat to our sovereignty.\u201d",
      "Ukrainian officials fear that the Russian attacks on Chornobyl and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plants may be just a start. During his speech in late September to the U.N. General Assembly, Zelenskyy warned that Russia was preparing strikes on more nuclear plants, which generate a large portion of Ukraine\u2019s electricity.",
      "\u201cIf, God forbid, Russia causes a nuclear disaster at one of our nuclear power plants, radiation won\u2019t respect state borders,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "The cost to build a subterranean school system is enormous \u2014 the budget for the underground version of Gymnasium No. 71 alone stands at more than 112 million hryvnias ($2.7 million). International donors are covering most of it, and the national and local governments have made it a priority on par with funding the army.",
      "\u201cEverybody understands that fortification and aid for the army, it\u2019s priority No. 1,\u201d said Ivan Fedorov, head of the Zaporizhzhia region. \u201cBut if we lose the new generation of our Ukrainians, for whom (do) we fight?\u201d",
      "Daria Oncheva, a 15-year-old student at Gymnasium 71, looks forward to the underground classes, and not just because she\u2019ll finally be in the same place as her schoolmates.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s safer than sitting at home remotely,\u201d she said.",
      "School No. 88, across town, is further along, with rooms carved out and fully lined with concrete thick enough to block an initial onslaught of radiation. The contractor leading the project is also digging trenches for Ukraine\u2019s military. When done, it will also be the primary bomb shelter for the neighborhood, whose single-family homes tend to have small orchards and trellised gardens \u2014 but no basements.",
      "An optimistic timeline has the school ready for children by December. It has three layers of rebar totaling 400 tons of metal, plus 3,100 cubic meters of reinforced concrete. The building will be topped by nearly a meter (yard) of earth, concealed by a soccer field and playground.",
      "The school will have an air filtration system, two distinct electrical lines and the ability to operate autonomously for three days, including with extra food and water supplies.",
      "Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who studies how people can survive nuclear fallout, said being underground improves survival by a factor of 10.",
      "But Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said ultimately people can do more \u2014 \u201cwhich is eliminating these weapons instead of \u2026 building, really not even a Band-Aid, for the actual problem.\u201d",
      "Lyudmila Zlatova, who has been the principal at School No. 88 for 30 years, hopes it will be a structure designed for the dangers Zaporizhzhia will face in the future. But she and the parents who gathered on a recent day were most concerned with the present, speaking at the edge of the construction pit as air raid sirens sounded.",
      "It takes 10 seconds for a bomb to reach the neighborhood from the front line, far too short a time to evacuate, and they land with unnerving frequency. The subterranean school\u2019s sunless rooms and concrete corridors will only make children more comfortable, given what they\u2019re already enduring, she said.",
      "\u201cThey will feel better studying without windows,\u201d Zlatova said, peering across at the construction site.",
      "Zlatova believes it will bring back at least some of the families who\u2019ve left Zaporizhzhia for other cities in Ukraine or elsewhere in Europe. The city remains fully functional, with public transit operating and grocery stores, markets and restaurants operating, and repairs ongoing for structures damaged by shelling \u2014 albeit in limited fashion. Around 150 of the school\u2019s 650 prewar students have left the city, but she said she\u2019s in touch with absent families and many promise to return home once there is a safe place to study.",
      "Gymnasium No. 6, which runs from first grade through high school, already has one. Its main building sits on the city\u2019s easternmost edge, closer than any other school to the front 40 kilometers (25 miles) away.",
      "Little wonder that its principal, Kostyantyn Lypskyi, seems a little frayed at the beginning of the academic year. But at least his students can attend because parents chipped in money last year to renovate the basement shelter about 50 meters from the main school building into a series of classrooms.",
      "His underground school, whose concrete walls and relatively thin metal doors are not radiation proof but protect against explosions, hold around 500 people \u2014 the same number as the new designs. The school has double that number, so students will alternate weeks. The youngest children study full-time just upstairs from the shelter, and the older ones are in the main building.",
      "\u201cOf course it will work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe prepared everything for the start of the new school year.\u201d",
      "In the earliest days of the school year, an air raid alarm meant he could test that confidence. It took five minutes from the moment the sirens sounded until the last children took their seats and spread out their books, awaiting instruction.",

      "Online video production company MrBeast says it has fired somewhere between 5 to 10 employees following an investigation into the YouTube empire\u2019s workplace culture",
      "NEW YORK -- Online video production company MrBeast said Friday it has fired somewhere between 5 to 10 employees following an investigation into the YouTube empire's workplace culture.",
      "A company spokesman declined to put a precise number on the firings, say which employees were let go or for what reasons. But the shakeup comes as Jimmy Donaldson, who draws millions of views under the MrBeast alias with highly produced stunts and giveaways, deals with accusations of impropriety against himself, his collaborators and others within his multimillion-dollar production company that have threatened his family-friendly image.",
      "Investigators only identified \u201cseveral isolated instances of workplace harassment and misconduct,\" according to a two-page letter sent Friday by Alex Spiro, a trial lawyer who led the investigation by white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and whose clients have included Jay-Z and Elon Musk.",
      "The nearly three-month probe concluded that there was no basis behind allegations that MrBeast team members committed sexual misconduct or \u201cknowingly\u201d employed people with \u201cproclivities or histories towards illegal or questionable legal conduct.\"",
      "Spiro said the team interviewed 39 current and former employees. Millions of documents from phones, emails, and messaging platforms including Discord and Slack were also reviewed, according to the letter.",
      "The controversies surrounding the so-called King of YouTube began snowballing this summer. Ava Tyson, a Donaldson friend and fellow creator accused of sharing inappropriate sexual messages with minors over multiple years, left the channel in July. Also circulated online by YouTuber Rosanna Pansino was a 2017 recording of Donaldson making racist comments and using homophobic slurs.",
      "A preliminary July shoot for his ambitious \u201cBeast Games\u201d Amazon Prime Video show was quickly hit with safety complaints from some contestants who said they faced \u201climited sustenance\u201d and \u201cinsufficient medical staffing\u201d while competing for a $5 million grand prize.",
      "MrBeast in turn has hired new executives, including a head of personnel and a general counsel, according to Spiro, and additional employees are getting \u201ctargeted training and executive coaching\u201d for undisclosed violations of company policy.",
      "The company \u201chas grown exceedingly quickly from a YouTube start-up comprised of a group of talented young individuals to a much larger entity,\u201d Spiro wrote to MrBeast's Board of Directors. \u201cIt is not uncommon that policies and practices essential in a mature company would lag behind commercial success.\u201d",
      "Donaldson has largely remained silent on the matters. He recently launched a prepacked lunch brand alongside internet personalities Logan Paul and KSI \u2014 marking his latest entrance into the food market after his chocolate bar and burger chain were met with mixed reviews. His 325 million YouTube subscribers have continued to see their feeds filled with outlandish, high-energy videos like the recently titled \u201c100 Identical Twins Fight For $250,000.\u201d",
      "In a Friday post on X sharing Spiro's letter, Donaldson wrote that he \u201cwas asked to refrain from making public statements to enable a detailed and unbiased investigation.\u201d",
      "Pansino, one of Donaldson\u2019s most vocal critics, responded on X that the findings of \u201cworkplace harassment and misconduct\u201d and \u201cmultiple firings\u201d mean \"it might be time for a bigger investigation.\u201d",
      "Donaldson's level of fame and growth place him in \u201cpretty rare company,\u201d said advertising lawyer Robert Freund, whose practice helps creators resolve disputes. He said he suspects the letter was released in attempt to assure stakeholders \u201cthat he's running a professional operation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see anything fishy or suspicious about what we\u2019ve been presented with here as the public,\u201d Freund told The Associated Press.",

      "Apart from making up for a shrinking labor force and the need to reduce workloads for drivers, the system also will help cut carbon emissions, she said.",
      "\u201cThe key concept of the auto flow-road is to create dedicated spaces within the road network for logistics, utilizing a 24-hour automated and unmanned transportation system,\u201d Endo said.",
      "The plan may sound like a solution that would only work in relatively low-crime, densely populated societies like Japan, not sprawling nations like the U.S. But similar ideas are being considered in Switzerland and Great Britain. The plan in Switzerland involves an underground pathway, while the one being planned in London will be a fully automated system running on low-cost linear motors.",
      "In Japan, loading will be automated, using forklifts, and coordinated with airports, railways and ports.",
      "The boxes measure 180 centimeters in height, or nearly six feet, and are 110 centimeters, or 3.6 feet, by 110 centimeters in width and length, about the size of a big closet.",
      "The system, which is also intended for business deliveries, may be expanded to other routes if all goes well. Human drivers may still have to do last-mile deliveries to people's doors, although driverless technology may be used in the future.",
      "Japan's shortage of truck drivers is worsening due to laws that took effect earlier this year that limit the amount of overtime drivers can log. That's seen as necessary to avoid overwork and accidents and to make the jobs tolerable, but in Japanese logistics, government and transportation circles, it\u2019s known as the \u201c2024 problem.\u201d",
      "Under current conditions, Japan's overall transport capacity will plunge by 34% by 2030, according to government estimates. The domestic transport capacity stands at about 4.3 billion metric tons, almost all, or more than 91%, by trucks, according to the Japan Trucking Association.",
      "That's a fraction of what's moving in a massive country like the U.S. About 5.2 trillion ton-miles of freight are transported in the United States each year, and that's projected to reach more than 8 trillion ton-miles of freight by 2050. A ton-mile measures the amount of freight shipped and how far it\u2019s moved, with the standard unit being one ton being moved one mile.",
      "Demand for deliveries from online shopping surged during the pandemic, with users jumping from about 40% of Japanese households to more than 60%, according to government data, even as the overall population keeps declining as the birth rate falls.",
      "As is true in most places, truck drivers have tough jobs requiring them to be on the road for days at a time, work that most jobseekers find unappealing.",
      "In recent years, annual fatalities from delivery trucks crashing on roads have hovered at about 1,000 deaths. That's improved from nearly 2,000 deaths in 2010, but the Trucking Association, which groups some 400 trucking businesses and organizations in the nation, would like to make deliveries even safer.",
      "The association is also urging consumers to hold back on delivery orders or at least bundle their orders. Some industry experts are urging businesses to limit free delivery offers.",
      "Trucks carry about 90% of Japan\u2019s cargo, and about 60% of Japan\u2019s fresh produce, like fruits and vegetables, come from distant places requiring trucking, according to Yuji Yano, a professor at the Ryutsu Keizai University, which is funded? by deliveries giant Nippon Express Co., now called NX Holdings, and focuses on economics and liberal arts studies, including trucking problems.",
      "\u201cThat means the 2024 problem isn\u2019t just a transportation problem but really a people\u2019s problem,\u201d Yano said.",

    "story": [
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to clarify remarks he made at a New York campaign rally where he suggested that Republicans may try to repeal legislation that has spurred U.S. production of semiconductor chips",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday that Republicans \u201cprobably will\u201d try to repeal legislation that spurred U.S. production of semiconductor chips, a statement he quickly tried to walk back by saying he would like to instead \u201cstreamline\u201d it.",
      "Johnson made the initial comment while campaigning for a vulnerable New York GOP congressman in a district that is anticipating a large new Micron semiconductor manufacturing plant.",
      "A reporter asked Johnson whether he would try to repeal the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had disparaged last week. \u201cI expect that we probably will, but we haven\u2019t developed that part of the agenda yet,\" Johnson replied.",
      "Democrats quickly jumped on the Republican speaker\u2019s comments, warning that it showed how Johnson and Trump are pursuing an aggressive conservative agenda bent on dismantling even popular government programs. The White House has credited the CHIPS Act for spurring hundreds of billions of dollars of investments as well as hundreds of thousands of jobs. Vice President Kamala Harris has pointed to the legislation on the campaign trail as proof that Democrats can be entrusted with the U.S. economy.",
      "Johnson, who voted against the legislation, later said in a statement that the CHIPS Act, which poured $54 billion into the semiconductor manufacturing industry, \u201cis not on the agenda for repeal.\"",
      "\u201cTo the contrary, there could be legislation to further streamline and improve the primary purpose of the bill\u2014to eliminate its costly regulations and Green New Deal requirements,\u201d the speaker's statement said.",
      "It wasn't the first recent comment Johnson has had to walk back. Earlier this week he had to clean up comments he made saying he wanted to \u201ctake a blow torch to the regulatory state\u201d and make \u201cmassive\u201d changes to the Affordable Care Act. After facing political blowback, he said that repealing the health care law was \u201cnot on the table.\u201d",
      "The incident was emblematic of Johnson's struggle working closely with Trump and at the same time campaigning for his House colleagues, especially those locked in tough reelection battles that are crucial to Republicans holding a narrow majority. The speaker was campaigning for Rep. Brandon Williams, a New York Republican who worked in the tech industry before running for Congress and supported the CHIPS Act.",
      "Williams said in a statement that he spoke privately with Johnson after he suggested that the act could be repealed.",
      "\u201cHe apologized profusely, saying he misheard the question,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Williams' district is anticipating a large new Micron semiconductor manufacturing plant. The company has said it received grants of $6.1 billion from the CHIPS Act to support its plans.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement Friday, \u201cAnyone threatening to repeal the CHIPS & Science Act is threatening more than 50,000 good-paying jobs in Upstate New York and $231 billion worth of economic growth nationwide.\u201d",
      "Democrats are hoping that the comments give them a late boost as they try to court working class voters in regions that depend on factory jobs. Harris, during a campaign stop in Saginaw, Michigan earlier this week, toured another semiconductor factory to bring attention to the 2022 law.",
      "In response to Johnson's comments Friday, a spokesperson for Harris' campaign, Ammar Moussa, said, \"Harris is running to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and make us competitive globally. The only way to guarantee these Republicans never get a chance to repeal these laws that are creating jobs and saving Americans money is to elect her president.\u201d",
      "As of August, the CHIPS and Science Act had provided $30 billion in support for 23 projects in 15 states that would add 115,000 manufacturing and construction jobs, according to the Commerce Department. That funding helped to draw in private capital and would enable the United States to produce 30% of the world\u2019s most advanced computer chips, up from 0% when the Biden-Harris administration succeeded Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "Viet Shelton, spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said, \u201cMost politicians usually go to a community promising to create jobs in the town they\u2019re visiting\u2026 Mike Johnson, ever the trendsetter, decided to visit a town and promise to kill jobs in that town.\u201d"

But Russian soldiers control another weapon they have never deployed, with the potential to be just as deadly: The nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.",
      "The NPP, as it\u2019s known, once produced more electricity than any other nuclear power plant in Europe. It fell to Russian forces in the first weeks of the full-scale invasion, and Russia has held its six reactors ever since. The plant has come under repeated attacks that both sides blame on the other.",
      "These twin dangers \u2013 bombs and radiation \u2013 shadow families in Zaporizhzhia. An Associated Press team spent nearly a week in the city to learn about its building binge for its future: an underground school system.",
      "Here's what AP found:",
      "About 50 kilometers (31 miles) away, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been in in cold shutdown for two years after intense negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Russian government. The IAEA has rotated a handful of staff on site ever since.",
      "There are risks even in cold shutdown, when the reactor is operating but not generating power. The main danger is that its external electrical supply, which comes from Ukrainian-controlled territory under constant Russian bombardment, will be cut off for a longer period than generators can handle.",
      "The nuclear plant needs electricity to keep crucial backups functioning, including water pumps that prevent meltdowns, radiation monitors and other essential safety systems. Russia has repeatedly struck at Ukraine\u2019s grid, attacks that have intensified this year. Highlighting the constant danger, electricity to the NPP was cut yet again for three days as emergency workers struggled to put out the fire.",
      "The Zaporizhzhia plant has a safer, more modern design than Chornobyl, known in Russian as Chernobyl, and there\u2019s not the same danger of a large-scale meltdown, experts say. But that doesn\u2019t reduce the risk to zero.",
      "Most of the youngest residents of the city have never seen the inside of a classroom. Schools that had suspended in-person classes during the COVID-19 pandemic nearly four years ago continued online classes after the war started in February 2022.",
      "Construction has begun on a dozen subterranean schools designed to be radiation- and bomb-proof and capable of educating 12,000 students.",
      "The cost to build a subterranean school system is enormous \u2014 the budget for the underground version of Gymnasium No. 71 alone stands at more than 112 million hryvnias ($2.7 million). International donors are covering most of it, and the national and local governments have made it a priority on par with funding the army.",
      "But most parents say bombs, which strike the city daily, are a far more tangible fear than radiation.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accuses Russia of targeting nuclear plants deliberately. Russian forces seized control of the Chornobyl area in the first days of the invasion, only to be driven back by Ukrainian forces.",
      "Since the start of the war, Russia has repeatedly alluded to its nuclear weapons stockpile without leveling direct threats. In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would consider any attack by a country supported by a nuclear-armed nation to be a joint attack and stressed that Russia could respond with nuclear weapons to any attack that posed a \u201ccritical threat to our sovereignty.\u201d",
      "Ukrainian officials fear that the Russian attacks on Chornobyl and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plants may be just a start. During his speech in late September to the U.N. General Assembly, Zelenskyy warned that Russia was preparing strikes on more nuclear plants, which generate a large portion of Ukraine\u2019s electricity.",

      "The National Semiconductor Technology Center Extreme Ultraviolet Accelerator is scheduled to begin operating next year. The contract for it stems from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which was designed to create more high-tech jobs and help the United States compete with international rivals like China. The Biden administration has set a goal for the U.S. to make 20% of the world\u2019s advanced chips.",

      "The European Commission opened its investigation five months after adding Temu to the list of \u201cvery large online platforms\u201d needing the strictest level of scrutiny under the bloc's Digital Services Act. It's a wide-ranging rulebook designed to clean up online platforms and keep internet users safe, with the threat of hefty fines.",
      "Temu started entering Western markets only in the past two years and has grown in popularity by offering cheap goods - from clothing to home products \u2014 that are shipped from sellers in China. The company, owned by Pinduoduo Inc., a popular e-commerce site in China, now has 92 million users in the EU.",
      "Temu said it \u201ctakes its obligations under the DSA seriously, continuously investing to strengthen our compliance system and safeguard consumer interests on our platform.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will cooperate fully with regulators to support our shared goal of a safe, trusted marketplace for consumers,\u201d the company said in a statement.",

      "Google Maps recently surpassed 2 billion monthly users worldwide for the first time, a milestone that illustrates how dependent people have become on the service\u2019s directions during their daily commutes and excursions to new places. With the introduction of Google\u2019s AI-powered Gemini technology, the maps are now being set up to become entertainment guides in addition to navigational tools.",
      "Starting this week in the U.S. only, users will be able to converse with Google Maps to ask for tips on things to do around specific spots in a neighborhood or city and receive lists of restaurants, bars and other nearby attractions that include reviews that have been compiled through the years. The new features will also provide more detailed information about parking options near a designated destination along with walking directions for a user to check after departing the car.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a new era of maps,\u201d Miriam Daniel, general manager of Google Maps, told reporters Wednesday during a preview of the features presented in Palo Alto, California. \u201cWe are transforming how you navigate and explore the world.\u201d",

      "ABC News projects Trump to win at least 279 electoral votes.",
      "Former President Donald Trump is projected to win the presidential race by ABC News, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in a frenzied contest to stage an improbable historic comeback.",
      "Trump ended up with at least 279 electoral votes after clinching wins in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin. Harris has won at least 219 votes. The race was marked by literal history, including two assassination attempts and 34 felony convictions against Trump, already having been impeached twice and faulted for mismanaging the COVID-19 pandemic response.",
      "Maybe even more memorable was President Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the race after a ruinous June debate in which he struggled at times to form sentences.",
      "Trump's victory underscores just how deep voters' frustrations were surrounding inflation and immigration, Republicans' two top issues this election cycle as polls consistently showed Americans' unhappiness with how Biden handled them.",
      "His return to the White House also suggests that Democrats were not motivated enough by the prospect of electing the first female president and that its base's fury over the Supreme Court's revocation of constitutional abortion protections has waned since 2022.",
      "For Trump personally, the win offers both political vindication and legal protection. Since his win, he and his brand were soundly rejected in 2018, 2020 and 2022. And once in office, he'd be able to undermine criminal cases against him surrounding his handling of classified documents while out of office and efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.",
      "\"I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president,\" Trump said in his victory speech.",
      "Trump's victory is likely to set off transformations in both parties.",
      "His win will likely help cement his \"Make America Great Again\" brand of politics as the dominant strand of Republicanism for the foreseeable future, with Vice President-elect JD Vance seemingly well positioned to carry on Trump's mantle after the current administration ends in a little over four years.",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, will likely have to sift through the rubble to understand what voters found so unappetizing about them that they'd choose instead to support a twice-impeached convicted felon who had already been voted out of office once.",
      "The former and future president has not substantively outlined his goals for a second term -- at his debate with Harris he boasted of having \"concepts of a plan\" when it comes to health care -- though he has warned that he could go after his political opponents and journalists. He also could use his familiarity with the federal bureaucracy to help install civil servants who are loyal to him.",
      "He will at least have a friendly, GOP-controlled Senate, though the House majority remains up in the air.",
      "Among the chief policy areas where Trump could leave his imprint are on the world stage, where he has forecasted less support for Ukraine; on trade, where he has boasted of tariffs of as high as 100% on some imports, and on immigration, where he supports a mass deportation force and eliminating the Temporary Protected Status program.",
      "He's also vowed to \"drill, baby, drill\" and lower costs, though his tariffs would likely raise the price of many goods, economists say, and he promised to eliminate tax on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits for seniors.",
      "Perhaps more than anything, though, Democrats will be on the lookout for any form of retribution from a candidate who repeatedly dubbed his detractors the \"enemy from within,\" though he never went after Hillary Clinton after leading chants of \"lock her up\" in 2016.",
      "Trump's victory this year was far from assured.",
      "Republicans across the spectrum panned Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack by his supporters on the U.S. Capitol to stop certification of the 2020 election, with even allies like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., suggesting the party should move on from the former president and his brand. That nascent push was largely abandoned weeks later when then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., ventured down to Mar-a-Lago to make amends and discuss House strategy.",
      "Republicans' disappointing 2022 election results tore open those divides once again. After an anticipated red wave instead gave way to the loss of a Senate seat and only marginal House gains, GOP leaders wondered if the time had come to elevate other lawmakers as the party's future.",
      "Buzz mounted around Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as a younger Republican and culture warrior who could synthesize Trump's brawler style into more widespread appeal, with Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis calling him the party \"leader.\" Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence offered more traditional conservative credentials in a snapback of sorts to a pre-Trump party.",
      "Millions of dollars flooded a crowded 2024 GOP primary field, with DeSantis in particular leaning on a historically well-heeled and involved super PAC to proselytize his fighter credentials.",
      "None of it mattered.",
      "Pence dropped out before the calendar even turned to 2024. DeSantis ended his campaign before the New Hampshire primary after falling far short of expectations in Iowa. And while Haley stuck around for months, even drawing thousands of votes in primaries after she ended her own campaign in March, no candidate ever held a candle to Trump's share of the primary electorate.",
      "All of the 2024 contenders endorsed Trump except for Pence and former Govs. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and Chris Christie of New Jersey, none of whom made close to a dent in the nominating contest.",
      "Even though he clinched the nomination as the GOP's dominant figure and former president, Trump's campaign was ultimately anything but conventional.",
      "Trump was dogged by a slate of investigations into his handling of classified documents upon leaving office, his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and payments made to the porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016. He was able to fend off or delay many of the federal investigations he faced, and while he was convicted in a New York trial of 34 felony counts over the Daniels payments, his sentencing was delayed until after the election.",
      "Compounding on the history of the election were two assassination attempts against Trump, the first of which, in July, saw him grazed in the ear by a bullet. Trump was able to use the threats to juice his fundraising and expound on his victimhood narrative, though they did not lead to any fundamental polling shifts.",
      "But perhaps more than anything, Trump's campaign was roiled by chaos in the Democratic Party.",
      "Trump appeared to initially struggle to figure out how to attack Harris once she took over as Democrats' nominee, even continuing to go after Biden.",
      "However, Trump eventually settled on a line of attack that Harris had four years to fix the country's woes, mocking her argument about what she'd do on Day One, arguing that day one was in 2021.",
      "Still, Trump kept Republicans nervous by mixing in messages of grievance up until the very end of the race, veering off a script on inflation and immigration that operatives believed was more effective in winning over persuadable voters.",
      "In the end, though, Trump's playbook was just enough to win.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 07:35:03 -0500",
    "summary": "How Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election.",
    "story": [
      "We'll have to wait for fuller data, but here are 3 possible reasons.",
      "Former President Donald Trump is projected to be the next president of the United States, according to an ABC News projection issued at 5:31 a.m. Eastern on Wednesday, Nov. 6. As of 6 a.m. Eastern, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin had been projected for Trump, and the once-and-future president leads in Arizona, Michigan and Nevada as well. At this point, the most likely final outcome appears to be a 312-226 Trump victory. Plus, while it will take some time to count all the ballots, Trump looks likely to win the national popular vote for president, too.",
      "Over the next few months, we at 538 will do a lot of analysis to figure out how exactly Trump won. He may be, after all, only the second Republican presidential candidate since 1992 to win the national popular vote. That warrants not only introspection among Democrats, but a lot of quality analysis, too. And Trump's sweep of the swing states \u2014 while not surprising \u2014 also represents a new high-water mark for his electoral success.",
      "For now, though, here are three quick possible explanations for Trump's victory tonight. These insights draw primarily on the exit poll, which for various reasons is imperfect but for now remains the best source of available data on why and how different types of people voted. (We reserve the right to revisit these conclusions when more data is available.)",
      "Inflation",
      "For all the hubbub about various issues, statements, rallies and rhetoric during this election, the economy is unique as providing the most obvious gravitational pull toward Trump. Voters rank the cost of living in America as one of their top concerns \u2014 and no doubt it is one of the most pressing, salient and visible problems in their lives. It is not a stretch of the imagination to imagine they would punish the incumbent party for this regardless of how unfavorably they viewed Trump; in fact that is what voters have been doing all around the world over the past three years.",
      "According to the exit poll, 35 percent of voters nationally rated the \"state of democracy\" as the most important factor to their vote. Eighty-one percent of these people voted for Harris and just 17 percent for Trump. But the economy was the next-most-influential issue. Among these voters, Trump led 79 percent to 20 percent. In the end, abortion did not rate as highly as Democrats might have hoped; only 14 percent rated it as their biggest concern.",
      "It's possible that inflation contributed to the growing divide between high-income voters and low-income voters. According to the exit poll, Democrats increased their vote share by 9 points among voters living in households that make more than $100,000 dollars a year. Among households making less, which account for about 60 percent of voters, Republicans gained 12 points on margin.",
      "Racial polarization",
      "Initial exit poll estimates also suggest Democratic support declined among non-white voters and rose among white voters (especially college-educated ones). The exit poll indicates Trump won white voters by 12 percentage points, 55 percent to Harris's 43 percent. Compared to the 2020 exit poll, that is a 5-point improvement for Democrats.",
      "Democrats performed best relative to 2020 among white college-educated voters. They moved 7 points to the left, voting 54 percent to 44 percent for Harris. Non-white non-college-educated voters, meanwhile, moved 13 points toward Trump.",
      "The Republican's gains with nonwhites was particularly acute among Hispanic and Latino voters. Democrats' vote margin with the group fell by 26 points, according to the exit poll, to just a 53-percent-to-45-percent margin. Trump's vote share with Latinos looks like it could be the best since George W. Bush's 44 percent in 2004. Latino men moved 33 points toward Trump, one of his biggest swings.",
      "Democratic turnout was poor",
      "In addition to economic headwinds and deteriorating margins with their base, it looks like Democrats also simply had bad turnout. So far, around 137 million ballots have been counted for the 2024 presidential race. Predictions of final turnout are hovering somewhere in the neighborhood 152 million votes. That would be a decrease from the 158 million who voted in 2020 and would be equivalent to about 61 percent of eligible voters. That would be a decline from 66 percent in 2020.",
      "It is also likely that the drop in turnout disproportionately affected Democrats. While we can't be sure until we can review records of who actually voted (states will release those over the next few months), the drop-off in turnout is currently greater in the most Democratic counties across the battleground states. That is something that would uniquely hurt Harris; if you're a Democrat, then lower turnout in the suburbs is bad, of course, but not so bad as missing the mark in Philadelphia or Milwaukee, where you're relying on a lot of votes to carry you to victory.",
      "Over the next few months, we'll be able to pore over even more data about why Trump won (again). The basic explanation is that this was always going to be a hard election for Harris to win. She both failed to persuade swing voters and to get out her base where it mattered most. Democrats will have to do a lot of soul-searching to figure out how to recover.",

    "summary": "A Republican-controlled Congress and former President Donald Trump back in the White House will have long implications for the country.",
    "story": [
      "One senator said voters are giving Republicans \"an extraordinary opportunity.\"",
      "Republicans are projected to have won control of the U.S. Senate after flipping several Democratic seats, and as the battle for the White House and the House of Representatives rages on, the GOP appears to be in a position to take control of not only Congress but also the presidency -- potentially putting former President Donald Trump on a glide path for policy approvals and Cabinet appointees should he win.",
      "With Senate control flipping from Democrats to Republicans, it could help boost the agenda of a possible Trump White House -- or block the priorities of a Kamala Harris presidency. Some of those priorities could be Cabinet appointees or potential Supreme Court justice confirmations. Federal judge confirmations could be either hampered or cleared depending on control, too.",
      "All 425 House seats are up for election -- and all eyes are on the key races that could potentially determine which party has control. Republicans currently control the lower chamber, but maintain a slim majority.",
      "Should the Senate, House and White House all go for the GOP, it will be the second time Trump has enjoyed such unity. Trump began his presidency in 2017 with a GOP-controlled House and Senate. Both former presidents Barack Obama in 2009 and Bill Clinton in 1993 also began their White House stints with Democratic control in both the House and Senate.",
      "Still, in the Trump, Obama and Clinton presidencies, at least one of the chambers flipped in the next election.",
      "While it may seem rare to have single-party control of the executive and legislative branches, it's not all that uncommon at the beginning of a president's first term, according to an analysis by Pew Research Center. It has been the case for 16 of 21 presidents dating back to Theodore Roosevelt -- though a few exceptions exist: Republicans George W. and George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon, Pew Research Center found in its analysis of data going back to the 56th Congress from 1899-1901.",
      "While control of the House and the White House still up for grabs, it's the first time in four years that the Senate has had control of the upper chamber -- something Republican senators are celebrating.",
      "\"As I've said, this election is not about us but rather what is best for the conference and the nation. I look forward to working with President Trump and our new conservative majority to make America great again by making the Senate work again,\" Texas Sen. John Cornyn said in a statement.",
      "Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso said Senate Republicans are \"focused on getting this country back on track.\"",
      "\"Voters are trusting Senate Republicans with an extraordinary opportunity,\" Barrasso said in a statement. \"As a new Republican Senate majority, our focus will be to take on an agenda that reflects America's priorities \u2013 lower prices, less spending, secure borders, and American energy dominance. That is what we will set out to do on Day One. Our new Republican Senators will be instrumental in the success of this agenda.\"",

      "Republicans unseated Democrats in West Virginia and Ohio.",
      "Republicans are projected to clinch control of the Senate after flipping at least two key states and successfully protecting their incumbents.",
      "Republican Gov. Jim Justice took the seat vacated by Sen. Joe Manchin, the West Virginia independent who caucuses with Democrats. And businessman Bernie Moreno, the Ohio GOP Senate nominee, unseated three-term Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott, and Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz two lawmakers in red-leaning states who were Democrats' best pickoff opportunities, are also projected to win reelection, while Nebraska GOP Sen. Deb Fischer was projected to beat an independent challenger.",
      "With Democrats currently holding a 51-49 majority in the Senate, these wins will now at least deliver a 51-seat majority for Republicans, barring any upsets. Republicans also have a prime opportunity to unseat Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in deep-red Montana, though the results of that race have not yet been projected by ABC News.",
      "Maintaining control of the Senate was always going to be a daunting task for Democrats, who entered the 2024 election cycle with a brutal map.",
      "Democrats were defending seats in Montana and Ohio, two red states, as well as a slate of purple states, including Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The GOP-held seats in Florida and Texas were their best flip opportunities, though Democratic nominees there faced headwinds due to the lean of the states and former President Donald Trump's strength there.",
      "It remains to be seen precisely how big Republicans' margin will be -- none of the purple state races have yet been called. But Republicans were feeling bullish heading into the early morning hours Wednesday.",
      "\"Look, today starts a new wave. You know, we talked about wanting a red wave. I think what we have tonight is a red, white and blue wave in this country,\" Moreno proclaimed in his victory speech.",
      "While widely expected in Washington, Republicans' success marks a vindication of the GOP's strategy heading into the 2024 election cycle.",
      "Still smarting from a disappointing 2022 midterm cycle that saw Democrats defy the odds and expand their Senate majority by one seat, Republicans this time around were heavily involved in several Senate primaries, trying to elevate candidates they viewed as the most electable (they did not, notably, play in Ohio).",
      "On the other hand, the results are a severe disappointment for Democrats, who had appeared optimistic in the race's home stretch.",
      "Texas was online, they had insisted, and Florida remained attainable, if a reach. And independent Dan Osborn in Nebraska was giving Fischer a run for her money.",
      "Cruz and Scott ultimately coasted, and while Osborn did end up running a competitive race, he couldn't withstand the national headwinds in a state where Trump romped.",
      "The wins mark a return to power for a GOP that was locked out of Senate control for four years.",
      "Republicans lost the majority in early 2021 as a result of two painful Georgia Senate runoffs, losses that Republicans in Washington largely blamed Trump for after his repeated claims of election fraud in the state that caused distrust of the election system among Republicans in the state. And though the party was projected to perform well in the 2022 midterms, they instead lost a seat in Pennsylvania, taking Democrats' majority from 50-50 to 51-49.",
      "Republicans will seize the chamber at a time when longtime GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is stepping down from his role leading the conference (he'll still serve in the Senate). Republicans will take a vote next week to name a replacement, with the fight largely centered around South Dakota Sen. John Thune and Texas Sen. John Cornyn. Scott is also running, though he is viewed as a longshot.",
      "Should Trump win another term in the Oval Office, a Republican Senate will be key to approving judicial and administration nominees, though the 60-vote filibuster remains a potential obstacle in passing legislation, possibly forcing cooperation with Democrats on must-pass bills like on government funding and elevating the voices of Republican moderates like Sens. Susan Collins, Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, Alaska.",
      "\"Tonight Republicans retook the Senate Majority and held every single incumbent, which is great news for the American people. A Republican majority will work to secure the border, bring down prices, and help confirm President Trump\u2019s nominees. We still have a number of competitive races we are watching across the country that remain to be called,\" said Sen. Steve Daines, Mont., the chair of Senate Republicans' campaign arm.",
      "Democrats are likely to swiftly go on offense heading into the 2026 midterms, targeting seats in Maine and North Carolina, though they'll also have to play defense in Georgia and Michigan.",

      "Nationally, the share of people saying they've gotten worse off under the current administration (45%) is the highest in presidential exit polls that have asked the question -- even surpassing the 42% \"worse off\" in 2008, in the teeth of the Great Recession.",
      "The state of democracy narrowly prevailed as the most important issue to voters out of five tested in the exit poll.",
      "Preliminary results may change as exit polls are updated throughout election night and beyond.",
      "Voters broadly express more negative than positive views about the country's direction: Just 26% are enthusiastic or satisfied with the way things are going, versus 72% dissatisfied or angry.",
      "More voters see American democracy as threatened (73%) than secure (25%). Still, about 6 in 10 in these preliminary exit poll results say the country's best days are ahead of it, versus about a third who say the country's best days are in the past.",
      "Across the seven swing states, anywhere from 68% to 73% of voters think democracy in this country is threatened.",
      "Fifty-five percent call Trump's views \"too extreme,\" and he's underwater in personal favorability, 44%-55%. Fewer call Harris' views too extreme (46%), though she's also underwater in personal favorability, albeit slightly, 48%-50%.",
      "Trump, in the preliminary results, is slightly less apt in the seven swing states to be seen as \"too extreme\" than he is nationally, but still more so than Harris.",
      "Favorability isn't determinative: Just 40% saw Trump favorably in 2016, when he won the Electoral College (albeit not the popular vote). One reason is that almost as few, 43%, had a favorable view of his opponent that year, Hillary Clinton. (In 2020, Trump's favorability rating was 46%; Joe Biden's was 52%.)",
      "Underscoring the emotion associated with the contest, preliminarily 36% of voters say they'd be \"scared\" if Trump were elected, while 29% would be scared by a Harris win.",
      "In terms of personal attributes, voters in preliminary results pick having the ability to lead as tops among four that were tested in the exit poll.",
      "The economy remains a key irritant. Voters say it's in bad shape by 67%-32%. And 45% say their own financial situation is worse now than four years ago, versus 30% the same, with just 24% doing better. The \"worse off\" number exceeds its 2008 level, then 42%, and far outpaces its shares in 2020 (20%) and 2016 (28%).",
      "President Joe Biden takes the heat, with just a 41% job approval rating (58% disapprove). It's been a challenge for Harris to persuade voters she's taking a new direction from Biden's. (Biden's approval rating is the lowest for an incumbent president in exit polls since George W. Bush's 27% as he left office in 2008. Trump managed 50% job approval in 2020, yet Biden beat him anyway.)",
      "Biden is underwater in favorability in the seven swing states.",
      "In Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin, more than half of voters said they were worse off now than they were four years ago. In the other four swing states, the percentage of voters who said the same ranged from 45% to 49%.",
      "The state of democracy prevails narrowly as the most important issue to voters out of five tested in the exit polls. Thirty-five percent of voters ranked it as their top issue, followed by 31% who said the economy, 14% who said abortion, 11% who said immigration and 4% who said foreign policy.",
      "Abortion stands out in importance to women, at 19% in preliminary results, versus 8% among men, and rises to 42% among women younger than 30. (Women account for 53% of all voters, preliminarily; men, 47%.)",
      "Trump is more trusted than Harris on immigration and the economy in the preliminary exit polls while Harris leads Trump in trust on abortion.",
      "Sixty-six percent overall say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, a central focus of Harris's campaign. (Support for legal abortion hit a low in exit polls, 51%, in 2020; its previous peak was 63% in 1992.)",
      "Legal abortion wins majority backing in all seven swing states from 60% to 69%.",
      "On immigration, a central focus for Trump, 39% say most undocumented immigrants should be deported, up from 26% in 2016 and 28% in 2012. Fifty-seven percent say undocumented immigrants instead should be offered a chance to apply for legal status.",
      "Georgia",
      "President Biden's 11,779-vote victory four years ago made him the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state since 1992. Post-election, a recorded call of Trump pressuring Georgia's secretary of state to \"find\" the votes Trump needed focused the nation on Georgia's election integrity.",
      "In preliminary exit poll results, 81% of Georgia voters say they're very or somewhat confident the state's elections are being conducted fairly and accurately, more than say so nationally (68%). These views are bipartisan, ranging from 94% of Democrats to 78% of independents and 72% of Republicans.",
      "Regardless, 68% of Georgia voters overall see U.S. democracy as somewhat or very threatened.",
      "Moreover, 42% of Trump voters in these preliminary results say that if he loses Georgia's official vote count, he should challenge the results rather than accept them. Half as many supporters of Kamala Harris say she should challenge a losing result, 21%.",
      "Forty percent of Georgia voters rate the economy as the most important issue in their vote, tops among five issues tested and more than the 31% who say so nationally. That's driven in part by the 52% who say they're worse off financially than four years ago, up considerably from just 16% in 2020 and surpassing a previous high of 33% in available exit polls since 1992. About three-quarters (73%) say the national economy is in not so good or poor shape, surpassing the 67% who say so nationally.",
      "Thirty percent of Georgia voters in these preliminary results are Black, on par with the share in 2020 (29%) and the most of any swing state. Georgia voters overall divide evenly between Harris and Trump in trust to handle racial issues, 50%-48%; 32% of white voters pick Harris on this question, rising to 89% of Black voters.",
      "In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, voters are split on whether federal hurricane aid is going to the people who need it: 47% think it is, while 50% say it's not.",

      "North Carolina has voted Republican in all but two presidential elections since 1968 (2008 and 1976), including by 1.3 percentage points for Trump in 2020 (his narrowest victory that year). Biden improved on Hillary Clinton\u2019s results among college-educated white voters, moderates and men, making it a closer contest than in 2016, but Trump was bolstered by strong support from conservatives, evangelical white Christians and white voters without college degrees.",
      "Forty-seven percent in the state say they're worse off now than when Biden became president, the most in available North Carolina exit polls since 1992. Four years ago, fewer than half as many, 20%, said they'd gotten worse off under Trump.",
      "It follows that the economy is cited by 36% as the most important issue in their vote, although about as many, 32%, cite the state of democracy as their top issue. Among attributes, 32% cite \"the ability to lead\" as most important; 27% pick \"can bring needed change.\"",
      "Nearly 4 in 10 voters are conservative and 31% are white evangelical Christians, 9 points more than their share nationally, At the same time, 60% of North Carolina voters say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.",
      "Pennsylvania",
      "Pennsylvania may be this year\u2019s tipping-point state. After voting for Trump by less than 1 percentage point in 2016, the aptly nicknamed Keystone State flipped to Biden in 2020, when he edged out Trump by just over 1 point -- or roughly 80,500 votes.",
      "Trump is underwater in personal favorability in preliminary exit poll results, with 47% expressing a favorable opinion of him overall, 51% unfavorable. (Still, that\u2019s slightly better than his ratings nationally, 44%-54% favorable-unfavorable.) Trump did even worse in favorability when he won the state in 2016 -- but benefited that year from an equally unpopular opponent in Hillary Clinton. In this year\u2019s preliminary results, Kamala Harris is equally as unpopular as Trump, 46%-53%, favorable-unfavorable.",
      "Issues can matter as much or more than personal ratings -- and 33% say the state of democracy is the most important issue in their vote for president, about even with the 35% who say so nationally. Thirty percent in Pennsylvania pick the economy as their top issue, again similar to the share who say so nationally (31 percent).",
      "In a liability for Harris, 50% of voters say their family\u2019s financial situation is worse today compared with four years ago, more than 45% who say so nationally and a high in available exit polls since 1992. Just 22% say their financial situation has gotten better.",
      "More voters favor than oppose the use of fracking in Pennsylvania, 55%-36%. Harris has said she won\u2019t ban fracking if elected; she\u2019s been criticized for reversing her position on the issue since her first presidential run.",
      "Michigan",
      "Trump\u2019s narrow victory in Michigan in 2016 marked the only time a Republican presidential candidate carried the state since 1988. Biden won it back by 3 points in 2020, improving on Hillary Clinton\u2019s results among independents, voters from union households and suburban voters. All three groups may be key again this year.",
      "Again, the democracy was the top issue for most voters, according to preliminary results: 35% of Michigan voters said the state of democracy mattered in deciding their votes. Fewer, 25%, said the economy.",
      "A plurality of Michigan voters (38%) say U.S. support for Israel is about right; the rest divide between saying it's too strong (29%) or not strong enough (27%). Michigan has the country\u2019s highest proportion of Arab Americans, a small but potentially important group from which Harris and Trump have vied for support.",
      "Arizona",
      "Arizona has voted for the Democratic candidate for president just twice since 1952: in 1996 and in 2020, when Biden won the state by 10,457 votes, his narrowest victory. One initiative is on the ballot that may draw voters especially concerned about abortion, as is another that may attract those favoring a crackdown on undocumented immigrants.",
      "Fifty-one percent of Arizona voters say they've gotten worse off financially under the Biden administration, more than the 45% who say so nationally and up dramatically from 15% in Arizona in 2020.",
      "Sixty-seven percent of Arizona voters in preliminary exit poll results say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, up from 53% in 2020 (and a slight increase from 62% in 2022). On the ballot this year is Proposition 139, which would add the right to an abortion to the Arizona state constitution.",
      "Fifty-five percent say most undocumented immigrants in the U.S. should be offered a chance to apply for legal status, while 41% say they should be deported to the countries they came from. This is similar to a 57%-39% result nationally. (This year\u2019s proposition would give state and local law enforcement the right to question, arrest, detain and prosecute anyone suspected of having crossed the border outside a legal port of entry.)",
      "Wisconsin",
      "Thirty-five percent of Wisconsin voters in preliminary exit poll results say the economy mattered most in their choice for president, slightly more than 31% nationally. Fifty-two percent say their family\u2019s financial situation has worsened in the past four years, surpassing the previous high of 35% in 2012 and more than 45% who say so nationally. Just 21% say their financial situation has improved.",
      "The state of the democracy virtually matches the economy as the top issue, with 33% saying it mattered most in their vote for president. A broad 72% of Wisconsin voters say democracy in the U.S. is threatened. At the same time, 80% are confident that elections in their state are being conducted fairly and accurately -- more than say so nationally, 68%.",
      "With the legality of abortion under dispute in the state, 17% of voters say abortion was the most important issue in their choice for president, ranking behind the economy and democracy as most important issues. Sixty-eight percent of Wisconsin voters think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, up sharply from 54% in 2020.",

      "Men and women have long voted differently in presidential races, with the gender gap averaging 19 points in exit polls since 1996. But several pollsters told ABC News they were bracing for a \"gender chasm\" this year given the contrast of a man and a woman at the top of the ticket as well as the prominence of abortion rights as an issue after the fall of Roe v.

      "Trump has a 12-point advantage with men in Georgia, preliminary results show: 55% to Harris\u2019 43%. That is the same gap he had there in the 2020 election against Biden.",

      "UPS workers that are members of the Teamsters union approved a tentative contract with the package delivery company last year. The run-up to the approval was acrimonious, with labor negotiations that threatened to disrupt package deliveries for millions of businesses and households nationwide.",
      "After negotiations broke down in early July 2023, Atlanta-based UPS reached a contract agreement with the Teamsters just days before an Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "At the time the agreement was struck, full- and part-time union workers were set to get $2.75 more per hour in 2023, and $7.50 more in total by the end of the five-year contract. Starting hourly pay for part-time employees also got bumped up to $21, but some workers said that fell short of their expectations.",
      "UPS said at the time that by the end of the new contract, the average UPS full-time driver would make about $170,000 annually in pay and benefits. It was not clear how much of that figure benefits accounted for.",
      "As part of the deal, the delivery company also agreed to make Martin Luther King Jr. Day a full holiday, end forced overtime on drivers\u2019 days off and stop using driver-facing cameras in cabs, among a host of other issues. It eliminated a two-tier wage system for drivers and agreements on safety issues were also reached, including equipping more trucks with air conditioning.",
      "In September video game performers reached agreements with 80 individual games that have signed interim or tiered budget agreements with the performers\u2019 union and accepted the artificial intelligence provisions they have been seeking.",
      "The performers had been striking for over a month.",
      "Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists began striking in July after negotiations with game industry giants that began more than a year and a half ago came to a halt over AI protections.",
      "The interim agreement secures wage improvements, protections around \u201cexploitative uses\u201d of artificial intelligence and safety precautions that account for the strain of physical performances, as well as vocal stress. The tiered budget agreement aims to make working with union talent more feasible for independent game developers or smaller-budget projects while also providing performers the protections under the interim agreement.",
      "Thousands of hospitality union workers on the Las Vegas Strip reached a tentative deal with the Venetian and Palazzo resorts in August, a first for employees at the sprawling Italian-inspired complex that opened 25 years ago.",
      "The Culinary Workers Union announced on the social platform X that the deal came together after a year of negotiations. It covers over 4,000 hotel and casino workers, from housekeepers and cocktail servers to bartenders and porters.",
      "Bethany Khan, a union spokesperson, said the deal mirrors the major wins secured in recent contracts awarded to 40,000 hospitality workers at 18 Strip properties owned or operated by casino giants MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts.",
      "Those wins included a 32% pay increase over five years, housekeeping workload reductions and improved job security amid advancements in technology and artificial intelligence.",
      "The bump in pay under those contracts will amount to an average $35 hourly wage by the end of the contracts, according to the union. Workers at these properties were making about $26 hourly with benefits before winning their latest contracts in November.",
      "Unions representing 85,000 health care workers reached a tentative agreement with industry giant Kaiser Permanente in October 2023 following a strike over wages and staffing levels.",
      "The deal included setting minimum hourly wages at $25 in California, where most of Kaiser\u2019s facilities are located, and $23 in other states. Workers would also see a 21% wage increase over four years.",
      "The lead up to the tentative agreement included a three-day strike involving 75,000 workers in multiple states.",
      "The tentative agreement also included protective terms around subcontracting and outsourcing, as well as initiatives to invest in the current workforce and address a staffing crisis.",
      "Hollywood\u2019s actors voted to ratify a deal with studios in December 2023 that ended their strike after nearly four months, bringing an official finish to a labor strife that shook the entertainment industry for most of last year.",
      "Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists approved a three-year contract.",
      "Control over the use of artificial intelligence was the most hard-fought issue in the long, methodical negotiations. The contract called for a 7% general pay increase with further hikes coming in the second and third years of the deal.",
      "The agreement also included a hard-won provision that temporarily derailed talks: the creation of a fund to pay performers for future viewings of their work on streaming services, in addition to traditional residuals paid for the showing of movies or series.",
      "Some 45,000 dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports returned to work in October after their union reached a deal to suspend a strike that could have eventually caused shortages and higher prices if it had dragged on.",
      "A walkout would have shut down as many as 36 ports that handle almost half of the nation\u2019s cargo from ships entering and exiting the nation. Any such strike would eventually have led to shortages that would have hurt the U.S. economy if the walkout by the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association went on for more than a month.",
      "The dispute is not over, however. Longshoremen suspended its strike after three days, but that lasts only until Jan. 15, providing more time to negotiate a new contract. The union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and shipping companies, said in a joint statement that they have reached a tentative agreement on wages.",
      "Talks now turn to the automation of ports, which the unions says will lead to fewer jobs, and other sticking points."

      "WASHINGTON -- A divided America weighed a stark choice for the nation\u2019s future Tuesday as a presidential campaign marked by upheaval and rancor approached its finale.",
      "Voters were deciding whether to send Republican Donald Trump back to the White House or elevate Vice President Kamala Harris to the Oval Office. With just hours until polls closed, tens of millions of Americans added their ballots to the 84 million cast early as they chose between two candidates with drastically different temperaments and visions for the country.",
      "Those casting Election Day ballots mostly encountered a smooth process, with isolated reports of hiccups that regularly happen, including long lines, technical issues and ballot printing errors.",
      "Harris stands to be the first female president if elected and has promised to work across the aisle to tackle economic worries and other issues without radically departing from the course set by President Joe Biden. Trump has vowed to replace thousands of federal workers with loyalists, impose sweeping tariffs on allies and foes alike, and stage the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "Harris and Trump entered Election Day focused on seven swing states, five of them carried by Trump in 2016 before they flipped to Biden in 2020: the \u201cblue wall\u201d of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin as well as Arizona and Georgia. Nevada and North Carolina, which Democrats and Republicans respectively carried in the last two elections, also were closely contested.",
      "Trump voted in Palm Beach, Florida, near his Mar-a-Lago club, and said afterward that he was feeling \u201cvery confident.\u201d",
      "Harris, the Democratic vice president, did phone interviews with radio stations in the battleground states, then visited Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington carrying a box of Doritos \u2014 her go-to snack.",
      "\u201cThis truly represents the best of who we are,\u201d Harris told a room of cheering staffers. She was handed a cellphone by supporters doing phone banking, and when asked by reporters how she was feeling, the vice president held up a phone and responded, \u201cGotta talk to voters.\u201d",
      "The closeness of the race and the number of states in play raised the likelihood that, once again, a victor might not be known on election night.",
      "Trump said Tuesday that he had no plans to tell his supporters not to refrain from violence if Harris wins, because they \u201care not violent people.\u201d Asked about accepting the race\u2019s results, he said, \u201cIf it\u2019s a fair election, I\u2019d be the first one to acknowledge it.\u201d He visited a nearby campaign office to thank staffers before a party at a nearby convention center.",
      "After her DNC stop, Harris planned to attend a party at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington.",
      "Federal, state and local officials have expressed confidence in the integrity of the nation\u2019s election systems. They nonetheless were braced to contend with what they say is an unprecedented level of foreign disinformation \u2014 particularly from Russia and Iran \u2014 as well as the possibility of physical violence or cyberattacks.",
      "Both sides have armies of lawyers in anticipation of legal challenges on and after Election Day. And law enforcement agencies nationwide are on high alert for potential violence.",
      "Harris, 60, would be the first woman, Black woman and person of South Asian descent to serve as president. She also would be the first sitting vice president to win the White House in 36 years.",
      "A victory would cap a whirlwind campaign unlike any other in American history. Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket less than four months ago after Biden, facing massive pressure from his party after a disastrous debate performance, ended his reelection bid.",
      "In Scranton, Pennsylvania, Liza Fortt arrived at her polling location in a wheelchair and not feeling well. But she said she ventured out anyway to vote for Harris.",
      "\u201cIt means a lot to me and my grandkids, my granddaughters, my nieces. ... I was just waiting for this day to come,\u201d said Fortt, who is 74 and Black. She said she never thought she\u2019d have such an opportunity, to cast a ballot for a Black woman in a presidential race.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud, to see a woman, not only a woman, but a Black woman,\u201d Fortt said.",
      "Trump, 78, would be the oldest president ever elected. He would also be the first defeated president in 132 years to win another term in the White House, and the first person convicted of a felony to take over the Oval Office.",
      "He survived one assassination attempt by millimeters at a July rally. Secret Service agents foiled a second attempt in September.",
      "A Trump victory would affirm that enough voters put aside warnings from many of Trump's former aides or instead prioritized concerns about Biden and Harris' stewardship of the economy or the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "It would all but ensure he avoids going to prison after being found guilty of his role in hiding hush-money payments to an adult film actress during his first run for president in 2016. His sentencing in that case could occur later this month. And upon taking office, Trump could end the federal investigation into his effort to overturn the 2020 election results.",
      "First-time voter Jasmine Perez, 26, cast her ballot at the Las Vegas Raiders\u2019 stadium in Nevada for Trump, citing his spiritual values.",
      "\u201cWhat really attracted me to Donald Trump is I\u2019m a Christian,\u201d Perez said, noting of the former president, \u201cI like that he openly promotes Christianity in America.\u201d",
      "Harris, pointing to the warnings of Trump's former aides, has labeled him a \u201cfascist\u201d and blamed Trump for putting women's lives in danger by nominating three of the justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. In the closing hours of the campaign, she tried to strike a more positive tone and went all of Monday without saying her Republican opponent's name.",
      "JD Jorgensen, an independent voter in Black Mountain, North Carolina, which was hit hard by Hurricane Helene, said voters should have made up their minds by now.",
      "\u201cI think that the candidates, both being in the public eye as long as they both have been, if you\u2019re on the fence, you hadn\u2019t really been paying attention,\u201d said Jorgensen, 35.",

      "Marcus died Monday in Boca Raton, Florida, surrounded by family, according to a Home Depot spokesperson.",
      "Marcus was Home Depot's CEO as it grew rapidly during its first two decades, and was chairman of the board until his retirement in 2002. Home Depot is now the world\u2019s largest home improvement chain. In recent years, he became an outspoken supporter of former President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cWe owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude to Bernie,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cHe was a master merchant and a retail visionary. But even more importantly, he valued our associates, customers and communities above all. He\u2019s left us with an invaluable legacy and the backbone of our company: our values and culture. \u201d",
      "The son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Marcus was born in 1929 and grew up in a tenement in Newark, New Jersey, according to a biography on the company's website. Marcus had aspirations of becoming a doctor, but his family couldn't afford medical school and he endeavored to become a pharmacist, receiving a degree from Rutgers University. Marcus used to say he'd skip classes to sell Amana freezers door-to-door, according to Home Depot.",
      "After college, Marcus worked at the manufacturing conglomerate O\u2019Dell\u2019s and the retail chain Vornado, quickly ascending the corporate ladder. By 1972, Marcus was chairman and president of Handy Dan Improvement Centers, part of the Daylin conglomerate. It was there that Marcus formed a lifelong friendship with Arthur Blank.",
      "The big moment in his career arrived after he was fired by Handy Dan in 1978, along with Blank. Marcus had dreamt of a one-stop shop for do-it-yourselfers. At age 49, Marcus, along with Blank, founded Home Depot. Investment banker Ken Langone helped to secure financing to get The Home Depot started, according to the company.",
      "The first Home Depot opened in Atlanta the following year and by 1981, the company went public and began selling stock. There are now more than 2,000 Home Depot stores and the company employs more than 500,000 people. In the past decade annual sales at Home Depot have doubled, reaching nearly $153 billion in 2023",
      "Marcus has financially supported various charities as well as Jewish and medical organizations through donations. He also built the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, one of the largest in the world. The company said that his philanthropic work will continue through The Marcus Foundation, with a focus on Jewish causes, children, medical research, free enterprise and the community.",
      "Marcus was a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump, donating nearly $5 million to the Republican Party between 2016 and 2020, according to OpenSecrets, an organization that tracks political spending. Last year, Marcus penned an op-ed for Real Clear Politics, a clearinghouse of elections data and analysis, that spelled out the reasons he was endorsing Trump for a second term."

      "BOSTON -- A jury on Tuesday found an Alabama man not guilty of killing an 11-year New Hampshire girl more than 35 years ago.",
      "The case came down to whether the jury believed DNA found under Melissa Ann Tremblay\u2019s fingernails was from Marvin \u201cSkip\u201d McClendon Jr. After telling a judge Monday they were deadlocked, the jury returned Tuesday and found McClendon not guilty on the sixth day of deliberations.",
      "\u201cMr. McClendon was greatly relieved by the verdict,\u201d McClendon\u2019s lawyer, Henry Fasoldt, told The Associated Press, adding that he would return home to Alabama after being held for two-and-a-half years. \"We appreciate the jury\u2019s careful and thoughtful deliberations.\"",
      "Essex County District Attorney Paul F. Tucker said he \u201cdisappointed with the verdict\u201d but praised the efforts of prosecutors and law enforcement officers in the case.",
      "\u201cI recognize the work and dedication of the jury during their long deliberations in this case,\" Tucker said. \"My thoughts are with the family of Melissa Ann Tremblay, who have suffered greatly due to the crime that took her life.\u201d",
      "Last year, a judge declared a mistrial in McClendon\u2019s prosecution after a jury deadlock. The body of the Salem, New Hampshire, girl was found in a Lawrence, Massachusetts, trainyard on Sept. 12, 1988, a day after she was reported missing.",
      "The victim had accompanied her mother and her mother\u2019s boyfriend to a Lawrence social club not far from the railyard and went outside to play while the adults stayed inside, authorities said last year. She was reported missing later that night.",
      "The girl\u2019s mother, Janet Tremblay, died in 2015 at age 70, according to her obituary. But surviving relatives have been attending court to observe the latest trial.",
      "After initially ruling out several suspects, including two drug addicts, early on, authorities turned their attention to McClendon.",
      "He was arrested at his Alabama home in 2022 based in part on DNA evidence.",
      "Essex County Assistant District Attorney Jessica Strasnick told the jury that comments McClendon made during his arrest showed he knew details of the crime and that he was \u201cfixated on the fact that she was beaten, ladies and gentlemen, because he knew that she wasn\u2019t just stabbed that day, that was she was beaten.\u201d",
      "A left-handed person like McClendon stabbed Tremblay, Strasnick said. She told jurors that the carpenter and former Massachusetts corrections officer was familiar with Lawrence, having frequented bars and strip clubs in the city. He also lived less than 20 miles (32 kilometers) away at the time of the killing.",
      "Strasnick told the jury that the DNA evidence taken from under Tremblay\u2019s fingernails excludes 99.8% of the male population.",
      "But Fasoldt said there was no proof the DNA came from under Tremblay\u2019s fingernails or was from McClendon.",
      "Fasoldt also said evidence shows that a right-handed person, rather than a left-handed person, could have stabbed Tremblay.",
      "He also argued that McClendon had \u201cno meaningful connection\u201d to Lawrence \u2014 other than that he lived 16 miles (25 kilometers) away in Chelmsford. He moved to Alabama in 2002 to a plot of land his family owned."

      "U.S. stocks rallied as voters headed to the polls on the last day of the presidential election and as more data piled up to show the economy remains solid",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks rallied Tuesday as voters headed to the polls on the last day of the presidential election and as more data piled up showing the economy remains solid.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 1.2% to pull closer to its record set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 427 points, or 1%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.4%.",
      "The market got a lift from a report showing growth accelerated last month for retailers, transportation companies and other businesses in the U.S. services industries. That was despite economists\u2019 expectations for a slowdown, and the Institute for Supply Management  said it was the strongest growth in more than two years.",
      "The report offered more hope that the U.S. economy will remain solid  and avoid a long-feared recession  following the worst inflation in generations.",
      "Excitement about the artificial-intelligence boom also helped lift the stock market, as it has for much of the last year. Software company Palantir Technologies jumped 23.5% after delivering bigger profit and revenue than analysts expected for the latest quarter. It\u2019s an industry known for thinking and talking big, and CEO Alexander Karp said, \u201cWe absolutely eviscerated this quarter, driven by unrelenting AI demand that won\u2019t slow down.\u201d",
      "It helped offset a 5.2% drop for NXP Semiconductors. The Dutch company fell to one of the largest losses in the S&P 500 after warning that weakness it saw in the industrial and other markets during the latest quarter is spreading to Europe and the Americas.",
      "All told, the S&P 500 rose 70.07 points to 5,782.76. The Dow gained 427.28 to 42,221.88, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 259.19 to 18,439.17.",
      "The market\u2019s main event Tuesday was the election, even if the result may not be known for days or weeks as officials count all the votes. Such uncertainty could upset markets, along with an upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve on interest rates later this week. The widespread expectation is for it to cut its main interest rate for a second straight time.",
      "Despite all the uncertainty heading into the final day of voting, many professional investors suggest keeping the focus on the long term. The broad U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins  the White House, even if each party\u2019s policies can help and hurt different industries\u2019 profits.",
      "Since 1945, the S&P 500 has risen in 73% of the years where a Democrat was president and 70% of the years when a Republican was the nation\u2019s chief executive, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.",
      "The U.S. stock market has risen more in magnitude when Democrats have been president, in part because a loss under George W. Bush\u2019s term hurt the Republicans\u2019 average. Bush took over as the dot-com bubble was deflating and exited office when the 2008 global financial crisis and Great Recession were devastating markets.",
      "Besides who will be president, other questions hanging over the market include whether the White House will be working with a unified Congress or one split by political parties, as well as whether the results will be contested.",
      "The general hope among investors is often for split control of the U.S. government because that\u2019s more likely to keep the status quo and avoid big changes that could drive the nation\u2019s debt much, much higher.",
      "As for a contested election, Wall Street has some precedent to look back to. In 2000, the S&P 500 dropped 5% in about five weeks after Election Day before Al Gore conceded to George W. Bush. That, though, also happened during the near-halving of the S&P 500 from March 2000 to October 2002 as the dot-com bubble deflated.",
      "Four years ago, the S&P 500 rose the day after polls closed, even though a winner wasn\u2019t yet clear. And it kept going higher after former President Donald Trump refused to concede  and challenged the results, which created plenty of uncertainty. A large part of that rally was due to excitement about the potential for a vaccine for COVID-19, which had just shut down the global economy.",
      "The S&P 500 ended up rising 69.6% from Election Day 2020 through Monday, following President Joe Biden\u2019s win. It rallied to records as the U.S. economy bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic and managed to avoid a recession despite a jump in inflation.",
      "In the four years before that, the S&P 500 rose 57.5% from Election Day 2016 through Election Day 2020, in part because of cuts to tax rates signed by Trump.",
      "Investors have already made moves in anticipation of a win by either Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris. But Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, suggests not getting caught up in such pre-election moves, or even those immediately after the polls close, \u201cwhich we believe will face inevitable tempering, if not outright reversals, either before or after Inauguration Day.\u201d",
      "In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury initially rallied following Tuesday morning\u2019s strong report on U.S services businesses but pared the gain later in the day. It slipped to 4.28% from 4.29% late Monday.",
      "In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe and Asia. The moves were mostly modest outside of jumps of 2.3% in Shanghai and 2.1% in Hong Kong.",

      "One of the most competitive U.S. House races in the country is playing out in Oregon, where the state\u2019s GOP-held 5th Congressional District is considered one of just over two dozen toss ups nationwide",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- One of the most competitive U.S. House races in the country is playing out in Oregon, where the state\u2019s GOP-held 5th Congressional District is among just over two dozen seats nationwide that are considered toss ups.",
      "Two other House races in the state\u2019s 4th and 6th districts, though less competitive, will also be closely watched as Democrats and Republicans battle for control of Congress. And in each contest, freshman female lawmakers are seeking reelection.",
      "Here are the tightest House races in the state:",
      "Republicans are looking to maintain a seat they flipped red during the 2022 midterms for the first time in roughly 25 years. But freshman U.S. Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer is facing a different Democratic opponent this November: Janelle Bynum, a state representative who has previously beat her in legislative elections in the district and is backed and funded by national Democrats.",
      "The seat is seen as a toss up by the Cook Political Report, meaning either party has a good chance of winning. Outside groups have poured millions of dollars into the race.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer narrowly won her seat in 2022 in the first election held in the district after its boundaries were significantly redrawn following the 2020 census. It now encompasses disparate regions spanning metro Portland and its wealthy and working-class suburbs, as well as rural agricultural and mountain communities and the fast-growing central Oregon city of Bend on the other side of the Cascade Range.",
      "Unaffiliated voters represent the largest constituency, although registered Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by about 25,000. Both parties are hoping that the higher voter turnout typically seen during presidential election years, compared to midterm elections, will energize their base.",
      "A small part of the district is in Multnomah County, where a ballot box just outside the county elections office in Portland was set on fire by an incendiary device about a week before the election, damaging three ballots. Authorities said that enough material from the incendiary device was recovered to show that the Portland fire was also connected to two other ballot drop box fires in neighboring Vancouver, Washington, one of which occurred on the same day and damaged hundreds of ballots.",
      "Oregon\u2019s newest congressional district, the 6th, is seen as a likely win for Democrats compared to the 5th, according to the Cook Political Report. This gives a slight advantage to incumbent U.S. Rep. Andrea Salinas, a Democrat who is running once again against Mike Erickson, a Republican she defeated in the 2022 midterms by roughly 2.5 percentage points.",
      "Salinas has far outraised Erickson, with over $5 million in campaign contributions compared to his roughly $545,000, the most recent federal campaign finance records show.",
      "Salinas and Chavez-DeRemer became the first Latina members of Congress to represent Oregon when they were elected in the 2022 midterms.",
      "Erickson is the founder and CEO of a shipping and logistics consulting company. It's his fourth time running for Congress.",
      "The boundaries of the 6th District were created during redistricting after the 2020 census. The district includes the state capital Salem and parts of Portland\u2019s affluent southwestern suburbs. And while it also spans rural areas across a broad swath of the Willamette Valley, President Joe Biden would have carried it by about 13 points in 2020.",
      "Democratic freshman U.S. Rep. Val Hoyle is seeking reelection in the 4th District, which spans the southern half of the state\u2019s coast and includes rural, mountainous communities and the more populous, liberal college towns of Eugene and Corvallis.",
      "She\u2019s running against Republican Monique DeSpain, who served in the U.S. Air Force for three decades, largely as a military lawyer, according to her website. DeSpain has never held elected office and has pitched herself as an \u201coutsider\u201d candidate.",
      "The district, which hasn\u2019t elected a Republican to the House since 1972, is seen as a likely win for Democrats, according to the Cook Political Report.",
      "Hoyle had outraised DeSpain by about $1.6 million as of mid-October, but Republican-affiliated groups still spent heavily in their bid to flip the seat, federal campaign finance records show. The fundraising arm of U.S. House Republicans, the National Republican Congressional Committee, spent some $375,000 on ads opposing Hoyle."

      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- New Yorkers could play an outsized role Tuesday in determining control of the U.S. House as Republicans cling to suburban seats they won two years ago by seizing on fears of crime, and Democrats try to claw them back by warning that a right-wing Congress might ban abortion.",
      "If everything goes their way, Democrats hope to pick off a handful of Republican incumbents in congressional races on Long Island and in the Hudson River Valley, as well as a central New York district that state leaders recently reconfigured to make more favorable to Democrats.",
      "But the GOP could wind up holding all of that ground and has a chance of unseating one or two incumbent Democrats.",
      "Most of the tightest contests are happening in places where voters favored President Joe Biden over former President Donald Trump in 2020, but then sent a crop of Republicans to Congress two years later.",
      "The slew of competitive races underscore the hidden political complexity of New York, which is associated with Democrats like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez but has also given rise to Republican stars like U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, the chair of the House Republican Conference. All three were heavily favored to win reelection Tuesday.",
      "On Long Island, Republican U.S. Rep. Anthony D\u2019Esposito is in a tough rematch with Democrat Laura Gillen, a former town supervisor he defeated in 2022, but who might do better with Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket.",
      "In central New York, Republican Rep. Brandon Williams is trying to hold off a challenge from Democratic state Sen. John Mannion. Williams won his seat two years ago by a margin of only around 2,600 votes and this year his district was redrawn to exclude some rural areas where he had garnered support.",
      "In a trio of districts that include parts of the Hudson Valley, three incumbents \u2014 two freshman Republicans and a Democrat \u2014 are trying to hold on to seats they won by thin margins in the last election.",
      "On both sides, the strategy has been to play to moderate suburban voters while casting opponents as extremists.",
      "In 2022, Republicans in New York City's suburbs thrived with campaigns that portrayed the nearby city as having become lawless during the pandemic.",
      "Crime rates have dropped significantly since then, but Republicans have continued to press crime as an issue while also trying to capitalize on suburban unease about immigration policy and an influx of international migrants.",
      "Democrats have moved to mount a stronger defense to voters\u2019 concerns about crime and immigration. They have also hammered Republicans on abortion \u2014 a tactic that didn't produce anticipated wins for the party two years ago in a state where abortion rights are not generally seen as under threat.",
      "Republican gains on Long Island were eroded last year when former U.S. Rep. George Santos was expelled from Congress after he was revealed to have fabricated his life story and defrauded campaign donors.",
      "Santos was replaced in a special election by Democratic U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi, who is now running for reelection against Republican Mike LiPetri, a former state lawmaker.",
      "Further out on Long Island, Democrats have turned to former CNN anchor and author John Avlon in an effort to deny Republican U.S. Rep. Nick LaLota a second term.",
      "Three close contests are in districts that include parts of the Hudson Valley.",
      "In the suburbs north of New York City, Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler faces former U.S. Rep. Mondaire Jones, a Democrat who previously represented part of the district before its boundaries were redrawn for the 2022 election.",
      "Jones, one of the first two openly gay Black men to serve in the House, portrayed Lawler as someone who \u201cmasquerades as a moderate on television but votes just like an extreme MAGA Republican.\u201d",
      "Lawler says Jones is the one masquerading as a centrist, when he is actually liberal.",
      "\u201cPeople want reasonableness,\u201d Lawler said in an interview before the election. \u201cThey want folks who are willing to work across the aisle to get things done.\u201d",
      "The race got extra attention in early October when The New York Times obtained a photo showing Lawler wearing blackface in 2006 at a college Halloween party where he dressed as Michael Jackson. Lawler said the outfit was intended to be an homage to a childhood idol.",
      "Elsewhere in the Hudson Valley, Democratic U.S. Rep. Pat Ryan is locked in a tight race with Republican Alison Esposito, who has served in the New York Police Department and is running on a law-and-order platform. Esposito, if victorious, would be the first openly gay Republican woman to serve in Congress.",
      "Further north, Republican U.S. Rep. Marc Molinaro is trying to hold off Democrat Josh Riley in a district that sprawls from New York\u2019s border with Massachusetts across the Catskill Mountains and all the way to the Finger Lakes.",
      "The election is a rematch of 2022, when Molinaro narrowly defeated Riley. Molinaro has perhaps tacked harder to the right than his Republican colleagues in the state, most notably when he recently shared a social media post falsely claiming that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating house pets.",
      "In the one New York congressional race not involving an incumbent, Democrat George Latimer is heavily favored in a race against Republican Dr. Miriam Levitt Flisser. Latimer defeated U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman in a Democratic primary in June, the first member of the progressive band of liberals known as the \u201cSquad\u201d to lose a reelection bid."

    "summary": "An amendment to New York&rsquo;s constitution could bar discrimination based on things including &ldquo;gender identity&rdquo; and &ldquo;pregnancy outcomes.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution could bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes.\u201d",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution that would bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes\" is up for a final vote Tuesday amid debate over how much it might affect future abortion and transgender rights.",
      "Supporters and opponents disagree sharply about the potential legal impact of the Equal Rights Amendment, also known as Proposition 1.",
      "New York\u2019s constitution currently forbids discrimination based on race, creed or religion. The amendment would add language that says someone cannot be denied civil rights because of their national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes or \u201creproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d",
      "Democratic leaders put the amendment on the ballot partly in hopes of boosting turnout by voters passionate about protecting abortion access, in an election year where U.S. House races in New York could help decide which party controls Congress.",
      "Several other states also have abortion-related constitutional amendments on their ballots Tuesday. Most of those ballot questions address head-on when it should be legal to end a pregnancy. But in New York, state lawmakers took the indirect approach of writing the amendment as an antidiscrimination measure.",
      "Democrats who support the amendment have argued that the new language would create a legal framework where any restrictions on abortion would amount to an unconstitutional form of discrimination in medical care. The New York City Bar Association has agreed with that assessment, as have some other legal experts.",
      "Still, the fact that the amendment itself does not use the word abortion has caused headaches for its supporters. It also opened the door for opponents to claim its other language would lead to a raft of unintended consequences.",
      "Republicans have run a strong messaging campaign against the amendment, choosing not to focus on what protections it might provide for abortion, but to target other parts of the proposal. Their main attack line has been to argue the amendment would provide a constitutional right for transgender athletes to play on girls\u2019 sports teams.",
      "They\u2019ve also argued that its language on national origin could result in noncitizens being allowed to vote, that its ban on age discrimination might take away price discounts for senior citizens, and that it could also wind up stopping parents from having a say in their child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Previous state court decisions have found that existing language in the state constitution bars noncitizens from voting. And the New York City Bar Association says the amendment would not block existing state laws requiring parental consent for a child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Legal battles are already underway in New York over whether existing state and federal laws give transgender people the right to play on sports teams that match the gender identity.",
      "Democrats in the state legislature voted to put the amendment on the 2024 ballot after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters elsewhere have shown support for abortion access in previous elections. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll recently found that 7 in 10 Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.",
      "Uncertainty over the New York amendment\u2019s impact on abortion was pronounced enough, however, that it caused even the state Board of Elections to throw up its hands. The board is responsible for writing simple explanations of proposed amendments that voters will see on their ballots. But rather than interpret the measure or include the word abortion in its description, the board decided to reiterate the amendment\u2019s language verbatim.",
      "Supporters of the amendment objected and filed lawsuit, but the judge in the case, David A. Weinstein, eventually declined to make the board rewrite its description, in part because he could not say for certain how courts would interpret the amendment\u2019s language.",
      "Abortion is currently legal in New York up through 24 weeks from the beginning of pregnancy. After that, it is only legal if the pregnant person\u2019s life, physical health or mental health is at risk, or if a medical provider determines the fetus is not viable. Although there is no defined time frame, viability is a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus.",
      "Democrats have firm control of state government in New York, making any new abortion restrictions unlikely in the near future.",
      "Backers of the proposal argue that if the amendment passes it would create a strong layer of abortion protections in New York that would be difficult for a future legislature to repeal. That's because New York requires the legislature to pass an amendment to the constitution two times before it goes to voters for final approval."

      "Three-term incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester of Montana is facing perhaps his toughest reelection challenge yet",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- Three-term incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester of Montana faces perhaps his toughest reelection challenge yet on Tuesday, with control of the Senate on the line in a state that has veered sharply rightward since the 68-year-old grain farmer's first election.",
      "Republicans have pinned their hopes on Tim Sheehy, a former U.S. Navy SEAL and founder of an aerial firefighting company. Sheehy, 38, had early backing from party leaders including former President Donald Trump, clearing the political newcomer's path to win the June primary.",
      "It is the first time Tester is sharing the same ballot as Trump, who twice won in Montana by wide margins.",
      "Long lines were seen at Montana polling places as a winter storm brought snow to some parts of the state.",
      "A Sheehy victory would seal Republican Party dominance across the five-state Northern Plains region: Tester entered office as one of six Democratic senators in the largely rural swath of American heartland that also includes Wyoming, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. He is now the only one.",
      "The lawmaker also is the sole remaining Democrat to hold statewide office in Montana.",
      "The candidates and their allies shattered political spending records and barraged voters with almost $300 million in ads on TV, radio, their phones and in their mailboxes. Total spending is expected to reach about $500 for each active registered voter in Montana.",
      "\u201cThis is the toughest race since Tester got in,\u201d said political analyst Jeremy Johnson, \u201cand Tim Sheehy is a real formidable candidate.\u201d",
      "In the race\u2019s final days, Tester\u2019s campaign plastered Montana newspapers and airwaves with advertisements amplifying claims from a former park ranger that Sheehy lied about a bullet wound in his arm.",
      "Sheehy said during an interview with conservative pundit Megyn Kelly that the wound came from combat in Afghanistan and wasn\u2019t accidentally self-inflicted as he told the ranger in 2015. The Republican said Tester was trying to smear him and other SEALs vouched for Sheehy\u2019s integrity, but he hasn't released any corroborating medical records.",
      "Montana's political profile has shifted dramatically since Tester's first election in 2006. It went from a \u201cpurple\u201d state that traditionally sent a mix of Democrats and Republicans to higher offices, to one where partisan divisions rule and the GOP enjoys a supermajority in the state Legislature.",
      "Tester warned throughout the campaign about \u201coutsiders\u201d such as Sheehy \u2014 who came to Montana in 2014 and bought a ranch \u2014 driving up housing prices and restricting hunting and fishing access for the general public.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of folks come into our state, rich folk, who want to try to buy our state, to try to change it into something that it\u2019s not,\u201d Tester said.",
      "Tester, the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, has built a record as a moderate over his 18 years in office. He has delivered legislation such as expanding health care for veterans and bringing broadband to rural areas, while sometimes opposing Democratic proposals to tighten rules for the energy industry.",
      "But Tester also consistently voted with Democrats on major legislation, putting him out of step with Montana's hardening conservatism.",
      "In the small city of Columbus, Montana, John Hungerford, 71, said after casting his ballot for Sheehy that Tester hadn't done enough to address his top issues \u2014 immigration and inflation \u2014 and too often followed the Democratic party line.",
      "\u201cHis voting record is not indicative of the values in Montana,\u201d Hungerford said.",
      "Sheehy sought to dent Tester's reputation for authenticity by highlighting more than $500,000 that lobbyists and their families donated to Tester this election cycle. Republicans alleged a pattern of campaign donations flowing to the Democrat from industries that needed his vote, after the lawmaker faced scrutiny over donations from bank executives affected by a 2018 regulatory roll back and from Lockheed Martin employees who benefited from a 2021 defense bill.",
      "There was no indication of wrongdoing by Tester. But Sheehy's tactic mirrored Tester\u2019s 2006 upset of a three-term Republican incumbent who was ensnared in a lobbying scandal.",
      "Sheehy also linked Tester to the perceived failures of the Biden-Harris administration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got an economy that\u2019s on its knees. We\u2019ve got foreign policy crises all over the world that we can\u2019t even hope to begin to address right now. It\u2019s time for a change in leadership,\u201d Sheehy said.",
      "The Tester campaign's response was to remind voters of his longtime advocacy in Congress for Montana's economically vital agriculture industry.",
      "Tester also paired his campaign with efforts to pass a ballot initiative that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. It was part of an effort to court the independents and moderate Republicans whose support has kept Tester in office even as the state shifted rightward.",
      "Sandra Troy, 68, said abortion was at the top of her mind as she voted for Tester, believing the Democrat would help protect access to the procedure.",
      "\u201cThe government shouldn't be bossing into our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cTester, he votes for the people.\u201d",
      "Sheehy touted his military service and business experience, and drew parallels between his recent arrival in Montana and settlers in the early 1900s who were resented by those who arrived even earlier.",
      "Sheehy pushed past questions raised over his record as a lobbyist and derogatory comments he made to supporters about Native Americans.",
      "His campaign was buoyed over the summer by a rally with Trump in Bozeman, Montana. The fast-growing college city could be crucial in determining which side wins.",
      "Trump \u2014 who carries a personal grudge over Tester's 2018 derailing of Trump's veteran affairs nominee \u2014 mocked Tester's physical appearance during the event."

      "Election Day voting is unfolding largely smoothly across the nation _ with only scattered reports of delays from extreme weather, ballot printing errors and technical problems",
      "WASHINGTON -- After an election season marked by concerns over disinformation, foreign influence and worrisome threats to election workers and voting systems, Election Day unfolded relatively smoothly nationwide with only scattered disruptions and delays.",
      "Leading into Tuesday, more than 82 million Americans had already cast their ballots in a largely successful early voting period with high turnout despite some hiccups and frustrations in the presidential battleground of Pennsylvania.",
      "And when the final day of voting came, the problems that cropped up were \u201clargely expected routine and planned-for events,\u201d said Cait Conley, senior adviser to the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. She said the agency was not currently tracking any national, significant incidents impacting election security.",
      "Issues affecting voters on Tuesday included typical election mishaps, from a worker forgetting a key in Arizona's largest county to an election judge failing to show up at the polls in Pennsylvania's Allegheny County. Some precincts around the country faced issues with voter check-in processes and e-pollbooks, causing some delays for voters trying to cast ballots. Some areas had ballot printing mistakes and were printing new ballots and extending voting hours accordingly. Extreme weather across the midsection of the country also caused flooding and some other isolated problems, including knocking out power for at least one Missouri polling place that resorted to a generator to keep voting up and running.",
      "Still, in various states affected by rain, voters enthusiastically huddled under umbrellas as they lined up to cast their ballots, not deterred in a presidential election that many U.S. voters view as crucially important to the future of U.S. democracy.",
      "In the western part of the key swing state of Pennsylvania, a few counties saw reports of issues with tabulator machines that scan and count paper ballots filled out by voters. A Pennsylvania state judge ordered polls to remain open for two extra hours in Cambria County, which voted 68% for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The county sought the extension after a software malfunction affected the ballot-scanning machines, though county officials said no one was turned away from the polls and all ballots would be counted. It was yet to be seen how the extension might affect vote-counting timelines in the tight battleground.",
      "In Georgia, another presidential swing state, fewer than a dozen precincts were set to stay open late because of delayed openings or evacuations due to alleged bomb threats that were found to be non-credible, according to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. That included two precincts in Cobb County, which is northwest of Atlanta. They were staying open until 7:20 p.m. because they opened late due to equipment issues.",
      "The FBI on Tuesday afternoon said it was aware of multiple non-credible bomb threats to polling locations in several states and said many of them appeared to originate from Russian email domains.",
      "The massive early voting turnout before Tuesday \u2014 slightly more than half the total number of votes in the presidential election four years earlier \u2014 was driven partly by Republican voters, who cast early ballots at a higher rate than in recent previous elections after a campaign by Trump and the Republican National Committee to counter the Democrats' longstanding advantage in the early vote.",
      "The early voting period faced minimal problems, even in western North Carolina, which was hammered last month by Hurricane Helene. State and local election officials, benefiting from changes made by the Republican-controlled legislature, pulled off a herculean effort to ensure residents could cast their ballots as they dealt with power outages, lack of water and washed out roads. That appeared to continue on Tuesday, with the North Carolina Board of Elections reporting no voting issues.",
      "Besides the hurricanes in North Carolina and Florida, the most worrisome disruptions to the election season so far were arson attacks that damaged ballots in two drop boxes near the Oregon-Washington border. Authorities there were still searching for the person responsible.",
      "The absence of any significant, widespread problems has not stopped Trump, the Republican nominee, or the RNC, which is now under his sway, from making numerous claims of fraud or election interference during the early voting period, a possible prelude to challenges after Election Day.",
      "Trump on Tuesday suggested he wouldn't challenge the results of the election \u2014 as long as it's fair.",
      "\u201cIf it's a fair elections, I'd be the first one to acknowledge\u201d the results, Trump said, though what meets that definition wasn't clear.",
      "A late effort by Republicans to challenge Atlanta-area election offices' collection of mail ballots last weekend after early voting had ended was rejected as \u201cfrivolous,\u201d with Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge R. Stan Baker saying the GOP argument \u201cdoes not withstand even the most basic level of statutory review and reading comprehension.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, has urged voters not to fall for Trump's tactic of casting doubt on elections. She was spending Tuesday afternoon turning out her own vote at a phone bank hosted by the Democratic National Committee, and said phone banking represents \u201cthe best of who we are.\u201d",
      "This is the first presidential vote since Trump lost to Joe Biden four years ago and began various attempts to circumvent the outcome and remain in power. That climaxed with the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol to halt certification of the results after Trump told his supporters to \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "Even now, a solid majority of Republicans believe Trump's lie that Biden was not legitimately elected, despite reviews, audits and recounts in the battleground states that all affirmed Biden's win.",
      "Through four years of election lies and voting-related conspiracy theories, local election officials have faced harassment and even death threats. That has prompted high turnover and led to heightened security for election offices and polling sites that includes panic buttons and bullet-proof glass.",
      "While there have been no major reports of any malicious cyberactivity affecting election offices, foreign actors have been active in using fake social media profiles and websites to drum up partisan vitriol and disinformation. In the final weeks, U.S. intelligence officials have attributed to Russia multiple fake videos alleging election fraud in presidential swing states.",
      "On the eve of Election Day, officials issued a joint statement with federal law enforcement agencies warning that Russia in particular was ramping up its influence operations, including in ways that could incite violence, and likely would continue those efforts well after the votes had been cast.",
      "Jen Easterly, the nation\u2019s top election security official, urged Americans to rely on state and local election officials for information about elections.",
      "\u201cThis is especially important as we are in an election cycle with an unprecedented amount of disinformation, including disinformation being aggressively peddled and amplified by our foreign adversaries at a greater scale than ever before,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot allow our foreign adversaries to have a vote in our democracy.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- A former Denver elections worker who says she was fired for speaking out about her safety concerns on comedian Jon Stewart's show filed a federal lawsuit Monday, alleging election officials wanted to silence her and violated her First Amendment rights.",
      "Virginia Chau, a lawyer who worked as a polling center supervisor during elections, spoke in 2022 about threats made against election workers and the lack of training for them during a panel discussion on the short-lived streaming show \u201cThe Problem with Jon Stewart.\u201d",
      "Nationally, election officials have increased security in the lead-up to Election Day both to protect their workers and to protect voting procedures and ballots. Election offices and workers have been the target of harassment and threats since the 2020 presidential election, mainly by people supporting former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies that the election was stolen from him because of fraud.",
      "According to Chau's lawsuit, the Denver elections division director R. Todd Davidson told her she was being removed as a supervisor because of her comments on the show and said she could be a hotline representative instead because no one from the public would recognize her in that job. The move would have been a demotion, the lawsuit said, and Chau refused to accept the new position.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Denver clerk and recorder Paul Lopez did not respond to Chau's request to reconsider her termination.",
      "\u201cInstead of heeding Ms. Chau\u2019s call for more resources and training for election officials facing threats to their personal safety, Defendants decided instead to retaliate against one of their best, and most passionate, election workers,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The suit was filed against the city, its elections director and clerk and recorder. It asks for Chau to be reinstated and for unspecified damages.",
      "A spokesperson for Lopez's office, Mikayla Ortega, and a representative of the city attorney's office, Melissa Sisneros, said their offices do not comment on pending litigation."

      "The former president was asked twice after casting his ballot in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday about a question that the state's voters are considering.

      "Former military defense contractor Leonard \u201cFat Leonard\u201d Francis has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for masterminding a decade-long bribery scheme that swept up dozens of U.S. Navy officers",
      "SAN DIEGO -- Former military defense contractor Leonard \u201cFat Leonard\u201d Francis was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years in prison for masterminding a decade-long bribery scheme that swept up dozens of U.S. Navy officers, federal prosecutors said.",
      "U.S. District Judge Janis L. Sammartino also ordered Francis to pay $20 million in restitution to the Navy and a $150,000 fine, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office. He was also ordered to forfeit $35 million in \u201cill-gotten proceeds from his crimes,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Prosecutors said the sentence resulted from Francis' first guilty plea in 2015 concerning bribery and fraud, his extensive cooperation with the government since then and another guilty plea Tuesday for failing to appear for his original sentencing hearing in 2022.",
      "Shortly before he was due to be sentenced in September 2022, Francis cut off a GPS monitor he was wearing while under house arrest and fled the country. He was later arrested in Venezuela and brought back to the U.S. in December 2023.",
      "Sammartino sentenced him to more than 13 1/2 years for the bribery and fraud charges, plus 16 months for failing to appear. The sentences are to be served consecutively.",
      "\u201cLeonard Francis lined his pockets with taxpayer dollars while undermining the integrity of U.S. Naval forces,\" U.S. Attorney Tara McGrath said in Tuesday\u2019s statement. \u201dThe impact of his deceit and manipulation will be long felt, but justice has been served today.\u201d",
      "Email and phone messages seeking comment were left Tuesday for William Douglas Sprague, an attorney for Francis.",
      "Sprague, who sought a sentence of just under nine years, argued that his client\u2019s cooperation should warrant a lesser sentence, 10 News San Diego reported.",
      "Sprague also said Francis' company provided the Navy with exemplary services for many years.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, as Leonard acknowledged in his early guilty plea and immediate cooperation, his greed drove him to commit bribery and to commit fraud,\u201d Sprague said.",
      "Prosecutors said Francis\u2019 actions led to one of the biggest bribery investigations in U.S. military history, which resulted in the conviction and sentencing of nearly two dozen Navy officials, defense contractors and others on various fraud and corruption charges.",
      "An enigmatic figure who was 6-foot-3 and weighed 350 pounds at one time, Francis owned and operated his family\u2019s ship servicing business, Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd. or GDMA, which supplied food, water and fuel to vessels. The Malaysian defense contractor was a key contact for U.S. Navy ships at ports across Asia for more than two decades. During that time, Francis wooed naval officers with Kobe beef, expensive cigars, concert tickets and wild sex parties at luxury hotels from Thailand to the Philippines.",
      "In exchange, officers, including the first active-duty admiral to be convicted of a federal crime, concealed the scheme in which Francis would overcharge for supplying ships or charge for fake services at ports he controlled in Southeast Asia. The officers passed him classified information and even went so far as redirecting military vessels to ports that were lucrative for his Singapore-based ship servicing company.",
      "In a federal sting, Francis was lured to San Diego on false pretenses and arrested at a hotel in September 2013. He pleaded guilty in 2015, admitting that he had offered more than $500,000 in cash bribes to Navy officials, defense contractors and others. Prosecutors say he bilked the Navy out of at least $35 million. As part of his plea deal, he cooperated with the investigation leading to the Navy convictions. He faced up to 25 years in prison.",
      "While awaiting sentencing, Francis was hospitalized and treated for renal cancer and other medical issues. After leaving the hospital, he was allowed to stay out of jail at a rental home, on house arrest with a GPS ankle monitor and security guards.",
      "But three weeks before his scheduled sentencing in September 2022, he snipped off his monitor and made a brazen escape, setting off an international search. Officials said he fled to Mexico, made his way to Cuba and eventually got to Venezuela.",
      "He was arrested more than two weeks after his disappearance \u2014 caught before he boarded a flight at the Simon Bolivar International Airport outside Caracas. Venezuelan officials said he intended to reach Russia.",
      "The cases were handled by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in an effort to be independent of the military justice system. But they have came under scrutiny.",
      "The felony convictions of four former Navy officers were vacated following allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Sammartino agreed to allow them to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and pay a $100 fine each.",
      "Last year, Sammartino ruled that the lead federal prosecutor in the officers' case committed \u201cflagrant misconduct\u201d by withholding information from defense lawyers, but that it was not enough to dismiss the case."

      "The water regulator, Ofwat, has provisionally said bills would rise by an average of \u00a319 a year - or 21% - between 2025 and 2030.",
      "But in a survey of 9,500 households carried out by the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), some 18% said they were already struggling with bills and 40% said they would struggle to afford these rises.",
      "Water companies said they were proposing an increase in support to struggling households to protect vulnerable customers.",
      "Ofwat and water firms have been locked in tense negotiations over how much they will be able to charge for the five years from April next year.",
      "In this major survey from the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), customers across 19 water company areas were presented with the proposed bill rises that were adjusted for inflation.",
      "Some 40% of the 9,500 people asked said they would find bill rises difficult to afford. Of those:",

      "\"It\u2019s quite frightening the extent to which water affordability is going to affect people in the future.\"",
      "He said a third of households under strain will cut back on essentials \"like food shopping\" in order to pay their water bill.",

      "Every water company has a scheme which can help reduce your bills if you are on a low income, but eligibility and support varies by company.",
      "The CCW is calling for a single social tariff across England and Wales to end what it calls a \"postcode lottery of assistance\".",
      "Mr Keil said current support on offer for customers in the form of social tariffs was \"completely inconsistent\".",
      "\"We are calling for the current system to be revamped and replaced with a much more fair system of social tariffs so it is consistent across England and Wales, which means that everyone who is struggling can be assured that that safety net is in place and support is there if they need it,\" he said.",
      "He says a single social tariff would be funded  centrally and distributed where the need is greatest.",
      "\"Water companies committed back in 2019, as part of a public interest commitment, to end water poverty by 2030, and this single social tariff is the best way to do that,\" he said.",

      "In July, Ofwat provisionally said bills would rise by an average of \u00a319 per year between 2025 and 2030 - totalling a \u00a394 increase, or a 21% rise, over that five year period. That increase does not include inflation.",
      "The bill hike varies by region with the regulator agreeing to a rise of 44% for Southern Water, and 11% for Northumbrian Water.",
      "Since July, some companies have asked for further increases. For example, Thames Water, the UK's largest water company, was given the go-ahead to lift bills by 23%. It has since said it needs to raise bills by 59%, in order to keep operating as normal.",
      "The BBC understands Ofwat is considering permitting bigger bill increases for some companies when it makes a final decision in December, to reflect higher financing costs.",
      "Responding to the CCW survey, Water UK, which represents the sector, said companies wanted to provide more help to customers struggling with bill rises.",
      "\u201cWe urgently need investment in our water and sewage infrastructure,\" a spokesman said.",
      "He added the survey showed there was widespread public support for investment to secure water supplies and stop sewage spills.",
      "\"However, we understand increasing bills is never welcome,\" he said.",
      "Ofwat said it would \"fully consider\" the findings from the CCW research.",
      "\"It is also clear the majority of customers accepted the investment being proposed and the increase in bills needed to fund it, but it is crucial companies deliver the meaningful improvements this investment is designed to bring\", a spokesperson said.",
      "\"Performance in the past has not been good enough. This is the challenge the companies will need to meet in the years ahead \u2013 and we will be closely monitoring progress as they do.\"",

      "The Treasury should have disclosed a \u00a39.5bn overspend in the public finances in the run-up to the previous government's Spring Budget \"under the law\", the UK's spending watchdog has said.",
      "Richard Hughes, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), told a committee of MPs on Tuesday the Treasury should explain why information was \"not provided to us\".",
      "His comments prompted the committee's chair and Labour MP Meg Hillier to suggest the Treasury \"may have broken the law\".",

      "The \u00a39.5bn overspend forms the basis of Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 claim that the Conservatives left Labour with a significant \"hole\" in the public finances.",
      "Asked by the committee on Tuesday how the shortfall could have happened, the OBR's Mr Hughes said \"the system very clearly broke down\", but insisted \"that kind of failure will not happen again\" because of processes put in place since.",
      "The OBR works closely with the Treasury. Its role is to assess the government's tax and spending plans and produce reports on whether the chancellors' plans are sound.",
      "Its judgements and forecasts are closely watched by financial markets to determine if the UK's economic plans are credible.",
      "Pushed on whether the Treasury broke the law over not disclosing an overspend, Mr Hughes said there may \"have been a misunderstanding of how the law ought to be interpreted\".",
      "\"There is no doubt in our minds that had that information been provided we would have had a materially different judgement,\" he added.",
      "He said it \"was a question for the Treasury to ask: why was information available within the Treasury and not provided to us?\"",
      "In summarising Mr Hughes' comments, Hillier said: \"The Treasury may have even broken the law in the run-up to the Spring Budget in not disclosing all the spending information.\"",
      "Shadow chancellor Hunt has previously accused the OBR of failing to act in a \"politically impartial manner\" by releasing its findings about the overspend on the day of the Budget last week, arguing it would help make the case for Labour's big tax rises.",

      "A Treasury spokesperson told the BBC: \u201cAt the time of the Spring Budget, we communicated to the OBR the decision that ministers would manage spending pressures by making offsetting savings. This was within the law.",
      "\"We have accepted all the recommendations put forward by the OBR in its review of the March 2024 forecast.",

      "The OBR has calculated that three quarters of the impact would be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "The watchdog's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "Prof Miles said the OBR estimated employers would only take around a quarter of the hit from the NI changes in terms of lower profits, and suggested that the rest would be felt by workers.",

For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",

      "Nearly 620 miles (1,000km) of new power lines need to be built to meet the government's clean energy plans, official energy planners have concluded.",
      "In a report, the body in charge of linking new projects to the grid said Labour's target to decarbonise electricity by 2030 was \"achievable\" but a \"huge challenge\".",
      "It will warn that infrastructure for the electricity network will need to be built much faster than it has been over the last decade to meet the pledge.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said ministers were committed to \"significant reforms\" of the planning system to speed up new connections.",
      "Faster grid hook-ups planned for some green energy projects",

      "The government is expected to publish its action plan for modernising the grid in the coming months.",
      "Sources within government see its report, to be published on Tuesday, as a vindication of its pledge to deliver a net zero carbon electricity system in Great Britain by 2030, a key part of Labour's election manifesto.",
      "But it also highlights the scale of the task when it comes to increasing the supply of renewable energy, and connecting it to the grid.",
      "Meeting the pledge, it finds, would require a significant boost to offshore wind capacity, alongside increased electrification of heat, transport and industry.",
      "Nearly 1,000 km (620 miles) of new power lines would be required to connect new renewable energy to the grid, along with 4,800 km of undersea cables, it said.",
      "The report points out that this would be more than double over five years what has been built in total in the last 10, requiring many projects to begin construction in the next 6 months to two years.",
      "It added that this \"challenging\" timescale will require changes to the planning system to cut down the time new projects take to get approval.",
      "The construction of hundreds of miles of new pylons is also likely to run into political opposition, with a number of schemes facing fierce local opposition.",

      "The GMB union, which represents oil and gas workers and donates to Labour, said any government plans to boost wind and solar power should come with a \"cast iron commitment to delivering quality jobs here\".",
      "Impact on bills",
      "NESO's report estimated that the 2030 clean energy plan would require an average of \u00a340bn in investment a year, most of it from the private sector, requiring a significant boost from current levels.",
      "It did not model the impact of its blueprint on consumer bills \"given the heavy dependence on policy choices\".",
      "But the report predicts wholesale energy prices are likely to fall with decreased reliance on gas, which often spikes unpredictably.",
      "The exact timing of any drop in costs depends on how quickly clean energy infrastructure can be built and related policy decisions, the report said.",
      "It argued that consumer costs were unlikely to rise, as fixed prices for renewable projects would offset reduced natural gas needs.",
      "It also said the 2030 target would depend on a four to fivefold expansion of its demand flexibility service, under which households and firms are encouraged to save money by using less electricity at busy times.",

      "The decision to increase National Insurance (NI) contributions made by companies has come under fire from many businesses, including GPs who argue it could hit services for patients.",
      "The new Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the move, telling the BBC it would not result in growth and would \"make all of us poorer\".",
      "Appearing on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the chancellor was asked whether there was any chance she would rethink the NI rise for employers.",
      "\"I'm not immune to their criticism,\" Reeves said, \"but we've got to raise the money to put our public finances on a firm footing.\"",

      "From next April, employers will have to pay NI at 15% on salaries above \u00a35,000, instead of 13.8% on salaries above \u00a39,100 currently.",

      "She criticised the rise in employers' NI contributions as being \"not coherent\" as most of the increase would be passed on through lower wages and higher prices, but she did not say whether or not she would reverse it.",
      "This goes to the core of the growing political divide in UK politics, following the first Labour budget in 15 years and Badenoch\u2019s victory.",
      "The new Conservative leader believes lower taxes will help boost economic growth, with the tax burden too high even under her own government.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re the Wall Street of the data centre industry,\u201d says Ms Bolthouse, who is a director of local Virginian charity and campaign group Piedmont Environmental Council.",
      "Data centres are vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Northern Virginia, the northern region of the state of Virginia, has been a key location for data centres since the 1990s. This is thanks to its immediate proximity to Washington DC, yet with historically cheap electricity and land prices.",
      "Centred on the city of Ashburn, which is 35 miles (56km) west of the US capital, there are more than 477 data centres in the state. This is by far the largest number in the US, with Texas in second place on 290, and California third with 283.",
      "In fact, some studies say that 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic goes through Ashburn and the surrounding area, which has been dubbed \u201cData Centre Alley\u201d.",
      "Thanks in large part to the continuing boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires more computing power, demand for data centres is rocketing. As a result, global data centre capacity is expected to double over the next five years, according to a recent study by business analysis firm Moody\u2019s.",
      "Ms Bolthouse and other environmentalists in Northern Virginia are opposed to the continuing expansion of the data centre sector in their region, saying it is already having a major negative impact on their quality of life.",
      "She points to new electricity cables being built over conservation land, parks and neighbourhoods, increased water demand, and the facilities\u2019 back-up diesel generators affecting air quality.",
      "Ms Bolthouse also cites the fact that households in Virginia and neighbouring Maryland are being expected to help pay for the electricity network upgrades that the data centres require.",
      "She and fellow campaigners are fighting back. \u201cWe\u2019re working directly on the ground, opposing each data centre application and working on the local zoning, and trying to educate our local planning commission and supervisors about the issues that we see. But we're also working at the state level.\u201d",
      "Similar campaigns against data centres are springing up all over the world, including in the Republic of Ireland, where such facilities use 21% of the country\u2019s electricity.",
      "\"Our main objections to data centres revolve around their potential negative impacts on our climate, their sustainability, and local infrastructure,\" says Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment. \"When data centres rely on fossil fuel, they potentially strain the electricity grid and can undermine national renewable energy commitments.\"",
      "The group is continuing to challenge plans for a new \u20ac1.2bn ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) data centre in County Clare on Ireland\u2019s west coast.",
      "Mr Lowes adds that while Friends of the Irish Environment would prefer to see data centre development halted altogether, there are various mitigations that might help, including sites prioritising renewable energy, and implementing energy and cooling efficiency measures.",
      "The big players in the global data centre industry are trying to allay people\u2019s concerns. This summer, for example, Microsoft launched its Data Center Community Pledge.",
      "Microsoft is promising that by next year it will procure 100% renewable energy globally. And that by 2030 it will \u201cachieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting\u201d, and become \u201cwater positive\u201d. The latter means that it aims for its data centres to return more water to the local supply than they use.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already uses recycled water for cooling in 20 of its 125 data centres around the world, and also says it will be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030.",
      "Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, which represents dozens of data centre operators including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, says that data centres are leading the way on clean energy use.",
      "\"For example, wind and solar capacity contracted to data centre providers and customers represented two-thirds of the total US corporate renewables market last year, and four of the top five purchasers of renewable energy in the US are companies that operate data centres,\" he says.",
      "\"The data centre industry is also unlocking greater energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users \u2013 everything from smart thermostats to grid-enhancing technologies require the digital infrastructure provided by data centres.\"",
      "The protests against data centres have also extended to South America, where campaigners say they have achieved successes.",
      "In Uruguay, for example, Google changed the design of a new facility now under construction. It was initially due to be water cooled, but the US giant switched to an air-cooled system.",
      "This followed protests in a country that has been experiencing droughts and a shortage of drinking water.",
      "\"Water use by Google in the initial proposal would have been equivalent to the daily consumption of drinking water by 55,000 people in our country,\" says Mar\u00eda Selva Ortiz of Friends of the Earth Uruguay.",
      "\"This threat to the right to water amidst a water crisis raised strong criticisms, leading Google to change the proposed technology to cool down its equipment, so the project was modified. Chillers will cool down with air instead of water.\u201d",
      "In Chile, meanwhile, Google has halted plans for a data centre over similar water use concerns.",
      "Back in Virginia, Ms Bolthouse says the firms need to do more to boost sustainability. In the long run, she says, it will be in the industry's own interests to improve data centres' environmental impact.",

      "The door of Juan Botero\u2019s apartment in Houston, Texas is made of wood \u2013 with a classy, walnut-like finish.",
      "But, for Halloween, he planned an eye-catching change. \u201cI\u2019m going to paint my door orange,\u201d Mr Botero, founder and chief executive of Colombia-based Glasst, told the BBC last month. And he has kept his promise.",
      "However, the move is not as drastic as it sounds. Mr Botero\u2019s firm, an \u201cinnovation company\u201d, has designed the paint to be removable \u2013 once dry, you can peel it off like plastic wrap. If it works as intended, it shouldn\u2019t leave behind any marks or residue.",
      "Mr Botero had the idea for the product, called Unpaint, about five years ago and, initially, his investors weren\u2019t keen. \u201cThey said I was crazy,\u201d he recalls. Nevertheless, he insisted: \u201cPeople are looking for customisation in their lives.\u201d",
      "Glasst is just one of many firms that claim house paint can do more than look nice. Various products now on the market, their makers promise, will save you money, keep you comfortable during heatwaves, or transform your relationship with the walls of your home. But is it all too good to be true?",
      "Unpaint is due to launch in the US this November, and Mr Botero is convinced that there is a market for the stuff. He argues it will appeal to people living in rented accommodation, who can\u2019t make permanent changes to their decor.",
      "Glasst, unsurprisingly, declines to share details about how it makes the paint, but Mr Botero says it is a resin from a renewable source. I ask if he means trees and he confirms.",
      "Peelable paint already exists for car bodywork, but getting such a product to work reliably on softer home interiors is more challenging.",
      "There is a risk of damaging your existing, underlying paint when you eventually wrest Unpaint off your walls, but, if the permanent paint below is in good condition, this shouldn\u2019t happen, says Mr Botero.",
      "It does have an odd texture: \u201cA little bit rubbery,\" says Mr Botero. Plus, it is easier to scratch than water-based emulsion.",
      "Bringing the product to market hasn\u2019t been easy. Glasst posted a video about the paint to YouTube two years ago, but the launch was delayed until this year \u201cto align with the correct funding and resources needed,\u201d says Mr Botero.",
      "He mentions that Glasst is working on other coatings with unusual properties \u2013 including \u201cThermglasst\u201d, an insulating resin due to launch next year. Mr Botero claims that less than a millimetre of this coating will provide the same insulating effect as 40 millimetres of foam.",
      "There\u2019s no independent validation of that claim just yet, but there are already a range of insulating paints on the market that promise to reduce your heating bills and, it is fair to note, they have not always performed well in scientific evaluations.",
      "In 2019, Richard Fitton of the University of Salford and colleagues published a paper in which they investigated the efficacy of six thermal paints available on the UK market at the time. In short, they found that claims that such paints could reduce heating bills by up to 20% or 25% were impossible to validate.",
      "First, the researchers coated boards with the paints, which allowed them to measure the coatings\u2019 thermal resistance, or insulating values. Then, the team calculated the reduction in heating costs you would expect after applying each of these paints to the interior of a typical Victorian terraced house.",
      "The biggest cost saving measured was a mere 2.9%, and, given the price of the paints in question, homeowners would potentially have to wait centuries or even up to a millennium \u2013 at 2019 prices \u2013 before they would recoup the decorating fees in terms of reduced heating costs.",
      "\u201cIf someone brought me a paint that could save me 25% of my energy bill, it would be on my wall by the weekend,\u201d says Prof Fitton. He adds that he is currently working on a follow-up paper to the 2019 study, and would also be open to testing Thermglasst, or any other insulating paint, in the future.",
      "Paints that help to keep your house cool might be more effective. For years, researchers have pursued the idea of improving the reflectivity of paint on exterior walls or roofs, since this could help keep buildings cool on hot, sunny days. Such weather is becoming ever more common due to climate change.",
      "The principle is as old as the hills \u2013 consider the white painted houses of the Mediterranean. But paints designed to be significantly more reflective than standard white paint could heighten the effect. i2Cool in Hong Kong is one of several firms marketing such a product at present.",
      "In their case, the paint contains tiny nanoparticles inspired by the extremely reflective body of the Saharan silver ant \u2013 which must naturally cope with baking sunshine.",
      "Martin Zhu, chief executive and co-founder, says the paint made by i2Cool was tested on the roof of a shopping mall in Hong Kong \u2013 but only on one of its two buildings, in order to find out whether there was a noticeable effect in terms of reducing the costs of running that building\u2019s air conditioning (AC).",
      "\u201cWe used a power meter to measure the energy consumption of the AC system,\u201d says Dr Zhu. The cost of running the AC duly fell in the painted building, by 40%, he adds.",
      "Dr Zhu first began working on the paint while a doctoral student, and he mentions that early versions made around 2017 contained silver, which made it very expensive \u2013 more than $100,000 just to cover a small area. Years of development later, it now costs around $10 per square metre of coverage. It also now comes in a variety of light colours, including grey, yellow and green.",
      "Researchers have noted that highly reflective coatings for passive cooling applications need to be resistant to dirt and soiling, for example, to avoid their efficacy dropping overt time. And glare from ultra-reflective roofs risks heating up nearby darker structures, a 2020 paper suggested.",
      "The paint from i2Cool does not contain heavy metals and uses a water-based emulsion, and while it is not biodegradable, it can be recycled, says Dr Zhu.",
      "The company\u2019s latest major project is the Dubai Mall. The roof of this sprawling complex \u2013 the largest mall in the world by total area \u2013 will eventually be fully coated with the paint. A 1,000 sq m section has been completed to date.",
      "While not yet available in Europe, that could change, says Dr Zhu. \u201cWe are discussing with some distributors in the UK,\u201d he says.",

      "Mr Rivers, who is indigenous, leads organised walks around Wiikwemkoong Unceded Territory on Manitoulin Island, in Ontario.",

      "Aa a result, Wikwemikong Tourism has struggled to retain staff, a problem that\u2019s reflected across a Canada-wide tourism sector still said to be short of hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "These staffing shortfalls will have to be addressed if the Canadian government is successful in its new drive to increase visitor numbers to the country.",
      "The push, led by government body Destination Canada, comes as visitor numbers to Canada have failed to recover post-Covid to their 2019 peak of 22 million people. Last year the total was 18.3 million, 17% lower.",
      "The new strategy called A World Of Opportunity, aims to increase revenue from Canada\u2019s tourism sector to $CA160bn ($116bn; \u00a389bn) by 2030, up from $CA109bn last year.",

      "More than 3,000km (1864 miles) west of Manitoulin Island, sits the popular tourist town of Jasper in Alberta\u2019s Rocky Mountains.",

The challenge is that not as many people will be able to visit Jasper until all the hotels are rebuilt, and we don\u2019t know how long that will take.\"",
      "Another big issue for the Canadian tourism sector is a fall in the number of Chinese visitors.",

      "\u201cA lot of North American and European carriers have really struggled with routes to China because they can't fly through Russia or over Russia, and by avoiding Russia, you add about three hours to the flight time, which is more expensive for the airlines and onerous for passengers.\u201d",

      "\"But it is as a friend I would like to remember him. We always had fun in his presence and his legend will continue through the years, but it is those private moments we were lucky enough to have with the great man that I will always remember fondly.\"",

      "She added: \"He was the Mightiest of Souls. His life enhanced mine and every life he touched. That will be his global legacy.",

      "The system of renewing the BBC's royal charter every 10 years is \"really odd\" and should be scrapped, the broadcaster's chair has said.",
      "The charter, drawn up by the government, sets out the terms and purposes of the BBC's existence and normally lasts for about a decade.",

      "Other organisations like the British Council and the Bank of England don't have a set duration and \"we should be like every other royal charter\", he said.",

      "He suggested making the charter permanent or drawing up new legislation as an alternative way to formalise the BBC's existence.",
      "\"Clearly either of those two approaches would involve finding new ways of reviewing the BBC\u2019s performance and holding the BBC to account,\" he said.",

      "Another soundtrack was The Wiz, the 1978 film musical version of the Wizard of Oz, which starred Diana Ross and a 19-year-old Michael Jackson, who was looking to branch out after finding childhood fame in The Jackson 5.",
      "Jones saw a superstar quality in Jackson and became his producer and mentor, first on 1979's Off the Wall, which was a major hit, and then 1982's Thriller, which reached new heights of commercial and critical success, and made Jackson the undisputed King of Pop.",
      "The album was not just the fulfilment of Jackson's talent, but the culmination of Jones's career, as he used his peerless musical expertise to define the 1980s with a sleek and polished fusion of R&B and pop.",
      "Jones listened to hundreds of songs to decide which nine should go on the album, and employed a dream team of musicians and songwriters that he had been assembling over the years.",
      "His choice of collaborators was one example of his knack for knowing how to make a good song great. For Beat It, he thought the single needed a rockier edge, so he recruited Eddie Van Halen to contribute a guitar solo. Legend has it that the solo was so explosive that a speaker caught fire in the studio.",
      "And when it came to the title track, Jones didn't like the original name Starlight, so he asked its writer, Rod Temperton, to come up with something different. Temperton renamed it Thriller and recast it with a spooky theme. Jones topped it off by asking his wife's friend, horror actor Vincent Price, to record a spoken-word outro.",
      "The album earned Jones and Jackson the Grammy Award for producer of the year, while Thriller was named album of the year and Beat It won record of the year.",
      "Jones used his winning formula in the 1980s with George Benson, Donna Summer and Patti Austin, and produced the decade's best-selling single when Jackson and Lionel Richie assembled 35 of America's biggest names for the 1985 charity song We Are the World.",
      "Jones famously posted a message on the studio entrance telling the stars: \"Check your egos at the door\".",
      "He had further success under his own name with his albums The Dude and Back on the Block. The latter, released in 1989, featured an all-star cast including many friends from his early career like Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Ray Charles.",
      "But as well as revisiting his past, he was also firmly in the present, enlisting rappers like Ice-T and Grandmaster Melle Mel to appear on the title track.",
      "It earned Jones another album of the year award at the Grammys.",
      "Although he was in his 50s, he embraced rap music because he saw similarities with the energy of bebop jazz, and because may of its stars had risen out of hardship on the streets.",
      "\"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "And rap stars reciprocated his affection, looking on Jones as an inspirational elder statesman of black American music. Even Kendrick and Dr Dre were awestruck when meeting him for the Netflix documentary, which was titled Quincy and directed by his daughter, actress Rashida Jones.",
      "Jones used his status to try to stem the violence in the hip-hop world, convening the Quincy Jones Hip-Hop Symposium in 1995, where he addressed a room full of the nation's rap stars.",
      "\"I want to see you guys live at least to my age,\" he told them.",
      "For Jones, social activism went hand-in-hand with his music.",
      "He met Martin Luther King in 1955, and \"from then on, my life was never the same\", he said.",
      "\"Civil rights work and political involvement was no longer an activity to do on the side. It became an essential part of life and humanity.\"",
      "He set up the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation and launched the We Are the Future project, among support for other causes.",
      "Elsewhere, his redoubtable work ethic saw him launch a record label and hip-hop magazine Vibe, as well as producing films like The Color Purple and TV shows including The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.",
      "With that workload, and an accompanying longstanding drink problem, his family life and his health both suffered.",
      "He married and divorced three times, having a nervous breakdown after splitting from third wife Peggy Lipton. To recover, he went to stay on the Pacific island owned by actor Marlon Brando, whom he first met in a jazz club at the age of 18.",
      "Jones was also in a relationship with actress and model Nastassja Kinski in the 1990s, and he had seven children in total.",
      "In 2015, he went into a diabetic coma for four days, and the following year went to hospital with a blood clot.",
      "His death on Sunday at the age of 91 has left the music world in mourning.",
      "If there's to be a second Quincy Jones memorial concert, stars will be queuing up to celebrate the full achievements of a singular talent."

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 13:20:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The musician, who has died aged 91, was one of the most consequential producers in jazz and pop.",
    "story": [
      "\"Music is sacred to me,\" Quincy Jones once said. \"Melody is God's voice.\"",
      "He certainly had the divine touch.",
      "Jones, who has died at the age of 91, was the right-hand man to both Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson, and helped to shape the sound of jazz and pop over more than 60 years.",
      "His recordings revolutionised music by crossing genres, promoting unlikely collaborations and shaping modern production techniques.",
      "Here are 10 songs that showcase his versatility and brilliance in the studio, and his ability to draw the best out of the musicians he worked with.",
      "1) Michael Jackson - Billie Jean",
      "Michael Jackson met Quincy Jones on the set of the 1978 movie The Wiz, and asked him to produce his next album. That record was Off The Wall - a disco extravaganza that established Jackson as a solo star.",
      "They teamed up again for 1982's Thriller, which arguably remade the pop business. Not only did it produce seven top 10 singles; but it crossed racial barriers, appealing equally to black and white audiences.",
      "Key to the success was Billie Jean, a dark tale about the groupies Jackson met while touring with his brothers. As a producer, Jones wasn't keen on the track at first - arguing with Jackson about the long instrumental opening.",
      "\"I said, \u2018Michael we\u2019ve got to cut that intro,\u2019\u201d he later recalled.",
      "\"He said, \u2018But that\u2019s the jelly! That\u2019s what makes me want to dance.' And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That\u2019s what makes me want to dance,' well, the rest of us just have to shut up.\"",
      "With those words ringing in his ears, Jones kept the arrangement lean and funky. He even instructed sound engineer Bruce Swedien to create a drum sound with a \"sonic personality\" that no-one had ever heard before. The result is one of the most recognisable intros in the history of pop.",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "2) Frank Sinatra - Come Fly With Me (Live at The Sands)",
      "\"The friendship was so strong. You can't describe it,\" said Jones of his partnership with Frank Sinatra - which extended far beyond the recording studio.",
      "\u201cSeven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying.\"",
      "After establishing their relationship on 1964's It Might As Well Be Swing, Jones helped Sinatra re-arrange his signature songs for a four-week residency at the Copa Room in The Sands hotel, Las Vegas.",
      "\"It was probably the most exciting engagement I have ever done in my life, since I started performing,\" Sinatra later recalled.",
      "Accompanied by the Count Basie Orchestra, the star sounds perfectly at ease, breezing around standards like I've Got You Under My Skin, Fly Me To The Moon and You Make Me Feel So Young.",
      "But it's Come Fly With Me that most perfectly captures the vitality of Jones's new arrangements, especially in the charismatic interplay between Sinatra and the brass section.",
      "No wonder that it was chosen as the show's opening number - as captured on the award-winning live album, Sinatra At The Sands.",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "3) Lesley Gore - It's My Party",
      "Lesley Gore was just a teenager when her vocal demos made their way into Quincy Jones's hands in the early 1960s. Up to that point, he'd been working with jazz singers like Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan - but he heard something he liked on Gore's tape.",
      "\"She had a mellow, distinctive voice and sang in tune, which a lot of grown up rock \u2018n\u2019 roll singers couldn\u2019t do, so I signed her,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography.",
      "For their first session, Jones picked It's My Party out of a pile of 200 demos and got to work. He double-tracked Gore's voice, adding little flourishes of brass and unexpected chord changes that perfectly evoke the song's adolescent angst.",
      "He then rush-released the single, after discovering that Phil Spector had plans to record the same song with the Crystals. It duly topped the US charts and went to number nine in the UK.",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "4) Quincy Jones - Summer In The City",
      "Recorded by The Lovin' Spoonful, Summer In The City is a 1960s rock classic, full of ominous organ chords and powerful drum hits that capture the sticky filth of an oppressive heatwave.",
      "Quincy Jones version, recorded for his 1973 album You've Got It Bad Girl, is almost unrecognisable as the same song. Lazily chilled-out, the Hammond organ is played with a featherlight touch, and the drums are gently brushed.",
      "Most of the lyrics are excised and, when they arrive at the 2'30\" mark, they're sung with almost heavenly serenity by Valerie Simpson (of Ashford and Simpson fame).",
      "Originally released as a b-side, it's become one of Jones's most influential songs. According to WhoSampled.com, it's been sampled on 87 other songs, including tracks by Massive Attack, Eminem, Nightmares on Wax and The Roots.",
      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "5) Dinah Washington - Mad About The Boy",
      "Another example of how Jones's skill as an arranger could completely change a song.",
      "Mad About The Boy was written by Sir No\u00ebl Coward, for the 1932 revue Words and Music. In the original, it was sung by four different women, each expressing their love for an unnamed film star (rumoured to be Douglas Fairbanks Jr) as they wait in line to see one of his films.",
      "It's funny and quirky and clever - but when Dinah Washington covered the song in 1961, Jones slowed it down and switched the time signature from 4/4 to 6/8, allowing the singer to prowl through the lyrics with a newfound carnality.",
      "Overlooked at the time, it gained a new lease of life in 1992 when it was used to soundtrack a Levis advert and crept into the UK charts for the first time.",

      "6) Quincy Jones - Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Written in just 20 minutes, Soul Bossa Nova was inspired by an early-60s fad for Brazilian music, sparked by the success of Jo\u00e3o Gilberto and Stan Getz's Desafinado.",
      "Jones is in his element here - with chirruping flutes and big trombone slides that capture the joie de vivre of the carnival. He also makes prominent use of a cu\u00edca, the Brazilian drum that produces what sounds like a very happy monkey in the opening bars.",
      "The bossa craze may have been short-lived, but Jones's song endured, most memorably in the opening dance sequence of Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery.",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "7) Michael Jackson - Beat It",
      "From the beginning, Jones and Jackson planned to make Thriller a blockbuster pop album.",
      "\"We went through 800 songs to get to nine,\" Jones said. \"That's not casual.\"",
      "The work was exhausting. At one point, they were working in three studios simultaneously... until the speakers caught fire.",
      "Beat It was crucial to the project - because it was designed to get Jackson played on US rock radio, an unheard of prospect in the heavily segregated music industry of the 1980s.",
      "Jones had told Jackson to write \"a black version\" of The Knack's My Sharona - the 1979 hit song that sold more then 10 million copies. But Jackson was one step ahead. He had a demo that fitted the bill, albeit without a hook or lyrics.",
      "While Jackson worked on those elements (you can hear his first, wordless attempt at the melody on his YouTube channel), Jones called on Eddie Van Halen to perform the guitar solo.",
      "\"He came in and he stacked up his Gibson [guitars],\" Jones later recalled.",
      "\"I said, 'I'm not going to sit here and try to tell you what to play... Let's try three or four takes. Some of it will be over-animated, some of it will be long, and we'll sculpt it.",
      "\"And he played his ass off.\"",
      "The song, with its West Side Story-inspired video, landed just as MTV took off, making Jackson a permanent fixture in living rooms across America.",
      "But for all the commercial focus of the Thriller project, Jones always maintained that the music came first.",
      "\"I've never, ever in my life done music for money or fame - because that's when God walks out of the room,\" he said.",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "8) The Brothers Johnson - Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Jones discovered guitarist George Johnson and bassist Louis Johnson when he heard them playing on a demo by Chaka Khan's sister, Taka Boom.",
      "He hired them to play on the soundtrack for the celebrated TV mini-series Roots, placed them in his touring band, and helmed their 1976 debut album Look Out For #1 (including a sublime cover of The Beatles' Come Together).",
      "But the brothers didn't achieve mainstream success until 1977, with the release of Strawberry Letter #23.",
      "Originally recorded by Shuggie Otis, Jones's version toughens up the production, with a strutting bassline and soaring backing vocals - but George Johnson struggled to recreate Shuggie's original guitar solo, which was full of complicated triplet notes.",
      "Frustrated, Jones called up session musician Lee Ritenour for help.",
      "\"Quincy was walking down the hallway tearing his hair out,\" Ritenour later recalled. \"He said, 'I'm going to lunch, Ritenour. Get it done.'",
      "Released in the middle of the punk and disco boom, the song's romantic psychedelia still found an audience - reaching number 13 in the charts. It was later re-popularised by Quentin Tarantino in the film Jackie Brown.",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "9) Sarah Vaughan - Misty",
      "Early in his career, Jones was one of the most in-demand arrangers in jazz, working with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee.",
      "In 1958, he recorded an entire album with Sarah Vaughan in Paris, backed by a 55-piece orchestra. Among the highlights is the lovestruck ballad Misty - originally recorded by pianist Erroll Garner, and made famous by Johnny Mathis.",
      "Unlike their syrupy and sentimental versions, Vaughan and Jones (along with producer Jack Tracy) give the lyrics some pathos. She might be \"as helpless as a kitten up a tree\", but you're never entirely convinced she's happy about the situation.",
      "Jones adds beguiling touches - from the cascading strings when Vaughan sings \"a thousand violins begin to play\", to the beautifully muted saxophone line, played by Zoot Sims.",
      "Vaughan died of lung cancer in 1990. In 2019, on what would have been her 95th birthday, Jones posted a tribute to the singer, using his pet name for her - Sassy.",
      "\"Dear sweet Sassy was all about sophistication and chord changes and, man, I\u2019m telling you she thought like a horn and SANG like a horn!\" he wrote on Facebook..",
      "\"We had quite the journey together, & I will never forget each moment we had, because every moment was a special one.\"",
      "Listen to Misty",
      "Listen to Misty",
      "10) USA For Africa - We Are The World",
      "\"Check your egos at the door,\" said the hand-written sign that Quincy Jones pinned to the door of his recording studio in 1985.",
      "The occasion was the recording of We Are The World - a star-studded charity single that aimed to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia.",
      "Written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, the record featured vocals from Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen, Dionne Warwick and Bob Dylan, all recorded in a single night.",
      "Herding the singers was a massive headache, as the recent Netflix documentary The Greatest Night In Pop revealed.",
      "At one point, Stevie Wonder insisted that some of the lyrics should be rewritten in Swahili - despite the fact that the people of Ethiopia, who would be the main beneficiaries of the famine-relief fundraiser, largely speak other languages.",
      "Jones oversaw the whole session with the patience and wisdom of a producer who'd seen it all.",
      "The results aren't particularly great - the song is sickly and overlong - but the fact that it's coherent at all is a testament to his skill as a producer, arranger, mentor and referee.",
      "In the end, the song raised more than $63m ($227m or \u00a3178m adjusted for inflation); and Jones looked back on it as one of his proudest achievements.",
      "\u201cI have never before or since experienced the joy I felt that night working with this rich, complex human tapestry of love, talent, and grace,\" he wrote in his 2002 autobiography.",

      "But others have called into question the credentials Jamie built his reputation on.",
      "Jamie reportedly claimed to have trained at the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and that he worked his way up at United Agents, a top London agency. He wrote in emails that he was a member of the Personal Managers\u2019 Association - which has a code of conduct for agents to observe.",
      "The BBC contacted all three of these organisations. They all said they had no record of him.",
      "Audition questions",
      "Several ex-clients have told the BBC Jamie sent them audition opportunities that were never intended for them.",
      "Layla Shirley from Birmingham signed with the agency in June 2022.",
      "Jamie sent her a promising self-tape opportunity, where actors are chosen by production companies to record their auditions at home. It was for an advert with a well-known burger chain - despite the fact she is vegan.",

      "Frustrated, Layla began speaking about her experience with other former clients and Alexa Morden, host of The 98%, a podcast which explores the reality of work for jobbing actors.",
      "The most important thing Layla wanted to draw attention to though, was the operation of Jamie\u2019s agency for child actors, Luna Kids Casting.",
      "Kids agency",
      "Luna Kids Casting held auditions in April, July and October 2023, with pop-up banners in the Wigan studio suggesting children signed by Jamie went on to work for Cbeebies, Sky, Disney and Fox.",
      "Sarah Wilson\u2019s 10-year-old daughter was successful during busy auditions and a photoshoot day was scheduled for those children asked to join the books.",

      "While this was \u201cincredibly expensive\u201d, Sarah says she felt reassured by the amount of paperwork requested prior to signing her daughter up.",
      "But costs kept mounting. They included a \u00a366 charge for a child\u2019s details and images to be uploaded to the agency\u2019s website and a fee of \u00a3120 to sign them up to Spotlight, a platform where actors are submitted for jobs.",
      "Agreements also outline a monthly fee of \u00a314.40. These charges were described as non-refundable.",

      "Sarah says she later discovered a fake credit added to her daughter\u2019s Spotlight profile. It said she had taken part in a stage production called As It Was, with Jamie\u2019s partner listed as the director.",
      "The BBC has searched for this production online and has found no record of its existence.",
      "Despite paying just under \u00a3500 to Luna Kids Casting, Sarah says only one audition opportunity was sent to them. She moved her daughter to another agency.",

      "The workshops cost between \u00a355 and \u00a360 and involved actors learning scripts and performing in front of top industry professionals.",
      "Attendees say Jamie would begin by giving a talk, where he would mention a portion of the fee would be donated to charity, with the logos of Mind, Rainbow Railroad and the Oddballs Foundation visible in photos of the sessions posted on social media.",

      "In a statement, Equity said: \u201cHaving taken legal advice, we have been told that there is no prospect of monies being returned to creditors and that they do not expect to be making any payments at all.",
      "\u201cThis outcome is hugely disappointing. Mr Fisher and his rogue agency have treated its clients appallingly, leading to the loss of significant amounts of money owed to them.\u201d",
      "Others have questioned the role of the platform Spotlight. In 2019, former employers warned Spotlight alleging that Jamie was submitting fake credits for his own clients, as well as \u201cconcocting\u201d productions that never existed.",
      "They claimed his \u201cconsistent fabrications\u201d could cause damage to the industry, but said they heard little back.",
      "In response, Spotlight told the BBC it was provided with verified references from casting professionals who had been positive about their business dealings with Jamie Fisher.",
      "It also said it had \u201cactively supported affected individuals during the agency's closure by offering one-to-one assistance and guiding them on how to address their concerns, including directing them to Equity and the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate (EASI)\u201d.",
      "While it does not regulate talent agencies, Spotlight says it can \u201cremove their services for misuse of our platform or for breaching our terms and conditions\u201d.",
      "The #BodhiGate scandal, first reported by Deadline, has also generated discussion about the limited regulation of UK entertainment, in contrast with the US, where 22 states require an agency licence.",

      "He suggests that actors should look for established agencies, read any contracts carefully and speak to current clients if looking for representation.",
      "Alongside Equity, actors we spoke to said they were in the process of, or had, submitted reports to the EASI, the government-backed watchdog which polices UK employment agencies. It has the power to bar individuals from practicing.",
      "The BBC understands it is currently investigating complaints around Luna Kids Casting and the Bodhi Talent Agency.",
      "In the meantime, Thea and Jack have been left wondering if they will ever see any of the money they say they are owed.",

      "So, why are cigarettes being glamorised again?",
      "Lucy, a 20-year-old university student, says she took up smoking recently because \"it's just what everyone does\".",

      "\"I definitely think everyone trying to be brat has influenced people to start smoking because Charli herself says you have to have a pack of cigs if you really want to embody the vibe.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:06:25 GMT",
    "summary": "The move is part of an overhaul of decades-old mental health legislation in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "Police will no longer be able to hold people who are being detained for mental-health reasons in police cells, under government plans for England and Wales.",
      "Officers can currently use cells as a \"place of safety\" for up to 24 hours to allow those needing immediate care to be assessed by a doctor.",
      "New legislation will also introduce additional rights for those receiving treatment, in a bid to modernise decades-old mental health laws.",
      "Charities have broadly welcomed the changes, whilst highlighting the need for better funding for mental health.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the \"outdated\" system was in need of changes to bring it \"in line with the 21st Century\".",
      "'I was sectioned and no one told me what was going on'",
      "'Discriminatory' mental health system overhauled",
      "People can be detained under the Mental Health Act - or sectioned - for their own safety, or the safety of others.",
      "Fully banning the use of police cells during detention was first proposed in draft legislation published under Boris Johnson's government, following a wide-ranging review of mental health laws published in 2018.",
      "But although that draft law underwent extensive scrutiny by MPs, it was not introduced to Parliament by the time of July's election.",
      "Under the current law, people who police believe are suffering from a mental disorder and are in \"immediate need of care or control\" can be detained so that they can be examined for possible treatment.",
      "Last year 34,685 people were detained under these circumstances, the majority to health settings such as a hospital A&E department.",
      "Some 314 detentions - around 1% - were to a police cell, with the proportion falling from around 4% in 2017, when restrictions on their use were tightened.",
      "Those detained in a police cell can typically only be held for 24 hours and must be assessed by a social worker and doctor during that time.",
      "A cross-party committee of MPs scrutinising the previous proposals had welcomed the ban on their use, but had called for an increase in appropriate places to detain people in healthcare settings alongside the change.",
      "Detention limits",
      "Labour had pledged to reform mental health legislation in its election manifesto -  branding existing laws, drawn up in the 1980s, as \"woefully out of date\".",
      "It had argued the current system discriminates against black people - who are more likely to be detained, according to official statistics - and had also criticised how the system treated autistic people and people with learning disabilities.",
      "Its new Mental Health Bill, to be published on Wednesday, will introduce a 28-day limit on how long autistic people and people with learning disabilities can be detained, unless they have a co-occurring mental health condition.",
      "It will also give people enhanced rights to select a person to represent their interests, and introduce additional requirements on clinicians to consult with people close to patients about their care.",
      "The rules on granting community treatment orders, which impose certain monitoring conditions on detained people discharged from hospital, are also expected to be changed.",
      "The health department said their use would be made more \"proportionate\", although it did not offer details.",
      "'Human rights scandal'",
      "The bill is set to largely mirror proposals included in the draft Tory law, including raising the threshold to detain people, and requiring that there is a realistic prospect that suggested treatment would have a therapeutic benefit.",
      "One area where it is expected to differ is in granting patients the right to draw up a document setting out their treatment preferences if they become unwell.",
      "The Conservative government had rejected making this a legal right, arguing that its preference was to retain flexibility in the system and it did not want to create a hierarchy of different documents.",
      "Labour has previously said the changes in the bill would take a number of years to implement fully, to give time to \"recruit and train more clinical and judicial staff\".",
      "The National Autistic Society said it welcomed the bill as a chance to end the \"human rights scandal\" of inappropriate detention.",
      "Mental health charity Mind also said the bill would move England and Wales a \"step closer to a more progressive mental health system,\" whilst adding that \"proper funding\" would be required to ease the \"mental health emergency\"."

      "The source said consultants were in a \"pretty unique position compared to other staff\" because their contracts meant they could opt out of non-emergency weekend work and then charge whatever their hospital was willing to pay for overtime.",
      "They said it was not in the BMA's interests to renegotiate these \"outdated\" contracts, more than 20 years old.",
      "\"What worries me is that the overtime costs are going to keep increasing with the need to tackle the backlog and this will breed resentment among other NHS staff who often work overtime for little more,\u201d the source said.",

      "Female mosquitoes are the ones that spread diseases to people, and so trying to prevent them having babies would help reduce overall numbers.",

      "New legislation will also introduce additional rights for those receiving treatment, in a bid to modernise decades-old mental health laws.",
      "Charities have broadly welcomed the changes, whilst highlighting the need for better funding for mental health.",

      "But although that draft law underwent extensive scrutiny by MPs, it was not introduced to Parliament by the time of July's election.",
      "Under the current law, people who police believe are suffering from a mental disorder and are in \"immediate need of care or control\" can be detained so that they can be examined for possible treatment.",

      "The OBR has calculated that three quarters of the impact would be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "The watchdog's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "Prof Miles said the OBR estimated employers would only take around a quarter of the hit from the NI changes in terms of lower profits, and suggested that the rest would be felt by workers.",

      "In a report, the body in charge of linking new projects to the grid said Labour's target to decarbonise electricity by 2030 was \"achievable\" but a \"huge challenge\".",
      "It will warn that infrastructure for the electricity network will need to be built much faster than it has been over the last decade to meet the pledge.",

      "But it also highlights the scale of the task when it comes to increasing the supply of renewable energy, and connecting it to the grid.",
      "Meeting the pledge, it finds, would require a significant boost to offshore wind capacity, alongside increased electrification of heat, transport and industry.",

      "It did not model the impact of its blueprint on consumer bills \"given the heavy dependence on policy choices\".",
      "But the report predicts wholesale energy prices are likely to fall with decreased reliance on gas, which often spikes unpredictably.",

      "The government could miss its own cladding removal completion date if progress is not made to speed up the process, the UK's spending watchdog has said.",
      "In a new report, the National Audit Office (NAO) said up to 60% of buildings with dangerous cladding had still not been identified by the government, and at its current rate of progress it was due to miss its own estimated completion date of 2035 for the works.",
      "The NAO also warned that more than \u00a3500,000 may have been lost to fraud in a payment to one applicant, which led to a review of counter-fraud structures.",
      "Building Safety Minister Alex Norris said the pace of works had been \"unacceptably slow\" and the government would set out its Remediation Acceleration Plan soon.",
      "The report follows the conclusion of the Grenfell Inquiry in September, which found risks had been ignored and there was \u201csystematic dishonesty\u201d from those who made and sold the cladding involved in the fire in west London in 2017, in which 72 people died.",
      "The report assessed how fast the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) was completing work to replace dangerous cladding from tower blocks in England, and aimed to provide an update to a previous NAO report in 2020.",
      "It found there had been \"a substantial increase in remediation activity\" since then, with 4,771 buildings taller than 11 metres being brought under the government's remedial works scheme as of August.",
      "However, an estimated 7,200 more buildings in England with such cladding still had not been identified and some \"may never\", the NAO continued.",
      "Progress with replacing the cladding was also slow, it found.",
      "Although the MHCLG spent \u00a32.3bn carrying out work on identified buildings, the report said work had only been completed on roughly a third of them and was yet to start on half.",
      "The government's suggested end date for completing cladding works on these buildings was 2035 but it was not on course to meet this deadline and \"there are significant challenges to overcome\", the report stated.",
      "The NAO also warned that the government had chosen approaches to funding that prioritised speed but \"increased the risks of poor value for money and fraud\".",
      "It said that the department had identified potential losses of more than \u00a3500,000 through fraud in 2023-24.",
      "This led to a review of counter-fraud structures and developed plans to improve fraud management in 2024, the report said.",

      "Gemma Lindfield, who lives in a block of flats in east London with dangerous cladding, said she wasn't surprised but hoped the report would spur the government into action.",
      "She said multiple issues were found in her building including with fire doors and a panel block system, but still have not been fixed - including the cladding.",
      "\"I had to pay for the waking watch and our building insurance since 2020 has more than doubled,\" Ms Lindfield explained.",

      "\"Because it's not possible to sell the property, the price of it has effectively fallen by about 25%,\" she said, and that until a resolution is found \"people cannot move on\".",
      "'Financial and emotional stress'",
      "The NAO recommended that if progress with identifying buildings with dangerous cladding did not improve by the end of 2024, the government should consider other measures.",
      "These include mandatory registration for medium-rise buildings - and as with high-rise buildings under the Building Safety Act 2022, tougher enforcement activity and action to help with disputes between residents and building owners.",
      "\"Many people still do not know when their buildings will be made safe, contributing to residents suffering significant financial and emotional distress,\" the report said.",

    "title": "Badenoch's win and Labour's big Budget mean we now have sharper left-right divide",
    "published": "Sat, 02 Nov 2024 15:21:21 GMT",
    "summary": "With the government announcing big spending and tax, the differences between the two main parties feel sharper, writes Laura Kuenssberg.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like week zero,\u201d a government insider suggests. A new Conservative leader today. A whopper of a Budget on Wednesday.",
      "Add those two events together and it feels like this is the week that everything changed \u2013 the clock restarts.",
      "The tramlines are now set for the battles ahead, a member of the cabinet tells me. A Labour government that\u2019s now unabashed in the big choices it\u2019s made, the winners and losers they\u2019ve picked.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative boss, is unashamed in saying what the softer fringes of the Tory party has felt squeamish about until now.",
      "And maybe we\u2019ve entered a new era when the fabled centre ground of politics feels a bit emptier \u2013 and the differences between the two main parties are sharper.",
      "The consequences of the Budget are still emerging, and the real effect won\u2019t be clear for many months. There has been no huge unravelling, but ministers are still incredibly aware they\u2019ll still need to explain it.",
      "If your doorbell rings this afternoon and it\u2019s a grinning person with a red rosette and a leaflet, you\u2019ll know what they\u2019re up to.",
      "The party knows the decisions, particularly to whack billions on employers\u2019 national insurance, have caused some anxiety among some voters. This will also hit GP practices and charities, which have flagged fears about the cost of the change - and no government wants to go to war with them.",
      "No minister wants to have to defend a decision that looks to many voters and their rivals, like they were misled, after promises not to raise National Insurance in the election.",
      "The government rejects the charge - insisting they only promised to not raise the National Insurance paid by employees, rather than employers.",
      "But Labour is having to learn what it\u2019s like to take the flak. To wobble on the big decisions would be politically disastrous. And in Downing Street there\u2019s confidence the public is broadly onside.",
      "Insiders say No 10\u2019s focus groups - which have been asked about the Budget in the last few days - have understood the decisions, reporting some grumbles but not much sign of outrage.",
      "One government source says, \u201cpeople looked at the Budget and said, \u2018that makes sense\u2019. That is a platform we can build on.\u201d",
      "The decisions, and the government\u2019s true motivations \u2013 are out there now in black and white. The source says \u201cit\u2019s the first time \u2013 certainly in government, probably in the whole project \u2013 we have been able to show, rather than just tell.\u201d",
      "However, after all of Labour\u2019s schmoozing of the business world, and all their emphasis in the election of growing the economy, there\u2019s been some surprise that those arguments were a lot less prominent on Wednesday.",
      "Sources say phase one was concentrating on the public finances and public services, then the next part will be more emphasis on growth with a big speech from Rachel Reeves at the Mansion House in the City soon.",
      "How the Budget will affect you and your money",
      "Rachel Reeves doesn\u2019t mind if you don't like her Budget",
      "A senior business leader told me, \u201cthey\u2019ve done part one well, in a more traditional Labour way, but to get a real shape, they need a very strong part two... creating the vision, energy and specific incentives and plan for growth and wealth creation \u2013 that still needs work.\u201d",
      "On the other side, Labour\u2019s union backers are pleased with extra cash for some public services, and the tweaking of the borrowing rules so more money is available to spend on long-term projects.",
      "But there\u2019s concern, as one leader puts it, that the NI rise for employers will be \u201craised in every negotiating room\u201d, as an excuse for lowering wages. And unhappiness on the left about the two-child benefit cap, and the winter fuel allowance, remains - with a judicial review of the decision on those pensioner payments in the offing.",
      "But forget the inevitable skirmishes and stresses. The Budget has filled in many of the blanks about this government, answering part of that common question: what does Keir Starmer really stand for?",
      "And the response could almost be a line from a Gordon Brown Budget of days gone by \u2013 economic stability, more public spending, with schools and hospitals at the top of the list.",
      "Starmer\u2019s backers says the discipline on day-to-day spending - even cuts to some departments - makes it different to Labour Budgets of the past, claiming they have taken the Conservatives\u2019 mantle for being the party you can trust with public money.",
      "But no doubt the Budget illuminates the priorities of classic Labour instincts, not the mushy middle.",
      "A government source suggests none of it should really be a surprise.",
      "\u201cTraditional centre-left arguments were were all there in the election \u2013 ending non-doms, VAT on private schools - overall it passes the fairness test and that is the most important thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cLabour in its veins,\u201d says a cabinet minister. And in the next few weeks Labour will publish what\u2019s been described as a \u201cprogramme for government\u201d that will make it even more clear.",
      "New Conservative chapter",
      "The sharper shape makes life both easier and harder for the brand new Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch.",
      "It\u2019s more straightforward perhaps if Labour\u2019s stripes are more red, the Tories can portray themselves a deeper blue.",
      "Kemi Badenoch has been deliberately light on policy, but her principles are clear. She believes in free markets and a smaller state. It\u2019s not going to be hard for her to draw a contrast to the government. \u201cIt\u2019s back to the future,\u201d one Tory source tells me.",
      "\u201cWe can go back to first principles, as we did in the 70s and the early 2000s,\u201d opposing bigger government and bigger taxes.",
      "Another senior party figure suggests the Budget has already sketched out an obvious path telling me, \u201cthe government has positioned itself as distinctly post-new Labour.",
      "\u201cIt is workerist, it\u2019s not very nice to farmers or rural areas \u2013 with pensioners and farmers you see that you have a coalition where the Tories can get back to 250 seats.\u201d",
      "Badenoch\u2019s backers are sure that she can satisfy the first task of opposition, getting noticed. Opposition parties don\u2019t have an automatic right to get attention.",
      "One supporter was convinced that \u201cwhatever happens, she will be an attention-gatherer.\u201d But Labour reckons their Budget choices have sent plenty of traps for the brand new leader.",
      "It might seem natural to the Tories to vote against the government\u2019s tax rises in the Budget. But it\u2019s a lot less comfortable to oppose extra cash for public services.",
      "It\u2019s one thing to stand against charging private schools VAT. But will the Conservatives oppose the new teachers for state schools the tax rise is meant to support? That is a far harder argument to make.",
      "Labour\u2019s decisions mean, despite Badenoch\u2019s broad-brush approach, the Tories are going to be expected to have something to say about schools and hospitals - services the public relies on.",
      "A senior Conservative figure warns that this week has \u201cset up a public services Parliament \u2026 you can\u2019t go through a sustained period of time when you just rely on the vibes.\u201d",
      "As Chris has written, the task for Badenoch is massive. Not just because of the July\u2019s battering that depleted their numbers so much, but because the Conservatives have been in the groove of attacking each other for many years now.",
      "The party is described by sources as \u201cfractious\u201d, and  \u201cdeeply sceptical\u201d. Getting rid of leaders became almost the norm.",
      "One of the contenders for the job joked when courting votes they\u2019d even been told by one former minister: \u201cI\u2019m more interested in the leadership race in two years time.\u201d",
      "Badenoch has won a clear mandate, but by a smaller margin than in races that have gone before.",
      "There is no doubt she is a politician that stands out, another Conservative says, referencing an old TV ad: \u201cShe has the potential to be Heineken \u2013 reaching the parts of the electorate other Tories cannot.\u201d",
      "But her style has risks - \u201clike a can of Heineken, if shaken up too much, it can froth everywhere,\u201d and make a terrible mess.",

      "Kemi Badenoch: Who is new Tory leader and what does she stand for?",
      "Chris Mason: Badenoch will need all her political savvy to transform Tory fortunes",
      "A Labour government that has expressed its priorities with big borrowing, big spending and big tax that believes the public is on board, after years when Budgets at home and in Whitehall have been under so much pressure.",
      "And an opposition with a new leader who believes in something completely different. Don\u2019t forget of course the smaller parties, Reform, the Lib Dems, the SNP and Greens, have important roles too.",
      "But the contours of the central contest feel sharper now.",
      "For years politicians, whether Labour or Conservative, have liked to suggest that we can drift towards lower taxes and still have the kind of public services of countries where the government spends much more cash.",
      "Perhaps this week might mark the moment when our politicians stop telling us we can have it all.",
      "A former cabinet minister suggests now we\u2019ll be much less like \u2018the stepping stone\u2019 between America and the rest of Europe. Politics is an ever-shifting kaleidoscope but Labour\u2019s enormous Budget has set new terms.",

      "Like her political heroine Margaret Thatcher, Kemi Badenoch - who is the new Conservative leader - divides opinion even within her own party.",
      "Her robust views, \"anti-woke\" values and no-nonsense style have made her a darling of the Conservative right and the party's grassroots and they have chosen her over fellow right-winger Robert Jenrick.",
      "As the first black woman to lead a major UK political party she has made history, but she is no fan of identity politics and is not likely to make much of that as she sets to work on the formidable task of restoring her party's battered fortunes.",
      "The former business secretary's analysis of what went wrong for the Conservatives at the general election is that they \"talked right, but governed left\", and need to \"stop acting like Labour\" to win back power.",
      "It is a pledge she put at the heart of her Tory leadership campaign, which focused on changing the underlying mindset of the British state rather than setting out detailed policies.",
      "Born in Wimbledon in 1980, Olukemi Adegoke was one of three children of Nigerian parents. Her father worked as a GP and her mother was a physiology professor.",
      "Badenoch - she married banker Hamish Badenoch in 2012 and they have three children - grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, and in the United States where her mother lectured.",
      "She returned to the UK at the age of 16 to live with a friend of her mother because of the worsening political and economic situation in Nigeria, and studied for her A-levels at a college in south London while working in a McDonald's restaurant and elsewhere.",
      "After completing a degree in computer engineering at Sussex University, she worked in IT while also gaining a second degree in law.",
      "She then moved into finance, becoming an associate director of private bank  Coutts and later worked as the digital director of influential Conservative-supporting magazine The Spectator, a non-editorial role.",
      "According to Blue Ambition, a biography written by Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, it was at Sussex University that Badenoch got a taste for right-wing politics - becoming \"radicalised\" by the left-wing campus culture, in the opposite direction.",
      "She later described student activists there as the \"spoiled, entitled, privileged metropolitan elite-in-training\".",
      "Badenoch and Jenrick wait for results of Tory leadership race",
      "Chris Mason: Challenges ahead for Kemi Badenoch",
      "Badenoch joined the Conservative Party in 2005 - aged 25 - and stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in 2010 and the London Assembly in 2012.",
      "When two Tory Assembly members, including Suella Braverman, were elected MPs in 2015, she took a vacant Assembly seat.",
      "She backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum before achieving her ambition of becoming an MP a year later, for the safe Conservative seat of Saffron Walden in Essex.",
      "Badenoch had spent three years bouncing around junior government roles when in 2022 she joined the rapid ministerial exodus which brought down Boris Johnson.",
      "To the surprise of many of her colleagues, Badenoch then joined the sprawling contest to succeed Johnson despite never having been in the cabinet.",
      "What began as a longshot campaign with the support mostly of loyal friends who also entered Parliament in 2017 quickly gained momentum, and heavyweight support in the form of Michael Gove.",
      "Badenoch ultimately came fourth with the backing of 59 MPs - more than the 42 MPs who were enough for her to finish top in the parliamentary stage of the current leadership election.",
      "Her direct approach, instructing her colleagues to \u201ctell the truth\u201d, won Badenoch a bigger role in the Conservative Party and it was inevitable that Liz Truss chose to appoint her to the cabinet - making her international trade secretary.",
      "Rishi Sunak retained her in post, adding the business and women and equalities briefs.",
      "Her time in Parliament has been characterised by her straightforwardness and willingness to engage in controversial issues.",
      "As a junior equalities minister under Johnson, she enraged many on the left when she challenged the notion there was widespread institutional racism in Britain.",
      "In an LBC interview, she said she had experienced prejudice only from left-wingers.",
      "\"I came to this country aged 16 and now I am standing for prime minister - isn't that amazing? I was born in this country but I didn't grow up here.",
      "\"I don't understand why people want to ignore all of the good things and only focus on the bad things, and use the bad things to tell the story,\" she added.",
      "She calls herself a gender-critical feminist, and has been an outspoken opponent of moves to allow self-certification of transgender identity.",
      "As the cabinet minister in charge of women and equalities, she spearheaded the UK government's blocking of Scotland's Gender Recognition Reform Bill.",
      "Responding to the Cass report on gender identity services in the NHS, she said they had been \"hijacked by ideologues\" while critics were \"gagged\", resulting in children being harmed.",
      "She has also opposed gender-neutral toilets.",
      "In 2021, members of the government's own LGBT+ advisory panel urged her to \"consider her position\" over the failure to deliver a manifesto pledge to ban so-called conversion therapy.",
      "Badenoch is often labelled a \"culture warrior\" but she disputes the tag.",
      "Sometimes accused of wanting to start a fight in an empty room, she says she does not like to fight - but is prepared to fight to defend Conservative principles.",
      "That is simultaneously what endears her to Conservative MPs and what makes some of them anxious.",
      "During the early stages of the leadership election several Conservative MPs told the BBC they were inclined to support Badenoch but were put off by fractious interactions while she was in government.",
      "To her supporters, that\u2019s the point: unlike other ministers she was willing to tell MPs what she believed and make the case for it forthrightly.",
      "On the eve of this year's party conference in Birmingham, she made headlines with a claim that not all cultures were \"equally valid\", citing as an example \"cultures where women are told that they should not work\".",
      "She also got attention in Birmingham for quipping that 5-10% of civil servants were so bad they should be in prison. She has previously strongly denied bullying officials.",
      "But she backtracked after an interview in which she appeared to suggest the current level of maternity pay was \"excessive\". She claimed her words had been \"misrepresented\", saying she had been talking about excessive business regulation and maternity pay was \"a good thing\".",
      "In 2018, Badenoch admitted that, a decade earlier, she had hacked into the website of then-Commons leader and deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman as a prank. Harman accepted her apology.",
      "Among public spats, in February, she accused the Post Office chair she had sacked of seeking \"revenge\" by \"making up\" claims he been told to delay compensation payments for sub-postmasters affected by the Horizon IT scandal.",

      "Appearing before a Commons committee, she told chair Caroline Nokes \"loads of people\" wanted to use equalities law as \"a tool for different personal agendas and interests\".",
      "During her leadership campaign, Badenoch has spoken of Conservatism being \"in crisis\" - under attack from a new \"progressive ideology\" involving \"identity politics\" (politics based on a particular identity such as race, religion or gender), constant state intervention, and \"the idea that bureaucrats make better decisions than individuals\" or elected politicians.",
      "Despite the Tories being in office for 14 years, she argues that increases in government regulations and public spending have crippled economic growth and polarised the country.",
      "She rejected Robert Jenrick's call for key party policies to be settled now, saying the UK's \"system is broken\" and requires a reset.",
      "The Conservative Party, she adds, needs to return to its core values and come up with new policies that recognise this reality."

      "Yiorgos Gadanakis, associate professor of agricultural business management at University of Reading, Whiteknights pointed to various sources including Defra's Farm Business Survey, which suggest that between about 30 and 35% of farms in the UK could be valued at over \u00a31m.",
      "As there are about 209,000 farm holdings in the UK, that gives an estimate of between 62,700 and 73,150.",
      "An alternative way is to look at the number of farms that are bigger than about 200 acres (81 hectares), because at average land prices that would be enough to mean inheritance tax was due. That figure comes out at about 70,000.",
      "Sally Shortall, professor of rural economy at Newcastle University, points out they will not be evenly distributed across the country because of differing land values. \"Farms in England are likely to be the hardest hit,\" she said.",
      "But of course a farm will only be affected once it is inherited, so 70,000 is not necessarily the right number to use.",
      "Is it 500 farms a year?",
      "Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an independent economy think-tank, told Sky News: \"The changes will affect a remarkably small number of some of the most valuable farms.\"",
      "He added: \"[Farms are] still more generously treated, actually, than farms used to be in decades past.\"",
      "The Treasury estimates that 500 estates including agricultural land will be affected by the agricultural property relief reform per year.",
      "Dan Neidle, an independent tax expert, says the number of actual farms affected is likely to be below 500 per year.",
      "There were a total of 462 inherited farms valued above \u00a31m in 2021-22, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC):",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m37 above \u00a35m",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m",
      "80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m",
      "37 above \u00a35m",
      "Under the new rules, those 462 farms would be affected by the 20% inheritance tax on any value above \u00a31m (not on the whole value).",
      "However, as Mr Neidle points out, like for the rest of the population, there is no inheritance tax to be paid on the value of property up to \u00a3325,000, bringing the untaxed total to \u00a31.325m.",
      "If a farmer is married, his or her spouse would be able to pass on another \u00a31.325m tax free, taking the total untaxed amount to \u00a32.65m.",
      "There were 117 farms valued above \u00a32.5m in 2021-22, according to the HMRC figures.",
      "In addition, there is an \u00a3175,000 tax-free allowance on a main residence when it's being passed on to children or grandchildren. This brings the total untaxed amount for a farming couple to up to \u00a33m.",
      "Steve Reed, the secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, confirmed the \"vast majority\" of farmers will not be affected by changes. Writing in the Telegraph, he said \"only the richest estates will be asked to pay\".",
      "Farmers 'betrayed' by \u00a31m inheritance tax relief cap",
      "Farmers mull selling or protests over tax change",
      "How are the inheritance tax rules changing?",
      "How much could be raised?",
      "The chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, has said that the inheritance tax exemptions currently cost \"about \u00a31bn a year for taxpayers\".",
      "Now the Treasury expects that the changes to inheritance tax , as well as changes to Business Tax Relief, will raise \u00a3230m in 2026-27, the first year of their introduction. This rises to \u00a3520m by the end of the forecast in 2029-30.",
      "But the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warns that there is high uncertainty around these figures.",
      "Is the tax affordable?",
      "Sam Kirkham, who specialises in agriculture at Albert Goodman accountants, says \"people look at the value of farms and think the farmers must be wealthy\".",
      "But she says if the farm passes down to the next generation to continue to produce food, they never get to realise that capital.",
      "And she adds farm profits are insufficient to meet the additional cost of inheritance tax.",
      "Government figures suggest that the average return on capital for farms (which is the percentage return that they are making from things like land and machinery) is only about 0.5%, which is very low.",
      "UPDATE 4 November: The unit on a measure of area was corrected from hectares to acres. A sentence was added detailing the residence nil-rate band rate of inheritance tax.",

      "And in looking to reboot Britain\u2019s economic model, the chancellor\u2019s most helpful asset is the fact she has a landslide majority to credibly pass all of these policies in to law.",
      "This is one of the many differences from Liz Truss\u2019 mini budget and is sometimes underrated. During that budget in 2022, the markets were not just testing the economic credibility of a PM and chancellor, but their political credibility too, to get a rather different set of economic policies through the Commons.",

      "While at the time of the Budget speech there was no response, the publication of the plans for the increase in the sale of government bonds has set off a marked rise in interest rates. This is because the government is borrowing more than the markets expected. The reaction now is notable, but remains orderly.",

      "Rates might not fall below 4% next year, as previously expected. The next words from the Bank of England, when it releases its new inflation forecast next week, will be closely watched.",
      "Mammoth changes",
      "The response has been modest given the mammoth changes seen in Wednesday's Budget, with \u00a376bn a year in new spending, half funded by tax and half by borrowing.",

      "The plans increase investment by \u00a3105bn versus previous Conservative plans for significant cuts, leaving investment at the highest sustained level in half a century.",
      "This could be much better for long term economic growth, and not as inflationary. Clearly, it depends on what the money is spent on.",

      "The Energy Secretary Ed Miliband was in the US last week visiting the key officials in charge of disbursing the record subsidies and loans made available in the $400bn Inflation Reduction Act. One lesson from the US is that it takes time to build up the pipeline of good government investments.",
      "While the US's private sector took an immediate cue from the massive government announcements, it took one to two years to get the state machine ramped up.",

      "While some maintain the new policy is designed in part to cover large-scale landowners who may have invested in farmland for the tax benefit, many in farming say the \u00a31m limit will hit small family farms hardest.",

      "Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Tim Farron said of the changes to agricultural property inheritance tax relief:  \"This is a family farm tax which risks ringing the death knell for local farmers and the small businesses who rely on them.\"",

    "summary": "Human-caused climate change made recent extreme weather events more intense and more likely, new analysis finds.",
    "story": [
      "Human-caused climate change made the ten deadliest extreme weather events of the last 20 years more intense and more likely, according to new analysis.",
      "The killer storms, heatwaves and floods affected Europe, Africa and Asia killing more than 570,000 people.",
      "The new analysis highlights how scientists can now discern the fingerprint of climate change in complex weather events.",
      "The study involved reanalysing data for some of the extreme weather events and was carried out by scientists from the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group at Imperial College London.",
      "\u201cThis study should be an eye-opener for political leaders hanging on to fossil fuels that heat the planet and destroy lives\u201d, said Dr Friederike Otto, co-founder and lead of WWA.",
      "\u201cIf we keep burning oil, gas and coal, the suffering will continue,\u201d she said.",
      "The researchers focused on the 10 deadliest weather events registered in the International Disaster Database since 2004.  That was when the first study was published linking a weather event \u2013 a heatwave in Europe - with our changing climate.",
      "The deadliest event of the last two decades was a drought in Somalia in 2011 which is reckoned to have killed more than 250,000 people.   The researchers found the low rainfall that drove the drought was made more likely and more extreme by climate change.",
      "The list includes the heatwave that hit France in 2015 killing more than 3,000 people, where researchers say high temperatures were made twice as likely because of climate change.",
      "How is climate change linked to extreme weather?",
      "Why is the world getting warmer?",
      "It also contains the European heatwaves of 2022, when 53,000 people died, and 2023, which led to 37,000 people losing their lives. The latter would have been impossible without climate change, the study finds.",
      "It says the deadly tropical cyclones that hit Bangladesh in 2007, Myanmar in 2008 and the Philippines in 2013 were all made more likely and intense by climate change.  That was also the case with the floods that hit India in 2013.",
      "The researchers say the real death toll from these events is likely to be significantly higher than the figures they quote.",
      "That is because fatalities linked to heatwaves do not tend to be recorded as such in much of the world, especially in poorer nations which are most vulnerable.",
      "The study was carried out before the storms in Spain left dozens dead this week.",
      "The link between climate change and weather events is only possible because the two scientists who founded the WWA - Dr Otto and a Dutch climatologist called Geert Jan van Oldenborgh \u2013 pioneered a way to track global warming in catastrophic weather events.",
      "They knew that weather records showed that extreme weather events were becoming more intense. What\u2019s more, a huge body of peer-reviewed science explained how warming the atmosphere can intensify extreme weather. What was missing was the link between a single event to rising global temperatures.",
      "\u200cFor years forecasters have been using atmospheric models to predict future weather patterns. Otto and Oldenborgh repurposed the models to run repeated simulations to work out how likely a weather event was in the current climate.",
      "\u200cThey also created parallel simulations which explored how likely the same event was in a world in which the industrial revolution had never happened. These computer models stripped out the effects of the billions of tonnes of CO2 that humans have pumped into the atmosphere.",
      "\u200cThe calculations meant they could compare how likely the same event was with and without the 1.2C of global warming that the world has already experienced since the industrial revolution.",
      "\u201cThe massive death tolls we keep seeing in extreme weather shows we are not well prepared for 1.3\u00b0C of warming, let alone 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C\u201d, said Roop Singh, of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre which supports the WWA.",
      "She said today\u2019s study showed the need for all countries to build their resilience to climate change and warned: \u201cWith every fraction of a degree of warming, we will see more record-breaking events that push countries to the brink, no matter how prepared they are.\u201d",

      "Many have tried to answer that question, but so far all have failed. In October, a high-profile HBO documentary suggested that a Canadian bitcoin expert called Peter Todd was he. The only problem: he said he was not, and the crypto world largely shrugged it off.",
      "So, inevitably, ears pricked up across our newsroom - and the crypto world at large - when on Thursday a call went out that the mysterious creator of Bitcoin was to, finally, unmask himself at a press conference.",

      "Their voice, opinions and world view would be extremely influential on an industry with such a devoted and zealous fanbase.",
      "But the fascination also stems from the fact that, as the holder of more than one million bitcoins, Satoshi would be a multi-billionaire, not least because the price of the coins is currently close to an all-time high.",
      "Given that vast wealth, it was somewhat unusual to be asked by the organiser of Thursday\u2019s press conference to pay for my seat at his grand unveiling.",
      "A front row seat would be \u00a3100. It was another \u00a350 if I wanted unlimited questions. Organiser Charles Anderson even encouraged me to spend \u00a3500 in exchange for the privilege of interviewing \"Satoshi\" on stage.",

      "Centred on the city of Ashburn, which is 35 miles (56km) west of the US capital, there are more than 477 data centres in the state. This is by far the largest number in the US, with Texas in second place on 290, and California third with 283.",
      "In fact, some studies say that 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic goes through Ashburn and the surrounding area, which has been dubbed \u201cData Centre Alley\u201d.",
      "Thanks in large part to the continuing boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires more computing power, demand for data centres is rocketing. As a result, global data centre capacity is expected to double over the next five years, according to a recent study by business analysis firm Moody\u2019s.",
      "Ms Bolthouse and other environmentalists in Northern Virginia are opposed to the continuing expansion of the data centre sector in their region, saying it is already having a major negative impact on their quality of life.",
      "She points to new electricity cables being built over conservation land, parks and neighbourhoods, increased water demand, and the facilities\u2019 back-up diesel generators affecting air quality.",
      "Ms Bolthouse also cites the fact that households in Virginia and neighbouring Maryland are being expected to help pay for the electricity network upgrades that the data centres require.",
      "She and fellow campaigners are fighting back. \u201cWe\u2019re working directly on the ground, opposing each data centre application and working on the local zoning, and trying to educate our local planning commission and supervisors about the issues that we see. But we're also working at the state level.\u201d",
      "Similar campaigns against data centres are springing up all over the world, including in the Republic of Ireland, where such facilities use 21% of the country\u2019s electricity.",
      "\"Our main objections to data centres revolve around their potential negative impacts on our climate, their sustainability, and local infrastructure,\" says Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment. \"When data centres rely on fossil fuel, they potentially strain the electricity grid and can undermine national renewable energy commitments.\"",
      "The group is continuing to challenge plans for a new \u20ac1.2bn ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) data centre in County Clare on Ireland\u2019s west coast.",
      "Mr Lowes adds that while Friends of the Irish Environment would prefer to see data centre development halted altogether, there are various mitigations that might help, including sites prioritising renewable energy, and implementing energy and cooling efficiency measures.",
      "The big players in the global data centre industry are trying to allay people\u2019s concerns. This summer, for example, Microsoft launched its Data Center Community Pledge.",
      "Microsoft is promising that by next year it will procure 100% renewable energy globally. And that by 2030 it will \u201cachieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting\u201d, and become \u201cwater positive\u201d. The latter means that it aims for its data centres to return more water to the local supply than they use.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already uses recycled water for cooling in 20 of its 125 data centres around the world, and also says it will be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030.",
      "Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, which represents dozens of data centre operators including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, says that data centres are leading the way on clean energy use.",
      "\"For example, wind and solar capacity contracted to data centre providers and customers represented two-thirds of the total US corporate renewables market last year, and four of the top five purchasers of renewable energy in the US are companies that operate data centres,\" he says.",
      "\"The data centre industry is also unlocking greater energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users \u2013 everything from smart thermostats to grid-enhancing technologies require the digital infrastructure provided by data centres.\"",
      "The protests against data centres have also extended to South America, where campaigners say they have achieved successes.",
      "In Uruguay, for example, Google changed the design of a new facility now under construction. It was initially due to be water cooled, but the US giant switched to an air-cooled system.",
      "This followed protests in a country that has been experiencing droughts and a shortage of drinking water.",
      "\"Water use by Google in the initial proposal would have been equivalent to the daily consumption of drinking water by 55,000 people in our country,\" says Mar\u00eda Selva Ortiz of Friends of the Earth Uruguay.",
      "\"This threat to the right to water amidst a water crisis raised strong criticisms, leading Google to change the proposed technology to cool down its equipment, so the project was modified. Chillers will cool down with air instead of water.\u201d",
      "In Chile, meanwhile, Google has halted plans for a data centre over similar water use concerns.",
      "Back in Virginia, Ms Bolthouse says the firms need to do more to boost sustainability. In the long run, she says, it will be in the industry's own interests to improve data centres' environmental impact.",
      "\"What's going to happen if we continue with business as usual is that electrical prices are going to skyrocket for everybody, including the data centre industry - and that's their biggest bill, so that's going to impact them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe water scarcity issue is also going to impact them.",

      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",

      "However, the move is not as drastic as it sounds. Mr Botero\u2019s firm, an \u201cinnovation company\u201d, has designed the paint to be removable \u2013 once dry, you can peel it off like plastic wrap. If it works as intended, it shouldn\u2019t leave behind any marks or residue.",
      "Mr Botero had the idea for the product, called Unpaint, about five years ago and, initially, his investors weren\u2019t keen. \u201cThey said I was crazy,\u201d he recalls. Nevertheless, he insisted: \u201cPeople are looking for customisation in their lives.\u201d",
      "Glasst is just one of many firms that claim house paint can do more than look nice. Various products now on the market, their makers promise, will save you money, keep you comfortable during heatwaves, or transform your relationship with the walls of your home. But is it all too good to be true?",
      "Unpaint is due to launch in the US this November, and Mr Botero is convinced that there is a market for the stuff. He argues it will appeal to people living in rented accommodation, who can\u2019t make permanent changes to their decor.",
      "Glasst, unsurprisingly, declines to share details about how it makes the paint, but Mr Botero says it is a resin from a renewable source. I ask if he means trees and he confirms.",
      "Peelable paint already exists for car bodywork, but getting such a product to work reliably on softer home interiors is more challenging.",
      "There is a risk of damaging your existing, underlying paint when you eventually wrest Unpaint off your walls, but, if the permanent paint below is in good condition, this shouldn\u2019t happen, says Mr Botero.",

      "He mentions that Glasst is working on other coatings with unusual properties \u2013 including \u201cThermglasst\u201d, an insulating resin due to launch next year. Mr Botero claims that less than a millimetre of this coating will provide the same insulating effect as 40 millimetres of foam.",
      "There\u2019s no independent validation of that claim just yet, but there are already a range of insulating paints on the market that promise to reduce your heating bills and, it is fair to note, they have not always performed well in scientific evaluations.",
      "In 2019, Richard Fitton of the University of Salford and colleagues published a paper in which they investigated the efficacy of six thermal paints available on the UK market at the time. In short, they found that claims that such paints could reduce heating bills by up to 20% or 25% were impossible to validate.",
      "First, the researchers coated boards with the paints, which allowed them to measure the coatings\u2019 thermal resistance, or insulating values. Then, the team calculated the reduction in heating costs you would expect after applying each of these paints to the interior of a typical Victorian terraced house.",
      "The biggest cost saving measured was a mere 2.9%, and, given the price of the paints in question, homeowners would potentially have to wait centuries or even up to a millennium \u2013 at 2019 prices \u2013 before they would recoup the decorating fees in terms of reduced heating costs.",
      "\u201cIf someone brought me a paint that could save me 25% of my energy bill, it would be on my wall by the weekend,\u201d says Prof Fitton. He adds that he is currently working on a follow-up paper to the 2019 study, and would also be open to testing Thermglasst, or any other insulating paint, in the future.",
      "Paints that help to keep your house cool might be more effective. For years, researchers have pursued the idea of improving the reflectivity of paint on exterior walls or roofs, since this could help keep buildings cool on hot, sunny days. Such weather is becoming ever more common due to climate change.",
      "The principle is as old as the hills \u2013 consider the white painted houses of the Mediterranean. But paints designed to be significantly more reflective than standard white paint could heighten the effect. i2Cool in Hong Kong is one of several firms marketing such a product at present.",
      "In their case, the paint contains tiny nanoparticles inspired by the extremely reflective body of the Saharan silver ant \u2013 which must naturally cope with baking sunshine.",
      "Martin Zhu, chief executive and co-founder, says the paint made by i2Cool was tested on the roof of a shopping mall in Hong Kong \u2013 but only on one of its two buildings, in order to find out whether there was a noticeable effect in terms of reducing the costs of running that building\u2019s air conditioning (AC).",
      "\u201cWe used a power meter to measure the energy consumption of the AC system,\u201d says Dr Zhu. The cost of running the AC duly fell in the painted building, by 40%, he adds.",
      "Dr Zhu first began working on the paint while a doctoral student, and he mentions that early versions made around 2017 contained silver, which made it very expensive \u2013 more than $100,000 just to cover a small area. Years of development later, it now costs around $10 per square metre of coverage. It also now comes in a variety of light colours, including grey, yellow and green.",
      "Researchers have noted that highly reflective coatings for passive cooling applications need to be resistant to dirt and soiling, for example, to avoid their efficacy dropping overt time. And glare from ultra-reflective roofs risks heating up nearby darker structures, a 2020 paper suggested.",
      "The paint from i2Cool does not contain heavy metals and uses a water-based emulsion, and while it is not biodegradable, it can be recycled, says Dr Zhu.",
      "The company\u2019s latest major project is the Dubai Mall. The roof of this sprawling complex \u2013 the largest mall in the world by total area \u2013 will eventually be fully coated with the paint. A 1,000 sq m section has been completed to date.",
      "While not yet available in Europe, that could change, says Dr Zhu. \u201cWe are discussing with some distributors in the UK,\u201d he says.",

      "It\u2019s not hard to see why he is a deeply polarising figure.",
      "Throughout the campaign, Trump used incendiary rhetoric \u2013 making crass jokes and threatening vengeance against his political enemies.",
      "His message on the economy touched a chord",
      "Few people have a middle ground when it comes to Trump. Most of the voters I spoke to during the course of this campaign said they wished he would \u201cshut his potty mouth\u201d \u2013 but they were able to look past it.",
      "Instead, they focused on the question he asked at every rally. \u201cAre you better off now than you were two years ago?\u201d",
      "So many people who voted for Donald Trump told me again and again that they felt the economy was much better when he was in office and they were sick of trying to make ends meet. Although much of the cause of inflation was due to outside forces such as the Covid-19 pandemic, they blamed the outgoing administration.",
      "Voters were also deeply concerned about illegal immigration which had reached record levels under Biden. They usually didn\u2019t express racist views or believe that migrants were eating people\u2019s pets, as Trump and his supporters had claimed. They just wanted much stronger border enforcement.",
      "'America first' for a second Trump term",
      "\u201cAmerica first\u201d was another one of Trump\u2019s slogans that really seemed to strike a chord with voters. All over the country I heard people \u2013 on the left and right - complaining about billions of dollars being spent on supporting Ukraine when they thought that money would be much better spent at home.",
      "In the end, they just couldn\u2019t vote for Harris, who served as Biden\u2019s vice-president for four years. They believed it would be more of the same, and they wanted change.",

      "It is perhaps one of the ironies of this election that the candidate who most represented change was himself in power just four years ago. But there are several differences between then and now.",
      "When he first came into power in 2016, he was a political outsider, and, at least for a while, he surrounded himself with veteran political advisers and staff who showed him the ropes and constrained his actions. Now he doesn\u2019t seem that interested in playing by the rules of the game.",
      "Many of these same advisers and staff have spoken out \u2013 calling him a \u201cliar\u201d, a \u201cfascist\u201d and \u201cunfit\u201d. They have cautioned that if he surrounds himself with loyalists, which he is expected to do, that there will be no one to restrain him from his more extreme ideas.",
      "When he left office, he faced a litany of criminal charges related to his role in the Capitol riots, how he handled documents pertaining to national security, and hush money payments to a porn star.",
      "But since the Supreme Court ruled that the president has total immunity from prosecution for official acts in office, it will be an uphill battle for any prosecutor to charge him during the next administration.",
      "And as president, he could instruct his justice department to drop the federal charges against him relating to the 6 January riots so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about a jail sentence. At the same time, he could pardon hundreds of people sentenced to prison for their part in the Capitol Riots.",
      "In the end, voters were presented with two versions of America.",
      "Donald Trump told them that their country was a failing nation that only he could Make Great Again.",
      "Meanwhile, Harris cautioned that if Trump was elected, American democracy itself would face an existential threat. That remains to be seen. But what Trump said himself during the campaign has not exactly assuaged people\u2019s fears.",
      "He has heaped praise on authoritarian leaders like Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, whom he said were \u201cat the top of their game, whether you like it or not\u201d.",
      "He has talked about trying to silence critics in the press. Just days before the election, he also made comments that implied he wouldn\u2019t mind if members of the media were killed.",
      "And he has continued to amplify conspiracy theories and unfounded claims of election fraud \u2013 even though the election ultimately led to his victory.",
      "Now, voters will find how much of what he said during the campaign was just loose talk - \u201cTrump being Trump\u201d. And remember: it\u2019s not just Americans who have to confront the reality of a second Trump term.",
      "The rest of the world will now discover what \u201cAmerica First\u201d really means. From the global economic consequences of 20% tariffs that he has proposed on US imports to the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East that he has vowed to end \u2013 regardless of which side wins.",

      "The Olympic steeplechaser was stabbed to death on New Year\u2019s Eve in the town of Eldoret, known as a top training centre for athletes.",
      "\u201cYour actions were cruel to a defenceless person whose life you cut short,\u201d Justice Reuben Nyakundi told Peter Ushuru Khalumi and David Ekai Lokere during the sentencing hearing in the High Court in Eldoret.",
      "Kiplagat\u2019s murder shocked people in Kenya, which has seen the killing of a number of other elite athletes in recent years.",
      "The judge said that Khalumi and Lokere had followed Kiplagat, who was in his car, and then CCTV footage showed that they had intentionally killed him in a premeditated act. The exact motive for the murder was not clear but at the time of the arrests the police had said it was robbery.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 01:55:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Benjamin Netanyahu says there is a \"crisis of trust\" between him and Yoav Gallant, and replaces him with Israel Katz.",
    "story": [
      "Protests have erupted in Israel after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired the country's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.",
      "Netanyahu said a \"crisis of trust\" between the two leaders led to his decision, adding that his trust in Gallant had \"eroded\" in recent months and Foreign Minister Israel Katz would step in to replace him.",
      "Gallant said his removal was due to disagreement on three issues, including his belief that it is possible to get the remaining hostages back from Gaza if Israel makes \"painful concessions\" which it \"can bear\".",
      "Many protesters on the streets were calling for Netanyahu to resign, and demanding the new defence minister prioritise a hostage deal.",
      "Netanyahu and Gallant have long had a divisive working relationship. During the past year, there have been reports of shouting matches between the two men over Israel\u2019s war strategy.",
      "The former defence minister has also been unhappy at plans to continue to allow Israel\u2019s Ultra Orthodox citizens to be exempt from serving in the military.",
      "Months before the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, Netanyahu had fired Gallant over political differences, before reinstating him following major public outcry.",
      "But on Tuesday Netanyahu said: \"In the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and the minister of defence\".",
      "He said although there had been trust and \"fruitful work\" in the first months of the war, \"during the last months this trust cracked\".",
      "Netanyahu added that \"significant gaps were discovered between me and Gallant in the management of the campaign\".",
      "These were \"accompanied by statements and actions that contradict the decisions of the government,\" he added.",
      "Following the news, Gallant posted on social media that the \"security of the state of Israel was and will always remain the mission of my life\".",
      "He later released a full statement on Tuesday night saying his removal from office had been \"the result of disagreement on three issues\".",
      "He believed there should be no exceptions for military service,  that a national inquiry was needed to learn lessons, and the hostages should be brought back as soon as possible.",
      "In reference to the hostages, he said: \"I determine that it is possible to achieve this goal. It requires painful concessions, which the state of Israel can carry and the IDF can bear.\"",
      "One of those protesting following the announcement, Yair Amit, said Netanyahu is endangering the whole country and called on the prime minister to \"step down from his office and to let serious people lead Israel\".",
      "Some protesters lit fires on the Ayalon Highway and blocked traffic in both directions, according to Israeli media.",
      "A group representing the families of people taken hostage by Hamas in its 7 October attack also condemned Netanyahu's dismissal of Gallant, calling it a continuation of efforts to \"torpedo\" a release deal.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum called on the incoming defence minister to \u201cexpress an explicit commitment to the end of the war and to carry out a comprehensive deal for the immediate return of all the abductees\u201d.",
      "Around 100 hostages out of 251 taken by Hamas on 7 October 2023 remain unaccounted for more than a year into the war.",
      "His replacement Katz is seen as even more hawkish in terms of military strategy.",
      "Another Netanyahu ally, Gideon Sa'ar - who previously held no cabinet portfolio- will become the new foreign minister.",
      "Gallant's removal will come into effect in 48 hours. The appointment of the new ministers requires the approval of the government and then the Knesset.",
      "Netanyahu first fired Gallant in March 2023 following their disagreement over controversial plans to overhaul the justice system.",
      "But he was forced to retract the sacking following massive public protests in several cities in Israel - an event that became known as \"Gallant Night.\"",
      "In May this year, Gallant voiced open frustration at the government\u2019s failure to address the question of a post-war plan for Gaza. Gallant wanted Netanyahu to declare publicly that Israel has no plans to take over civilian and military rule in Gaza.",
      "It was a rare public sign of divisions within Israel's war cabinet over the direction of the military campaign.",
      "\u201cSince October, I have been raising this issue consistently in the cabinet,\u201d Gallant said, \u201cand have received no response\".",
      "Netanyahu responded by saying that he was \"not ready to exchange Hamastan for Fatahstan,\" in reference to rival Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah.",
      "Responding to Gallant's removal on Tuesday night, members of Israel's political opposition parties called for protests from the public.",
      "Gallant\u2019s dismissal also takes place on the day of the presidential election in the US- Israel\u2019s key backer in its war in Gaza - a timing noted by several Israeli media outlets.",
      "Gallant was viewed as having a much better relationship with the White House than Netanyahu.",
      "A representative for the White House's National Security Council said on Tuesday: \"Minister Gallant has been an important partner on all matters related to the defence of Israel. As close partners, we will continue to work collaboratively with Israel\u2019s next minister of defence.\"",
      "Observers note that Gallant's removal also comes at a time where Netanyahu is under pressure by far-right politicians to pass a bill which would have continued to allow Israel's ultra-Orthodox citizens to be exempt from serving in the military. Gallant had been a high-profile opponent of the bill.",

      "Of course, in the merry-go-round world of Israeli politics, no-one will be shocked if this is not the last we hear from Gallant.",
      "He has been sacked as defence minister once before, back in March 2023.",
      "On that occasion, along with many high-ranking military and former military officials, he was unhappy with Netanyahu\u2019s controversial plans to overhaul the judicial system.",
      "His dismissal led to tens of thousands of Israelis taking to the streets calling for him to be reinstated.",
      "After just a few days, Netanyahu was forced to back down and return Gallant to his position.",
      "On Tuesday night, as news broke that he had been sacked again, there were again protests in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, but not on the same scale.",
      "Gallant belongs to the same political party as Netanyahu, Likud, and could one day challenge his leadership in any future elections.",
      "But the fact he has been given his marching orders now suggests the prime minister is feeling strong.",
      "As has been the case for the past year, it is Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader, its most Machiavellian and successful political operator, who is calling the shots."

    "story": [
      "For the first time, an Algerian author has won France\u2019s top literary award, the Goncourt, with a searing account of his country\u2019s 1990s civil war.",
      "Kamel Daoud\u2019s novel Houris tells of Algeria\u2019s blood-soaked \u201cdark decade\u201d, in which up to 200,000 people are estimated to have been killed in massacres blamed on Islamists or the army.",
      "The heroine Fajr (Dawn in Arabic) has survived having her throat cut by Islamist fighters - she has a smile-like scar on her neck and needs a speaking tube to communicate - and tells her story to the baby girl she carries inside her.",
      "Written in French, the book \u201cgives voice to the suffering of a dark period in Algeria, particularly the suffering of women,\u201d the Goncourt committee said.",
      "\u201cIt shows how literature\u2026 can trace another path for memory, next to the historical account.\u201d",
      "The irony is that few in Algeria are likely to read it. The book has no Algerian publisher;  the French publisher Gallimard has been excluded from the Algiers Book Fair, and news of Daoud\u2019s Goncourt success has - a day on - still not been reported in the Algerian media.",
      "Worse, Daoud - who now lives in Paris - could even face criminal charges for speaking of the civil war.",
      "A 2005 \u201creconciliation\u201d law makes it a crime punishable by jail to \u201cinstrumentalise the wounds of the national tragedy\u201d.",
      "According to Daoud, the effect is to make the civil war - which traumatised the entire country - a non-subject.",
      "\u201cMy 14 year-old daughter did not believe me when I told her about what had happened,  because the war is not taught in schools,\u201d Daoud told Le Monde newspaper.",
      "\u201cI cut out some of the worst scenes I wrote. Not because they were untrue, but because people would not believe me.\u201d",
      "Daoud, 54, had first-hand experience of the massacres because he was a journalist at the time working for the Quotidien d\u2019Oran newspaper. In interviews he has described the ghastly routine of counting corpses, then seeing his count altered - up or down - by the authorities, depending on the message they wanted to be given.",
      "\u201cYou develop a routine,\u201d he said. \u201cCome back, write your piece, then get drunk.\u201d",
      "He worked as a columnist for many years, but gradually fell foul of the Algerian government because of his refusal to toe the line.",
      "He is strongly critical of what he sees as the official \u201cinstrumentalisation\u201d of the 1954-1962 war of independence against France; and of what he sees as the continuing subjugation of women in Algerian society.",
      "\u201cIn a way the Islamists lost the civil war militarily, but they won politically,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhat I hope is that my book will make people think about the price of freedom, especially for women. And in Algeria, that it will encourage people to confront all of our history, not fetishise one part over the rest.\u201d",
      "Daoud has written two previous novels, one of which - the much-praised Meursault Investigation - was a rewriting of Albert Camus\u2019s The Stranger and was shortlisted for the Goncourt in 2015.",
      "In 2020 the author moved to Paris, \u201cexiled by the force of things\u201d, and took French nationality. \u201cAll Algerians are Franco-Algerians,\u201d he has said. \u201cEither out of hate or out of love.\u201d",
      "In Algeria he is a divisive figure. His enemies regard him as a traitor who sold his soul to France, while others recognise him as a literary genius of whom the country should be proud.",
      "In his post-award press conference, Daoud himself said that it was only by coming to France that he was able to write Houris.",
      "\u201cFrance gave me the freedom to write. It is a land of refuge for writers,\u201d he said.  \u201cTo write you need three things. A table, a chair and a country. I have all three.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A week after flash floods hit eastern Spain, recriminations are flying over who was to blame for the country\u2019s worst natural disaster in living memory amid angry scenes on the part of those affected.",
      "An initial image of cross-party unity has been replaced by disputes over which institutions had jurisdiction in the disaster areas where at least 218 people lost their lives.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the floods, Valencia regional leader Carlos Maz\u00f3n of the conservative People\u2019s Party (PP) welcomed Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and thanked him for his government\u2019s support.",
      "It was an unusual sight in the context of Spain\u2019s deeply polarised politics, with Maz\u00f3n even calling S\u00e1nchez \"dear prime minister\".",
      "Valencia's regional leader has faced criticism for taking around 12 hours to respond to a red weather warning by Spain's national meteorological office (Aemet) on 29 October and issue an alert directly to people\u2019s phones, by which time the flood was already causing enormous damage.",
      "However, the national leader of the PP, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, questioned the information provided by the Aemet, which is supervised by the central government. He also complained that the prime minister's administration had not co-ordinated with the regional government.",
      "In the days since, pressure has mounted on Maz\u00f3n, with many commentators and political adversaries calling on him to resign for his actions on that day, as well as for eliminating the Valencia Emergency Unit (UVE) on taking office last year.",
      "In response, he has taken a more confrontational approach, in line with that of his party boss.",
      "That has included blaming the CHJ hydrographic agency, which is controlled by Madrid, for allegedly activating and then de-activating an alert on the day in question.",
      "\u201cIf the CHJ had re-activated the hydrological alert, the alarm message would have been sent immediately\u201d by the regional government, Maz\u00f3n said.",
      "The CHJ has responded by explaining that it provides data on rainfall and related matters but that it does not issue alerts of this kind.",

      "The head of the military emergency unit (UME), Javier Marcos, responded by saying that protocol dictated that the regional government had to request any such support.",
      "\u201cI can have 1,000 men at the door of the emergency but I can\u2019t go in, legally, without authorisation from the head of the emergency,\u201d he said, referring to the Valencia leader.",
      "Maz\u00f3n\u2019s comments about the military reportedly enraged the defence minister, Margarita Robles, who expressed her anger during a crisis meeting of ministers with King Felipe on Monday.",
      "Meanwhile, the political situation has been further complicated after calls by N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o for the prime minister to declare a national state of emergency, which would centralise management of the crisis in Madrid, wresting powers from Valencia\u2019s regional government.",
      "The leader of the far-right Vox party, Santiago Abascal, has also backed such a measure, which has been ruled out by the government.",
      "\u201cS\u00e1nchez is the one responsible for not activating all the state resources when lives could have been saved,\u201d he said, denouncing the \u201cevil and incompetence\u201d of the administration.",
      "The king, S\u00e1nchez and Maz\u00f3n were all hit by the blowback of public anger over the handling of the tragedy on Sunday, when people in the Valencian town of Paiporta, the worst hit by the floods, threw mud and jeered at them, calling them \u201cmurderers\u201d.",
      "As the scenes became increasingly violent, the prime minister\u2019s security detail led him away to his car. Maz\u00f3n stayed near the king and Queen Letizia, who both engaged with some of the local people in an effort to reassure them that everything possible was being done to help.",
      "While the wisdom of that visit has been widely questioned, Maz\u00f3n has since presented a \u20ac31.4bn proposal for the reconstruction of the flood-devastated areas, to be financed by the central government.",
      "S\u00e1nchez, meanwhile, has announced a separate initial aid package worth \u20ac10.6bn.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 00:00:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Will the new generation of Nigerian politicians deliver the change in attitudes that many had hoped for?",
    "story": [
      "Nigerian politician Alex Ikwechegh has caused outrage after he was caught on video slapping and verbally abusing a taxi driver delivering food to his house.",
      "\"Do you know who I am?... I can make you disappear in this whole country, and nothing will happen,\" Ikwechegh was heard saying in the video that went viral.",
      "The altercation apparently started after the driver asked Ikwechegh to go outside to collect the food, rather than him taking it inside.",
      "Shocked Nigerians shared the clip widely, forcing Ikwechegh, a member of the opposition All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) party who represents the south-eastern town of Aba in the House of Representatives, to issue a formal apology - a stark contrast to his arrogant and intimidating tone in the video.",
      "Unfortunately, it is common in Nigeria for officials and other \"big men\" to use their power to intimidate ordinary citizens with the familiar phrase: \"Do you know who I am?\" - a reminder of the untouchable status they believe they hold.",
      "Politicians, including many MPs, often also intimidate the public by travelling in large convoys, with police escorts and blaring sirens.",
      "Their convoys are given priority over regular traffic, with security officers sometimes reacting aggressively towards anyone who fails to make way for them.",
      "But this latest case is especially disappointing because Ikwechegh, at 42, is part of a younger generation of politicians.",
      "The \"Not Too Young to Run\" campaign was started a few years ago by civil society organisations to encourage more young people to become involved in Nigerian politics.",
      "With 70% of the country's population under 35, the initiative aimed to lower the age limits for running for office, allowing younger Nigerians to bring new ideas and a fresh approach to leadership.",
      "It succeeded in 2018, reducing the minimum age requirements for various offices and raising the number of young candidates from 6% to 27% in just one year.",
      "The age of running for the House of Representatives - the lower chamber of parliament - was reduced from 30 to 25, the Senate and governorship from 35 to 30, and president from 40 to 30.",
      "Since Nigeria's median age is only 18, many hoped younger leaders would break the old patterns of oppression and entitlement.",
      "But Ikwechegh's actions exhibit some of the same old behaviours that many young Nigerians had hoped would be left behind.",
      "Sadly, his case isn't unique. Two years ago, Nigeria's then-youngest senator, Elisha Abbo, who was 41 at the time, was filmed slapping a shop assistant after accusing her of \"insulting\" him.",
      "He threatened her with arrest, and even called over a police officer to carry it out.",
      "The incident was caught on CCTV and eventually led to Abbo, who is no longer a senator after losing elections last year, apologising. But it exposed just how deeply rooted this culture of abuse of power is.",
      "All this has left many Nigerians wondering if younger leaders are falling into the same traps as the older generation.",
      "The situation takes me back to my boarding school days, where senior students regularly bullied juniors.",
      "As juniors, my classmates and I would eagerly talk about what we'd do once it was our turn to be seniors, picturing the punishments we'd hand down to those younger than us.",
      "It felt like a right, something to look forward to - a small comfort amid the hardships of being a junior - that someday, we would be the ones with the power, not the ones on the receiving end.",
      "But by the time we made it to senior year, the school introduced new rules against bullying, and we felt robbed.",
      "We had waited our turn, and now that right was being taken from us. The school stuck with its new rules although many seniors still found ways to circumvent them.",
      "It feels like this same cycle is playing out on a national level.",
      "When a 42-year-old politician, active on social media, can slap a taxi driver - three times - on camera without a second thought, it forces us to wonder if the younger generation of politicians are simply waiting to inherit, rather than break, the cycle of privilege, whether they truly want a fresh start or are just waiting for their turn to wield power without any restraint.",
      "Nigeria's House of Representatives has referred Ikwechegh to its Ethics and Privileges Committee after he was accused of bringing it into disrepute.",
      "He has also been arraigned in court on charges of \"threats, assaults, and abuse of public office\".",

      "In the case of Byron, NASCAR ruled that Ross Chastain and Austin Dillon both ran interference to help fellow Chevrolet driver Byron not lose any position on the track that would cost him a spot in the championship.",
      "Elton Sawyer, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said the sanctioning body considered suspending the drivers as well as taking action against manufacturers Chevrolet and Toyota. He said there was nothing in the rulebook that would call for the manufacturers to be punished, but NASCAR planned to meet with the leaders of Ford, Chevy and Toyota to discuss the situation.",
      "Because the penalties were issued the week of the season finale, the teams have until Wednesday afternoon to ask for an expedited appeal. The appeals would likely be heard Thursday.",

      "Dillon was fined $100,000, as was Richard Childress Racing. One-race suspensions were given to team executive Keith Rodden, crew chief Justin Alexander and spotter Brandon Benesch. The team also lost 50 points. Richard Childress Racing also said it would appeal.",
      "Wallace was fined $100,000, as was 23XI. The one-race suspensions went to team executive Dave Rogers, crew chief Robert Barker and spotter Freddie Kraft. The team also lost 50 points.",

      "Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson's historic \"Thriller\" album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.",
      "Jones' publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family.",
      "\"Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones' passing,\" the family said in a statement. \"And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.",
      "\"He is truly one of a kind and we will miss him dearly; we take comfort and immense pride in knowing that the love and joy, that were the essence of his being, was shared with the world through all that he created. Through his music and his boundless love, Quincy Jones' heart will beat for eternity.\"",
      "Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary music catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song.",
      "For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who didn't own at least one record with his name on it or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who didn't have some connection to him.",
      "Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for \"Roots\" and \"In the Heat of the Night,\" organized President Bill Clinton's first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of \"We Are the World,\" the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa.",
      "Lionel Richie, who co-wrote \"We Are the World\" and was among its featured singers, would call Jones \"the master orchestrator.\"",
      "Jones' work with Michael Jackson",
      "In a career that began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 RPM, the top honors he received are likely the ones for his productions with Jackson: \"Off the Wall,\" \"Thriller\" and \"Bad\" were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones' versatility and imagination helped set off Jackson's explosive talent as he transformed from child star to the \"King of Pop.\" On such classic tracks as \"Billie Jean\" and \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,\" Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For \"Thriller,\" some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing \"Beat It\" and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.",
      "\"Thriller\" sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles' \"Greatest Hits 1971-1975\" among others as the best-selling album of all time.",
      "\"If an album doesn't do well, everyone says 'it was the producers fault'; so if it does well, it should be your 'fault,' too,\" Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. \"The tracks don't just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.\"",
      "The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography \"Q\", including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for \"Roots.\" He also received France's Legion d'Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, \"Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones\" and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author.",
      "Music as Jones' savior",
      "Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, once telling Oprah Winfrey that \"There are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don't. Nothing's in between.\" Jones' mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem \"senseless\" for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting.",
      "\"They nailed my hand to a fence with a switchblade, man,\" he told the AP in 2018, showing a scar from his childhood.",
      "Music saved him. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano.",
      "\"I went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,\" he wrote in his autobiography. \"That's where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.\"",
      "Within a few years, he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band.",
      "\"We had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,\" Jones later told Musician magazine. \"That's when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.\"",
      "Jones, the businessman",
      "As a music executive, he overcame racial barriers by becoming a vice president at Mercury Records in the early '60s. In 1971, he became the first Black musical director for the Academy Awards ceremony. The first movie he produced, \"The Color Purple,\" received 11 Oscar nominations in 1986 but, to his great disappointment, no wins.",
      "In a partnership with Time Warner, he created Quincy Jones Entertainment, which included the pop-culture magazine Vibe and Qwest Broadcasting. The company was sold for $270 million in 1999.",
      "\"My philosophy as a businessman has always come from the same roots as my personal credo: Take talented people on their own terms and treat them fairly and with respect, no matter who they are or where they come from,\" Jones wrote in his autobiography.",
      "Jones, the epitome of versatility",
      "He was at ease with virtually every form of American music, whether setting Sinatra's \"Fly Me to the Moon\" to a punchy, swinging rhythm and wistful flute or opening his production of Charles' soulful \"In the Heat of the Night\" with a lusty tenor sax solo. He worked with jazz giants (Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, Duke Ellington), rappers (Snoop Dogg, LL Cool J), crooners (Sinatra, Tony Bennett), pop singers (Lesley Gore) and rhythm and blues stars (Chaka Khan, rapper and singer Queen Latifah).",
      "On \"We are the World\" alone, performers included Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen. He co-wrote hits for Jackson - \"P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing)\" - and Donna Summer - \"Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger) - and had songs sampled by Tupac Shakur, Kanye West and other rappers. He even composed the theme song for the sitcom \"Sanford and Son.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 10:11:23 -0500",
    "summary": "The former child actor who grew up to play Roman Roy, the filterless, fast-talking middle child in \"Succession,\" is now playing a rudderless man-child in Jesse Eisenberg's poignant comedy, \"A Real Pain.\"",
    "story": [
      "For 42-year-old Kieran Culkin, visiting the building in Manhattan's Yorkville neighborhood where he spent the first eight years of his life brings back unusual memories. \"I remember my mom baking a cake and it would come out slanted because the whole apartment was on a slant,\" he said. \"We used to put cars on one end of the kitchen and let go and see them roll!",
      "\"We lived in a tight space where it was just seven of us running around. It was like a sort of little wolf-pack mentality,\" he said.",
      "His father \"Kit,\" himself a former actor, and mother Patricia, a telephone operator, raised their seven kids in a four-room apartment. Kieran came fourth in the birth order. \"Whenever the door would open to let the kids in, I used to stand aside and make sure, and I used to count to make sure all six of them got in before I got in,\" he said. \"That's how I remember growing up, too, was I couldn't fall asleep until they all fell asleep. Like, I only existed because they did around me.\"",
      "He got into acting because neighbors of theirs ran an off-off-Broadway theater on the Upper East Side: \"And they knew that there was this family that had a bunch of kids. And whenever they needed a kid they were like, 'Uhm, you know, we might need a kid for this show.' And my parents were more or less like, 'Okay, yeah, what gender? What age? We got a whole bunch.'\"",
      "Soon enough, Macaulay, two years older than Kieran, became world famous as the star of \"Home Alone.\" Kieran also had a small role in that movie, and a year later played Steve Martin's son in \"Father of the Bride.\"",
      "Kieran was cute and charismatic. But making it as a grownup actor meant learning how to act. He says when he was 18 and starring in the movie \"Igby Goes Down,\" the director, Burr Steers, wanted to break him of his \"kid acting habits\" \u2013 to unlearn the tricks that had served him so well as a child.",
      "\"He really didn't like kid actors, and he was like, 'You still have a few bad habits,'\" Culkin said. \"He was like, 'You're doing something with your eyes.' He would say, 'Soulful eyes.' Or sometimes he would say, you know, 'That was Nickelodeon,' or something like that. 'You're doing kid stuff.'\"",
      "And when that didn't work, \"He bought me a six-pack of beer and he goes, 'I want you to take this beer and do the scene in front of the mirror.' And I was like, 'I don't think I can do that \u2026 I'm gonna be too self-conscious.' He goes, 'That's what the beer's for.'\"",
      "Culkin got praise for \"Igby.\" But he wasn't sure he wanted to keep acting. For one thing, he was worried about becoming famous. \"Definitely. I feel like any rational person [who] got to experience fame second-hand, they would not pursue it. It's not a nice thing.\"",
      "His brother, Macauley, has become an international movie star at a young age. \"And I saw that and went, 'Oh, I got it. That's awful. Let's never do that!'\"",
      "Kieran worked on stage and only sporadically on film for years, before landing the part he's best known for: Roman Roy, the filterless, fast-talking middle child scheming to inherit a media empire in \"Succession.\"",
      "Even as a member of the fictional Roy family, though, Culkin's real family played a role. Back in 2008, his older sister, Dakota Culkin, was struck and killed by an automobile. He said, \"After a couple seasons on 'Succession,' I realized there was some stuff that Roman did that I was like, 'Oh, that's my sister. That was her sense of humor.' She could find exactly what the right thing to make fun of you was that would get to you, but be really funny and make the room laugh. That was her.\"",
      "Sixteen years later, the loss of his sister is still devastating. \"I only knew who I was because of who my siblings are,\" Kieran said. \"So, to lose one was losing a big piece of myself. Losing one of my favorite people in the world, it doesn't get easier. But you get used to it.\"",
      "Culkin's newest project is also about family. In the movie \"A Real Pain,\" he and Jesse Eisenberg (who wrote and directed) play cousins on a trip to Poland to see where their late beloved grandmother was raised \u2013 and the concentration camp she survived.",
      "Culkin's character, Benji, is a charming but rudderless man-child \u2026 a contrast to Eisenberg's straitlaced family man.",
      "Asked why he connected with the role, Culkin replied, \"I don't really know what it was with me, but I went, I instantly knew who this guy was. I understood the dynamic, and I really wanted to play.\"",
      "Describing the character, Culkin has said, \"I'm one quick little misstep away from being that person.\"",
      "\"That's good! I said that? Good!\" he laughed. \"I feel like I easily could've gone down that path. There was something in that that I recognized as myself, but I'm not that guy at all. But I think I'm worried that I easily could've become that guy, [had I not] married, kids, or figured out how to, you know, get my s*** together.\"",
      "Indeed, Culkin is not \"that guy.\" He's been married to his wife Jazz for 11 years. The couple has two children.",
      "Asked what he likes about being a dad, Culkin said, \"Oh, man, everything. Everything except dinnertime. Dinnertime's a terror. I've seen some kids sit and eat dinner, it's great. My kids sit and eat breakfast, they'll eat lunch, but dinner is just throwing things around the house, and it's very stressful.\"",
      "Kieran Culkin may be at the top of his game, but he says he's still figuring it out.",
      "\"There's different versions of success. I think for many years success, for me, was, like, working on projects I really like [that] nobody really sees. Fly under the radar, but keep getting to do what I do. And now I'm like, 'Well, now I gotta figure out how to do the jobs I want but also make money.' It's really hard to find the way to do that!\"",

      "\"The barriers of entry are so much higher to get into the haunted house attraction business \u2014 rules, regulations and the expense to get in, even what people perceive as entertainment,\" said Billy Messina, co-creator of Netherworld, an attraction that has been scaring people in Stone Mountain, Georgia, for nearly 30 years. \"A bunch of teenagers that say 'Boo!' \u2014 that won't fly anymore,\" Messina told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Unlike the haunted house fundraisers run by civic organizations such as the United States Junior Chamber, also known as the Jaycees, Netherworld is among the dozen or so haunted houses that can be likened to full-scale Broadway productions. And, unlike the neighborhood house that is haunted by volunteers, these Halloween attractions are professional outfits staffed throughout the year, even though the window to turn a profit is far smaller, just a month or two around Halloween.",
      "\"Our revenue cycle is very short, the lion's share of our revenue is in a 2- to 3-month window,\" said Chris Stafford, CEO and founding partner of Thirteenth Floor Entertain Group. Based in Denver, Colorado, Thirteenth Floor operates 32 attractions including haunted houses and Halloween festivals across the country, selling hundreds of thousands of tickets each year.",

      "Halloween costume chain Spirit bet on the pop-up model and won",
      "\"Most of our properties we hold year-round, so we have an annual operating plan to make sure the revenue we expect to see is going to come in,\" said Stafford, who worked in the banking industry for 12 years before turning what had been a beloved hobby into a full-time career.",
      "\"It's a tough business with a staff and a mortgage that is open all year long, and then you have 20 to 30 days to make sure you get to cover all of those basic expenses. It's a challenge,\" said Messina, who started out in the film industry as a makeup and special effects artist. Still, \"it's pretty amazing to be able to do this for a living,\" he added.",
      "Both share a passion for haunted houses that took hold in childhood.",
      "\"I worked at a local haunted house with a friend from high school. I just really loved everything about it, some of my best memories are from there,\" said Stafford, recalling his experiences as a 15-year-old working at a family-run haunted house in Denver.",
      "Growing up in New York City, Messina recalls seeing commercials on television for haunted houses on the Jersey Shore and yearning but unable to go.",
      "Like many other businesses, Messina and Stafford list labor as a huge challenge.",
      "With a full-time staff of about 15, Netherworld also hires about 500 seasonal workers as parking attendants, food and customer service employees and, of course, to scare folks. \"For new employees, the hiring push starts sometime in August, and really kicks up in mid-September. We have college students all the way up to white-collar professionals that just want to be part of it,\" said Messina.",
      "Netherworld's base pay starts at $8.50 an hour. \"People aren't there for the money, working as a scare actor,\" said Messina.",
      "Thirteenth Floor has full-time staff in marketing and finance, and \"then comes the season and we ramp up and literally hire thousands of people to work \u2014 probably the greatest challenge is staffing up a workforce that large in that short a time,\" offered Stafford. \"Most of our scare actors are not professional actors, but interested in learning,\" he added of the positions which pay just above minimum wage.",
      "A large percentage of the seasonal workforce returns each year, both men relayed.",
      "Ticket sales keep Netherworld afloat, and outside factors including the weather and sports can have an impact beyond Messina's control. \"Rain is devastating to attendance, or if the [Atlanta] Braves are in the [National Baseball League] playoffs,\" he offers as examples. \"Concessions and the gift shop are not enough to keep the lights on. We don't lose money on that stuff, but they are by no means a cash cow,\" Messina noted.",
      "Both men listed Netflix as the primary competition. \"Just getting people off the couch \u2014 it's hard,\" Stafford said, adding that Thirteenth Floor strives to give people a reason to come together socially. \"Too much of our lives are lived digitally, behind the screen,\" he said.",

Those onions were pulled from affected McDonald's locations and Taylor Farms recalled yellow-slivered onions sent to other food service operators.",
      "There have been 90 cases reported in 13 states, and Colorado had 26 people who reported the illness and had it traced back to this outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says most people recover from E. coli, but some people have seen severe complications.

      "Smith was a frequent McDonald's customers",
      "JC Smith and his wife Doris often went out for dinner in western Colorado and frequently visited the same McDonald's, located not far from their home. They ordered the same meal every time: a Quarter Pounder.",

      "Louise Mcloughlin found out when she was 13 that she had been conceived by a sperm donor. She said when her parents told her, it \"felt like the rug was just pulled from underneath my entire life.\"",
      "McLoughlin was raised in Dublin as an only child. When at-home genetic testing became available in 2006, she signed up, and she discovered that she had a half-sister. Not long after that, there was another match.",
      "\"I just went, oh my God. We found our biological dad,\" she told CBS News. Within a few hours McLoughlin found a website belonging to her biological father and, later that same day, she called him.",
      "\"I know I've caught you off guard,\" McLoughlin told the man on the other end of the phone line. \"I have a million questions. You may have a million questions.\"",
      "Her biological father said the call came unexpectedly, but he did acknowledge donating sperm at a clinic in London years earlier. He said he thought the donation would remain anonymous, but he told McLoughlin that he welcomed her call.",
      "\"To hear this man say, 'you're very welcome,'\" McLoughlin told CBS News, \"I feel guilty, because I know that's not the happy ending that everyone gets.\"",
      "McLoughlin now hosts a podcast called You Look Like Me, which explores the lives of donor-conceived people. Some have faced the discovery of hundreds of half-siblings.",
      "A recent Netflix documentary highlighted the case of one prolific sperm donor from the Netherlands, Jonathan Jacob Meijer, who has fathered hundreds of children. Some of his donations may have reached the United States.",
      "Meijer told CBS News he believes he has about 550 children, but admitted it could be many more. The sperm banks he's used do not need to inform him how many children have resulted from his donations.",
      "In 2023, a court in the Netherlands banned a man, identified only as Jonathan M. under Dutch privacy laws, from donating any more sperm, saying he had fathered about 550 children. The court noted that under national guidelines, donors are allowed to produce a maximum of 25 children with 12 mothers, and the judge said the man had \"deliberately lied about\" the extent of his donations \"to persuade the parents to take him as a donor.\"",
      "\"Donor conceived people have been sounding the alarm on this for years,\" McLoughlin said. \"We are seeing men who are donating hundreds and thousands of times. They're doing it in small areas. They're doing it within the same kind of years. So you're ending up with kids who are growing up knowing each other or meeting each other in later adulthood, which is just incredibly, incredibly dangerous.\"",
      "One of the dangers is that donor offspring can end up in incestuous relationships without knowing.",
      "One Connecticut woman revealed last year that she unknowingly had a relationship with her half-brother in high school, saying her mother was a victim of fertility fraud having been inseminated by her doctor with his own sperm. More than 50 fertility doctors in the U.S. have been accused of using their own sperm to inseminate patients.",
      "\"We regulate gasoline more comprehensively, driving more comprehensively. And yet, here we're actually creating lives,\" Indiana Law Professor Jody Madeira said. She's trying to get a law passed in Indiana that would make fertility fraud a felony.",
      "Madeira said the U.S. was like the Wild West compared to European countries in terms of regulating sperm donations.",
      "\"If you think that something like, a guy with a thousand kids, donor conceived kids, is possible in Europe, then the chances are exponentially higher in the United States,\" she told CBS News.",
      "There are several known prolific sperm donors in America, including New Yorker Ari Nagal, who's said he has 165 kids, and is still counting.",
      "There are no national databases tracking sperm donations in America, nor is there a legal limit on how many donations a person can make. There is also no requirement for donors to disclose genetic medical conditions that could affect offspring.",
      "Madeira said it is possible to regulate sperm donations, but \"in the United States, our cultural orientation just prioritizes the market, and the industry, and the wishes of parents. Whereas in Europe, they prioritize the rights of donor conceived individuals.\"",

    "story": [
      "The future of Medicare, America's sweeping health insurance program for older adults, continues to come up on the campaign trail from both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump during this final stretch leading up to the 2024 presidential election.",
      "This year's voting comes at a time when the 67.5 million Americans enrolled in Medicare plans are starting to see significant changes, largely resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act that Vice President Kamala Harris cast a tie-breaking vote for in 2022.",
      "Harris has touted the law's more generous prescription spending benefits for seniors, which Biden administration officials say have not resulted in feared premium spikes or cutbacks for most drug plans.",
      "Some of that \"stabilization\" is the result of billions poured into premium-lowering efforts, which Republicans have voiced frustration over as an \"election year stunt.\" Premiums for Medicare Part B are also continuing to grow, up to an estimated $185 monthly in 2025.",
      "The act has also offered some respite for lawmakers grappling with the program's long-running insolvency crisis, as spending is still outpacing the taxes that fund it. Medicare's trust fund now has until 2036 before it is set to run out, thanks in large part to savings from the law and an economic rebound following the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Harris wants to expand Medicare benefits",
      "Harris has made her proposal to expand Medicare's coverage\u00a0for home health care aides a common part of her stump speech in recent weeks. The plan also calls for adding coverage for hearing and vision benefits to Medicare.",
      "Expanding the new benefits could be paid for by a separate Harris proposal to expand the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The price caps program under its current design will be too small to cover the expanded benefits Harris wants. But the campaign has pointed to estimates suggesting that billions more could be recouped by a more aggressive approach to its price caps and other drug cost reforms, if Congress signs off.",
      "Former President Donald Trump's campaign responded to the Harris announcement by pointing to their own promises in the Republican platform this year, including \"shifting resources back to at-home care.\"",
      "They also cited changes Medicare made during the COVID-19 pandemic under Trump, like expanding access to telehealth providers.",
      "Trump wants to block Medicare age increases",
      "A frequent applause line at Trump's rallies is his pledge to block any increases to the eligibility age for Medicare coverage, which is currently set at 65 years old, and to eliminate income taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "\"I will fight for and protect Social Security and Medicare. There will be no cuts, and we won't be raising the age, like they're going to end up doing,\" Trump told supporters at a Pennsylvania rally on Oct. 9.",
      "Those promises could add to the steep challenges facing Congress, as it navigates the thorny solutions to Medicare insolvency. Though the deadline for Medicare running out of money has been pushed back, officials have warned Congress that delaying action now to shore up the fund will force even more painful changes down the road.",
      "While Trump has painted his pledge as a broadside against his Democratic rival, the retirement age issue was actually a point of division within his own party during the GOP primary. House Democrats have also railed against some of their GOP colleagues over a plan that suggested \"modest adjustments to the retirement age\" down the road.",
      "Harris accuses Trump of backing cuts to Medicare",
      "Democrats have accused Trump of backing cuts to Medicare for years, despite his repeated vows not to cut the program's funding.",
      "The Harris campaign has revived attacks from Trump's first term, which claimed his proposed budgets were cutting \"Medicare support for hospitals and other providers under the guise of eliminating wasteful spending.\"",
      "\"Now Donald Trump has a different approach. He tried to cut Medicare and Social Security every year he was president,\" Harris said on Oct. 29, in remarks near the White House that the campaign billed as her closing argument.",
      "At the time, Trump White House officials defended the savings as good government reforms and said Medicare's funding would still grow under the budget. The changes largely echoed recommendations by a nonpartisan advisory commission to improve the program, and outside budget watchdogs agreed it would not directly impact beneficiaries.",
      "Harris has also claimed that her Republican opponent would cut Medicare and overturn provisions the Inflation Reduction Act added, like the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. As evidence, she cites proposals in the Heritage Foundation's \"Project 2025\" platform, written by Trump allies, despite his own disavowal of the document.",
      "Trump accuses Harris of \"bankrupting\" the program",
      "On the trail, Trump most often brings up Medicare when accusing Harris of \"bankrupting\" the program. He frames the attack the same way he did against President Biden earlier this year, before Mr. Biden dropped out, claiming a surge of migrants was \"destroying\" Medicare.",
      "\"They're allowing millions of these people to go into Social Security, Medicare. They're going to destroy it,\" Trump said on Oct. 29, in remarks from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.",
      "Under current law, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicare. Only some \"lawfully present immigrants\" can get premium-free Medicare, typically only after those seniors have paid payroll taxes in enough years.",
      "A more nuanced version of Trump's attack,\u00a0published by his campaign, points to Harris' support for an \"earned pathway to citizenship\" for immigrants. The Trump campaign claims this could \"make millions of low-wage migrants into US citizens\" and threaten the survival of the program.",
      "This echoes a similar claim that has come up in Washington for years. A failed immigration reform effort\u00a0in 2013 that sought to carve out a \"pathway to citizenship\" was projected to result in higher Medicare spending to cover the additional people, though it was also projected to bring in more tax revenue that could outweigh the increased expenses.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 05:00:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve will make a rate cut decision on November 7. Here's what economists expect.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Thursday is expected to cut interest rates for the second time this year, with the decision coming less than two months after its surprise jumbo cut in September.",
      "The Fed is expected to shave borrowing costs by 0.25 percentage points, or half the size of its September reduction, according to forecasts from economists polled by FactSet. That would bring the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for borrowing money \u2014 down to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% from its current 4.75% to 5% level.",
      "With the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure dropping to 2.1% last month, just shy of the Fed's 2% goal, the central bank is easing off the brakes it applied when inflation hit a 40-year high during the pandemic. High borrowing costs have made it more expensive to buy everything from homes to cars.",
      "If the Fed cuts rates by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday as predicted, the move will provide some added relief for consumers, although the initial benefit will be small, experts say. The Fed is expected to continue cutting rates at its next several meetings, which could snowball into bigger savings for borrowers.",
      "\"Once a few more cuts happen over the next few months, the impact will add up to something that moves the needle for the average person struggling with debt,\" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst, in an email. \"For now, however, the effect of these cuts won't be very noticeable.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Thursday's Fed meeting.",
      "Is the Fed going to cut interest rates?",
      "Yes, the Fed is expected to shave its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday, November 7, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "\"Ongoing price and wage growth disinflation along with strong productivity growth should favor a gradual recalibration of Fed policy with a 25bps rate cut post-election following an outsized 50bps 'catch-up' rate cut in September,\" noted EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an October 31 report.",
      "Daco expects that the Fed will cut rates by an additional 0.25 percentage points at every meeting through June 2025. That will bring the federal funds rate to 4.4% in December and 3.4% in June.",
      "What time is the Fed rate decision?",
      "The Fed will announce its decision at 2 p.m. ET on Nov. 7, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m.",
      "The next Fed rate decision will be announced on Dec. 18.",
      "How low will rates go in 2024?",
      "The Fed is expected to cut its benchmark rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its December meeting. That would reflect a full percentage point cut from its pre-September level, when the federal funds rate was at its highest in more than two decades.",
      "But that doesn't mean mortgage rates or other borrowing costs will decline to that level, as lenders like mortgage companies and credit card companies make money by charging higher terms to consumers than the federal funds rate.",
      "Even so, borrowers should see some relief. Already, credit card rates are slightly lower, although they still remain close to record highs, according to Schulz.",
      "\"While they'll almost certainly continue to fall in coming months, no one should expect dramatically reduced credit card bills anytime soon,\" he added. \"Unless the Fed dramatically accelerates its pace of rate cuts, it'll still be a while before these reductions add up to more than just a few dollars per month coming off your bill.\"",
      "Will mortgage rates drop?",
      "Despite the Fed's September cut, mortgage rates have increased over the last month, with the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan sitting at about 6.72%, according to Freddie Mac. That's up from a September low of 6.08%.",
      "Even though the Fed's rate decisions impact mortgage rates, home borrowing costs are also affected by economic trends such as unemployment. Meanwhile, Treasury yields have been on the rise due to concerns about rising U.S. debt and the presidential election.",
      "\"As long as investors remain worried about what the future may bring, Treasury yields, and, by extension, mortgage rates are going to have a tough time falling and staying down,\" noted Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree.",

      "The shares have been on a wild ride since going public in March, initially surging and giving former president's 57% stake a value of\u00a0$5.2 billion.

    "story": [
      "If history is any guide, one stock market gauge suggests that Vice President Kamala Harris will defeat former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race.",
      "In all but two elections since 1944, the party in the White House has retained power when the U.S. stock market advances before Election Day, or the period between the end of July and Halloween, according to an election predictor devised by Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, based out of Allentown, Pennsylvania.",
      "In 2020, the S&P 500 fell 0.04% from July 31 to October 31, with then-President Donald Trump losing the election to President Joe Biden. While the outcome in the 2024 election is not yet known, the S&P 500 rose 3.3% during that three-month span this year.",
      "\"You can say there is sort of an overlap \u2014 the market usually goes up on an annual basis and voters tend to give the incumbent the benefit of the doubt, so it makes sense if the market goes up most of the time and the incumbent gets re-elected most of the time,\" Stovall told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even more reliable are periods when the stock market falls during the period from July 31 to October 31, in which case the incumbent has been replaced 89% of the time. That predictor failed only once, in 1956, according to Stovall, pointing to the year when incumbent President Dwight Eisenhower defeated Adlai Stevenson, despite the S&P 500 tumbling 7.7% in the period ahead of the election.",
      "Still, Stovall notes a mathematician might scoff at basing a model on such a limited sample, in this case the 21 presidential elections held in the U.S. since World War II.",
      "\"Is this really statistically significant? I think the answer is no, but it makes for interesting copy,\" the strategist said. \"You can have data tell whatever story you want.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 12:36:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Harris and Trump both have proposed historically large tax overhauls. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are both proposing tax changes that would rank among the largest in U.S. history, but their plans would impact very different groups of Americans by providing tax credits and cuts to some taxpayers, while raising taxes on others.",
      "While taxes are always on the ballot during an presidential election, the 2024 race has even more at stake given that many provisions in Trump's signature tax legislation, the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, will expire at the end of 2025. If Trump wins, he's expected to extend many of those provisions, while Harris has vowed to only keep those that help people earning under $400,000.",
      "At the same time, both candidates have sought to curry favor with some groups of voters by promising specific tax cuts and credits, such as Harris' plan to introduce a $6,000 Child Tax Credit for parents of newborns. Trump, meanwhile, has dangled a host of tax cuts to everyone from senior citizens (promising to get rid of income taxes on Social Security) to tipped workers (vowing to eliminate taxes on tips).",
      "But Trump is also proposing across-the-board tariffs on all imports, a plan that would effectively act as a sales tax on American consumers. That's because the countries that manufacture products imported to the U.S. do not pay tariffs; rather, tariffs are added to the prices of imported products that American consumers purchase.",
      "Here's what to know about how their tax plans stack up.",
      "Would Trump cut or raise your taxes?",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts \u2014 including cutting the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21% \u2014 would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "However, Trump's tax cuts would require Congressional approval, which could prove to be a hurdle if at least one of the chambers is controlled by Democrats.",
      "If Trump is unable to enact his tax cuts but adds his proposed tariffs \u2014 which don't need a Congressional greenlight \u2014 he would instead be introducing the seventh-biggest tax increase since 1940, the Tax Foundation says. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by U.S. consumers, with the typical household paying about $1,700 more each year in additional costs, according to one estimate.",
      "Meanwhile, income taxes would decline under Trump for all income groups, but the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Their analysis includes Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.",
      "Would Harris cut or raise your taxes?",
      "Harris is proposing a mix of tax cuts, tax increases and expanded tax credits that together would rank as the 15th largest tax increase since 1940, according to the Tax Foundation.",
      "However, the impact would be greater on higher-income households, given that she has vowed to not raise taxes on those earning less than $400,000. Her tax increases would also be targeted at businesses, as she wants to boost the corporate tax rate to 28% from its current 21%.",
      "Most low- and middle-income households would actually get a tax break under her proposals, but high-income households would pay substantially more in income taxes than they currently do, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model.",
      "The top 0.1%, or those earning more than $14 million a year, would see their taxes increase by about $167,000 a year.",
      "What are Harris and Trump proposing for families?",
      "Harris wants to expand the Child Tax Credit from its current $2,000 to $6,000 for children up to a year old, $3,600 for kids between 1 to 6, and $3,000 for those between 6 to 17.",
      "Low-income households with kids would receive an additional $2,750 on average from Harris' expanded CTC, according to a Tax Policy Center\u00a0analysis.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's vice presidential candidate, JD Vance, has floated the idea of a $5,000 CTC, but the campaign hasn't introduced more details, according to the Tax Policy Center. If Trump extends the TCJA, the CTC would remain at $2,000 per eligible child.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for taxes on Social Security?",
      "Harris hasn't proposed any tax cuts for Social Security beneficiaries, while Trump has floated eliminating federal income taxes on the retirement payments.",
      "Trump's plan would mostly help middle- and high-income retirees, given that low-income retirees often don't make enough to pay federal income tax on their benefits, according to tax experts. The biggest boost would go to retirees earning between $63,000 and $200,000, the Tax Policy Center estimates.",
      "At the same time, Trump's tax cut would likely hasten the insolvency of the Social Security trust fund, which relies on those income taxes for funding, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Retirees would also be facing a bigger benefit cut, up to 33% of their monthly checks rather than the 23% currently forecast, when the trust fund is exhausted, the group estimates.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for business taxes?",
      "Harris wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from its current 21%.",
      "By comparison, Trump wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%.",
      "\"Nowhere do the candidates' tax plans differ more,\" noted Howard Gleckman, senior fellow of the Tax Policy Center, in a November 1 blog post.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for taxes on overtime and tips?",
      "One place where the candidates converge is on cutting taxes for people who work for tips. Both have portrayed the idea as helping workers with families.",
      "But Trump is also proposing other tax cuts for workers, such as a plan to get rid of federal income taxes on overtime income.",
      "What other tax changes are Harris and Trump proposing?",
      "Harris wants to help people buy homes and start businesses by creating a new $25,000 first-time homebuyers credit and expanding the deduction for startup business expenses from $5,000 to $50,000.",
      "Trump has also proposed making the interest for auto loans tax deductible, a move that would primarily help higher-income taxpayers who itemize their deductions.",

      "The current annual salary for a U.S. senator \u2014 as well as members of the U.S. House of Representatives \u2014 is $174,000. The government-paid salary, set in 2009, reflects a $4,700 pay bump from 2008, but has not been raised since.",

      "Unlike individuals in other professions, Congress essentially has direct control over the salary of its members, in the sense that any raise or decrease in member compensation must be \"ascertained by Law\" according to\u00a0Article I, Section 6\u00a0\u00a0of the U.S. Constitution. Checks and balances in the legislative process surrounding compensation, however, keep members from giving themselves million-dollar pay raises each year.",
      "\"A change in salary must be done via a bill or joint resolution, both of which are presented to the President for a signature. Thus, the President could veto a bill changing Members' salaries if he thought it inappropriate,\" explains a 2019 report from the Congressional Institute.",
      "That said, perhaps the most powerful protection against inflated salaries in Congress is the ballot box, and the voting public's general skepticism toward increases in Senate pay.",
      "\"Members know constituents are skeptical of congressional pay increases, so they hate voting for them,\" according to the Congressional Institute.",
      "Do senators get a cost of living adjustment?",
      "In spite of public scrutiny, Congress has managed to keep itself among the highest paying professions.",
      "After public outrage quashed a brash attempt by Congress to increase member pay by 51% in early 1989, a more modest hike of 10% was passed through The Ethics Reform Act of 1989, signed into law by President George Bush on Nov. 30, 1989.",
      "Described by CQ Almanac at the time as \"the most sweeping rewrite of the congressional code of conduct in 12 years,\" the legislation allowed salaries for congressional members to reach $125,000 in 1991, a nearly 40% increase from the $89,500 salary that had been set in 1987.",
      "The ethics reform also established an annual automatic cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for members of Congress\u00a0based on the previous year's Employment Cost Index, an increase they have refused since 2009 \u2014 likely to avoid blowback from voters.",
      "If Congress had accepted each of those increases over the years, their annual salary would have reached $208,000 in 2023, as previously\u00a0reported by CBS News. Meanwhile, a report by Congressional Research Service\u00a0 estimates senators are actually making 29% less than they were in 2009 because of inflation.",

      "But pay raises can come in less obvious forms, such as subsidies. As reported last January by the New York Times, a provision passed by Congress in late 2022 allowed lawmakers to claim reimbursements for gas, food and lodging while on official business in Washington \u2014 the equivalent of a $34,000 tax-free pay raise, according to the Times.",

But that's exactly what's happening to Swifties nationwide as hackers target Ticketmaster accounts, stealing customers' tickets for resale on other sites.",
      "\"It was like that gut punch,\" Morgen Bernius, a Maryland mom, told CBS News national consumer correspondent Usher Qurashi in describing the moment she discovered the Taylor Swift tickets she purchased for her daughter had suddenly disappeared from her Ticketmaster account.",
      "\"The tickets are gone \u2014 gone,\" said Bernius, adding that she could cry just thinking about it. \"It was devastating,\" she added.",

As an added precaution, Ticketmaster is limiting ticket transfers to 72 hours before Eras Tour concerts and requiring two-factor authentication for some transactions.",
      "\"It's a very small percent, less than a tenth of one percent,\" said Henrich, \"but obviously for that one fan who's going through that, it's a really stressful situation.\"",

    "summary": "How the U.S. election plays out could have a major impact on the millions of Americans enrolled in Medicare. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "On the campaign trail, both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are eager to portray themselves as guardians of Medicare. Each presidential candidate accuses the other of backing spending cuts and other policies that would damage the health insurance program for older Americans.",
      "But the election's outcome could alter the very nature of the nearly 60-year-old federal program. More than half of Medicare beneficiaries are already enrolled in plans, called Medicare Advantage, run by commercial insurers, and if Trump wins, that proportion is expected to grow \u2014 perhaps dramatically.",
      "Trump and many congressional Republicans have already taken steps to aggressively promote Medicare Advantage. And Project 2025, a political wish list produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation for the next presidency, calls for making insurer-run plans the default enrollment option for Medicare.",
      "Such a change would effectively privatize the program, because people tend to stick with the plans they're initially enrolled in, health analysts say. Trump has repeatedly tried to distance himself from Project 2025, though the document's authors include numerous people who worked in his first administration.",
      "Conservatives say Medicare beneficiaries are better off in the popular Advantage plans, which offer more benefits than the traditional, government-run program. Critics say increasing insurers' control of the program would trap consumers in health plans that are costlier to taxpayers and that can restrict their care, including by imposing onerous prior authorization requirements for some procedures.",
      "\"Traditional Medicare will wither on the vine,\" said Robert Berenson, a former official in the Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton administrations who's now a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning research group.",
      "While the fate of Medicare has gotten scant attention so far in the campaign, the different visions under Trump versus Harris indicate the high stakes.",
      "A candidate's position on protecting Medicare and Social Security is the most important health care issue, or among the most important, in determining 63% of Americans' vote in the presidential election, according to a September poll by Gallup and West Health, a family of nonprofit and nonpartisan organizations focused on health care and aging.",
      "Medicare, which covers about 66 million people, is funded largely by payroll taxes. At age 65, most Americans are automatically enrolled in Medicare coverage for hospitalization and doctor visits, known as Part A and Part B, though others must sign up. Consumers must also sign up for other aspects of Medicare, specifically drug coverage (Part D) and supplemental plans from insurers that pay for costs that aren't covered by traditional Medicare, such as extended stays in skilled nursing facilities and cost sharing.",
      "People on Medicare pay premiums plus as much as 20% of the cost of their care.",
      "Medicare Advantage plans typically combine coverage for hospital and outpatient care and prescriptions, while eliminating the 20% coinsurance requirement and capping customers' annual out-of-pocket costs. Many of the plans don't charge an extra monthly premium, though some carry a deductible \u2014 an amount patients must pay each year before coverage kicks in.",
      "Sometimes the plans throw in extras like coverage for eye exams and glasses or gym memberships.",
      "However, they control costs by limiting patients to networks of approved doctors and hospitals, with whom the plans negotiate payment rates. Some hospitals and doctors refuse to do business with some or all Medicare Advantage plans, making those networks narrow or limited. Traditional Medicare, in comparison, is accepted by nearly every hospital and doctor.",
      "Medicare's popularity is one reason both candidates are pledging to enhance it. Last month, Harris released a plan that would add benefits including care for hearing and vision, and long-term in-home health care. The costs would be covered by savings from expanding Medicare's negotiations with drugmakers, reducing fraud, and increasing discounts drugmakers pay for certain brand-name drugs in the program, according to Harris' campaign.",
      "Trump's campaign said he would prioritize home care benefits and support unpaid family caregivers through tax credits and reduced red tape.",
      "The Trump campaign also noted enhancements to Medicare Advantage plans during his tenure as president, such as increasing access to telehealth and expanding supplemental benefits for seniors with chronic diseases.",
      "But far less attention has been paid to whether to give even more control of Medicare to private insurers. Joe Albanese, a senior policy analyst at Paragon Health Institute, a right-leaning research group, said \"a Trump administration and GOP Congress would be more friendly\" to the idea.",
      "The concept of letting private insurers run Medicare isn't new. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, asserted in 1995 that traditional Medicare would fade away if its beneficiaries could pick between the original program and private plans.",
      "The shift to Medicare Advantage was accelerated by legislation in 2003 that created Medicare's drug benefit and gave private health plans a far greater role in the program.",
      "Lawmakers thought private insurers could better contain costs. Instead, the plans have cost more. In 2023, Medicare Advantage plans cost the government and taxpayers about 6% \u2014 or $27 billion \u2014 more than original Medicare, though some research shows they provide better care.",
      "The Trump administration promoted Medicare Advantage in emails during the program's open enrollment period each year, but support for the privately run plans has become bipartisan as they have grown.",
      "\"It helps inject needed competition into a government-run program and has proven to be more popular with those who switch,\" said Roger Severino, lead architect of Project 2025's section on the Department of Health and Human Services. He served as director of HHS' civil rights office during the Trump administration.",
      "But enrollees who want to switch back to traditional Medicare may not be able to. If they try to buy supplemental coverage for the 20% of costs Medicare doesn't cover, they may find they have to pay an unaffordable premium. Unless they enroll in the plans close to the time they first become eligible for Medicare, usually at age 65, insurers selling those supplemental plans can deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of preexisting conditions.",
      "\"More members of Congress are hearing from constituents who are horrified and realize they are trapped in these plans,\" said Andrea Ducas, vice president of health policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy organization.",
      "[Correction: This article was updated at 10:20 a.m. ET on Nov. 4, 2024, to correct the amount Medicare Advantage plans cost the government and taxpayers last year compared with original Medicare.]",

    "published": "Sat, 02 Nov 2024 10:00:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Jasmine Adeoye, an account manager based in Austin, Texas, said she became addicted to kratom drink \"Feel Free Classic,\" after she sought an alcohol alternative.",
    "story": [
      "When Jasmine Adeoye, an account manager based in Austin, Texas, decided to stop drinking in June 2022, she turned to a kratom beverage advertised as an alcohol alternative. Within a year and a half, Adeoye said she was addicted to the drink, \"Feel Free Classic,\" lured by what she calls the company's deceptive marketing tactics.",
      "The 29-year-old account manager based in Austin, Texas, said her favorite podcasters promoted the drink, which the company Botanic Tonics manufactures and sells, as \"a miracle\" beverage that could help people trying to overcome addiction and embrace sobriety. Having struggled with binge drinking in the past, Adeoye was intrigued.",
      "She said she was unaware the drink contained kratom, a plant native to Southeast Asia that can produce feelings of energy, ease anxiety and reduce pain\u2014 but carries a risk of addiction, seizures, and very rarely, death. Since kratom is unregulated in the U.S., some products are sold in highly concentrated forms and could contain contaminants like heavy metals and harmful bacteria, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.",
      "Eventually, Adeoye says she was drinking up to 10 two-ounce bottles a day and spending around $100 daily. The company recommends consumers drink no more than a bottle daily. By then, she said, her life revolved around the drink and she needed to make sure she had access to it wherever she went.",
      "A drink advertised an #alcoholalternative",
      "Then came the withdrawals, which some consumers compare on social media to withdrawing from an opioid.",
      "\"When I would wake up, I'd be 'dope sick', essentially, and need to go straight to the gas station and go buy Feel Free to immediately feel better,\" Adeoye said.",
      "This past March, after one bout of withdrawal symptoms was so severe, she sought medical care close to her home in Austin. She hadn't told the doctors she was struggling with kratom use, she said, and they chalked her symptoms up to a virus.",
      "\"All of a sudden, it just spirals out of control and you get to a point where you feel like you can't live without them,\" she said. \"And you become just a shell of a person.\"",
      "Adeoye, who was trying to stay sober from alcohol, said she unwittingly found herself in the throes of addiction \u2014 and she's not the only one.",
      "A forum on the social network Reddit called r/quittingkratom has more than 45,000 members while a forum dedicated exclusively to quitting Feel Free has nearly 3,000. There are podcasts, support groups and books dedicated to quitting kratom.",
      "In 2023, a class action lawsuit was filed in California against Botanic Tonics alleging that the drink was advertised as a safe alternative to alcohol. The company used social media to reach its \"desired customer base,\" the lawsuit states, which included individuals who had struggled with addiction. According to the 2023 suit, Botanic Tonics posted over a thousand advertisements on Instagram using the hashtag #alcoholalternative. The suit also says that advertisements on Instagram omitted any mention of kratom or potential side effects.",
      "CBS News spoke with another consumer about their experience with Feel Free Classic who also described the drink's appeal as an alcohol alternative, and said they had become addicted to the beverage and eventually experienced withdrawal symptoms.",
      "The company told CBS News in a statement it \"fell short of the high standards of transparency and consumer education that our company now champions.\" And they've taken steps for \"continuous improvement and doing what's right for consumers.\"",
      "Botanic Tonics said they'd implemented changes including enhanced labeling, raised age restrictions to 21 and over, investing in clinical research, expanded consumer education resources and maintained rigorous manufacturing standards in FDA-registered, cGMP-certified facilities.",
      "CBS News found through an internet search that Feel Free Classic was featured in at least 22 podcasts. The company's founder, JW Ross, has spoken openly with podcast hosts about his previous struggles with alcohol, and how Feel Free Classic was developed as an alternative.",
      "\"We make a powerful product. That product works for a lot of people, but it doesn't work for everyone,\" Botanic Tonics said in a statement to CBS News. \"Our priority as a company is making sure it gets into the right hands, which is why it's so important for us to focus on informing people who have issues with substance abuse that it isn't for them.\"",
      "Upon the lawsuit's settlement in September, Botanic Tonics said it would issue clear labels and warnings \u2014 but around the time Adeoye began taking Feel Free Classic and ultimately became hooked, the website advertised the drinks to be \"used for productivity enhancement or as a healthy alcohol alternative.\" As recently as January 2024, a banner on the website read \"cheers to a dry January.\"",
      "Kratom risks not fully known by the public",
      "Kratom is used by an estimated 2 million to 15 million Americans. As kratom's use rises in the U.S., so do the risks. The FDA warns the public against consuming kratom for medical use due to the risk of liver toxicity, seizures and substance use disorder; the DEA classifies it as a \"drug of concern\" and warns that it can lead to addiction. Botanic Tonics said, \"while leaf kratom can lead to physical dependence, its risk profile is significantly lower compared to many other commonly used substances.\" The company pointed CBS News to comparative safety practices and FDA studies available on the Global Kratom Coalition website, an advocacy group promoting the use of kratom.",
      "It is rare to overdose from kratom alone \u2013 a vast majority of the overdoses typically include an accompanying substance like alcohol or cocaine. But it does happen.",
      "Wrongful death suits in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington followed. The family of a Florida woman whose death in 2021 was attributed to a chemical compound found in kratom was awarded $11 million in a wrongful death lawsuit. Last year, $2.5 million was awarded in the first kratom wrongful death trial in the United States. A kratom company based in Washington State was found liable for negligence among other claims relating to the death of a 39-year-old who was found dead in his living room after consuming kratom.",
      "Despite kratom's potential for addiction and subsequent withdrawal symptoms, it has gained a reputation among the online sobriety community as a method to self-manage opioid withdrawal \u2014 which has not yet been scientifically proven.",
      "Adeoye said even though information about the dangers of kratom was readily available, she didn't understand the associated risks. If she could go back two years, she said, she would have researched the ingredients \"as heavily as possible.\"",
      "\"To my knowledge, it was something that was similar to matcha, like a tea or a coffee,\" Adeoye said. \"So, thought it was completely harmless.\"",
      "Scrutiny grows around kratom marketing",
      "Botanic Tonics isn't the only kratom product company that has come under scrutiny.",
      "In July, the FDA issued a warning advising consumers against using OPMS Black Liquid Kratom, which \"has been linked to serious adverse health effects, including death,\" according to the agency. Shot of Joy, which sells kratom shots, was issued a warning letter by the FDA in 2023 stating the company markets their products for the \"treatment or cure of opioid addiction\"\u2014 a claim the FDA says has not been determined by the agency. In a series of Instagram advertisements viewed by CBS News, Shot of Joy promotes their beverage as an alcohol alternative. The FDA has issued warning letters to ten companies that sell kratom products between 2019 and 2023.",
      "After nearly two years of silently struggling, Adeoye told her mom, and then her husband following that medical visit. She was ready to quit.",
      "She spent the next few days detoxing at home.",
      "\"I couldn't eat anything. My mom had to force me to eat,\" she said, noting that she had to have someone with her \"around the clock.\"",
      "Though the physical withdrawals tapered off after about three days she says it took six months to feel regulated mentally.",
      "\"It's very depressing to feel this emptiness,\" Adeoye said of quitting kratom. \"You feel like life is never going to be the same.\"",
      "Botanic Tonics'\u00a0 FAQ page now includes a section addressing past marketing practices.",
      "\"Our marketing strategy has changed dramatically in the past year, but not as a reaction to the lawsuit filing,\" the statement reads. \"As our business has grown, specifically in retail, we've shifted marketing focus accordingly.\"",

      "Investigators only identified \"several isolated instances of workplace harassment and misconduct,\" according to a two-page letter sent Friday by Alex Spiro, a trial lawyer who led the investigation by white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and whose clients have included Jay-Z and Elon Musk.",

      "The controversies surrounding the so-called King of YouTube began snowballing this summer. Ava Tyson, a Donaldson friend and fellow creator accused of sharing inappropriate sexual messages with minors over multiple years, left the channel in July.

      "Donaldson has largely remained silent on the matters. He recently launched a prepacked lunch brand alongside internet personalities Logan Paul and KSI, marking his latest entrance into the food market after his chocolate bar and burger chain were met with mixed reviews. His 325 million YouTube subscribers have continued to see their feeds filled with outlandish, high-energy videos like the recently titled \"100 Identical Twins Fight For $250,000.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 09:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "JD Vance, former President Trump's running mate, has come a long way from his hardscrabble childhood of \"Hillbilly Elegy.\"",
    "story": [
      "Vice presidential candidate JD Vance, 40, has amassed a multimillion fortune in the two decades since he left behind the hardscrabble childhood he described in his bestselling 2016 memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\"",
      "Vance's net worth is estimated at between $4.8 million and\u00a0$11.3 million, according to federal disclosure forms filed in August. While that's a far cry from the\u00a0estimated\u00a0$6.7 billion fortune of his running mate, former President Donald Trump, Vance's wealth far surpasses the median U.S. household net worth of $193,000.",
      "Vance parlayed his tough upbringing into a life of rare privilege after attending Yale Law School, where he met\u00a0his wife, Usha, and made connections with wealthy patrons, including the right-leaning billionaire Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal. After graduating from Yale, Vance was hired by Thiel's firm Mithril Capital, marking the start of a career in venture capital that helped build his fortune.",
      "\"I mean, look, I wanted to make money \u2014 I'm not saying I'm anti-making money,\" Vance told the New York Times in October about his decision to start a career in venture capital. \"But when I thought about what I really wanted out of my life, what I really wanted was what Usha and I have right now. And I wanted to raise our kids in stability.\"",
      "Vance added that when he was a child and people asked his address, he was never sure he would be at the same location a month later because of the financial instability of his youth. \"I hated the fact that I had these different addresses \u2014 it was just something that really bothered me as a kid,\" he added.",
      "Backed by funding from Thiel, Vance ran for a Senate seat in Ohio, winning the race in 2022 and taking his Senate position in January 2023.",
      "Vance's net worth",
      "Vance's biggest asset is an account with Charles Schwab, which he valued at between $2.3 million to $7.7 million.",
      "In federal disclosure forms, candidates estimate their assets between a range of values, rather than providing a specific dollar figure. For instance, Vance's Schwab account holds a stake in the Invesco QQQ Trust, an ETF that focuses on the Nasdaq 100 index, which the senator estimated is worth between $1 million to $5 million.",
      "Vance, a major supporter of digital currencies, also owns between $250,000 to $500,000 in bitcoin, his disclosure form shows.",
      "The vice presidential hopeful also owns:",
      "Real estate in Washington, D.C., worth between $500,000 to $1 millionOwnership in his venture capital fund, Narya Capital Fund I, worth between $500,000 to $1 millionChecking and savings accounts at Marcus Goldman Sachs and the Navy Federal Credit Union valued between $200,000 to $500,000A SEP-IRA account worth between $100,000 to $250,000",

      "A SEP-IRA account worth between $100,000 to $250,000",
      "Vance lists only two liabilities: A mortgage worth between $250,000 to $500,000 and a line of credit between $500,000 to $1 million.",
      "He also gets royalties from \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" which he estimated brings him between $15,000 to $50,000 in annual income.",

    "summary": "Cindy Nava, a former undocumented immigrant, Dreamer and Biden administration official, was elected to the New Mexico State Senate.",
    "story": [
      "As the 2024 election results continued rolling in Wednesday morning, the outcomes of federal and state races took shape across the United States. A handful of them marked historic victories, with Congress' first transgender representative and Maryland's first Black senator among them.",
      "In New Mexico, voters elected Cindy Nava to join the state legislature, paving the way for a former undocumented person and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, recipient to hold a position in public office.",
      "Nava, a Democrat, won New Mexico's state Senate contest in District 9, which includes a region just north of Albuquerque. She bested Republican candidate Audrey Trujillo with 55% of the vote,\u00a0according to results shared online by the New Mexico Secretary of State's office.",
      "Originally from Mexico, Nava came to the U.S. as a young child with her family. She was a Dreamer \u2014 a recipient of the DACA program \u2014 which was designed to protect undocumented people who arrived in the country as children from being deported. The Obama-era policy took effect in 2012.",
      "Years later, after graduating from college in New Mexico, Nava was appointed to serve as a senior policy adviser at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under the Biden administration. She was the first former DACA recipient appointed by the White House, said Nava in a biography that appears on\u00a0her campaign website.",
      "\"I am the first in my family to graduate college, and the first Dreamer (DACA recipient) in the country to be appointed by the White House,\" the bio reads. \"Now, I am among a small handful of Dreamers in the country who are running for public office.\"",
      "Nava's victory in New Mexico's state legislature was unprecedented because a former DACA recipient had never successfully become an elected official before this latest election. She could potentially share that milestone with Luis Mata, a Democratic candidate for Tennessee's House of Representatives in 2024 who was also a Dreamer.",
      "Historic election triumphs touched multiple states.",
      "Delaware",
      "Delaware made huge strides in the 2024 congressional elections. Sarah McBride, a Democrat who has served in the Delaware State Senate and worked in the Obama administration, won her U.S. House race and became the first openly transgender person elected to Congress.",
      "U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, also a Democrat, also became the first woman and the first Black person elected to serve in the U.S. Senate from Delaware. She reached the same milestone for Delaware when she was elected to represent the state in the House in 2017.",
      "The upcoming congressional term will mark the first time two Black women serve simultaneously in the Senate, owing to Rochester's victory in Delaware and Angela Alsobrooks' victory in Maryland.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 10:01:40 -0500",
    "summary": "From enthusiasm from Israel's leader to thinly veiled anxiety from some of America's oldest European allies, foreign reaction to Trump's election victory is rolling in fast.",
    "story": [
      "With former President Donald Trump set to reprise his role as the commander in chief of the world's most powerful military and largest economy \u2014 and with him wasting no time in claiming victory in the\u00a0U.S. presidential election \u2014 leaders around the world started reacting Wednesday to the reality of a second term in the White House for the businessman-turned politician.",
      "From enthusiasm voiced by Israel's leader as he wages an expanding, multi-front war to anxiety from some of America's closest, generations-old European allies, the reaction to Trump's election performance started rolling in long before the final votes were counted across the U.S.",
      "Below is a look at how some foreign leaders and others around the world have taken the news of the American electorate's apparent rebuke of Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party at the polls.",
      "Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered his congratulations to Trump on Wednesday, calling his election performance \"history's greatest comeback!\"",
      "\"Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America,\" Netanyahu said. \"This is a huge victory!\"",
      "Despite Trump's criticism of the Israeli leader's handling of the ongoing war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Netanyahu was widely believed to favor the former U.S. leader in the U.S. election, as tension between Washington and Tel Aviv has risen sharply over the last year due to Israel's tactics in its multi-front war with Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East.",
      "The war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that saw the militants kill some 1,200 people and kidnap about 250 others, has now killed more than 43,000 people in the Palestinian territory, according to its Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also significantly ramped-up its assault on Hezbollah, Hamas' fellow-Iranian backed allies in Lebanon. The Israeli offensive there has killed more than 3,000 people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.",
      "The Biden administration has continued pushing for cease-fires on both fronts, to no avail, and demanding that Israel do more to mitigate the devastating impact of the wars on civilians.",
      "Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy",
      "Ukraine's war-time President Volodymyr Zelenskyy congratulated Trump Wednesday for what he called an \"impressive election victory,\" and said he looked forward to \"an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump's decisive leadership.\"",
      "\"I recall our great meeting with President Trump back in September, when we discussed in detail the Ukraine-U.S. strategic partnership, the Victory Plan, and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post, adding that his country was interested \"in developing mutually beneficial political and economic cooperation that will benefit both of our nations.\"",
      "\"I appreciate President Trump's commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs,\" said the Ukrainian leader. \"This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together.\"",
      "Zelenskyy offered no comment on Trump's repeated vows to \"quickly\" end the nearly three-year war that began with Russia's full-scale invasion in early 2022. His government and his commanders on the battlefield have voiced growing concern that Trump could dramatically reduce or even halt the huge American support for Ukraine's military effort to repel Russia's invasion.",
      "Zelenskyy has warned that if the resolve of Ukraine's Western backers crumbles and Russia is allowed to seize Ukrainian territory, the war his country is fighting could spread, with direct implications for Americans.",
      "\"This aggression, and Putin's army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they're the NATO members,\" he told CBS News early this year.",
      "Hungary's Viktor Orb\u00e1n",
      "One of the first foreign leaders to offer congratulations to Trump on Wednesday was one of the very few who openly backed him long before the final votes were cast in the U.S. Hungary's far-right President Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who's been accused during his decades-long leadership of the eastern European nation of eroding its democratic institutions by giving himself more power and limiting that of the country's courts and civil society institutions, called Trump's apparent success \"a much needed victory for the World!\"",
      "In a message posted on social media, Orb\u00e1n said Trump had pulled off \"the biggest comeback in US political history,\" and he congratulated him on his \"enormous win.\"",
      "Orban has made himself an outsider among European Union leaders by endorsing anti-immigrant policies and maintaining close ties with President Vladimir Putin amid Russia's ongoing invasion of neighboring Ukraine \u2014 all while touting his close ties to Trump.",
      "In a speech over the summer, Orb\u00e1n suggested he had even helped to craft Trump's future statecraft, claiming to have \"entered the policy-writing system of President Donald Trump's team,\" with \"deep involvement there.\"",
      "Russia, but not Putin himself",
      "Leonid Slutsky, who heads the Committee on International Affairs in Russia's State Duma, or parliament, was quoted Wednesday by the country's state-run RIA Novosti news agency as saying a Trump victory offered \"a chance for a more constructive approach to the Ukrainian conflict.\"",
      "\"Can we expect changes in approaches to the role of the U.S. in the Ukrainian conflict, which has been fueled by the Democratic administration since 2014? Judging by the election rhetoric (if it can still be believed), the Republican team is not going to send more and more American taxpayers' money into the furnace of a proxy war against Russia,\" Slutsky was quoted as saying. \"Perhaps there is a chance for a more constructive approach here.\"",
      "Slutsky did not comment on Trump's repeated vows to end the war in Ukraine quickly if reelected \u2014 something European and Ukrainian leaders fear he could do by halting America's vast military support for Kyiv and forcing Ukraine to accept Russia's takeover of significant Ukrainian territory.",
      "Slutsky did predict, however, that if the next American administration does cut off that support, the U.S.-backed Ukrainian government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will fall \"in a matter of months, if not days.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from President Vladimir Putin, who never spoke in favor of either candidate during the U.S. election campaign process, but whose leadership Trump has lauded previously.",
      "In remarks later to journalists in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was unaware of any plans for Putin to congratulate Trump directly, saying the former U.S. leader had made \"quite harsh statements\" about Russia during the campaign and calling the U.S. an \"unfriendly country that is directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state.\"",
      "In a statement issued later, Russia's Foreign Ministry echoed that stance, saying: \"We have no illusions about the elected American President, who is well known in Russia, and the new composition of Congress, where the Republicans, according to preliminary data, are gaining the upper hand. The ruling political elite in the United States, regardless of party affiliation, adheres to anti-Russian attitudes and a line on 'containing Moscow.' This line is not subject to fluctuations in the domestic political barometer in the United States.\"",
      "The ministry said Russia would \"work with the new Administration when it 'settles' in the White House, firmly defending Russian national interests and focusing on achieving all the goals of the special military operation.\"",
      "In his remarks, however, Peskov left room for any change in the U.S. stance during Trump's second term, saying: \"After victory, preparing to enter the Oval Office, sometimes statements take on a different tone.\"",
      "\"We will draw conclusions based on concrete steps and concrete words,\" he said, adding that it would be \"practically impossible\" for Trump to damage U.S. relations with Moscow, as they're \"at their lowest point in history.\"",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that Trump's reelection was \"no cause for concern\" for Mexico, despite the president-elect's recent threat to impose a massive 25% tariff on Mexican imports unless her government halts what he called an \"onslaught of criminals and drugs\" coming across the southern U.S. border.",
      "\"We are a free, independent, sovereign country and there will be good relations with the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, adding that she felt it was \"prudent to wait\" to extend congratulations to the U.S. election winner until the official results were announced.",
      "\"For all Mexicans, there is no cause for concern, for our countrymen and women [in the U.S.], for their relatives who are here, for Mexican businesswomen and businessmen, there is no cause for concern,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer did his best Wednesday, despite a clear delineation between his own policies and those expected of another Trump administration, to maintain the decorum of the storied \"special friendship\" between the two nations.",
      "In a social media post, Starmer offered his congratulations to Trump \"on your historic election victory,\" adding that he looks forward to \"working with you in the years ahead.\"",
      "\"As the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defense of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise,\" said Starmer, who came to power only months ago as Britain's left-leaning Labour Party won national elections in a landslide after a decade and a half of Conservative Party rule.",
      "\"I know that the US-UK special relationship will continue to prosper on both sides of the Atlantic for years to come,\" added Starmer.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron",
      "\"Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump,\" France's President Emmanuel Macron said in a brief statement posted on social media Wednesday. He declared his administration \"ready to work together\" again as it did during Trump's first term in office, \"with your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.\"",
      "But an hour later, the French president issued another statement that hinted at the concerns he and many of his European colleagues are likely to share about Trump's commitment to the transatlantic NATO alliance, America's future backing of Ukraine in the war with Russia, and his stance on foreign import tariffs.",
      "In his second tweet, Macron said he had just spoken with German Chancellor Olaf Sholz, and that the leaders of the EU's two biggest economies had agreed to \"work towards a more united, stronger, more sovereign Europe in this new context. By cooperating with the United States of America and defending our interests and our values.\"",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte",
      "\"I just congratulated @realDonaldTrump on his election as President of the United States,\" said NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on Wednesday, adding in his social media post that Trump's \"leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through #NATO.\"",
      "Trump has criticized many of the NATO alliance's European members for failing to commit at least 2% of their national GDPs to their defense budgets.",
      "Trump shocked many of America's closest allies during and after his first term by openly criticizing\u00a0their funding commitments, and during the 2024 presidential campaign he said calling on allies to increase their defense spending would be a policy he aggressively pursued if reelected.",
      "In May, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said \"Trump got our allies to increase their NATO spending by demanding they pay up,\" and that if reelected, \"he will restore peace and rebuild American strength and deterrence on the world stage.\"",
      "Iran's government and people",
      "Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran's ruling Islamic regime, appeared on the country's state-run TV network IRIB Wednesday and was quoted as dismissing the potential impact of Trump's election victory amid her country's standoff with the West over its support for armed proxy groups across the Middle East and its nuclear program.",
      "\"The election of the U.S. President is not relevant to us,\" she said according to a translation of her remarks on state media. She said the policies of both the U.S. and Iran were \"fixed and do not change with the change of individuals,\" and said there would be be no \"impact on people's livelihoods\" in Iran regardless of who occupies the White House.",
      "Iran's economy has been decimated by a huge regime of U.S. and international sanctions imposed initially over its alleged nuclear weapons development \u2014 which the country denies \u2014 and extended over its support for U.S.-designated terror groups such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "During Donald Trump's first term in office, he unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of an international nuclear pact negotiated by his predecessor that was intended to keep Iran's atomic work in check in exchange for an easing of sanctions. He adopted a hard line instead, re-imposing sanctions to the consternation of America's European allies who helped broker and co-signed the deal.",
      "Iran has since ramped up its nuclear work, and there has been mounting concern this year that its backing for the so-called proxy groups across the Mideast could lead to a full-scale war with Israel, with the potential to draw in the U.S. as Israel's closest ally.",
      "Despite the government's claim that there would be no impact on Iranians, the value of the country's currency, the rial, slipped on Wednesday to its lowest ever value.",
      "Traders in Tehran told The Associated Press that the rial was trading at 703,000 to the dollar, though there could be further fluctuations over the course of the day.",
      "One resident of Iran's capital told the AP he had no doubt that Trump \"will intensify the sanctions.\"",
      "\"Things that are not in our favor will be worse,\" 22-year-old student Amir Aghaeian told the AP. \"Our economy and social situation will surely get worse... I feel the country is going to blow up.\"",
      "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, and Gaza residents",
      "Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian Authority that administers the Israeli-occupied West Bank, congratulated Trump on his reelection and wished him success.",
      "In his message, posted Wednesday on the website of the Authority's\u00a0news agency WAFA, Abbas expressed hope to work with Trump for peace and security in the region, stressing the Palestinian people's commitment to the pursuit of \"freedom, self-determination and statehood, in accordance with international law.\"",
      "\"We will remain steadfast in our commitment to peace, and we are confident that the United States will support, under your leadership, the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people,\" he said, addressing Trump.",
      "While nearly two-thirds of Israelis polled by the Israel Democracy Institute before election day in the U.S. said they believed Trump would be a better American leader for Israel's interests, the sentiment in Gaza, where Abbas' Fatah movement hasn't held any power in many years, was less focused on who would win, and more on surviving the war.",
      "A woman living amid the rubble in Gaza told CBS News this week that they just want the bombs to stop falling, and many were doubtful that a change in U.S. leadership could precipitate that.",
      "\"For me, Republicans or Democrats are the same thing,\" Gaza resident Firas Abu Firas said before election day. \"They are two faces on the same coin.\"",
      "Hamas reacts",
      "Basem Naim, a long-time senior figure in the Hamas regime that ruled over the Palestinian Gaza Strip for almost two decades before the group sparked the ongoing war with Israel with its unprecedented terrorist attack more than a year ago, called Trump's reelection, \"a private matter for the Americans,\" but said in a statement Wednesday that \"Palestinians look forward to an immediate cessation of the aggression against our people, especially in Gaza, and look for assistance in achieving their legitimate rights of freedom, independence, and the establishment of their independent self sovereign state with Jerusalem as its capital.\"",
      "International diplomatic efforts toward a so-called \"two-state solution,\" which would see an independent state of Palestine created alongside Israel, have all but vanished amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "U.S. administrations from both sides of the political aisle have pushed for such a solution to the nearly seven-decade crisis in the heart of the Middle East, but with the current Israeli administration firmly opposed to the notion of Palestinian statehood, most Palestinians saw little reason for hope regardless of who won the U.S. election.",
      "Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te",
      "Taiwan President Lai Ching-te offered his \"sincere congratulations\" to Trump on Wednesday, saying he was \"confident that the longstanding\u00a0#Taiwan-#US partnership, built on shared values & interests, will continue to serve as a cornerstone for regional stability & lead to greater prosperity for us all.\"",
      "The United States is bound by domestic law to back Taiwan, an island off China's eastern coast that's claimed by Beijing as Chinese territory but which has had its own democratic government for decades, if it faces military aggression.",
      "China's President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under the rule of his Communist Party, by force if necessary, creating one of the most risky global military standoffs on the planet. Chinese and Taiwanese military vessels and aircraft have regularly entered each others' territory in recent months, increasing the tension as U.S. vessels continue \"freedom of navigation\" operations in the region.",
      "During and before the campaign, Trump dodged questions about whether the U.S. would come to the aid of Taiwan if China launched an invasion with him in the White House. In a July interview with The Associated Press,\u00a0he said\u00a0Taiwan should pay the U.S. more for helping ensure its defense.",
      "European Union's Ursula von der Leyen",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Union bloc's governing body, the European Commission, congratulated Trump on Wednesday and iterated her hope in a brief\u00a0social media post\u00a0that the U.S. and EU could \"work together on a strong transatlantic agenda that keeps delivering\" for citizens on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "\"I warmly congratulate Donald J. Trump. The EU and the US are more than just allies,\" Von der Leyen said. \"We are bound by a true partnership between our people, uniting 800 million citizens. So let's work together on a strong transatlantic agenda that keeps delivering for them.\"",
      "Italian premier Giorgia Meloni",
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni congratulated Trump Wednesday, lauding what she called \"unshakeable\" ties between the U.S. and Italy.",
      "\"Italy and the United States are 'sister' nations, linked by an unshakeable alliance, common values and a historic friendship. It is a strategic bond which I am sure we will now strengthen even more,\" Italy's far-right leader wrote in a statement posted to social media.",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan congratulated \"my friend Donald Trump\" Wednesday with a message posted on social media.",
      "The leader of the sometimes contentious NATO ally, who's taken a strong stance against Israel's handling of the ongoing wars with Hamas and Hezbollah, voiced his hope that \"Turkey-US relations will strengthen, that regional and global crises and wars, especially the Palestinian issue and the Russia-Ukraine war, will come to an end.\"",
      "\"I believe that more efforts will be made for a more just world,\" said Erdogan. \"I hope that the elections will be beneficial for our friendly and allied people in the United States and for all of humanity.\"",

      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro",
      "Colombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro congratulated Trump on Wednesday and lauded the U.S. democratic process, which he said would be respected, but took the opportunity also to challenge the president-elect's vows to close the U.S. border to undocumented migrants as unrealistic.",
      "\"The only way to seal the boarders is through the prosperity of the communities of the south and the end of blockades,\" he said.",
      "Petro also alluded to concerns that Trump will lead the world's biggest economy further away from goals to address man-made climate change, saying the dialogue between the global north and south continues, \"and the reality of the climate collapse will force us to rally around a solution.\"",
      "Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva",
      "Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known widely simply as Lula, offered his congratulations to Trump Wednesday \"on his election victory and return to the presidency of the United States.\"",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is the projected winner of the 2024 election, besting Vice President Kamala Harris for the highest office in the land.",
      "CBS News projected the former president will win multiple battleground states. As of Wednesday morning, Trump was also ahead in the popular vote, something that eluded him in 2016.",
      "Although Trump was projected the winner early Wednesday, Nov. 6, it will be several months before Trump takes office. Here's what to know about when he will be sworn in.",
      "When will Trump be sworn in?",
      "President-elect Trump will be sworn in at his inauguration. The presidential inauguration is always held on Jan. 20, as specified by the Constitution's 20th Amendment.",
      "The president-elect becomes the president immediately after being sworn in. The new president typically moves into the White House after the ceremony.",
      "Trump has vowed to end the war in Ukraine before Inauguration Day, but he has no presidential powers before being sworn in. He has made a number of promises for his presidency, including ending ObamaCare and beginning mass deportations of migrants. In his closing message the night before Election Day, Trump promised greatness if he won.",
      "\"After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history,\" Trump said. \"You watch, it's going to be so good, it's going to be so much fun. It'll be nasty a little bit at times, and maybe at the beginning, in particular, but it's going to be something.\"",
      "What happens on Inauguration Day?",
      "The inauguration is about two and a half months after Election Day. It begins with a procession to the Capitol, according to the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.",
      "The vice president recites his oath of office and is sworn in first. Around noon, the president recites his own oath of office and is sworn in.",
      "Then, the president gives an inaugural address. The speech usually outlines a president's vision and goals for their term. At his first inauguration, Trump said he was planning on \"transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American people.\"",
      "After the speech, the previous president makes an honorary departure from the Capitol. That's followed by a signing ceremony, where the new president signs their first official actions. That's followed by a number of ceremonies.",
      "The final traditional event of the inauguration is the pass-in review, when the president and vice president review military troops before leading a procession of ceremonial military regiments, citizens' groups, floats and marching bands from the Capitol to the White House.",
      "The president-elect recites this oath, as required by the U.S. Constitution, ahead of being sworn in, according to the Congressional committee:",
      "\"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"",
      "The vice presidential oath of office is the same as the vow taken by senators, representatives, and other federal employees, according to the Congressional committee:",
      "\"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.\"",

      "Dow futures soared nearly 1,400 points, or 3.2%, lifting the blue-chip market into record terrain before the start of trade on Wednesday. S&P 500 futures were up more than 2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also looked set to open strong.",
      "\"U.S. equity futures have traded up while election results have been tallied. In our base case, we expect the S&P 500 to rise to 6,600 by the end of 2025, a near-15% price return from current levels, driven by our expectations of benign U.S. growth, lower interest rates and the continued structural tailwind from AI,\" Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email. \"Lower corporate taxes and/or deregulation of the energy and financial sectors under a Trump administration could provide additional support.\"",
      "Cryptocurrency is also surging as investors bet that the second Trump administration will benefit the volatile sector. Bitcoin prices rose nearly 8% to a record $75,345.00 in early trading, before dipping to about $73,500.",
      "The former president, who was once critical of digital currencies, pledged during his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and to create a bitcoin \"strategic reserve.\"",
      "\"Bitcoin is the one asset that was always going to soar if Trump returned to the White House,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, a British online investment platform.",
      "\"Trump has already declared his love of the digital currency and crypto traders now have a new narrative by which to get even more excited about where the price could go,\" he added.",
      "The Republican Party's electoral success on Tuesday, which included winning control of the Senate, is also benefiting Trump's personal finances by boosting the stock price of Trump Media & Technology Group. Shares in the company, which owns the social network Truth Social and in which Trump owns a stake valued at more than $5 billion, jumped nearly 38% to $46.80 before markets opened.",
      "Although markets have pushed to new highs this year, Wall Street analysts warn that some of Trump's key policy proposals could rekindle U.S. inflation, dampen economic growth and drive up the nation's debt. Specifically, Trump has proposed imposing tariffs of up to 20% on foreign goods and up to 60% on Chinese imports.",
      "The Federal Reserve will offer its latest readout on the state of the economy on Thursday, with Wall Street analysts expecting the central bank to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point.

    "summary": "Former President Donald Trump prevailed in his third presidential bid \u2014 after four indictments, one conviction, two Democratic opponents and two assassination attempts.",
    "story": [
      "Donald J. Trump's projected victory over Kamala Harris in the 2024\u00a0presidential election marks a historic and improbable comeback for the former president, who left office in 2021 after failing to overturn the 2020 election results. Afterward, he became the first former president to be charged with either state or federal crimes, with four separate indictments, one of which resulted in conviction.",
      "\"We overcame obstacles that nobody ever thought we could,\" he said on election night after a bitter, bruising campaign. He vowed to fight for every family and for their futures. \"This will truly be the golden age of America,\" he vowed.",
      "Trump was projected by CBS News to have won the battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 surpassing the electoral vote threshold of 270 by 6 votes with a total of 276. Votes were still being counted in the other battleground states of Michigan, Nevada and Arizona when Trump secured the presidency.",
      "Exit polling shows Trump won overwhelmingly among White voters without a college education and made inroads with Black and Latino men.",
      "Throughout his two-year campaign, Trump hammered President Biden, and later Harris, on inflation and the economy. It's a message that resonated with voters, whose views on the economy are more negative now than they were in 2020, despite the pandemic that brought the economy to a halt during his presidency. Nationally and across the battleground states, on the question of whether voters are better off now than they were four years ago, more voters said they are financially worse off.",
      "In Georgia, independent voters broke for Trump in Georgia, 54% to 43%, according to CBS News exit polls. This is a group that backed Mr. Biden in 2020 by 9 points. The economy was their top issue.",
      "Harris and Trump attracted equal support from independents in North Carolina, but that meant the vice president was winning a smaller share than Mr. Biden did in 2020. Even with that edge, North Carolina was the lone battleground state Trump won that year.",
      "Trump also ran hard on immigration \u2014 as he has for nearly a decade \u2014 and vowed at nearly every campaign event that he'd carry out mass deportations if he's reelected. Exit polling showed that voters also believed Trump would do a better job of confronting illegal immigration at the southern border.",
      "Trump has had an unshakeable base of voters, and in this election, he was able to attract new\u00a0 voters who were undecided \u2014 low-propensity, young male voters \u2014\u00a0 turned out for him.",
      "Trump is the first convicted felon to win the presidency. Sentencing for his federal conviction in the New York \"hush money\" trial is set for Nov. 26 and raises questions about how a president-elect would be punished under the law. He also faces criminal charges in three other cases whose futures are now in doubt.",
      "At 78, Trump is the oldest person to be elected president \u2014 breaking the record held by President Biden, who withdrew from the 2024 presidential race in July amid questions about his age and competency. Mr. Biden was also 78 when he took office in 2021, but on Inauguration Day, Trump will be several months older than Mr. Biden was when he was sworn in.",
      "On his path to the presidency, Trump also survived two assassination attempts, one during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, when a gunman's bullet grazed his ear, and a separate incident at his West Palm Beach golf club on Sept. 15 when a suspect fled after the Secret Service opened fire.",
      "Launched 2024 campaign 2 years ago",
      "Trump launched his 2024 campaign in November 2022, at his home in Florida, shortly after Republicans fell short of their expectations of a \"red wave\" in the midterm elections. He built his campaign on retribution, anti-immigrant rhetoric and a continued populist shift in his economic and social policies.",
      "He held his first rally in Waco, Texas, months later, on March 24, 2023 \u2014 the 30th anniversary of the standoff there between federal agents and Branch Davidian cult led by David Koresh that led to the death of 82 members. Trump characterized his own race as the \"final battle\" and promised vengeance against perceived political enemies.",
      "\"I am your warrior, I am your justice,\" Trump said, flanked by \"witch hunt\" signs surrounding the stage. \"For those who have been wronged and betrayed \u2026 I am your retribution.\"",
      "United States v. Donald J. Trump",
      "Trump's 2024 campaign was for a few months dominated by the four indictments against him. In March 2023, he was indicted by the Manhattan district attorney on fraud charges stemming from his role in hush money payments made to an adult film star before the 2016 election.",
      "In addition to the New York case, Trump was indicted in two separate federal cases filed by special counsel Jack Smith. He faced charges in Florida of mishandling classified documents he tried to keep at his home after his presidency at his home. That case was dismissed by a judge who ruled that Smith's appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional. Smith is appealing that decision.",
      "In Washington, D.C., he faces charges over his alleged efforts to subvert the peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election. The judge in this case has yet to set a date for the trial as the parties remain in litigation over what classified material can be included, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that presidents have some immunity from prosecution for official actions taken while in office.",
      "In Georgia, he was indicted with over a dozen others on charges stemming from efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. That case has been on hold by an appeals court since June.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty in all of the cases against him.",
      "Trump's first indictment and only conviction in the New York hush money trial only bolstered his poll numbers and his fundraising, solidifying his control over the Republican Party in the early stages of the primary campaign. Within 24 hours of his conviction, he raised over\u00a0$52.8 million.",
      "Republican primaries",
      "Trump faced a number of primary opponents, including two who served in his administration, former Vice President Mike Pence and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. At the outset, Trump's biggest threat appeared to be Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a conservative governor whose state had the strongest showing for Republicans in the midterm elections. But DeSantis failed to gain traction with GOP voters and dropped his bid in January after finishing 30 points behind Trump in the Iowa caucuses.",
      "Haley, Trump's remaining primary opponent, won only two contests \u2014\u00a0 Vermont and Washington, D.C. Trump never participated in a primary debate.",
      "Once Trump clinched the nomination, he installed loyalists inside the Republican National Committee, naming North Carolina GOP chairman Michael Whatley and his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as the party's co-chairs. The pair focused on \"election integrity\" in battleground states, filing lawsuits over voter rolls and early-voting laws while they worked to convince conservatives that the early voting system Trump disparaged for years was necessary for him to win.",
      "Trump continued to cast doubt on early voting, which he saw as a tool for Democrats to try to steal the 2024 election from him.",
      "A new race \u2014 and an assassination attempt",
      "After Trump and Mr. Biden clinched their respective nominations, their debate, hosted by CNN, was scheduled for June 27. It became the most consequential debate in U.S. history when Mr. Biden's performance, marred by gaffes, unfinished sentences and mumbling, caused Democratic leaders and voters to question his ability to serve another term because of his age.",
      "Trump did not campaign for 10 days following the debate, as a growing list of Democrats called on Mr. Biden's cognitive ability to continue his reelection bid.",
      "Mid-July was a turning point in the 2024 race, upending the presidential campaign.",
      "On July 13, Trump survived an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, when his ear was\u00a0 grazed by a bullet after a gunman fired several times at him during a rally just before the Republican convention.",
      "A day and a half later, Trump tapped Ohio GOP Sen. JD Vance, a first-term senator and bestselling author of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\"\u00a0 to be his running mate.",
      "Days later he accepted the Republican Party nomination for the third time, making him the first Republican to secure the party nomination three times since Richard Nixon.",
      "A few days later, Mr. Biden exited the race and backed Harris for the Democratic nomination.",
      "Just two months after the attempt on his life in Butler, Trump's life was put in danger again after an attempted gunman, armed with a rifle, was spotted at his golf course in West Palm Beach on Sept. 15. Trump returned to Butler on Oct. 5 for a rally with Elon Musk.",
      "Focus on Harris in final days of campaign",
      "With Mr. Biden out of the race, Trump trained their attention onto Harris, whom he disparaged as \"low IQ\" and \"stupid.\"",
      "The Trump campaign labeled Harris \"border czar\" \u2013 a reference to her assignment by Mr. Biden to address the root causes of migration into the U.S. from central American countries \u2013 and repeatedly attacked her on immigration. He profanely disparaged her, calling Harris a \"sh** vice president\" and claiming she was \"importing illegal alien rapists and murderers.\"",
      "Immigration was a constant in all of three of Trump's bids for the White House. He promised mass deportations for migrants and promised to establish the death penalty for any migrant who kills a U.S. citizen.",
      "In the final week before the election, his campaign was embroiled in controversy. His rally at New York's Madison Square Garden was overshadowed by comments made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to Puerto Rico as a \"floating island of garbage,\" among other racist jokes.",
      "During an interview with Tucker Carlson, he called former Rep. Liz Cheney, one of his most vocal critics, a \"war hawk\" and suggested she'd have a different opinion on foreign wars if she had guns pointed at her.",
      "Trump also ramped up his rhetoric against the media, telling supporters two days before the election that he wouldn't mind if someone tried to shoot through the media riser to assassinate him, as he complained about the bulletproof glass positioned around him.",
      "In his closing message on the trail in Georgia, Trump promised greatness if he won.",
      "\"After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history,\" Trump said. \"You watch, it's going to be so good, it's going to be so much fun. It'll be nasty a little bit at times, and maybe at the beginning, in particular, but it's going to be something.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Josh Stein, the North Carolina attorney general, will defeat Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson in the state's gubernatorial race, CBS News projects.",
      "Stein, a Democrat, is set to become the first Jewish governor in the state's history, and previously served in the state Senate before becoming attorney general. His projected victory comes as his opponent was roiled in scandal, with a slew of inflammatory comments unearthed on a number of topics since the campaign began.",
      "\"Tonight, the people of North Carolina resoundingly embraced a vision,\" Stein said in his acceptance speech Tuesday night. \"We chose hope over hate, competence over chaos, decency over division. That's who we are as North Carolinians.\"",
      "Robinson, who gained prominence in Republican circles after he delivered a viral pro-gun rights speech, has made inflammatory comments across a number of topics \u2014 from Islam to abortion to feminism \u2014 but he's been especially vocal on LGBTQ+ issues.",
      "Since the primary, Robinson's campaign had been marred by the resurgence of posts he's made online, which spurred concern among Republicans about their nominee's prospects in the coming election. Then, in September, a CNN investigation shook the gubernatorial race, tying Robinson to a slew of incendiary, explicit and racist comments on a pornographic website more than a decade ago. Robinson denied the CNN report, while insisting that he wouldn't drop out of the race.",
      "Robinson, who would have been the first Black governor of North Carolina, was endorsed by former President Donald Trump ahead of the primary, who called him \"Martin Luther King on steroids.\" In the aftermath of the CNN report, the GOP largely distanced itself from the lieutenant governor, while Robinson lost campaign staff, and ad buys for him were not renewed.",
      "With the projected victory, Stein is set to replace Gov. Roy Cooper, a term-limited Democrat. Democrats have frequently won gubernatorial races in North Carolina, but Republicans were eager to flip the governor's mansion this year, with voters having elected Republicans to a number of statewide offices in recent years.",
      "North Carolina is a major battleground state this cycle, with among the closest margins of any state Trump won in 2020. At the time, Trump's victory seemed to set up Republican victories down the ticket. But experts have questioned whether Robinson's presence on the ticket could hurt the former president this year.",

      "An unpiloted SpaceX Dragon cargo ship caught up with the International Space Station and glided in for a smooth docking on Tuesday \u2014\u00a0Election Day\u00a0across the U.S. \u2014 bringing 3 tons of supplies, science gear and other equipment to the lab, including holiday treats for the crew.",
      "The Dragon's Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from historic launch pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 9:29 p.m. EST Monday, lighting up the night sky for miles around as it climbed away atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust.",
      "After boosting the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the first stage, making its fifth flight, peeled away, reversed course and headed back to an on-target landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station while the second stage continued the climb to space.",
      "The landing marked SpaceX's 57th successful booster recovery at the Florida Space Force station and its 363rd overall, including California flights and droneship landings.",
      "Just under 10 minutes after liftoff, the vacuum-optimized engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage shut down and one minute later, the Dragon was released to fly on its own.",
      "Running slightly ahead of schedule, the cargo ship executed a series of rendezvous rocket firings, catching up with the space station from behind and below before looping up to docking at the lab's forward port at 9:52 a.m.",
      "\"Welcome aboard, Dragon,\" astronaut Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore radioed from inside the station. \"Nice to  have you aboard.\" Station commander Sunita Williams, referring to the  successful docking in general and the food on board in particular,  added: \"Just want to say thank you to SpaceX, the International Space  Station program, the Commercial Crew program for bringing us... honey.\"",
      "One of the first items on the agenda is a test Friday to determine the Cargo Dragon's ability to boost the space station's orbit slightly using its aft-facing thrusters. The ISS is routinely re-boosted by Russian Progress freighters and Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ships, but Friday's test will be a first for SpaceX.",
      "The California rocket builder is under contract to NASA to build a powerful space tug of sorts that can be used to safely drive the ISS back into the atmosphere when the lab complex is retired in the 2030 timeframe. The vehicle is needed to make sure the station breaks up over a stretch of ocean well away from populated areas and shipping lanes.",
      "During the test Friday, the Cargo Dragon's aft thrusters will fire for about 12 minutes.",
      "\"The data that we're going to collect from this reboost and attitude control demonstration will be very helpful, informing SpaceX analyses on how the system performs,\" said Jared Metter, SpaceX director of flight reliability. \"This data is going to lead to future capabilities, namely the US de-orbit vehicle.\"",
      "Reboost aside, the Cargo Dragon is loaded with slightly more than 6,000 pounds of equipment and supplies, including 2,022 pounds of science gear, 2,119 pounds of crew clothing, food and other supplies, 377 pounds of spacewalk equipment, 525 pounds of space station hardware and 44 pounds of computer equipment.",
      "One of the more unusual payloads: Lignosat, a small wooden satellite using a framework of magnolia panels built by researchers at Kyoto University in Japan and the Tokyo-based logging company Sumitomo.",
      "\"While some of you might think that wood in space seems a little counterintuitive, researchers hope that this investigation demonstrates that a wooden satellite can be more sustainable and less polluting for the environment than conventional satellites,\" said Meghan Everett, the ISS deputy project scientist.",
      "\"The main objective here is to determine whether wood can be used in space, and to do this, researchers will measure the temperature and strain of the wooden structure and see how it might change in the vacuum environment of space with atomic oxygen and radiation conditions as well.\"",
      "As with all station-bound Dragon cargo ships, the crew supplies include fresh food and special treats for holiday meals.",
      "Bill Spetch, ISS operations and integration manager, said the \"food kit\" includes \"citrus, apples, sweet onions, blueberries, radishes, etc,\" along with lobster, crab and quail for holiday meals. A variety of cheeses is on board as well as fresh coffee and personal items requested by each crew member.",
      "Mounted in the Dragon's unpressurized trunk section is the Coronal Diagnostic Experiment, or CODEX, an instrument that will be mounted outside the space station to learn more about how charged particles in the solar wind are heated to millions of degrees and accelerated to enormous velocities, affecting Earth's space environment and the rest of the solar system.",
      "Inside the station, the astronauts will have a variety of new experiments and instruments to operate and monitor, including one called ARTEMOSS that will examine how Antarctic moss tolerates the space radiation and microgravity environment to learn more about how plants might be used in future life support systems.",
      "The European Space Agency is sending up a space exposure experiment to learn more about how high-tech materials respond to prolonged exposure to the weightless environment and another experiment to study how organic samples degrade when exposed to unfiltered ultraviolet light from the sun.",
      "And in an experiment that could be particularly useful to future astronauts, a small device known as Nanolab Astrobeat, provided by the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology, will test cold welding technology that could prove useful for repairing leaks or other damage from inside a spacecraft.",

Another recirculated a debunked claim that Michigan voters were casting multiple ballots.",

The Obama-era policy took effect in 2012.",

      "President-elect Trump will be sworn in at his inauguration. The presidential inauguration is always held on Jan. 20, as specified by the Constitution's 20th Amendment.",
      "The president-elect becomes the president immediately after being sworn in. The new president typically moves into the White House after the ceremony.",
      "Trump has vowed to end the war in Ukraine before Inauguration Day, but he has no presidential powers before being sworn in. He has made a number of promises for his presidency, including ending ObamaCare and beginning mass deportations of migrants. In his closing message the night before Election Day, Trump promised greatness if he won.",
      "\"After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history,\" Trump said. \"You watch, it's going to be so good, it's going to be so much fun. It'll be nasty a little bit at times, and maybe at the beginning, in particular, but it's going to be something.\"",
      "What happens on Inauguration Day?",
      "The inauguration is about two and a half months after Election Day. It begins with a procession to the Capitol, according to the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.",
      "The vice president recites his oath of office and is sworn in first. Around noon, the president recites his own oath of office and is sworn in.",
      "Then, the president gives an inaugural address. The speech usually outlines a president's vision and goals for their term. At his first inauguration, Trump said he was planning on \"transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American people.\"",
      "After the speech, the previous president makes an honorary departure from the Capitol. That's followed by a signing ceremony, where the new president signs their first official actions. That's followed by a number of ceremonies.",
      "The final traditional event of the inauguration is the pass-in review, when the president and vice president review military troops before leading a procession of ceremonial military regiments, citizens' groups, floats and marching bands from the Capitol to the White House.",
      "The president-elect recites this oath, as required by the U.S. Constitution, ahead of being sworn in, according to the Congressional committee:",
      "\"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"",
      "The vice presidential oath of office is the same as the vow taken by senators, representatives, and other federal employees, according to the Congressional committee:",
      "\"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.\"",

      "\"U.S. equity futures have traded up while election results have been tallied. In our base case, we expect the S&P 500 to rise to 6,600 by the end of 2025, a near-15% price return from current levels, driven by our expectations of benign U.S. growth, lower interest rates and the continued structural tailwind from AI,\" Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email. \"Lower corporate taxes and/or deregulation of the energy and financial sectors under a Trump administration could provide additional support.\"",

      "The former president, who was once critical of digital currencies, pledged during his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and to create a bitcoin \"strategic reserve.\"",

    "summary": "Former President Donald Trump prevailed in his third presidential bid \u2014 after four indictments, one conviction, two Democratic opponents and two assassination attempts.",
    "story": [
      "Donald J. Trump's projected victory over Kamala Harris in the 2024\u00a0presidential election marks a historic and improbable comeback for the former president, who left office in 2021 after failing to overturn the 2020 election results. Afterward, he became the first former president to be charged with either state or federal crimes, with four separate indictments, one of which resulted in conviction.",
      "\"We overcame obstacles that nobody ever thought we could,\" he said on election night after a bitter, bruising campaign. He vowed to fight for every family and for their futures. \"This will truly be the golden age of America,\" he vowed.",
      "Trump was projected by CBS News to have won the battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 surpassing the electoral vote threshold of 270 by 6 votes with a total of 276. Votes were still being counted in the other battleground states of Michigan, Nevada and Arizona when Trump secured the presidency.",
      "Exit polling shows Trump won overwhelmingly among White voters without a college education and made inroads with Black and Latino men.",
      "Throughout his two-year campaign, Trump hammered President Biden, and later Harris, on inflation and the economy. It's a message that resonated with voters, whose views on the economy are more negative now than they were in 2020, despite the pandemic that brought the economy to a halt during his presidency. Nationally and across the battleground states, on the question of whether voters are better off now than they were four years ago, more voters said they are financially worse off.",
      "In Georgia, independent voters broke for Trump in Georgia, 54% to 43%, according to CBS News exit polls. This is a group that backed Mr. Biden in 2020 by 9 points. The economy was their top issue.",
      "Harris and Trump attracted equal support from independents in North Carolina, but that meant the vice president was winning a smaller share than Mr. Biden did in 2020. Even with that edge, North Carolina was the lone battleground state Trump won that year.",
      "Trump also ran hard on immigration \u2014 as he has for nearly a decade \u2014 and vowed at nearly every campaign event that he'd carry out mass deportations if he's reelected. Exit polling showed that voters also believed Trump would do a better job of confronting illegal immigration at the southern border.",
      "Trump has had an unshakeable base of voters, and in this election, he was able to attract new\u00a0 voters who were undecided \u2014 low-propensity, young male voters \u2014\u00a0 turned out for him.",
      "Trump is the first convicted felon to win the presidency. Sentencing for his federal conviction in the New York \"hush money\" trial is set for Nov. 26 and raises questions about how a president-elect would be punished under the law. He also faces criminal charges in three other cases whose futures are now in doubt.",
      "At 78, Trump is the oldest person to be elected president \u2014 breaking the record held by President Biden, who withdrew from the 2024 presidential race in July amid questions about his age and competency. Mr. Biden was also 78 when he took office in 2021, but on Inauguration Day, Trump will be several months older than Mr. Biden was when he was sworn in.",
      "On his path to the presidency, Trump also survived two assassination attempts, one during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, when a gunman's bullet grazed his ear, and a separate incident at his West Palm Beach golf club on Sept. 15 when a suspect fled after the Secret Service opened fire.",
      "Launched 2024 campaign 2 years ago",
      "Trump launched his 2024 campaign in November 2022, at his home in Florida, shortly after Republicans fell short of their expectations of a \"red wave\" in the midterm elections. He built his campaign on retribution, anti-immigrant rhetoric and a continued populist shift in his economic and social policies.",
      "He held his first rally in Waco, Texas, months later, on March 24, 2023 \u2014 the 30th anniversary of the standoff there between federal agents and Branch Davidian cult led by David Koresh that led to the death of 82 members. Trump characterized his own race as the \"final battle\" and promised vengeance against perceived political enemies.",
      "\"I am your warrior, I am your justice,\" Trump said, flanked by \"witch hunt\" signs surrounding the stage. \"For those who have been wronged and betrayed \u2026 I am your retribution.\"",
      "United States v. Donald J. Trump",
      "Trump's 2024 campaign was for a few months dominated by the four indictments against him. In March 2023, he was indicted by the Manhattan district attorney on fraud charges stemming from his role in hush money payments made to an adult film star before the 2016 election.",
      "In addition to the New York case, Trump was indicted in two separate federal cases filed by special counsel Jack Smith. He faced charges in Florida of mishandling classified documents he tried to keep at his home after his presidency at his home. That case was dismissed by a judge who ruled that Smith's appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional. Smith is appealing that decision.",
      "In Washington, D.C., he faces charges over his alleged efforts to subvert the peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election. The judge in this case has yet to set a date for the trial as the parties remain in litigation over what classified material can be included, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that presidents have some immunity from prosecution for official actions taken while in office.",
      "In Georgia, he was indicted with over a dozen others on charges stemming from efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. That case has been on hold by an appeals court since June.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty in all of the cases against him.",
      "Trump's first indictment and only conviction in the New York hush money trial only bolstered his poll numbers and his fundraising, solidifying his control over the Republican Party in the early stages of the primary campaign. Within 24 hours of his conviction, he raised over\u00a0$52.8 million.",
      "Republican primaries",
      "Trump faced a number of primary opponents, including two who served in his administration, former Vice President Mike Pence and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. At the outset, Trump's biggest threat appeared to be Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a conservative governor whose state had the strongest showing for Republicans in the midterm elections. But DeSantis failed to gain traction with GOP voters and dropped his bid in January after finishing 30 points behind Trump in the Iowa caucuses.",
      "Haley, Trump's remaining primary opponent, won only two contests \u2014\u00a0 Vermont and Washington, D.C. Trump never participated in a primary debate.",
      "Once Trump clinched the nomination, he installed loyalists inside the Republican National Committee, naming North Carolina GOP chairman Michael Whatley and his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as the party's co-chairs. The pair focused on \"election integrity\" in battleground states, filing lawsuits over voter rolls and early-voting laws while they worked to convince conservatives that the early voting system Trump disparaged for years was necessary for him to win.",
      "Trump continued to cast doubt on early voting, which he saw as a tool for Democrats to try to steal the 2024 election from him.",
      "A new race \u2014 and an assassination attempt",
      "After Trump and Mr. Biden clinched their respective nominations, their debate, hosted by CNN, was scheduled for June 27. It became the most consequential debate in U.S. history when Mr. Biden's performance, marred by gaffes, unfinished sentences and mumbling, caused Democratic leaders and voters to question his ability to serve another term because of his age.",
      "Trump did not campaign for 10 days following the debate, as a growing list of Democrats called on Mr. Biden's cognitive ability to continue his reelection bid.",
      "Mid-July was a turning point in the 2024 race, upending the presidential campaign.",
      "On July 13, Trump survived an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, when his ear was\u00a0 grazed by a bullet after a gunman fired several times at him during a rally just before the Republican convention.",
      "A day and a half later, Trump tapped Ohio GOP Sen. JD Vance, a first-term senator and bestselling author of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\"\u00a0 to be his running mate.",
      "Days later he accepted the Republican Party nomination for the third time, making him the first Republican to secure the party nomination three times since Richard Nixon.",
      "A few days later, Mr. Biden exited the race and backed Harris for the Democratic nomination.",
      "Just two months after the attempt on his life in Butler, Trump's life was put in danger again after an attempted gunman, armed with a rifle, was spotted at his golf course in West Palm Beach on Sept. 15. Trump returned to Butler on Oct. 5 for a rally with Elon Musk.",
      "Focus on Harris in final days of campaign",
      "With Mr. Biden out of the race, Trump trained their attention onto Harris, whom he disparaged as \"low IQ\" and \"stupid.\"",
      "The Trump campaign labeled Harris \"border czar\" \u2013 a reference to her assignment by Mr. Biden to address the root causes of migration into the U.S. from central American countries \u2013 and repeatedly attacked her on immigration. He profanely disparaged her, calling Harris a \"sh** vice president\" and claiming she was \"importing illegal alien rapists and murderers.\"",
      "Immigration was a constant in all of three of Trump's bids for the White House. He promised mass deportations for migrants and promised to establish the death penalty for any migrant who kills a U.S. citizen.",
      "In the final week before the election, his campaign was embroiled in controversy. His rally at New York's Madison Square Garden was overshadowed by comments made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to Puerto Rico as a \"floating island of garbage,\" among other racist jokes.",
      "During an interview with Tucker Carlson, he called former Rep. Liz Cheney, one of his most vocal critics, a \"war hawk\" and suggested she'd have a different opinion on foreign wars if she had guns pointed at her.",
      "Trump also ramped up his rhetoric against the media, telling supporters two days before the election that he wouldn't mind if someone tried to shoot through the media riser to assassinate him, as he complained about the bulletproof glass positioned around him.",
      "In his closing message on the trail in Georgia, Trump promised greatness if he won.",
      "\"After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history,\" Trump said. \"You watch, it's going to be so good, it's going to be so much fun. It'll be nasty a little bit at times, and maybe at the beginning, in particular, but it's going to be something.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 05:00:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve will make a rate cut decision on November 7. Here's what economists expect.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Thursday is expected to cut interest rates for the second time this year, with the decision coming less than two months after its surprise jumbo cut in September.",
      "The Fed is expected to shave borrowing costs by 0.25 percentage points, or half the size of its September reduction, according to forecasts from economists polled by FactSet. That would bring the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for borrowing money \u2014 down to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% from its current 4.75% to 5% level.",
      "With the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure dropping to 2.1% last month, just shy of the Fed's 2% goal, the central bank is easing off the brakes it applied when inflation hit a 40-year high during the pandemic. High borrowing costs have made it more expensive to buy everything from homes to cars.",
      "If the Fed cuts rates by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday as predicted, the move will provide some added relief for consumers, although the initial benefit will be small, experts say. The Fed is expected to continue cutting rates at its next several meetings, which could snowball into bigger savings for borrowers.",
      "\"Once a few more cuts happen over the next few months, the impact will add up to something that moves the needle for the average person struggling with debt,\" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst, in an email. \"For now, however, the effect of these cuts won't be very noticeable.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Thursday's Fed meeting.",
      "Is the Fed going to cut interest rates?",
      "Yes, the Fed is expected to shave its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday, November 7, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "\"Ongoing price and wage growth disinflation along with strong productivity growth should favor a gradual recalibration of Fed policy with a 25bps rate cut post-election following an outsized 50bps 'catch-up' rate cut in September,\" noted EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an October 31 report.",
      "Daco expects that the Fed will cut rates by an additional 0.25 percentage points at every meeting through June 2025. That will bring the federal funds rate to 4.4% in December and 3.4% in June.",
      "What time is the Fed rate decision?",
      "The Fed will announce its decision at 2 p.m. ET on Nov. 7, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m.",
      "The next Fed rate decision will be announced on Dec. 18.",
      "How low will rates go in 2024?",
      "The Fed is expected to cut its benchmark rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its December meeting. That would reflect a full percentage point cut from its pre-September level, when the federal funds rate was at its highest in more than two decades.",
      "But that doesn't mean mortgage rates or other borrowing costs will decline to that level, as lenders like mortgage companies and credit card companies make money by charging higher terms to consumers than the federal funds rate.",
      "Even so, borrowers should see some relief. Already, credit card rates are slightly lower, although they still remain close to record highs, according to Schulz.",
      "\"While they'll almost certainly continue to fall in coming months, no one should expect dramatically reduced credit card bills anytime soon,\" he added. \"Unless the Fed dramatically accelerates its pace of rate cuts, it'll still be a while before these reductions add up to more than just a few dollars per month coming off your bill.\"",
      "Will mortgage rates drop?",
      "Despite the Fed's September cut, mortgage rates have increased over the last month, with the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan sitting at about 6.72%, according to Freddie Mac. That's up from a September low of 6.08%.",
      "Even though the Fed's rate decisions impact mortgage rates, home borrowing costs are also affected by economic trends such as unemployment. Meanwhile, Treasury yields have been on the rise due to concerns about rising U.S. debt and the presidential election.",
      "\"As long as investors remain worried about what the future may bring, Treasury yields, and, by extension, mortgage rates are going to have a tough time falling and staying down,\" noted Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree.",

    "summary": "From enthusiasm from Israel's leader to thinly veiled anxiety from some of America's oldest European allies, foreign reaction to Trump's election victory is rolling in fast.",
    "story": [
      "With former President Donald Trump set to reprise his role as the commander in chief of the world's most powerful military and largest economy \u2014 and with him wasting no time in claiming victory in the\u00a0U.S. presidential election \u2014 leaders around the world started reacting Wednesday to the reality of a second term in the White House for the businessman-turned politician.",
      "From enthusiasm voiced by Israel's leader as he wages an expanding, multi-front war to anxiety from some of America's closest, generations-old European allies, the reaction to Trump's election performance started rolling in long before the final votes were counted across the U.S.",
      "Below is a look at how some foreign leaders and others around the world have taken the news of the American electorate's apparent rebuke of Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party at the polls.",
      "Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered his congratulations to Trump on Wednesday, calling his election performance \"history's greatest comeback!\"",
      "\"Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America,\" Netanyahu said. \"This is a huge victory!\"",
      "Despite Trump's criticism of the Israeli leader's handling of the ongoing war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Netanyahu was widely believed to favor the former U.S. leader in the U.S. election, as tension between Washington and Tel Aviv has risen sharply over the last year due to Israel's tactics in its multi-front war with Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East.",
      "The war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that saw the militants kill some 1,200 people and kidnap about 250 others, has now killed more than 43,000 people in the Palestinian territory, according to its Hamas-run health ministry. Israel has also significantly ramped-up its assault on Hezbollah, Hamas' fellow-Iranian backed allies in Lebanon. The Israeli offensive there has killed more than 3,000 people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.",
      "The Biden administration has continued pushing for cease-fires on both fronts, to no avail, and demanding that Israel do more to mitigate the devastating impact of the wars on civilians.",
      "Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy",
      "Ukraine's war-time President Volodymyr Zelenskyy congratulated Trump Wednesday for what he called an \"impressive election victory,\" and said he looked forward to \"an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump's decisive leadership.\"",
      "\"I recall our great meeting with President Trump back in September, when we discussed in detail the Ukraine-U.S. strategic partnership, the Victory Plan, and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post, adding that his country was interested \"in developing mutually beneficial political and economic cooperation that will benefit both of our nations.\"",
      "\"I appreciate President Trump's commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs,\" said the Ukrainian leader. \"This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together.\"",
      "Zelenskyy offered no comment on Trump's repeated vows to \"quickly\" end the nearly three-year war that began with Russia's full-scale invasion in early 2022. His government and his commanders on the battlefield have voiced growing concern that Trump could dramatically reduce or even halt the huge American support for Ukraine's military effort to repel Russia's invasion.",
      "Zelenskyy has warned that if the resolve of Ukraine's Western backers crumbles and Russia is allowed to seize Ukrainian territory, the war his country is fighting could spread, with direct implications for Americans.",
      "\"This aggression, and Putin's army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they're the NATO members,\" he told CBS News early this year.",
      "Hungary's Viktor Orb\u00e1n",
      "One of the first foreign leaders to offer congratulations to Trump on Wednesday was one of the very few who openly backed him long before the final votes were cast in the U.S. Hungary's far-right President Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who's been accused during his decades-long leadership of the eastern European nation of eroding its democratic institutions by giving himself more power and limiting that of the country's courts and civil society institutions, called Trump's apparent success \"a much needed victory for the World!\"",
      "In a message posted on social media, Orb\u00e1n said Trump had pulled off \"the biggest comeback in US political history,\" and he congratulated him on his \"enormous win.\"",
      "Orban has made himself an outsider among European Union leaders by endorsing anti-immigrant policies and maintaining close ties with President Vladimir Putin amid Russia's ongoing invasion of neighboring Ukraine \u2014 all while touting his close ties to Trump.",
      "In a speech over the summer, Orb\u00e1n suggested he had even helped to craft Trump's future statecraft, claiming to have \"entered the policy-writing system of President Donald Trump's team,\" with \"deep involvement there.\"",
      "Russia, but not Putin himself",
      "Leonid Slutsky, who heads the Committee on International Affairs in Russia's State Duma, or parliament, was quoted Wednesday by the country's state-run RIA Novosti news agency as saying a Trump victory offered \"a chance for a more constructive approach to the Ukrainian conflict.\"",
      "\"Can we expect changes in approaches to the role of the U.S. in the Ukrainian conflict, which has been fueled by the Democratic administration since 2014? Judging by the election rhetoric (if it can still be believed), the Republican team is not going to send more and more American taxpayers' money into the furnace of a proxy war against Russia,\" Slutsky was quoted as saying. \"Perhaps there is a chance for a more constructive approach here.\"",
      "Slutsky did not comment on Trump's repeated vows to end the war in Ukraine quickly if reelected \u2014 something European and Ukrainian leaders fear he could do by halting America's vast military support for Kyiv and forcing Ukraine to accept Russia's takeover of significant Ukrainian territory.",
      "Slutsky did predict, however, that if the next American administration does cut off that support, the U.S.-backed Ukrainian government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will fall \"in a matter of months, if not days.\"",
      "There was no immediate reaction from President Vladimir Putin, who never spoke in favor of either candidate during the U.S. election campaign process, but whose leadership Trump has lauded previously.",
      "In remarks later to journalists in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was unaware of any plans for Putin to congratulate Trump directly, saying the former U.S. leader had made \"quite harsh statements\" about Russia during the campaign and calling the U.S. an \"unfriendly country that is directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state.\"",
      "In a statement issued later, Russia's Foreign Ministry echoed that stance, saying: \"We have no illusions about the elected American President, who is well known in Russia, and the new composition of Congress, where the Republicans, according to preliminary data, are gaining the upper hand. The ruling political elite in the United States, regardless of party affiliation, adheres to anti-Russian attitudes and a line on 'containing Moscow.' This line is not subject to fluctuations in the domestic political barometer in the United States.\"",
      "The ministry said Russia would \"work with the new Administration when it 'settles' in the White House, firmly defending Russian national interests and focusing on achieving all the goals of the special military operation.\"",
      "In his remarks, however, Peskov left room for any change in the U.S. stance during Trump's second term, saying: \"After victory, preparing to enter the Oval Office, sometimes statements take on a different tone.\"",
      "\"We will draw conclusions based on concrete steps and concrete words,\" he said, adding that it would be \"practically impossible\" for Trump to damage U.S. relations with Moscow, as they're \"at their lowest point in history.\"",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday that Trump's reelection was \"no cause for concern\" for Mexico, despite the president-elect's recent threat to impose a massive 25% tariff on Mexican imports unless her government halts what he called an \"onslaught of criminals and drugs\" coming across the southern U.S. border.",
      "\"We are a free, independent, sovereign country and there will be good relations with the United States,\" Sheinbaum said, adding that she felt it was \"prudent to wait\" to extend congratulations to the U.S. election winner until the official results were announced.",
      "\"For all Mexicans, there is no cause for concern, for our countrymen and women [in the U.S.], for their relatives who are here, for Mexican businesswomen and businessmen, there is no cause for concern,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer did his best Wednesday, despite a clear delineation between his own policies and those expected of another Trump administration, to maintain the decorum of the storied \"special friendship\" between the two nations.",
      "In a social media post, Starmer offered his congratulations to Trump \"on your historic election victory,\" adding that he looks forward to \"working with you in the years ahead.\"",
      "\"As the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defense of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise,\" said Starmer, who came to power only months ago as Britain's left-leaning Labour Party won national elections in a landslide after a decade and a half of Conservative Party rule.",
      "\"I know that the US-UK special relationship will continue to prosper on both sides of the Atlantic for years to come,\" added Starmer.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron",
      "\"Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump,\" France's President Emmanuel Macron said in a brief statement posted on social media Wednesday. He declared his administration \"ready to work together\" again as it did during Trump's first term in office, \"with your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.\"",
      "But an hour later, the French president issued another statement that hinted at the concerns he and many of his European colleagues are likely to share about Trump's commitment to the transatlantic NATO alliance, America's future backing of Ukraine in the war with Russia, and his stance on foreign import tariffs.",
      "In his second tweet, Macron said he had just spoken with German Chancellor Olaf Sholz, and that the leaders of the EU's two biggest economies had agreed to \"work towards a more united, stronger, more sovereign Europe in this new context. By cooperating with the United States of America and defending our interests and our values.\"",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte",
      "\"I just congratulated @realDonaldTrump on his election as President of the United States,\" said NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on Wednesday, adding in his social media post that Trump's \"leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through #NATO.\"",
      "Trump has criticized many of the NATO alliance's European members for failing to commit at least 2% of their national GDPs to their defense budgets.",
      "Trump shocked many of America's closest allies during and after his first term by openly criticizing\u00a0their funding commitments, and during the 2024 presidential campaign he said calling on allies to increase their defense spending would be a policy he aggressively pursued if reelected.",
      "In May, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said \"Trump got our allies to increase their NATO spending by demanding they pay up,\" and that if reelected, \"he will restore peace and rebuild American strength and deterrence on the world stage.\"",
      "Iran's government and people",
      "Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran's ruling Islamic regime, appeared on the country's state-run TV network IRIB Wednesday and was quoted as dismissing the potential impact of Trump's election victory amid her country's standoff with the West over its support for armed proxy groups across the Middle East and its nuclear program.",
      "\"The election of the U.S. President is not relevant to us,\" she said according to a translation of her remarks on state media. She said the policies of both the U.S. and Iran were \"fixed and do not change with the change of individuals,\" and said there would be be no \"impact on people's livelihoods\" in Iran regardless of who occupies the White House.",
      "Iran's economy has been decimated by a huge regime of U.S. and international sanctions imposed initially over its alleged nuclear weapons development \u2014 which the country denies \u2014 and extended over its support for U.S.-designated terror groups such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "During Donald Trump's first term in office, he unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of an international nuclear pact negotiated by his predecessor that was intended to keep Iran's atomic work in check in exchange for an easing of sanctions. He adopted a hard line instead, re-imposing sanctions to the consternation of America's European allies who helped broker and co-signed the deal.",
      "Iran has since ramped up its nuclear work, and there has been mounting concern this year that its backing for the so-called proxy groups across the Mideast could lead to a full-scale war with Israel, with the potential to draw in the U.S. as Israel's closest ally.",
      "Despite the government's claim that there would be no impact on Iranians, the value of the country's currency, the rial, slipped on Wednesday to its lowest ever value.",
      "Traders in Tehran told The Associated Press that the rial was trading at 703,000 to the dollar, though there could be further fluctuations over the course of the day.",
      "One resident of Iran's capital told the AP he had no doubt that Trump \"will intensify the sanctions.\"",
      "\"Things that are not in our favor will be worse,\" 22-year-old student Amir Aghaeian told the AP. \"Our economy and social situation will surely get worse... I feel the country is going to blow up.\"",
      "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, and Gaza residents",
      "Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian Authority that administers the Israeli-occupied West Bank, congratulated Trump on his reelection and wished him success.",
      "In his message, posted Wednesday on the website of the Authority's\u00a0news agency WAFA, Abbas expressed hope to work with Trump for peace and security in the region, stressing the Palestinian people's commitment to the pursuit of \"freedom, self-determination and statehood, in accordance with international law.\"",
      "\"We will remain steadfast in our commitment to peace, and we are confident that the United States will support, under your leadership, the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people,\" he said, addressing Trump.",
      "While nearly two-thirds of Israelis polled by the Israel Democracy Institute before election day in the U.S. said they believed Trump would be a better American leader for Israel's interests, the sentiment in Gaza, where Abbas' Fatah movement hasn't held any power in many years, was less focused on who would win, and more on surviving the war.",
      "A woman living amid the rubble in Gaza told CBS News this week that they just want the bombs to stop falling, and many were doubtful that a change in U.S. leadership could precipitate that.",
      "\"For me, Republicans or Democrats are the same thing,\" Gaza resident Firas Abu Firas said before election day. \"They are two faces on the same coin.\"",
      "Hamas reacts",
      "Basem Naim, a long-time senior figure in the Hamas regime that ruled over the Palestinian Gaza Strip for almost two decades before the group sparked the ongoing war with Israel with its unprecedented terrorist attack more than a year ago, called Trump's reelection, \"a private matter for the Americans,\" but said in a statement Wednesday that \"Palestinians look forward to an immediate cessation of the aggression against our people, especially in Gaza, and look for assistance in achieving their legitimate rights of freedom, independence, and the establishment of their independent self sovereign state with Jerusalem as its capital.\"",
      "International diplomatic efforts toward a so-called \"two-state solution,\" which would see an independent state of Palestine created alongside Israel, have all but vanished amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "U.S. administrations from both sides of the political aisle have pushed for such a solution to the nearly seven-decade crisis in the heart of the Middle East, but with the current Israeli administration firmly opposed to the notion of Palestinian statehood, most Palestinians saw little reason for hope regardless of who won the U.S. election.",
      "Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te",
      "Taiwan President Lai Ching-te offered his \"sincere congratulations\" to Trump on Wednesday, saying he was \"confident that the longstanding\u00a0#Taiwan-#US partnership, built on shared values & interests, will continue to serve as a cornerstone for regional stability & lead to greater prosperity for us all.\"",
      "The United States is bound by domestic law to back Taiwan, an island off China's eastern coast that's claimed by Beijing as Chinese territory but which has had its own democratic government for decades, if it faces military aggression.",
      "China's President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under the rule of his Communist Party, by force if necessary, creating one of the most risky global military standoffs on the planet. Chinese and Taiwanese military vessels and aircraft have regularly entered each others' territory in recent months, increasing the tension as U.S. vessels continue \"freedom of navigation\" operations in the region.",
      "During and before the campaign, Trump dodged questions about whether the U.S. would come to the aid of Taiwan if China launched an invasion with him in the White House. In a July interview with The Associated Press,\u00a0he said\u00a0Taiwan should pay the U.S. more for helping ensure its defense.",
      "European Union's Ursula von der Leyen",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Union bloc's governing body, the European Commission, congratulated Trump on Wednesday and iterated her hope in a brief\u00a0social media post\u00a0that the U.S. and EU could \"work together on a strong transatlantic agenda that keeps delivering\" for citizens on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "\"I warmly congratulate Donald J. Trump. The EU and the US are more than just allies,\" Von der Leyen said. \"We are bound by a true partnership between our people, uniting 800 million citizens. So let's work together on a strong transatlantic agenda that keeps delivering for them.\"",
      "Italian premier Giorgia Meloni",
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni congratulated Trump Wednesday, lauding what she called \"unshakeable\" ties between the U.S. and Italy.",
      "\"Italy and the United States are 'sister' nations, linked by an unshakeable alliance, common values and a historic friendship. It is a strategic bond which I am sure we will now strengthen even more,\" Italy's far-right leader wrote in a statement posted to social media.",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan congratulated \"my friend Donald Trump\" Wednesday with a message posted on social media.",
      "The leader of the sometimes contentious NATO ally, who's taken a strong stance against Israel's handling of the ongoing wars with Hamas and Hezbollah, voiced his hope that \"Turkey-US relations will strengthen, that regional and global crises and wars, especially the Palestinian issue and the Russia-Ukraine war, will come to an end.\"",
      "\"I believe that more efforts will be made for a more just world,\" said Erdogan. \"I hope that the elections will be beneficial for our friendly and allied people in the United States and for all of humanity.\"",
      "Trump and Erdogan appeared to get along relatively well during the American's first term in office.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro",
      "Colombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro congratulated Trump on Wednesday and lauded the U.S. democratic process, which he said would be respected, but took the opportunity also to challenge the president-elect's vows to close the U.S. border to undocumented migrants as unrealistic.",
      "\"The only way to seal the boarders is through the prosperity of the communities of the south and the end of blockades,\" he said.",
      "Petro also alluded to concerns that Trump will lead the world's biggest economy further away from goals to address man-made climate change, saying the dialogue between the global north and south continues, \"and the reality of the climate collapse will force us to rally around a solution.\"",

    "summary": "Forecasters say Hurricane Rafael is expected to become a Category 3 storm before it makes landfall on Cuba's southwest coast.",
    "story": [
      "San Juan, Puerto Rico \u2014 Hurricane Rafael swelled into a Category 2 storm early Wednesday as it swirled past the Cayman Islands, and it was forecast to intensify before making landfall later in the day in western Cuba. It was another stroke of bad news for Cuba, which has been struggling with blackouts while recovering from another hurricane two weeks ago that killed at least six people in the eastern part of the island.",
      "CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said Rafael was undergoing rapid intensification and was expected to become a major hurricane, Category 3 or higher, by the time it makes landfall in Cuba. After it enters the Gulf of Mexico, Nolan said Rafael was forecast to turn to the west and maintain its hurricane status into the weekend. Forecasting models suggest it will likely track more and more to the west before either dissipating over the western Gulf, or heading for Mexico.",
      "As of 10 a.m. Eastern, Rafael was a\u00a0Category 2 storm, located about 60 miles east-southeast of the Isle of Youth and around 130 miles south-southeast of Havana. It was packing maximum sustained winds of 110 mph.",
      "It was moving northwest at 14 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Forecasters warned that Rafael was expected to slam into Cuba on Wednesday as a potential Category 4 storm after dumping rain on Jamaica and the Cayman Islands on Tuesday. The center warned of life-threatening storm surge, damaging hurricane-force winds and flash flooding for western portions of Cuba.",
      "The U.S. State Department issued an advisory for Cuba on Tuesday afternoon, offering departure flights to non-essential staff and American citizens, and advising others to \"reconsider travel to Cuba due to the potential impact of Tropical Storm Rafael,\" before the storm grew into a hurricane.",
      "On Tuesday morning, the Cuban Civil Defense called on Cubans to prepare as soon as possible, because when the storm makes landfall \"it's important to stay where you are.\" The day before, authorities said they had issued an evacuation order for 37,000 people in far eastern Cuba, in the province of Guantanamo, due to bad weather.",
      "A hurricane warning that had been in effect Tuesday for the Cayman Islands was dropped for the biggest of the islands Wednesday. The measure remained in effect for Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, along with the Cuban provinces of Pinar del Rio, Artemisa, La Habana, Mayabeque, Matanzas, and the Isle of Youth.",
      "A tropical storm warning was in effect for a handful of other Cuban provinces, as well as the lower and middle Florida Keys from Key West to west of the Channel 5 Bridge, and Dry Tortugas. The warning was lifted in Jamaica after the storm passed by the western coast.",
      "Rafael on Tuesday knocked out power in Jamaica and unleashed flooding and landslides.",
      "The Jamaica Public Service, the island's electricity provider, said in a statement late Tuesday that impassable roads were preventing crews from restoring power in some areas.",
      "Meanwhile, crews in Little Cayman and Cayman Brac were expected to fan out early Wednesday to assess damage after a direct hit late Tuesday. Power outages were reported across the Cayman Islands, and schools remained closed on Wednesday.",
      "\"While conditions have improved on Grand Cayman, residents are advised to exercise extreme caution on the roads and near coastlines as rough seas and residual flooding risks may persist,\" the government said in a statement.",
      "Forecasters warned Rafael would unleash heavy rains across the western Caribbean that could lead to flooding and mudslides in parts of Cuba and the Cayman Islands.",
      "Heavy rainfall also was expected to spread north into Florida and nearby areas of the southeast U.S. during the middle to late part of the week. The Hurricane Center predicted storm surges in Florida could reach 1 to 3 feet in Dry Tortugas and 1 to 2 feet in the Lower Florida Keys. A few tornadoes also were expected Wednesday over the Keys and southwestern Florida.",

      "The craft, of a type known as \"go-fast boats,\" was powered by two outboard motors and appeared to be a low-profile, semi-submersible craft -- commonly known as a \"narco sub\" -- designed to make detection more difficult.",
      "Aboard the craft, the Navy detained nine crew members, six of whom were foreigners. The Navy did not specify their nationalities, but many of the boats found off Mexico have Colombian or Venezuelan crew members.",

      "Netanyahu and Gallant have repeatedly been at odds over the war in Gaza. But Netanyahu had avoided firing his rival. Netanyahu cited \"significant gaps\" and a \"crisis of trust\" between the men in his Tuesday evening announcement.",
      "\"In the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and defense minister,\" Netanyahu said. \"Unfortunately, although in the first months of the campaign there was such trust and there was very fruitful work, during the last months this trust cracked between me and the defense minister.\"",
      "In the early days of the war, Israel's leadership presented a unified front as it responded to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. But as the war dragged on and spread to Lebanon, key policy differences have emerged. While Netanyahu has called for continued military pressure on Hamas, Gallant had taken a more pragmatic approach, saying that military force has created the necessary conditions for a diplomatic deal that could bring home hostages held by the militant group.",
      "Gallant, a former general who has gained public respect with a gruff, no-nonsense personality, said in a statement: \"The security of the state of Israel always was, and will always remain, my life's mission.\"",
      "The White House on Tuesday declined to comment on the firing but called Galant \"an important partner on all matters related to the defense of Israel.\"",
      "\"As close partners, we will continue to work collaboratively with Israel's next Minister of Defense,\" the White House National Security Council said.",
      "Gallant has worn a simple, black buttoned shirt throughout the war in a sign of sorrow over the Oct. 7 attack and developed a strong relationship with his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.",

An American company is working to change that, and their innovation is a contender for this year's annual Earthshot Prize, an award handed out by Britain's Prince William to highlight solutions to the climate crisis.",
      "Like most 12-year-olds, Dimakatso Ngcobo isn't a fan of household chores. She wasn't shy about telling CBS News so as she scrubbed an old pot, a few plastic plates and two old peanut butter jars that she and her mom use as cups.",
      "Last year, her mom couldn't afford the rent at their home in Soweto, outside Johannesburg, so they were evicted. The mother and daughter walked to the community of Kokotela, a few miles further south, to buy a tiny dirt patch of land for $200. There, they put up a new one-room home made of metal sheeting.",
      "Ngcobo told CBS News that while there's no running water and no toilet, what she missed the most was electricity.",
      "\"It is a bit hard. We don't have much. We don't afford that much,\" she said, adding on a more positive note: \"At least the school nearby is OK, as I want to be a doctor one day.\"",
      "She was also grateful for her world getting just a little bit brighter recently, thanks to the U.S. company d.light, which was created by two co-founders who met at Stanford University's school of design. The company has now connected more than 180 million people in 70 countries to a clean source of energy from solar power.",
      "\"We are very focused on making these products as affordable as possible, and the way we do that is by pay-as-you-go financing, where customers can pay 20 cents a day or 30 cents per day, similar to what they would spend on kerosene or diesel for the diesel generator,\" said d.light co-founder Nedjip Tozun. \"But instead of literally burning away that money, they can invest it into an asset that they are going to own that is going to deliver power for many years.\"",
      "D.light is one of the 15\u00a0finalists in the running for a 2024 Earthshot Prize. Winners will be chosen Wednesday in five categories: Protect and Restore Nature, Clean Our Air, Revive Our Oceans, Build a Waste-Free World and Fix our Climate. The winner in each category will be awarded 1 million U.K. pounds, or about $1.3 million, intended to help scale-up their respective projects.",
      "William, the Prince of Wales and future British monarch, has said he took inspiration from President John F. Kennedy's 1962 \"Moonshot\" challenge to land a man on the moon within 10 years when he created the Earthshot Prize four years ago with the ambition of finding and elevating innovative global climate solutions. The Earthshot initiative's ambitious goal since it launched has been to repair the planet within 10 years.",
      "The Earthshot award ceremony has come to the African continent for the first time this year, with Cape Town in South Africa playing host.",
      "Delegates at the Earthshot awards in Cape Town told CBS News ahead of Tuesday's U.S. national election that they've been disappointed that climate change didn't emerge as a central theme in the presidential race, and they worry it could fall even further from the focus of U.S. policy conversation.",
      "New Yorker Shantha Bloemen, CEO of Mobility for Africa, a start-up that provides green mobility services to rural women in Africa using custom-built electric tricycles and bespoke solar powered batteries, was nominated for an award this year but didn't make the finalist list. She said she was still hoping to find partners in Cape Town this week to help her scale up her company's operations.",
      "\"We need urgent action and strong political leadership to unlock the financing to combat this crisis,\" she told CBS News. \"There are many of us with proven solutions to mitigate the worst impact on those living on the front line of the crisis, but without strong U.S. political leadership, it will be difficult to unlock the finance needed to scale quickly to succeed. Time is not on our side.\"",
      "Prince William acknowledged the networking aspect of the prize initiative Tuesday at an event in Cape Town. Panel host Wanjira Mathia teased the British royal as he sat for a panel discussion, calling the prize \"a large dating service to bring together climate innovators.\"",
      "\"The prize is about visibility, but it's also about scale,\" he said. \"What we hear a lot from innovators is, 'I have a solution and no idea how to scale,' and businesses and leaders who say, 'I have money but don't know where to put it.' So, that's where we created a launchpad, which is a dating service which matches the funder with the solution, and vice versa. And I think this collaboration is key \u2014 if you put all of this into one melting pot, then sparks will fly.\"",
      "\"It's wonderful to see those many brilliant minds and changemakers in a room,\" he said, addressing the audience.",
      "Back in Kokotela, south of Johannesburg, Muriel Nobela can now power her TV, radio and lights thanks to a d.light solar panel on her roof. The panel feeds electricity to an outside light and to a storage battery inside her home, and it all costs her just over $250, which she's paying off in small monthly instalments.",
      "Her neighbor Portia Msomi had always been forced to rely on gas to cook and candles for light in the evenings. Now, it's just a flip of a switch.",
      "\"Aha!\" said Portia, giggling as she hit her new d.light switch to illuminate her home. \"You see, isn't it wonderful!\"",
      "Tozun told CBS News it's that kind of reaction that drives d.light's work.",
      "\"The name of our company is d.light, and that is the emotion that gets us really excited to see in our customers,\" he said, adding: \"There are 2 billion people in the world who have unreliable electricity access, and about 750 million with no access to electricity at all, our goal is\u00a0 to transform the lives of one billion people by 2030.\"",
      "Portia takes a lot of pride in her new solar system. With a huge amount of effort she climbed onto a large trunk to stretch her hand onto her metal roof to grab her solar panel and clean it meticulously. She told CBS News it took her only four months to pay off the $150 cost of the system.",
      "She pointed to various neighbors' homes that had burned down in accidents involving paraffin and candle fires.",
      "\"We are safe now, and have light all the time,\" she said.",
      "Light and safety are important for young Dimakatso Ngcobo, too, but the 12-year-old told CBS News that being connected was one of the biggest benefits of clean power in her home. She can now indulge in her favorite activity: scrolling through TikTok and Instagram.",
      "\"And I love TV,\" she added. \"I really love cartoons.\"",

    "story": [
      "Nogales, Mexico \u2014 Migrants from all corners of the globe, from Latin America to far-flung countries in Africa and Asia, come to a shelter in this northern Mexican city hoping to enter the U.S. and escape economic hardship and, in some cases, deadly danger.",
      "\"They tried to kill us,\" said Rosa Benalcazar, a migrant staying at the House of Mercy and all Nations, one of the biggest shelters for migrants on the Mexican side of the Arizona-Mexico border.",
      "Benalcazar said she journeyed to the U.S. after criminal gangs threatened to harm her and her family in Ecuador, which has seen record numbers of its citizens flee amid mounting violence and insecurity.",
      "Like the other migrants at the shelter in Nogales, Benalcazar has been trying to get an appointment to enter America through a U.S. government phone app known as CBP One. Designed to discourage illegal border crossings, the Biden administration program allows migrants in Mexico to request a time to be processed at a legal entry point. The wait times, however, can extend for months due to an extraordinarily high demand.",
      "\"I haven't had luck,\" Benalcazar said in Spanish, noting she's been attempting to secure a CBP One appointment each day for seven months straight.",
      "Sister Lika Macias, the shelter's director, said many migrants feel that luck may soon become harder to find, given the presidential election in the U.S.",
      "\"The politics in the United States,\" affect \"migration policy\" at the U.S.-Mexico border, Macias said.",
      "Vice President Harris has promised to continue current Biden administration policies that sharply limit asylum for those who cross the southern border without waiting for a CBP One appointment. But former President Donald Trump has vowed to seal the U.S.-Mexico border altogether, including by ending the CBP One process and other programs that allow migrants to enter the country lawfully.",
      "\"There's a lot of concern\"",
      "On a recent morning, immigration attorney Alba Jaramillo sought to ease the confusion and anxiety among those at the shelter. The American election could go \"either way\" and there's no telling who will win, she told a group of migrants, most of them mothers with children.",
      "Jaramillo urged the migrants to be patient and to avoid listening to social media rumors about a sudden, overnight U.S. policy change.",
      "\"There's a lot of concern about what's going to happen,\" said Jaramillo, the co-director of the Immigration Law and Justice Network, a pro-immigrant group. \"They're very scared. They think that the asylum system is going to close.\"",
      "Jaramillo said she also urged migrants to follow the legal process and refrain from crossing the U.S. border illegally with the help of smugglers. Crossing the Arizona desert, she said, is not only dangerous, and potentially deadly, but would also disqualify migrants from asylum under an executive action by President Biden in June.",
      "After Mr. Biden enacted those broad restrictions on asylum, illegal border crossings, which had soared to record levels late last year, plunged to a 4-year low. While unauthorized crossings have remained at that low level for the past few months, U.S. officials worry the results of the presidential election could disrupt the lull.",
      "A Trump victory, some U.S. officials believe, could prompt large numbers of migrants to try to cross into the country illegally before he takes office in January. In addition to promising to shut down the CBP One app process, Trump has vowed to reinstate his hardline immigration policies, militarize the border and oversee the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "\"It's nerve-racking\"",
      "Roughly half the migrants at the shelter are children, according to Macias, the facility's director. While their parents desperately await the results of the election, fearing dramatic changes in American border policy, the kids' only focus is being kids.",
      "After all, for the children, there's little to fear at the Nogales shelter, where they can learn English and mathematics and enjoy outdoor activities like soccer and basketball, as well as occasional treats.",
      "Still, parents like Areli Doral, a young mother from Guerrero, Mexico, remain deeply concerned about what could happen following the American election.",
      "\"Yes, I'm scared,\" Doral said in Spanish, while holding her two-year-old son, Edgar.",
      "\"If they close the (CBP One) application, what are we going to do? We already waited 10 months,\" she said. \"It's nerve-racking.\"",
      "Doral said returning to her hometown is not an option, noting it would be dangerous for her son.",

    "story": [
      "Mexico's National Guard fatally shot two Colombians and wounded four others in what the Defense Department claimed was a confrontation near the U.S. border.",
      "Colombia's foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday that all of the victims were migrants who had been \"caught in the crossfire.\" It identified the dead as a 20-year-old man and a 37-year-old woman, and gave the number of Colombians wounded as five, not four. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy. The victims were identified by the foreign ministry as Yuli Vanessa Herrera Marulanda and Ronaldo Andr\u00e9s Quintero Pe\u00f1uelas.",
      "Mexico's Defense Department, which controls the National Guard, did not respond to requests for comment Monday on whether the victims were migrants, but it said one Colombian who was not injured in the shootings was turned over to immigration officials, suggesting they were.",
      "If they were migrants, it would mark the second time in just over a month that military forces in Mexico have opened fire on and killed migrants.",
      "On Oct. 1, the day President Claudia Sheinbaum took office, soldiers opened fire on a truck, killing six migrants in the southern state of Chiapas. An 11-year-old girl from Egypt, her 18-year-old sister and a 17-year-old boy from El Salvador died in that shooting, along with people from Peru and Honduras.",
      "The most recent shootings happened Saturday on a dirt road near Tecate, east of Otay Mesa on the California border, that is frequently used by Mexican migrant smugglers, the department said in a statement late Sunday.",
      "The Defense Department said a militarized National Guard patrol came under fire after spotting two vehicles -- a gray pickup and a white SUV -- in the area, which is near an informal border crossing and wind power generation plant known as La Rumorosa.",
      "One truck sped off and escaped. The National Guard opened fire on the other truck, killing two Colombians and wounding four others. There was no immediate information on their conditions, and there were no reported casualties among the guardsmen involved.",
      "One Colombian and one Mexican man were found and detained unharmed at the scene, and the departments said officers found a pistol and several magazines commonly used for assault rifles at the scene.",
      "Colombians have sometimes been recruited as gunmen for Mexican drug cartels, which are also heavily involved in migrant smuggling. But the fact the survivor was turned over to immigration officials and that the Foreign Relations Department contacted the Colombian consulate suggests they were migrants.",
      "Cartel gunmen sometimes escort or kidnap migrants as they travel to the U.S. border. One possible scenario was that armed migrant smugglers may have been in one or both of the trucks, but that the migrants were basically unarmed bystanders.",
      "The defense department said the three National Guard officers who opened fire have been taken off duty while the incident is being investigated.",
      "Former president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office Sept. 30, gave the military an unprecedentedly wide role in public life and law enforcement; he created the militarized Guard and used the combined military forces as the country's main law enforcement agencies, supplanting police. The Guard has since been placed under the control of the army.",
      "But critics say the military is not trained to do civilian law enforcement work. Moreover, lopsided death tolls in such confrontations - in which all the deaths and injuries occur on one side - raise suspicions among activists whether there really was a confrontation.",
      "For example, the soldiers who opened fire in Chiapas - who have been detained pending charges - claimed they heard \"detonations\" prior to opening fire. There was no indication any weapons were found at the scene.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 06:40:24 -0500",
    "summary": "North Korea and its partner Russia say Kim Jong Un's U.N. resolution-breaking missile tests are a justified reaction to U.S. military provocations.",
    "story": [
      "Seoul \u2014\u00a0North Korea fired a salvo of short-range ballistic missiles early Tuesday, Seoul's military said. It was Pyongyang's second launch in days and it came just hours before Americans were set to vote for a new president.",
      "The nuclear-armed North last week test-fired what it said was its most advanced and powerful solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). That was Kim Jong Un's first weapons test since he was accused by U.S. and Ukrainian officials of sending soldiers to help support Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "North Korea, which has denied the deployment, is under growing international pressure to withdraw its troops from Russia, with Seoul warning Tuesday that thousands of soldiers were being deployed to front-line areas, including the Russian region of Kursk, which Ukrainian troops pushed into months ago.",
      "Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected the launch of \"several short-range ballistic missiles\" at around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday (5:30 p.m. Eastern, Monday) into waters east of the Korean peninsula. The missiles flew approximately 248 miles and Seoul's military said it had tracked the launch in real time while sharing information with Tokyo and Washington.",
      "\"In preparation for additional launches, our military has strengthened surveillance and alertness,\" it added. Seoul was set to get more U.S. help in monitoring the North's missile launches, meanwhile, with the State Department in Washington announcing Monday the approval of a new military aid package worth almost $5 billion.",
      "That package includes the potential sale of airborne early warning and control systems to South Korea, with the approval of four E-7 Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C) aircraft, 10 jet engines, and other systems and support elements, at an estimated total cost of $4.92 billion.",
      "The early warning and control aircraft, known as Wedgetails, would enable South Korea to detect missiles and other threats more swiftly and from greater distances than ground-based radar systems.",
      "\"This proposed sale will improve the Republic of Korea's ability to meet current and future threats by providing increased intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and airborne early warning and control capabilities,\" the State Department said. \"It will also increase the ROK Air Force's command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) interoperability with the United States.\"",
      "On Sunday, South Korea, Japan and the United States conducted a joint air drill involving a U.S. B-1B bomber, South Korean F-15K and KF-16 fighter jets, and Japanese F-2 jets, in response to the ICBM launch. Such joint drills infuriate Pyongyang, which views them as rehearsals for invasion.",
      "Pyongyang called its latest launch \"a direct response to the trilateral aerial exercises over the weekend,\" Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defense Industry Studies told AFP. \"Given it was a salvo of short-range missiles, the North is indicating that it not only has long-range missiles capable of reaching the U.S., but also short-range ones to target all bases in South Korea and Japan.\"",
      "Kim Yo Jong, sister of the country's leader and a key spokesperson, called the U.S.-South Korea-Japan exercises an \"action-based explanation of the most hostile and dangerous aggressive nature of the enemy toward our Republic.\"",
      "In a statement carried Tuesday by the official Korean Central News Agency, she said the drill was \"absolute proof of the validity and urgency of the line of building up the nuclear forces we have opted for and put into practice.\"",
      "Seoul has long accused the nuclear-armed North of sending weapons to help Moscow fight Kyiv and alleged that Pyongyang has moved to deploy soldiers en masse since Kim signed a mutual defense deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June.",
      "\"More than 10,000 North Korean soldiers are currently in Russia, and we assess that a significant portion of them are deployed to front-line areas, including Kursk,\" Jeon Ha-gyu, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, said Tuesday.",
      "Seoul, a major weapons exporter, has said it is reviewing whether to send weapons directly to Ukraine in response, something it has previously resisted due to longstanding domestic policy that prevents it from providing weaponry into active conflicts.",
      "With its recent testing spate, \"Pyongyang is showing that its contribution of weapons and troops to Russia's war in Ukraine does not curtail its military activities closer to home,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. \"On the contrary, cooperation with Moscow appears to enable blatant violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\"",
      "On Monday, Robert Wood, U.S. deputy ambassador to the U.N., slammed the North's advancing ballistic missile program and said Russia and China were preventing the U.N. from holding Pyongyang to account.",
      "Beijing and Moscow \"have repeatedly shielded the DPRK, contributing to the normalization of these tests and emboldening the DPRK to further violate this Council's sanctions and resolutions,\" he said, referring to the North by its official name.",
      "Speaking Tuesday in Moscow, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko said the North's missile tests were a justified reaction to U.S. \"provocations,\" according to Russia's state-run TASS news agency.",

    "story": [
      "Maumere, Indonesia\u00a0\u2014 Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency said Monday that at least 10 people had died as a series of volcanic eruptions widens on the remote island of Flores. The eruption at Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki around midnight spewed thick brownish ash as high as 6,500 feet into the air and hot ashes hit several villages, burning down houses including a convent of Catholic nuns, said Firman Yosef, an official at the Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki monitoring post.",
      "Yosef said volcanic material was thrown up to 3.7 miles from the volcano's crater, blanketing nearby villages and towns with tons of volcanic debris and forcing residents to flee.",
      "Rescuers were still searching for more bodies buried under collapsed houses, said Abdul Muhari, the National Disaster Management Agency's spokesperson. Muhari said all the bodies, including a child, were found with a 2.4-mile radius of the crater. He said at least 10,000 people had been affected by the eruption in six villages.",
      "Some people fled to relatives' houses while the local government was readying schools to use as temporary shelters.",
      "The country's volcano monitoring agency increased the volcano's alert status to the highest level and more than doubled the exclusion zone to a 4.3-mile radius after midnight on Monday as eruptions became more frequent.",
      "A nun in Hokeng village died and another was missing, said Agusta Palma, the head of the Saint Gabriel Foundation that oversees convents on the majority-Catholic island.",
      "\"Our nuns ran out in panic under a rain of volcanic ash in the darkness,\" Palma said.",

      "About 6,500 people were evacuated in January after Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki began erupting, spewing thick clouds and forcing the government to close the island's Frans Seda Airport. No casualties or major damage were reported, but the airport has remained closed since then due to seismic activity.",
      "In a video conference on Monday, Muhammad Wafid, the head of Geology Agency at the Energy and Mineral Resources ministry said there was a different character between January's eruption and Monday's eruption due to a blockage of magma in the crater, which reduced detectible seismic activity while building up pressure.",
      "\"The eruptions that occurred since Friday were due to the accumulation of hidden energy,\" Wafid said.",
      "It's Indonesia's second volcanic eruption in as many weeks. West Sumatra province's Mount Marapi, one of the country's most active volcanos, erupted on Oct. 27, spewing thick columns of ash at least three times and blanketing nearby villages with debris, but no casualties were reported. An eruption of Mount Marapi at the end of 2023 did claim at least 23 lives.",
      "Lewotobi Laki-laki is one of the 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, an archipelago nation that's home to some 280 million people.

      "Moldova's pro-European Union incumbent President Maia Sandu won a tense presidential runoff election Sunday, beating a rival backed by a pro-Russian party in what she called as a \"lesson in democracy.\"",
      "The election in the small ex-Soviet republic, which lies sandwiched between war-torn Ukraine and the European Union, was overshadowed by allegations of meddling by Moscow. The key vote took place just two weeks after a referendum saw Moldovans back their country's bid to join the EU by a razor-thin margin.",
      "Sandu won 54.94 percent of the vote compared to 45.06 percent for Alexandr Stoianoglo, who was supported by the pro-Russian Socialists party and whom Sandu fired as prosecutor general last year, according to near-complete results published by the country's election commission.",
      "\"Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books.... Freedom, truth, and justice have prevailed,\" Sandu declared. \u00a0 Her rival Stoianoglo, 57, urged people \"to remain calm, regardless of the figures,\" but the Socialists party that backed him was quick to release a statement Monday questioning the results and calling her \"illegitimate,\" without offering any specific evidence.",
      "\"Maia Sandu is an illegitimate president, recognized only by her sponsors and supporters abroad. The people of Moldova feel betrayed and robbed,\" the party claimed in a statement, decrying \"blocking of voters' access\" and other alleged irregularities in the vote, in which Sandu benefitted from strong support from the country's large diaspora.",

      "In a statement issued Monday morning by the White House, President Biden said the Moldovan people \"went to the polls and voted in favor of President Sandu's vision for a secure, prosperous, and democratic Moldova.\"",
      "\"For months, Russia sought to undermine Moldova's democratic institutions and election processes.

      "He vowed to strengthen Ukraine's ties with Moldova and noted that both countries had applied to join the EU in the wake of Russia's February 2022 invasion.",
      "\"Only true security and a peaceful, united Europe can guarantee each person and every family the confidence to face tomorrow with hope and certainty,\" he said.",
      "Accession negotiations for Moldova to join the EU formally opened in June. In the October 20 referendum, 50.35 percent of voters backed EU membership, with Sandu blaming \"foreign interference\" for the narrow result in the country of 2.6 million people.",

      "He said ancient floods destroyed most of the burials' wooden coffins and linen wrappings.",

      "In September 2023, British media outlets Channel 4 and the Sunday Times published claims by four women of being sexually assaulted or raped by Brand between 2006 and 2013, at the height of his fame.",
      "Another woman who accused Brand told CBS News partner network BBC News\u00a0she was working in the same building where the BBC's Los Angeles office was when the incident occurred. She said Brand went on to laugh about it moments later on his radio show.",

    "summary": "Reza Valizadeh had worked for Radio Farda, an outlet under Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that's overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media.",
    "story": [
      "An Iranian-American journalist who once worked for a U.S. government-funded broadcaster is believed to have been detained by Iran for months now, authorities said Sunday, further raising the stakes as Tehran threatens to retaliate over\u00a0an Israeli attack on the country.",
      "The imprisonment of Reza Valizadeh, acknowledged to CBS News and the Associated Press by the U.S. State Department, came as Iran marked the 45th anniversary of the American Embassy takeover and hostage crisis on Sunday. It also followed Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatening both Israel and the U.S. the day before with\u00a0\"a crushing response\"\u00a0as long-range B-52 bombers reached the Middle East in an attempt to deter Tehran.",
      "Valizadeh had worked for Radio Farda, an outlet under Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that's overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media. In February, he wrote on the social platform X that his family members had been detained in an effort to see him return to Iran.",
      "The State Department told CBS News on Sunday that they are \"aware of reports that his U.S.-Iranian citizen has been arrested in Iran,\" when asked about Valizadeh.",
      "\"We are working with our Swiss partners who serve as the protecting power for the United States in Iran to gather more information about this case,\" a spokesperson said. \"Iran routinely imprisons U.S. citizens and other countries' citizens unjustly for political purposes. This practice is cruel and contrary to international law.\"",
      "The spokesperson said the State Department is \"unable to provide additional comment due to privacy considerations.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty told CBS News in a statement on Saturday that it is aware of Valizadeh's detainment in Iran and has no official confirmation of charges against him. They said Valizadeh stopped working with them in November 2022.",
      "\"We are profoundly concerned about the continued arrest, harassment and threats against media professionals by the Iranian regime,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In August, Valizadeh apparently posted two messages suggesting he had returned to Iran despite Radio Farda being viewed by Iran's theocracy as a hostile outlet.",
      "\"I arrived in Tehran on March 6, 2024. Before that, I had unfinished negotiations with the (Revolutionary Guard's) intelligence department,\" the message read in part. \"Eventually I came back to my country after 13 years without any security guarantee, even a verbal one.\"",
      "Valizadeh added the name of a man who he claimed belonged to Iran's Intelligence Ministry. The AP could not verify if the person worked for the ministry.",
      "Rumors have been circulating for weeks that Valizadeh had been detained. The Human Rights Activists News Agency, which monitors cases in Iran, said that he had been detained on arrival to the country earlier this year, but later released.",
      "He was then rearrested and sent to Evin prison, where he now faces a case in Iran's Revolutionary Court, which routinely holds closed-door hearings in which defendants face secret evidence, the agency reported. Valizadeh had faced arrest in 2007 as well, it said.",
      "Iran has not acknowledged detaining Valizadeh. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Voice of America, another U.S. government-funded media outlet overseen by the Agency for Global Media, first reported the State Department was acknowledging Valizadeh's detention in Iran.",
      "Since the 1979 U.S. Embassy crisis, which saw dozens of hostages released after 444 days in captivity, Iran has used prisoners with Western ties as bargaining chips in negotiations with the world. In September 2023,\u00a0five Americans detained for years in Iran were freed in exchange\u00a0for five Iranians in U.S. custody and for $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets to be released by South Korea.",
      "Valizadeh is the first American known to be detained by Iran in the time since.",
      "Meanwhile, Iranian state television aired footage Sunday of different cities across the country marking the anniversary of the embassy takeover.",
      "Gen. Hossein Salami, the head of the Guard, also spoke in Tehran, where he repeated a pledge made the day before by Khamenei.",
      "\"The resistance front and Iran will equip itself with whatever necessary to confront and defeat the enemy,\" he said, referring to the militant groups like Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah backed by Tehran.",
      "In Tehran, thousands at the gate of the former U.S. Embassy chanted \"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel.\" Some burned flags of the countries and effigies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "They also carried images of killed top figures of Iran's allied militant groups including Lebanese Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Palestinian Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The crowd in the state-organized rallies chanted they were ready to defend the Palestinians.",
      "Tensions are heightened in the Middle East after a war broke out on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel's offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not say how many were combatants but say more than half were women and children.",
      "Hezbollah, who is also allied with Iran, began firing rockets, drones and missiles from Lebanon into Israel in solidarity with Hamas immediately after. The yearlong cross-border fighting boiled over to full-blown war on Oct. 1, when Israeli forces launched a ground invasion of southern Lebanon for the first time since 2006.",
      "Iran, one of Israel's bitter foes, launched its own attack, unleashing about 180 ballistic missiles at Israel on Oct. 1. Israel retaliated, targeting Iranian military facilities in airstrikes on Oct. 25.",

    "story": [
      "Christmas came early this year in Venezuela. The season officially began October 1, as decreed by the country's authoritarian president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. \"I am going to declare the advancement of Christmas to the first of October,\" he said.",
      "The absurdity would be laughable if this weren't the perfect snapshot of Venezuela's black-is-white, dystopian unreality, an oil-rich country so devastated economically that it can't even keep the lights on \u2026 where life is so unlivable that a quarter of its population (nearly 8 million people) has fled.",
      "\"He needed a distraction,\" said former New York Times journalist William Neuman. \"It's bread and circuses.\"",
      "The title of Neuman's book about Venezuela says it all: \"Things Are Never So Bad That They Can't Get Worse.\" \u00a0\"Everybody knows that he's lost the election,\" he said. \"He's the emperor who has no clothes.\"",
      "In July, Venezuela, with a history of on-again, off-again democracy, held elections. Maduro claimed he had been re-elected, but in a bold act of defiance, the opposition produced voting machine tallies proving that Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez had actually won the presidency, by better than a 2-to-1 margin. Impartial election observers agreed.",
      "Maduro called out the military to enforce his election denial. Gonz\u00e1lez was told to leave the country, or else. (He turned up in Spain.) In the ensuing chaos, at least two dozen people were killed, and more than 2,000 detained.",

      "So, how could a country sitting on the largest oil reserve in the world end up like this? According to Neuman, \"It rained money. They spent it, wasted it, and stole it. It stopped raining, and the people went hungry. And that's essentially what happened in Venezuela in a nutshell.\"",
      "Venezuela has been producing oil since 1914, but what's known as \"the resource curse\" really set in when the charismatic and controversial Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was elected president in 1998. When he took office, the price of oil was $7 a barrel, Neuman said: \"Within several years, it gets to over $120 a barrel, so Ch\u00e1vez was very fortunate, because he comes in just at the beginning of this great commodities boom.\"",
      "Ch\u00e1vez spent huge sums of oil money on social programs, and borrowed even more, plunging his country into debt. But ordinary Venezuelans felt rich and heard for a change.",
      "The United States was his favorite bogeyman. At the United Nations in 2006, Ch\u00e1vez called President George W. Bush \"the devil.\"",
      "When Ch\u00e1vez died of cancer in 2013, his hand-picked successor was Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who wasn't so popular, or so lucky. Oil prices crashed; inflation reached an inconceivable 300,000%.",
      "Maduro met public discontent with repression, and millions left the country.",
      "Looking at the map of the Venezuelan exodus since 2014, the United States is fourth among destinations. Just over 750,000 have either been granted temporary protected status in the U.S., or have applied. So, Venezuela's crisis is here, at our doorstep, in our cities.",
      "Niurka Mel\u00e9ndez left in 2015. \"We are broken,\" she said. \"We were broken as a country ... no institutions, no freedom.\"",

      "Mel\u00e9ndez introduced us to one woman who left Venezuela with eight members of her family, including her four small children. She's afraid, even here, to disclose her name. \"When an armed group named Colectivos came to my house, they took everything that I had,\" she said. \"They took even the blender, everything, my computer, everything. And then they hit us because we didn't have the money, the exact money \u2013 they were asking for $500. I didn't have that amount.\"",
      "So, they crossed the Dari\u00e9n Gap, risking their lives. Since its contested election in July, Venezuela has resumed the human hemorrhage of its people \u2013   has resumed exporting its crisis.",

      "Cunningham, who treats people from all over the U.S. at Dell Laser\u2019s dedicated dry eye center, called dry eye the \"potentially most prevalent disease\" in North America.",
      "\"We sit at the computer all day without hydration, and that builds up inflammation over time.\"",
      "Modern lifestyles, including frequent computer use, have driven an uptick in dry eye cases, as the eye is the \"highest-friction area of the human body,\" the doctor said.",
      "\"You blink 10,000 times a day,\" he went on. \"The tear film is bringing nutrients to your cornea.\"",
      "\"So, your tears are not just a lubricant \u2014 they're actually the lifeline of your cornea and the front of your eye.\"",
      "COVID LOCKDOWNS LED TO SPIKE IN KIDS' VISION PROBLEMS, 1 IN 3 NOW NEARSIGHTED, STUDY FINDS",
      "As people age, fewer tears are produced due to hormonal changes, according to Cunningham \u2013 and women suffer from dry eye more than men for this reason.",
      "Young workers in forced-air environments, like offices, are most at risk, he noted.",
      "Changes in hormones and medication can worsen dryness, as well as inflammatory issues throughout the body like joint pain or stomach problems, the doctor cautioned. (iStock)",
      "\"When you stare at a computer screen, your blink rate can go down to two to four times a minute; on average, it\u2019s supposed to be about 20 to 40 times a minute,\" he said. \"We sit at the computer all day without hydration, and that builds up inflammation over time.\"",
      "Typing on a computer for a long period of time is \"literally like sprinting for your eyes,\" the expert noted.",
      "Symptoms to know",
      "Dry eye can have different symptoms based on gender, ethnicity and other variables, but some \"hallmark\" signs are consistent dryness, fluctuating vision and overall awareness of your eyes throughout the day, according to Cunningham.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"You should not notice that your eyes are in your head,\" he said. \"And if you notice they're there, that's most commonly dry eye.\"",
      "Recommended remedies",
      "When treating dry eye, there is \"no one product for everybody,\" said Cunningham.",
      "Some options include anti-inflammatory eye drops, tearduct plugs, intense pulsed light therapy (IPL) and other laser treatments.",
      "While artificial tears can be a \"refreshing tool,\" prescription steroids and anti-inflammatory drops are needed to address the inflammation, Cunningham said.",
      "Eyes weren't \"built\" to stare at a computer screen for long periods of time, according to an expert. (iStock)",
      "Skin is also \"intimately involved\" in dry eye, Cunningham noted, as inflammation in the skin, or rosacea, can have a direct correlation to the condition.",
      "\"We have to look more at the skin in your face in order to truly manage dry eye,\" the doctor said.",
      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0www.foxnews.com/health",
      "Bowen encourages everyone to get routine eye exams, particularly those with dry eye symptoms. As the condition is progressive and will worsen with time, it's important to \"get ahead\" of it, she said.",
      "\"It\u2019s not going to get better if you\u2019re not treating the inflammation,\" Bowen added.",
      "Anti-inflammatory eye drops are used to help stop the immune system from \"shutting down tear production,\" which can help with dry eye, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "Making lifestyle changes \u2014 like eating a well-rounded diet that includes anti-inflammatory foods and exercising regularly \u2014 can also help, Cunningham said.",

      "After a bitterly contested presidential campaign full of unprecedented twists and turns, voters returned Donald Trump to the White House after four years out of power. In an election where voters across the country wanted change, they chose Trump\u2019s outsider appeal over Kamala Harris\u2019 promise to \"turn the page\" on the Trump era.",
      "Trump\u2019s victory was powered by his strength on the economy and immigration \u2013 two of voters\u2019 top concerns. He was seen as a stronger leader than Harris in a time of turmoil, and voters remembered his presidency more fondly than their evaluations of the current administration. Trump ran up the score with his base while narrowing traditional Democratic advantages among Black, Hispanic, and young voters.",
      "Harris came close in her bid to become the first woman elected to the presidency but was unable to make enough gains in the ideological middle of the electorate to offset defections among groups that traditionally vote Democratic.",

      "Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump arrives at an election night watch party at the Palm Beach Convention Center on Nov. 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Florida. (Evan Vucci/AP)",
      "Voters headed to the polls believing the country was on the wrong track (70%, up from 60% who felt that way four years ago) and seeking something different: most wanted a change in how the country is run, with roughly a quarter seeking complete and total upheaval.",
      "Those seeking complete change in the country\u2019s affairs voted for the former president by a wide margin.",
      "Voters\u2019 frustrations with Joe Biden\u2019s administration were a drag on Harris\u2019 candidacy, as nearly 6 in 10 disapproved of the job Biden has done.",
      "Voters had rosier recollections of Trump\u2019s time in office, with half approving of the job he did as president. Four years ago, 47% approved of the job Trump had done.",
      "This desire for change was coupled with split views on the role of government. Slightly more than half felt the government should be doing more to solve the country\u2019s problems, a modest decline from 2020 (57%). Some 45% felt the government was doing too many things better left to the private sector.",
      "Profile of the Vote",
      "The nation\u2019s deep divides \u2013 by gender, education, and area of residence \u2013 were on vivid display. Men backed Trump by 10 points, while women went for Harris by 8 points. The 18-point gender gap was a touch wider than 2020 (17 points).",
      "In 2020, Trump won men by 5 points and Biden won women by 12.",
      "This divide was readily apparent in views of societal gains for women. Some 4 in 10 Trump supporters (43%) were concerned that society\u2019s focus on gains for women had come at the expense of men; just 14% of Harris felt that way. Overall, 29% were concerned.",
      "Voters without a college degree went for Trump by 12 points; college-educated voters went for Harris by 15 points. Harris\u2019 showing among college-educated voters was 1 point worse than Biden\u2019s 2020 showing among college-educated voters, while Trump bettered his 2020 numbers among noncollege voters by 4 points.",

      "Harris won college-educated Whites by 8 points and college-educated White women by 16 points \u2013 both in the ballpark of Biden\u2019s 2020 margins (+7 points and +21 points, respectively).",

      "Suburban voters backed Harris by 6 points, less than Biden\u2019s 10-point margin four years ago. Suburban women, a major source of strength for Biden (+19 points), went heavily for Harris (+16 points) \u2013 but she lost ground among suburban men (Trump +5 points, compared to +1 for Biden).",
      "While the election was, in part, about the deep divides in American society, Trump\u2019s success in attracting traditional Democratic constituencies was also a defining feature. He improved on his 2020 numbers among Hispanics (41%, +6 points), Black voters (15%, +7 points from 2020), and young voters (46%, +10 points).",
      "FOX NEWS PROJECTS DONALD TRUMP DEFEATS KAMALA HARRIS TO BECOME 47TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",

      "Seniors, who backed Trump by 3 points in 2020, were once again in the former president\u2019s column.",
      "Trump won Catholics by 9 points and Protestants by 22 points, while Harris held the edge among Jewish voters (+34 points), Muslims (+32 points), and the religiously unaffiliated (+40 points).",

      "Harris\u2019 best groups included college-educated women, Black voters, liberals, and urban voters.",
      "That each candidate successfully appealed to their base is hardly surprising in a hyper-partisan political environment. Most Democrats (95%) backed Harris; slightly fewer Republicans (92%) backed Trump.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of Republicans (73%) considered themselves part of the MAGA movement. And while the Harris campaign touted endorsements from prominent Republicans, she was unable to convince enough non-MAGA Republicans to cross the aisle.",
      "Just 7% of voters self-identified as true independents, meaning they do not lean toward one party or another. Harris had a 7-point advantage with this pivotal swing group, a decline from Biden\u2019s 15-point edge in 2020.",
      "Harris was able to appeal to political moderates (+17 points), though once again to a lesser degree than Biden (+26 points in 2020).",

      "Views of the Candidates",
      "In a time of domestic discord and international conflict, Trump was able to project significant strength of character. A majority saw him as a strong leader; fewer felt that way about Harris.",
      "Voters also believed Trump would capably handle a crisis (54-48%) and had the right policy ideas (52%-47%).",
      "Harris had advantages on personal character (53% vs 43% for Trump), honesty (47%-41%), and having the mental capacity to serve as president (57%-52%). Equal numbers thought each would look out for people like them (48%-48%).",
      "But in an election where voters wanted change, slightly more thought Trump would bring positive change (51%-48%).",
      "Trump\u2019s voters were largely motivated by support for the former president (79%) rather than a vote against Harris (21%). Two-thirds of the vice president\u2019s supporters (66%) described their vote as for her; 34% as against Trump.",
      "On balance, voters had slightly more favorable views of Harris (48% favorable, 50% unfavorable) as a person than Trump (47% favorable, 51% unfavorable). The same was true at the vice-presidential level: views of Tim Walz (43% favorable, 42% unfavorable) were marginally better than opinions of JD Vance (43% favorable, 45% unfavorable). Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ended his third-party presidential bid and endorsed Trump in August, was just a touch less popular than the two running mates (42% favorable, 43% unfavorable).",
      "Harris\u2019 best groups included college-educated women, Black voters, liberals and urban voters. (Fox News)",
      "Although he won, Trump was unable to fully rehabilitate his image during his time out of office: four years ago, his favorable rating was under water by 7 points (46% favorable vs. 53% unfavorable).",
      "The spotlight was less kind to Biden, whose sharply negative favorability rating (40% favorable, 58% unfavorable) slipped significantly from four years ago (50% favorable, 48% unfavorable).",
      "Views of the candidates were shaped over the course of a condensed campaign marked by a string of earthshaking events: the criminal cases against Donald Trump, two assassination attempts against the former president, Biden withdrawing from the race after the first debate, and Harris attempting to be the first woman elected to the presidency.",
      "Relatively few voters (13%) said the possibility of electing the first woman president was the most important factor to their vote. Harris won these voters by a wide margin \u2013 but a third backed Trump to deny Harris the chance to be the first female commander-in-chief.",
      "The image of a bloodied and defiant Trump after the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, clearly galvanized his supporters, as 16% said the attempts were the most important factor to their vote, and they overwhelmingly backed Trump.",
      "Voters had a net-positive view of the Secret Service (52% approve, 46% disapprove), though 62% of Trump voters disapproved of the job the organization is doing.",
      "Opinions of the Supreme Court (50% approve, 49% disapprove) were evenly divided, while two-thirds disapproved of Congress (31% approve, 68% disapprove).",
      "Views on the Issues",
      "As voters headed to the polls, they said the economy was far and away the top issue facing the country, followed distantly by immigration and abortion.",
      "Four in 10 voters (40%) said inflation was the single most important factor to their vote, and they backed Trump by almost two-to-one.",
      "Harris countered Trump\u2019s advantages on inflation and immigration by winning the 26% who focused primarily on abortion by 41 points and the 50% who prioritized the future of American democracy by 27 points.",
      "Nearly one-third (31%) said freedom of speech was most important to their vote, and they went somewhat more narrowly for Trump (+8 points).",
      "As voters headed to the polls, they said the economy was far and away the top issue facing the country, followed distantly by immigration and abortion. (Fox News)",
      "Voters had a negative view of the economy: nearly two-thirds rated it as not good (40%) or downright poor (24%). Four years ago, in the depths of a coronavirus-induced recession, only 14% said economic conditions were poor.",
      "In a sign of inflation\u2019s economic toll, nearly three times as many voters said they were falling behind financially as said they were getting ahead. In 2020, 13% said they were getting ahead and 18% were falling behind, with the majority (69%) holding steady.",
      "Those who said they were getting ahead went for Harris by 42 points and those holding steady backed her by a narrower 6-point spread, while those falling behind went for Trump by 29 points.",
      "Nearly all voters were concerned about being able to afford food (91%, including 67% very concerned), and most were worried about paying for health care (84%, 54% very concerned), housing (79%, 51% very), and gas (79%, 48% very).",
      "Voters preferred Trump to Harris by 9 points on handling the economy and by 5 points on taxes.",
      "Despite preferring Trump on the economy, voters split on his signature economic policy, increasing tariffs on goods imported to the United States.",
      "Trump\u2019s advantage on immigration was larger than his edge on the economy, as voters preferred him on the issue by 15 points.",
      "Over the course of the campaign, Trump promised \"the largest domestic deportation operation in American history\" \u2013 and succeeded in changing voters\u2019 minds on the issue. Four years ago, 70% believed undocumented immigrants should be offered the chance to apply for legal status, while 29% felt they should be deported. Voters\u2019 views this year were markedly different.",
      "Relatedly, two-thirds favored limiting the number of immigrants allowed to apply for asylum \u2013 a policy adopted by both the Trump and Biden administrations, but more closely associated with Trump.",
      "Voters also thought Trump would do a better job handling crime than Harris by 9 points.",
      "Harris\u2019 advantages on climate change (voters preferred her to Trump by 18 points) and abortion (Harris +18 points) outpaced Trump\u2019s edge on immigration and crime.",
      "All told, nearly two-thirds (63%) said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, up from the 59% who felt that way four years ago, before the repeal of Roe v. Wade.",
      "The balance was closer, however, when voters considered a ban after 15 weeks: 46% in favor, 53% opposed.",
      "In a sign of inflation\u2019s economic toll, nearly three times as many voters said they were falling behind financially as said they were getting ahead. In 2020, 13% said they were getting ahead and 18% were falling behind, with the majority (69%) holding steady. (Fox News)",
      "A slim majority opposed banning gender-affirming medical treatments for minors who identify as transgender. The Trump campaign spent millions of advertising dollars highlighting Harris\u2019 past support of gender-affirming care for the incarcerated.",
      "Even if they did not agree with her on transgender health care, voters saw Harris as better able to handle health care more broadly (by 8 points) and largely envisioned a more active government role. Majorities felt the government should be more involved in lowering the price of prescription medication (75%), eliminating medical debt (58%), and ensuring individuals have health insurance coverage (58%).",
      "Slightly fewer, 50%, said the government should be more involved in ensuring children are vaccinated against common preventable diseases, but just 22% wanted the government less involved in vaccinations.",
      "A week before the election, Harris used a speech at the Ellipse in Washington \u2013 the site of the Jan. 6, 2021, Trump rally that preceded the violent events at the Capitol \u2013 to cast Trump as a threat to American democracy.",
      "A 55% majority was concerned Trump would move the country closer to authoritarian rule, while less than half (46%) felt Harris posed a similar threat.",
      "Even so, majorities felt each candidate\u2019s views were too extreme.",
      "Voters split over how much responsibility Trump bore for the violence at the United States Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Harris won those who felt Trump had a great deal of responsibility by 86 points, while Trump won those who felt he was not to blame at all by 91 points. The group in the middle \u2013 who felt he was somewhat responsible for the violence \u2013 went for Trump by 40 points.",
      "In general, slightly more voters felt the way Republicans talk about politics leads to violence (56%) than felt the same about Democrats (50%).",
      "Despite unsubstantiated allegations of fraud in the 2020 election results and Trump raising similar concerns about the 2024 contest, three-quarters of voters (75%) were confident votes would be counted accurately at the national level, and even more were confident in their state\u2019s ability to properly count the vote.",
      "While 31% lacked confidence that ineligible voters would be prohibited from voting, that was down from 35% who felt that way four years ago. Few (9%) worried that eligible voters would be prevented from casting ballots.",
      "Overall, 89% felt both candidates were obligated to accept the results of the election once all the votes were counted and the inevitable legal challenges were resolved. The vast majority of Harris voters (95%) and Trump voters (82%) felt there was an obligation to accept the results.",
      "Trump countered Harris\u2019 closing argument by suggesting Harris was too weak and untested to respond effectively in a crisis. Three-quarters thought Harris had been tested, and these voters felt she had delivered negative results by a 5-point margin. Most voters felt Trump had been tested, and slightly more felt he had delivered positive results than negative ones.",
      "The ongoing violence in the Middle East served to reinforce Trump\u2019s argument about leadership in a crisis, as voters believed he would do a better job handling the situation.",
      "Voters favored continuing aid to Israel to fight Hamas and Hezbollah by 9 points, while favoring continued aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression by 11 points.",
      "There was a marked shift in voters\u2019 views of America\u2019s role in the world. Just 20% wanted the country to take a more active role in solving the world\u2019s problems, down from 37% who felt that way four years ago. Roughly equal numbers said the current approach was about right (38%) or preferred a less active role (40%).",
      "States",
      "Georgia swung back to the Republican column after Biden eked out a win by the slimmest of margins in 2020. With the margins so narrow, the smallest shifts from 2020 would have been enough to flip the state to Trump. Instead, he got substantial movement among constituencies Democrats were counting on to keep the state blue.",
      "Harris won women by 5 points, down from Biden\u2019s 10-point advantage in 2020. She won voters under age 30 by 9 points, down from +19 for Biden. There was a similar shift among Black voters, who form the backbone of Democratic support in the Peach State: from Biden +86 points to Harris +71 points.",
      "The shift among Black men was particularly consequential, as they went for Harris by just 51 points after breaking for Biden by 76 points four years ago.",
      "Harris was counting on a strong performance in the suburbs to offset Trump\u2019s strength (+31 points) with rural voters, but here again she came up well short of Biden\u2019s mark: winning by just 3 points, a far cry from Biden\u2019s 12-point win.",
      "Trump was dominant with White voters without a college degree (78%) and White evangelical Christians (82%).",
      "Trump appealed to voters across the state on economic grounds and found a ready audience, as huge numbers said they were concerned about paying for necessities like food (93%), health care (87%), gas (84%), and housing (83%).",
      "Georgia voters trusted Trump over Harris on the economy by 8 points.",
      "Voters preferred Harris by a wider margin (19 points) on abortion. Harris highlighted the case of Amber Thurman, the Georgia mother who died waiting for care after complications from an abortion pill, as an example of the harms of abortion bans.",
      "Trump, on the other hand, shone a spotlight on Laken Riley, a nursing student allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant while jogging in February. His message on immigration proved compelling, as voters favored him on the issue by 17 points.",
      "Overall, 54% would prefer illegal immigrants be deported, a substantial increase from the 32% who felt that way in 2020. Less than half (44%) said undocumented immigrants should be given the chance to apply for legal status.",
      "Georgia was a focal point for controversy after the 2020 election, but 8 in 10 voters were confident this year\u2019s votes would be counted accurately.",
      "Trump triumphed once again in North Carolina, as Republicans have now won 10 of the last 11 presidential elections in the state. Barack Obama\u2019s narrow win in 2008 was the only Democratic victory since Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency.",
      "Trump posted similar results to 2020 among White voters without a college degree (74%, vs 69% four years ago), rural voters (63%, up 3 points from 2020), and White evangelical Christians (87%, up 1 point from 2020).",
      "That alone might have been a winning formula \u2013 but shifts among Black voters and voters under age 30 pushed Trump over the top.",
      "Overall, young voters backed Harris by just 8 points after going for Biden by 16 points four years ago. The shift was entirely powered by young men, who backed the former president by 16 points. Women under 30 went for Harris by 25 points.",
      "The story was similar among Black voters: Black women were nearly universal in their support for Harris (93%), while 19% of Black men backed Trump, up from 6% in 2020.",
      "Overall, 88% of Black voters picked Harris, down substantially from Biden\u2019s 94%.",

      "2) Install and run strong antivirus software: An antivirus software actively running on all of your devices can help keep them all safe, including your iPhone. With iPhones, strong antivirus software will prevent you from clicking on any malicious links that may then install malware onto your devices, which can potentially extract personal information from your device. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These can be phishing attempts designed to steal your personal information.",

      "While most iPhone users rest easy knowing that the iOS keeps most common viruses and malware at bay, they are still susceptible to scammers trying to work around the closed code and scaring people into making bad choices that endanger their phones and data. Because Apple never sends out alerts about viruses or malware on your iPhone, it should be the first clue of a scam. Even if it looks official, iPhone users do not get alerts from Apple about viruses or malware. If you do install a good antivirus program, that will be the only program notifying you that there is anything amiss with your iPhone. Understanding these scams can go a long way in keeping you calm and your phone safe.",

      "Common misconceptions",
      "Opening emails can instantly infect your device: One common myth is that simply opening an email can automatically infect your device with malware. In reality, modern email systems (such as Gmail, Outlook, etc.) generally prevent this from happening. The real danger comes from interacting with the content inside the email, such as clicking on malicious links or downloading harmful attachments.",
      "Plain text emails are always safe: While emails in plain text format are generally safer than HTML-based emails, they can still pose a risk if they contain malicious links. Phishing attacks can appear in plain text emails, luring you to dangerous websites.",
      "Emails from known contacts are always safe: Even if an email appears to come from someone you know, that doesn\u2019t always mean it's safe. Attackers can spoof email addresses or hack accounts, so always be cautious about unexpected or unusual messages from known contacts, especially those containing links or attachments.",
      "Spam filters catch all malicious emails: Spam filters are highly effective but not perfect. Some sophisticated phishing and malicious emails can bypass these filters and land in your inbox. This is why it\u2019s important to stay vigilant, even with emails that seem to have passed your email service\u2019s security checks.",
      "Previewing emails is always safe: Most modern email clients use a \"preview\" pane for quick reading. While the risk of malware through previews is significantly reduced in up-to-date systems, embedded trackers or other forms of data collection can still occur, confirming your activity to the spammer. Always disable automatic image loading or other active content features in your email client\u2019s settings to minimize exposure.",

      "1) Embedded trackers: Some spam or\u00a0phishing emails contain trackers that can notify the sender when the email is opened. This can confirm to the spammer that your email address is active, potentially leading to more spam.",
      "2) Malicious links and attachments: The real danger lies in clicking on links or downloading attachments within the email. These can lead to malicious websites or download malware onto your device.",
      "3) HTML emails: Emails that contain HTML content can sometimes execute scripts when opened. While modern email clients have protections against this, it\u2019s still a potential risk.",
      "4) Phishing attempts: Even if you don\u2019t click on anything,\u00a0phishing emails can be designed to look very convincing and may trick you into providing personal information if you respond.",

      "3) Enable email filtering: Turn on spam filters to reduce the number of unsolicited or potentially dangerous emails reaching your inbox. This reduces your exposure to phishing attempts. Most email platforms these days automatically filter out what they assume to be \"junk\" into their own folder. If you notice the amount of spam getting through to your inbox increasing, you may want to consider a\u00a0Spam Filter.\u00a0There are free options for different email providers. For Gmail, try\u00a0Mailwasher. For Outlook and Windows Mail, try\u00a0Spam Bully, which costs an annual fee of $29.95.",
      "4) Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your email client and operating system to stay protected from the latest security vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit.",

      "He'd make the benefits tax-free, but the costs could be significant.",
      "With most of your life attached to these nine numbers, your Social Security number (SSN) is incredibly important to keep safe. That\u2019s why it is crucial to pay attention to signs that your SSN may have been compromised. While preventing the misuse of your SSN is paramount, there are action steps you can take if it does fall into the wrong hands.",

      "There are steps you can take if your Social Security number falls into the wrong hands. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Top signs someone might be using your Social Security number",
      "Are you concerned that your Social Security number may have gotten into the wrong hands? Check below to see if you are experiencing any of these signs:",
      "Americans are granted free credit reports every 12 months from the three major consumer reporting companies. Regularly culling through these reports can help you spot potential fraud, which might signal that your Social Security number has been compromised. Any hard inquiries you didn\u2019t request on your credit report are a strong indicator that someone tried to open a credit card or another line of credit with your SSN.",
      "While most people know they should check their credit report and scores, you can see your Social Security statement by creating an account on the official Social Security Administration website. Because only one account can be created per SSN, it is safer if you claim it so that no one else can by piecing together your personal information (along with your SSN) to claim it fraudulently. Make sure it is connected to a secure email account that you check frequently. This account also provides up-to-date data on earnings and benefit distributions so you can see if anything is \"off.\"",
      "You can see your Social Security statement by creating an account on the official Social Security Administration website. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEWARE OF THIS SOCIAL SECURITY SCAM BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU",
      "While it might seem natural to toss a pile of \"junk\" mailers or ignore calls from random debt collectors or advertisers, it may be an indicator that someone has gotten a hold of your Social Security number and has begun opening accounts under your number. It\u2019s important to make note of the patterns and follow up with these collectors should it become more and more apparent that your SSN might have been misused. Oftentimes, consumers start getting more credit offers when new credit cards are opened. Additionally, if you start receiving bills under someone else\u2019s name at your address, it might be time to follow up with these notices.",
      "If you start receiving notices about your Social Security number being used to file someone else\u2019s taxes or inappropriately use your health insurance, it is definitely a sign that someone may have compromised your SSN. While receiving a notice from the IRS or Medicare can feel scary, it is imperative that you reach out to the corresponding agency to notify them of the fraudulent activity so that you can stop further damage.",
      "Beware of new notices from the IRS or other governmental agencies. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Top ways to keep your Social Security number safe",
      "Go to the official Social Security Administration website to create an account,\u00a0if you haven\u2019t already.",
      "Put your Social Security number card in a very safe place, such as a safe, bank safe or a filing cabinet that can be locked. Because it is used so frequently, those nine digits are worth memorizing. If your wallet is lost or stolen, and you keep your SSN card in there, it will be messier than losing just money or your ID. Don\u2019t carry your Social Security card in your wallet or purse.",
      "Skip jotting down your Social Security number on in-person forms. When your SSN is jotted down on paper, it is hard to control how the information gets used or disposed of. If you can submit forms online, you can skip the risk of having your SSN getting into the wrong hands. If you mail in forms that denote your SSN, you risk having that piece of mail stolen or lost.",
      "Even though your SSN is requested on some forms, it is not always necessary. If a future employer is requesting your SSN, double-check why they need it. They would most likely need it to run a background check, which you should know about anyway. Additionally, some establishments allow you to provide the last four digits of your SSN until you are finalizing a screening process, etc.",
      "Open accounts for your children's Social Security numbers because you want to claim them for them early and be able to monitor any movement related to their SSN.",
      "Some records that contain your Social Security number are important to keep on hand, such as income tax filings. If they are kept digitally, encrypt and or password-protect the document or folder, especially if it is uploaded to the cloud. Keep offline documents with SSNs in a safe or shred instead of throwing them away.",
      "Remember you (usually) only get one SSN in a lifetime, it is important to safeguard that data with your \"life.\"",
      "Removing your personal information from the internet, given the increasing privacy concerns about artificial intelligence, is essential. Data removal services can help protect your Social Security number by systematically erasing your details from websites, thus reducing the risk of identity theft.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "To further protect your tax returns from identity theft, the IRS offers an identity protection PIN (IP PIN). This is a six-digit number that prevents someone else from filing a tax return using your Social Security number or individual taxpayer identification number. The IP PIN is known only to you and the IRS, adding an extra layer of security to your tax filings.",

While it may feel overwhelming to see any of these signs that your SSN might be compromised, it\u2019s important to know there are steps you can take to protect yourself moving forward. While paying regularly for fraud protection services may seem like an unnecessary expense when you\u2019re not presently dealing with identity or credit issues, a fraud protection service subscription can help you focus on your present moment instead of worrying about what a criminal might do with your SSN.

The malware we\u2019re talking about here is just like that. It\u2019s called FakeCalls, and every time researchers figure out how it infects devices, it evolves with new ways to hide.",

      "What you need to know",
      "FakeCalls is a banking trojan that focuses on voice phishing, where victims are deceived through fraudulent calls impersonating banks and are asked to share sensitive information. Earlier versions did this by prompting users to call the bank from within an app that impersonated the financial institution, as reported by\u00a0Bleeping Computer. However, the latest version, analyzed by\u00a0Zimperium, sets itself as the default call handler.",
      "The default call handler app manages incoming and outgoing calls, allowing users to answer, reject or initiate calls. Giving these permissions to a malicious app, as you can imagine, carries serious risks.",
      "When a user gives the app permission to set itself as the default call handler, the malware gets the green light to intercept and mess with both outgoing and incoming calls. It even shows a fake call interface that looks just like the real Android dialer, complete with trusted contact info and names. This level of deception makes it really tough for victims to see what's happening.",

The developer of the malware has also added several new commands, including the ability to start livestreaming the device's screen, take screenshots, unlock the device if it\u2019s locked and temporarily turn off auto-lock.

Historically, Play Protect hasn\u2019t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. Also, avoid clicking on any links in messages or emails that seem suspicious. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any\u00a0phishing emails or\u00a0ransomware scams.",

      "2) Download apps from reliable sources:\u00a0It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources, like the Google Play Store. The FakeCalls malware infects your phone when you download an app from an unknown link. As an Android user, you should only download apps from the Play Store, which has strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Also, never trust download links that you receive through SMS.",
      "3) Be cautious with app permissions: Always review the permissions requested by apps before installation. If an app requests access to features that seem unnecessary for its function, it could be a sign of malicious intent. Do not give any app Accessibility permissions unless you really need to. Avoid granting permissions that could compromise your personal data.",
      "4) Regularly update your device\u2019s operating system and apps: Keeping your software\u00a0up to date is crucial, as updates often include security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware like FakeCalls.",
      "5) Monitor financial activity regularly: Check your bank and credit card statements often for unauthorized transactions. Set up alerts for any account activity, which can notify you immediately if suspicious activity occurs.",
      "6) Limit sensitive transactions on mobile: Whenever possible, avoid performing high-risk transactions (like large money transfers) on your mobile device, especially if you\u2019re in\u00a0public or connected to unsecured Wi-Fi. Use a secure computer or contact your bank directly from a verified number.",

All USB-C ports also support the fastest Thunderbolt 4 standard, which means you can transfer large videos and other files faster. The display is still a 24-inch panel with 4.5K resolution, but Apple is now offering a \"nano-texture glass\" option for an extra $200, designed to reduce reflections and glare.",
      "There are a few other updates, too. The base RAM has doubled to 16GB from the previous model, with an option to go up to 32GB on the higher-end version. The new iMac also includes a 12MP webcam and introduces Apple Intelligence features, which are finally rolling out. These include AI-powered writing and editing tools and a redesigned Siri, now powered by ChatGPT.",
      "The\u00a0M4 iMac now comes in new colors, including green, yellow, orange, pink, and purple. Silver remains an option too. It\u2019s available for preorder now, with shipping starting Nov. 8.

First announced in 2005, it retained the same design until 2010, but Apple finally changed it with the latest model. They\u2019ve shrunk the case, reducing the computer\u2019s volume by half. The new Mini is now a five-inch by five-inch box that\u2019s just two inches tall, while the older model measures 7.75 inches by 7.75 inches and is 1.41 inches thick.",
      "The main upgrade for the new computer is the inclusion of Apple\u2019s latest chips, either the M4 or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro. The\u00a0M4 Mini\u00a0comes equipped with two USB-C ports and a headphone jack on the front. These front USB-C ports support USB 3, with speeds of up to 10Gbps.",
      "On the back, you\u2019ll find three USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports (up to 40Gbps), along with Ethernet and HDMI connections. The higher-end M4 Pro model also features Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, which offers transfer speeds of up to 120Gbps and the ability to connect up to three displays.",
      "The starting price of the\u00a0Mac Mini remains the same at $599. This baseline model comes with the M4 chip featuring 10 CPU cores and 10 GPU cores, along with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. For $799, you can double the SSD to 512GB, while the $999 model bumps the RAM up to 24GB. These are solid prices, which isn\u2019t something I say often about Apple products.",

But if you\u2019re just using an\u00a0iMac for general tasks like browsing or light work, you might be better off with an older model to save some cash. The M4 Mac Mini, though, is a great value option with a competitive price and an extra $100 education discount. For those needing even more power, the new M4 MacBook Pros feature both M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, with base RAM now starting at 24GB on the Pro models and 16GB on the entry-level 14-inch version.",

Your data profile can be sold to many different buyers, including targeted advertising and marketing companies, as well as\u00a0government agencies.",
      "How a data broker uses your information",
      "Some data brokers offer personal profiles directly to consumers, and you might be surprised by how much information they have about you. Have you ever tried searching for someone on a \"people search\" website? These sites let you enter a name and find out all sorts of information about that person. Try searching for yourself or someone you know. You might find out who used to live at your current address, how much money you make and who your relatives are.",
      "Where do people search sites get their information?",
      "People search sites get their information from public records like court documents and voter registration forms. They usually offer some basic information for free, but if you want more details, you\u2019ll have to sign up for a free trial. And when you do, they\u2019ll probably ask for even more information about you.",
      "The scary thing is that anyone with a computer can access this information, including identity thieves. With just a few key pieces of information, they can call your bank, reset your passcodes and take over your financial accounts.",
      "Even cyberstalkers and blackmailers can use people search sites to find out more about you. Sure, most sites make users promise not to use the information for illegal purposes, but there\u2019s no real way to enforce that. It\u2019s all based on the honor system.",
      "Taking control: removing your information from data brokers",
      "Don\u2019t worry though; there\u2019s something you can do about it. You can request that data brokers remove your information.\u00a0 But with hundreds of them in the U.S. alone, it can be a daunting task. That\u2019s where removal services come in.",
      "Invest in data removal services",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "The persistence of robocalls: why are they still a problem?",
      "While it\u2019s important to take steps to protect your personal information, such as removing it from data broker sites, there are still other threats to our privacy and security. For example, despite efforts to crack down on robocalls, scammers are constantly finding new ways to evade detection and continue their operations. Furthermore, as technology improves, robocallers are able to use more sophisticated methods, such as \"spoofing\" their phone numbers to make it appear as though they are calling from a different location or entity.",
      "Moreover, spam callers are becoming so sophisticated that they have started to add conversational speech to their scripts to further convince their unsuspecting victims to go along with their scams. For instance, the caller may stumble on their words, use \"umm\" a lot, and sometimes even use slang to signal to the listener that the caller is not a robot but an ordinary person, but beware! While some robocalls can range from harmless reminders, most are malicious scams, leaving many frustrated and vulnerable to fraud. There are steps you can take, however, to put an end to these pesky calls for good.",

      "Wurmser noted that\u00a0\"Ukraine is not facing an incessant attempt from the first days of the Ukraine war of self-defense to stop the war in a way that allows its enemy to consolidate its gains and pocket a victory.\u00a0Only recently has the United States begun to indicate the preference for, but did not impose material pressure on yet, Ukraine to move toward a cease-fire.

      "Cease-fire talks continued last week as Israel, the U.S., Egypt and Qatar looked to find a solution to free the hostages and stop the war, yet life in the trenches goes on. Fox News Digital spoke with an IDF colonel based in the explosive Netzarim corridor in Gaza.",
      "The Netzarim Corridor splits Gaza in half, and it's here where IDF Col. Amir Ofri\u00a0organizes his troops in a fight against terrorists. The atmosphere is tense, he says, and describes a recent incident where a Gazan woman stumbled toward his unit checkpoint, her movements erratic, suggesting disorientation. As she approached, he recalls her repeatedly glancing over her shoulder, seemingly reluctant to come closer. He says it was clear to him that she was under the influence of drugs.",
      "\"We try to assess whether she poses a threat or is armed,\" Ofri tells Fox News Digital. But as the woman gets closer, it becomes obvious she is being directed by someone behind her. The decision is made to send her back, but as they do, his soldiers identify Hamas spotters in a nearby school in the refugee camp of Al-Bureij. As the soldiers move closer, terrorists fire at them from the windows, unleashing anti-tank missiles and explosives.",

      "\"Women and children, Hamas exploits the population in extreme and cruel ways,\" he says during a Zoom interview. \"I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\"",
      "On the morning that Hamas attacked Israeli communities and settlements close to Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, Col. Ofri was with his family in the north to celebrate his 46th birthday. A seasoned officer, he immediately reported for duty to a base in the Negev Desert a little more than 30 kilometers from the border. By the next day, his reserve armored brigade was positioned at the Gaza fence, ready for whatever lay ahead. \"We were the first to enter Gaza on Oct. 21,\" he recalls.",
      "The responsibility he bears weighs heavily on him. \"It's been over nine months since I\u2019ve seen my wife and children for more than a fleeting moment,\" he says. Before the war, he directed a company with factories in Israel, Spain and the U.S. \"My partner in Oklahoma was one of the first to call me after Oct. 7. He said he hoped the U.S. would send everything it could to help us.\"",

      "His mission along the Netzarim Corridor, which serves both as a lifeline for humanitarian aid and a strategic position in the ongoing conflict, is critical. \"Our job is to keep the route open for humanitarian convoys,\" Ofri explains. \"Every day presents unique challenges and risks.\"",
      "The Netzarim Corridor is pivotal in the Gaza Strip. With the onset of the ground campaign, IDF forces established a four-kilometer wide corridor to split Gaza in two, from its eastern border to the Mediterranean Sea. Key towns sit along the route \u2013 Jabalia and Zeitoun to the north, and Al-Bureij and Nuseirat to the south.",
      "The other side, Hamas, doesn\u2019t account for the population; they exploit them. The terrorists we eliminate often wear civilian clothes. Some are disguised as women.\"",
      "Fifteen years after Gaza was last under Israel\u2019s military control, this strategic route is again being held by the IDF. The majority of Gaza\u2019s population has been evacuated south, allowing the IDF to maintain nearly full control over significant parts of the Strip. However, it has also become one of the most dangerous areas in the conflict, with Israeli soldiers killed and injured since operations began.",

      "Despite these difficulties, Ofri\u2019s brigade has operated with minimal casualties. \"Eight fighters from my brigade have fallen since the fighting began,\" he says somberly. \"But we haven\u2019t lost any soldiers while securing the corridor, and that\u2019s the result of learning from others\u2019 experiences.\"",

      "\"All the convoys we needed to pass did pass, and then we saw Hamas setting up roadblocks, stopping and looting them,\" he says, elaborating on the complicated dynamics on the ground. \"Hamas targets specific trucks rather than looting indiscriminately. We observed them unloading supplies quickly, moving items into warehouses. We even saw armed Hamas vehicles leaving those locations, with guards at the entrances.\"",

As someone who approves all operations for the brigade, I state clearly that no fire is intentionally directed at women or children. Not a single shell or airstrike is executed without assessing potential collateral damage.\"",

      "\"The problem lies in Hamas's cynical use of the population,\" Ofri says. He blames the terror organization for the loss of so many civilian lives. \"We witnessed this during the recent Iranian attack. As soon as the Iranian assault began, on October 1, Hamas operatives attacked us. We were on the southern side of the corridor when they used short-range mortars to exploit the situation, pushing civilians toward our position.

      "In October, Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader and the mastermind behind the Oct. 7 attack, was killed by the IDF in Rafah, in southern Gaza. While many speculate that Sinwar\u2019s death may lead to a turning point in the conflict, Ofri remains dubious. \"In my view, he was just another terrorist who deserved to die. He\u2019s just another obstacle in the effort to release hostages. I understand we won\u2019t be able to free them through military means alone. However, I believe military pressure is the only strategy that has led to the first hostage deal.\"",
      "And it is because of the hostages that Israel must continue fighting, he says. \"There are 101 hostages left, many of whom are relatives of our soldiers. Oct. 7 affected us all. I lost friends that day as well,\" Ofri says. \"That\u2019s why we come together time and again, although it gets harder and harder. If you ask any soldier, they will tell you it\u2019s about the hostages.\"",

      "Badenoch, 44, replaces former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and has pledged to lead the party through a period of renewal after its resounding defeat at Britain's July election, saying it had veered towards the political center by \"governing from the left\".",
      "UK PM KEIR STARMER IN HOT WATER FOR ACCEPTING FREEBIES, INSISTS HE\u2019S DONE NOTHING WRONG",

      "Badenoch became the Conservatives' fifth leader since mid-2016 after winning 57% of party members' votes in the final stage of a months-long contest that saw a field of six whittled down to two. She beat a former immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, who won 43% of the votes.",
      "Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed her victory, saying \"the first Black leader of a Westminster party is a proud moment for our country\".",
      "Badenoch herself has publicly said she prefers not to focus on her race.",
      "Asked at the Conservative Party conference earlier this year how it would feel to become the first Black woman leader of the party, she said: \"I am somebody who wants the color of our skin to be no more significant than the color of our hair or the color of our eyes.\"",

      "\"They (the Conservative Party) are not more approachable because of the fact that they've now got a Black person,\" said Imani Samuels, a student. \"It will just depend on what she's doing.\"",
      "Asked about Badenoch's comment on her skin color, Samuels replied: \"She should be proud of that, and she should step forward with her Blackness, because to have such a position and to be Black and a woman should be something she's very proud to say.\"",

      "'Tell the truth'",
      "Badenoch promised on Saturday to tackle problems in the party head-on.",
      "\"The time has come to tell the truth,\" she told the audience at the final count of the leadership contest, promising to answer the main questions over how the Conservatives lost the July election so badly.",
      "\"It is time to get down to business, it is time to renew.\"",
      "With forthright views on everything from what she calls identity politics to the value of officials, Badenoch attracts both strong admirers and detractors. She is certain to shake up the Conservatives, who saw their contingent of lawmakers in the 650-seat parliament fall in July to 121 from 365 seats in 2019.",
      "With the Labour government off to a bumpy start, some Conservatives are increasingly optimistic that they could win back power at the next election, which has to be held in 2029.",
      "But some more centrist Conservatives worry Badenoch might alienate not only the more moderate wing of the party but also some voters who were won over by the centrist Liberal Democrats at the last election.",

    "summary": "Americans are poised to elect a new Congress as every seat in the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate is up before voters on Election Day.",
    "story": [
      "Republicans will win control of the Senate for the next two years, NBC News projects, though control of the House is still up for grabs.",
      "Senate Republicans ousted Democrats in red states to secure the majority, flipping seats in West Virginia, Montana and Ohio, states that have swung heavily to the GOP. And they held their ground in friendly states like Texas and Florida, assuring them at least 51 seats when the new Congress is sworn in next January.",
      "The GOP's success at converting a dream Senate map to victories where it counted most will give the party control of legislation and nominations under President-elect Donald Trump. NBC News has not yet projected a winner in the race for control of the House.",
      "Follow 2024 election live updates",
      "Democrats had hoped their slate of incumbents and heavy outside spending by allied groups would help overcome headwinds in those red states. But ultimately the force of political gravity won out.",
      "The GOP senators are expected to elect a new leader next week as longtime Republican leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is stepping down from the role after a record 18 years. His current deputy, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., and former deputy, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, are battling to take the job when the new Congress begins.",
      "\u201cThe Biden-Harris administration has forced the American people to endure four years of high prices, open borders, and chaos on the world stage,\" Thune, the GOP whip, said in a statement. \"Tonight, with Republicans reclaiming majority control of the U.S. Senate, we can begin to turn the page on this expensive and reckless chapter of American history.\"",
      "Every nonincumbent president since 1992 has entered office with their party controlling both chambers of Congress. But with the House still up for grabs, there\u2019s no guarantee that\u2019ll happen this year for Trump.",
      "Republicans were favored to win the Senate",
      "Democrats entered Election Day with a 51-49 edge. As expected, Republicans will pick up an open seat in deep-red West Virginia, with NBC News projecting that Gov. Jim Justice has won the election to succeed retiring Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Joe Manchin.",
      "In the red state of Ohio, Republican candidate Bernie Moreno has defeated Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, NBC News projected.",
      "And the party flipped a Democratic-held seat in red Montana, where Democratic Sen. Jon Tester lost to GOP rival Tim Sheehy.",
      "Democrats are defending another five seats in purple states that are highly competitive at the presidential level: Sen. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania; an open seat in Michigan, where Sen. Debbie Stabenow is retiring; Sen. Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin; an open seat in Arizona, where Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Krysten Sinema is retiring; and Sen. Jacky Rosen in Nevada.",
      "But Democrats\u2019 best hopes for capturing a Republican-held seat faded in Texas, where Sen. Ted Cruz won re-election to a third term, NBC News projected. In red-trending Florida, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., also won re-election, defeating former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, NBC News projected. Some Democrats had held out hope for a miracle in Florida but outside groups largely voided the race.",
      "In deep-red Nebraska, the populist independent candidate Dan Osborn was running competitively against low-profile Republican Sen. Deb Fischer, but Fischer held on.",
      "A close fight for the House",
      "The race for the House is on a knife-edge, with redistricting accounting for some early seat changes but no clear trend about which way control of the chamber is headed.",
      "Republicans came into Election Day holding a 220-212 majority, with three vacancies \u2014 two in safe blue seats, one in a safe red seat. Democrats will need to pick up just four seats in order to capture control of the House and, with it, the speaker\u2019s gavel and chairmanships of all committees.",
      "The battlefield is narrow. According to the Cook Political Report, there are 22 \u201ctoss-up\u201d seats at the heart of the fight \u2014 10 held by Democrats and 12 held by Republicans. A few dozen more seats are being hotly contested but lean toward one party.",
      "Notably, the blue states of New York and California host 10 ultra-competitive House districts. Those two states are expected to be comfortably won by Harris at the presidential level, but Republicans are investing heavily in holding and flipping downballot seats there.",
      "In New York, Republicans were defending four seats they flipped in 2022, which helped propel them to the House majority. Democratic challenger John Mannion on Tuesday knocked off GOP Rep. Brandon Williams in a Syracuse-based district, while Republican Rep. Mike Lawler held on against former Democratic Rep. Mondaire Jones. The other GOP freshmen fighting for re-election are Reps. Marc Molinaro and Anthony D\u2019Esposito. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan beat back a challenge from Republican Alison Esposito in New York's Hudson Valley in a race that was rated \u201clean Democrat.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania, six-term Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright, a former member of leadership who represents President Joe Biden's hometown of Scranton, lost to Republican Rob Bresnahan. In a neighboring district, Democratic Rep. Susan Wild conceded to a GOP challenger she significantly outraised, state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie. NBC News has not yet called that race.",
      "\u201cI lost this election, and my opponent won,\" Wild said in a statement. \"I congratulate my opponent on winning this seat, and I am going to do everything to ensure a smooth transition, because the people of this district deserve nothing less.\"",

      "Freshman Rep. John Duarte is facing Democrat Adam Gray in the 13th District; Rep. David Valadao has a rematch against Democrat Rudy Salas in the 22nd District; Rep. Mike Garcia is fending off a challenge from Democrat George Whitesides in the 27th District; longtime Rep. Ken Calvert is trying to hold off Democrat Will Rollins in the 41st District; and Rep. Michelle Steel is squaring off with Democrat Derek Tran in the 48th District.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and the man who wants to replace him, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., have spent the past weeks crisscrossing those key House battlegrounds, as well as a slew of swing districts in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada and the Pacific Northwest.",
      "When polls opened Tuesday morning, the chair of the House Democratic campaign arm sounded a note of optimism.",
      "\u201cWe are in a very strong position,\u201d Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., told NBC News. \u201cWe have great candidates. We are with the American people on policy, in our message. We\u2019ve had the resources to get out the vote and communicate with voters all across the country, and that has all put us in a very strong position today to take back the majority, take back the gavels and make Hakeem Jeffries our next speaker.\u201d",
      "Still, she warned that the battle for the majority could be close and take \u201ca few days\u201d to count all the votes.",
      "But in a speech to supporters in his hometown of Shreveport, Louisiana, Johnson said he would fly late Tuesday to Mar-a-Lago to be with Trump \u2014 a sign that the speaker and Republicans feel they are having a good election night. Spokespeople for Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., and GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., said those leaders were also on their way to see Trump.",
      "\"I think it is a night, when they tabulate all this, I am very hopeful that we're going to have not only a larger majority in the House to make my job easier,\" Johnson told the crowd in Shreveport, \"but we retake the Senate and the White House as well. I think that's what's going to happen.\"",
      "A full plate",
      "The new Congress will have to work with Trump from the very start.",
      "The Fiscal Responsibility Act, the product of a deal between Biden and then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, extended the nation's debt limit until January 2025. The Treasury Department will be able to avert an immediate catastrophic debt default by using extraordinary measures to free up cash, but another bipartisan agreement will likely be needed.",
      "The Senate will spend the first part of the New Year confirming the president\u2019s judicial and Cabinet nominees, as well as hundreds of others nominated for other political roles.",
      "If Republicans manage to win complete control of Congress, they will be in the same situation they were in 2016 \u2014 with Trump back at the helm.",
      "In that scenario, Republicans will have to determine how to use budget reconciliation, an arcane process that would allow them to fast-track legislation without Democratic support: Do they push forward first with another round of Trump tax cuts? Or do they try once again to repeal or overhaul Obamacare, as they failed to do in 2017?",
      "Johnson, whose political fate is tied to the outcome of the election, has recently said Republicans would go big and pursue a \u201cmassive reform\u201d of the Affordable Care Act if his party wins.",
      "\u201cThe ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we got a lot of ideas on how to do that,\u201d Johnson said at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania."

      "The results and exit poll data reveal the undercurrents of what has shaped an election full of twists and turns.",
      "Here are five takeaways from election night 2024.",
      "Latinos swing dramatically to Trump",
      "It may be the biggest story of the race: Latino voters swung toward Trump by a staggering 25 percentage points compared with four years ago.",
      "Trump won the support of 45% of Latino voters nationally compared with 53% for Harris, the NBC News Exit Poll found. That's far better than the 33-point loss Trump suffered among Latinos in 2020, when he won 32% to Joe Biden\u2019s 65%. And it may end up being the strongest GOP performance among Latinos in a presidential race since George W. Bush carried 44% in 2004.",
      "Nationally, Latinos accounted for 12% of the electorate, and Trump\u2019s gains are boosting his margins across a host of battleground states, from Pennsylvania to Arizona, which complicated Harris\u2019 path.",
      "Trump's gains were fueled by a massive shift among Latino men, who backed him over Harris by 10 points.",
      "The swings are likely to force a reckoning among Democrats about why they're hemorrhaging support in the fast-growing demographic. Members of the party were bracing for some losses with Hispanic voters, but not at the level they suffered Tuesday.",
      "Political gravity catches up to Senate Democrats",
      "Democrats, facing an enormously difficult Senate map, had bet that their battle-tested incumbents would be able to defy political gravity once again in hostile territory \u2014 especially with the aid of millions of dollars in spending from allied groups.",
      "It was not to be.",
      "Republicans flipped Democratic-held seats in West Virginia, Ohio on Montana to capture the majority while comfortably holding their ground in red-leaning states like Texas, Florida and Nebraska.",
      "The result will give Republicans a boost when they set the agenda on big items Congress will have to deal with in 2025: the expiring Trump tax cuts and a potential extension of Obamacare subsidies designed to lower premiums for the middle class, as well as another extension of the debt ceiling and a new round of government funding.",
      "Harris gains with white women and college graduates",
      "The election showed signs of a racial realignment: Republicans made gains among nonwhite voters while Democrats gained a few points among white voters, primarily women.",
      "After Trump carried white women by 11 points in 2020, Harris narrowed the gap to 5 points, according to the NBC News Exit Poll.",
      "Biden beat Trump by 9 points among white women with college degrees four years ago. Harris expanded that advantage to 20 points, arguably her most significant demographic triumph among a historically Republican-leaning cohort.",
      "The education divide also grew overall: Harris gained a few points among college graduates, while Trump picked up a few points among voters without college degrees.",
      "And the generational divide flattened somewhat, as Trump gained among men under 30, winning 47% of them, compared to 49% for Harris.",
      "The abortion issue wasn\u2019t a panacea for Democrats",
      "Without a doubt, the issue of abortion and the backlash to overturning Roe v. Wade helped Harris. The NBC News Exit Poll found that abortion ranked as the third-most-important issue for voters, and Harris won those who cited it by 52 points.",
      "But abortion wasn't the defining issue of the cycle, with the economy and democracy trumping it. Trump handily won those who cited the economy as their top issue, while Harris comfortably won those who said they prioritize the state of democracy.",
      "In the end, economic concerns loomed large: Trump dominated by 40 points among the two-thirds of voters who rated the economy as \u201cnot so good\u201d or \u201cpoor.\u201d",
      "The battle for the House is headed for overtime",
      "Meanwhile, the results of the race for control of the narrowly divided House may not be known immediately.",
      "The reason is that the fight for the chamber's majority is playing out on a different battlefield from the one for the White House and the Senate. Competitive House districts are in the disproportionately white and well-educated suburbs, where Democrats have largely held their ground.",
      "The House majority is likely to be decided by races in blue states \u2014 most notably New York, where Democrats are poised to make gains, and California, where Republicans are defending five seats in difficult territory. Still, it's unclear Democrats will pick up enough seats to flip the House, as they've lost a bit of ground elsewhere.",
      "It leaves open a high-stakes question about the balance of power in Washington next year."

      "The unusually competitive contest to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin was always a must-win for Democrats, who are trying to hang onto their Senate majority.

      "The county executive in Prince George\u2019s County, Alsobrooks handily won the Democratic primary this year despite being outspent 10-to-1 by Rep. David Trone. Campaign spending only ballooned from there, with both Alsobrooks and Hogan spending tens of millions of dollars to sway voters in a state President Joe Biden won by more than 30 points in 2020. \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful having her in the Senate. She\u2019s eminently qualified. She\u2019ll do a great job for her state and for the people of the country, former Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, D-Ill., told NBC News this fall.",
      "Polls consistently showed Alsobrooks pulling ahead in the weeks before the election. Hogan could never quite replicate the support he received from Democrats as governor in his Senate campaign. In his two terms as governor and as a Senate candidate, Hogan tried to distance himself from former President Donald Trump, going so far as to reject an endorsement.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll win precisely because of the reluctance of Democrats who might be willing to vote for him at the state level to give him a try at the federal level,\u201d Lublin said before the election. \u201cFrankly, the sad thing in this case is that the Senate could use more moderates, and more moderate Republicans.\u201d",
      "The race stood out to Lublin because, in a national political environment marked by one unprecedented event after another, he felt it maintained a relative degree of normalcy \u2014 or at least what was deemed normal a decade ago. In Hogan, many Marylanders saw a Republican who represented an increasingly rare version of the party prior to Trump\u2019s takeover. And Alsobrooks has been \u201cembraced by the Democratic establishment\u201d as a liberal who \u201cdoesn\u2019t come off as unrealistic,\u201d according to Lublin.",
      "\u201cIn many ways it\u2019s like an old-fashioned race because neither party is running someone extreme,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be voting simply for the person we hate the least. These are both good politicians.\u201d",
      "But national narratives have still managed to make their way into the race, according to Candace Turitto, director of the University of Maryland\u2019s applied political analytics program.",
      "\u201cAlsobrooks\u2019 main attack on Hogan has still been to paint him as a member nonetheless of this more extreme Republican party who would ultimately be a vote promoting a far-right agenda,\u201d Turitto said in an email to NBC News before the election. \u201cHogan\u2019s public record does not lead to that conclusion in my opinion, but that message is likely a successful one when voters consider the totality of their ballot.\u201d",
      "Alsobrooks\u2019 election is also historic in showing the \u201cincreasing normalcy\u201d of electing Black politicians, Lublin said.",
      "In Maryland alone, Wes Moore, the state\u2019s first Black governor, and Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, both Democrats, gained national attention after the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March. Moore, in particular, is seen as a rising star in the national party.",
      "\u201cIn Maryland, there\u2019s a tacit feeling among many Democrats that, just like it was time to elect our first Black governor, it\u2019s past time to elect our first Black senator,\u201d Lublin said."

    "story": [
      "NBC News projects Democratic Rep. Andy Kim wins New Jersey\u2019s U.S. Senate race, defeating Republican Curtis Bashaw after a historic campaign to fill the seat of former Sen. Bob Menendez.",
      "The win makes Kim the state\u2019s first Asian American senator. In his first interview after his victory was projected, Kim said he was still taking it all in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m here with my mom and my dad. I\u2019m here with my wife, with my two sons \u2014 three generations in the same room,\u201d said Kim, 42. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to process, but I\u2019m really proud.\u201d",
      "Kim won in a race for a seat that was vacated by Bob Menendez, a longtime Democratic senator who resigned in August after he was convicted in July on charges of taking bribes in exchange for official government acts. Kim said he hopes constituents see him as \u201csomebody who\u2019s trying to usher in a new era of politics.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe live in a time of such great distrust in government, and I really do think that that poses a deep, deep concern and threat to our society,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big reason why I stepped up to run for Senate, jumped in the day after the indictment of the senator, because I felt like we needed to change course.\u201d",
      "Kim added that there\u2019s a \u201chunger for a new, younger generation of leadership to step up.\u201d",
      "Many New Jersey voters saw Kim\u2019s campaign as an opportunity for a fresh start after Menendez\u2019s almost two decades in office. It\u2019s also a reflection of the state\u2019s changing demographics, with Asian Americans making up the fastest-growing racial group.",
      "The number of Asian Americans in New Jersey nearly doubled from 2000 to 2022. In many areas, the electorate has proven to be a critical voting bloc. In the state\u2019s second-most-populous county, Middlesex, for example, eligible Asian American voters make up almost 38% of the electorate. In Bergen County, the most populous, they make up almost a quarter.",
      "Kim, the son of Korean immigrants, grew up in South Jersey. He is now set to be the first Korean American U.S. senator and has said his win would be a chance to listen to Asian American voters, who have often felt excluded from American politics. However, not everyone has been receptive to an Asian American like him representing the state.",
      "\u201cLast year, when I first started running for Senate, I had somebody literally tell me to my face that I\u2019m the \u2018wrong kind of minority to win statewide,\u2019\u201d Kim said. \u201cThat was really hurtful.\u201d",
      "Kim, who currently represents New Jersey\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, hopes to change those perceptions.",
      "\u201cI have every bit as much right to represent the state as anybody else,\u201d he said. \u201cI am as American as anybody else.\u201d",
      "Kim\u2019s campaign itself has already had a significant impact on the state\u2019s politics. In his first big win, Kim filed a lawsuit in February challenging New Jersey\u2019s unique ballot design known as the \u201ccounty line.\u201d In that design, candidates who are endorsed by a county party are grouped together in a column.",
      "Meanwhile, other candidates competing for the same offices appear off to the side. Kim, who pushed for grouping candidates by office, argued that the county-line ballots unfairly benefited those backed by party leaders. In May, a U.S. district judge sided with Kim, barring use of the old design.",
      "As he looks to start his first term as a senator, Kim said he hopes Asian Americans will take the leap into public service.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t self-select yourself out,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to run for office, if you want to serve, give it a try. I hope that people hear that.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WILMINGTON, Del. \u2014 Delaware state Sen. Sarah McBride won the state\u2019s only House seat Tuesday, NBC News projects, making her the first openly transgender person elected to Congress.",
      "McBride, a Democrat, defeated Republican John Whalen III, taking 57.8% of the vote with 95% of the vote in.",
      "\u201cTonight is a testament to Delawareans that here in our state of neighbors, we judge candidates based on their ideas and not their identities,\u201d McBride said at Delaware\u2019s Democratic election night celebration Tuesday night.",
      "She thanked her friends and family and her late husband, Andy Cray, who died of cancer in 2014, just days after their wedding.",
      "\u201cMy time with Andy reinforced for me a simple truth, that hope as an emotion, hope as a phenomenon, only makes sense in the face of hardship,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile at this moment in America\u2019s history, hope sometimes feels hard to come by, we must never forget that we are the beneficiaries of seemingly impossible change.\u201d",
      "McBride\u2019s key priorities for her congressional run were expanding access to affordable health care, protecting reproductive rights and increasing the minimum wage. She told NBC News in September that her goal in Congress was to work with colleagues to break through the partisan gridlock and actually pass legislation \u2014 which she became known for during her time in Delaware\u2019s Senate. During her first term, she helped pass universal paid family and medical leave across the state.",
      "Jake Carpenter, 42, works in finance for a college near Lincoln, Delaware, and said he met McBride at a meet and greet in August, when he asked her, \u201cWhat have you promised, and how have you done it?\u201d She walked him through the policies she worked on in the state Senate, and \u201cshe won me over,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI knew that she was trans, and being gay myself, I wanted to see someone like me, someone part of my community, be successful,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cShe\u2019s like a hero to me.\u201d",
      "He knocked on dozens of doors in Sussex County, the only majority Republican county in the state, to talk to people about McBride\u2019s platform. He said he persuaded six Republicans to vote for McBride.",
      "He added that he\u2019s an adviser to an LGBTQ club at the college he works for and that \u201cfor my trans students, this is a really big deal.\u201d",
      "Kelley Robinson, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation\u2019s largest LGBTQ advocacy organization, described McBride\u2019s win as \u201ca landmark achievement on the march toward equality.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis historic victory reflects not only increasing acceptance of transgender people in our society, ushered in by the courage of visible leaders like Sarah, but also her dogged work in demonstrating that she is an effective lawmaker who will deliver real results,\u201d Robinson said in a statement, adding that HRC is proud to see McBride, who previously was the organization\u2019s national press secretary, \u201creshaping the halls of Congress.\u201d",
      "McBride is no stranger to making history. She initially made headlines in April 2012 when she came out as trans in American University\u2019s student newspaper at the end of her term as the student body president.",
      "The same year, she became the first out trans woman to work in the White House when she interned with the Obama administration, according to her 2018 memoir, \u201cTomorrow Will Be Different: Love, Loss, and the Fight for Trans Equality.\u201d",
      "Then, in 2016, she became the first trans person to speak at a major political convention when she gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention.",
      "In 2020, she was elected to represent Delaware\u2019s 1st Senate District, which includes Claymont, Bellefonte and parts of Edgemoor and Wilmington, becoming the country\u2019s first openly trans state senator.",
      "McBride became interested in politics from a young age. By the time she was 18, she had volunteered or worked on at least three political campaigns, including Beau Biden\u2019s 2006 campaign for attorney general and his 2010 re-election campaign. Nearly a decade later, Joe Biden wrote the foreword to her memoir.",
      "McBride said that while she was voting Tuesday, she was reflecting on how powerful it was to vote for Kamala Harris for president; Lisa Blunt Rochester, who won her Senate race and will become the first woman and first Black person to represent Delaware in the Senate; and then herself.",
      "\u201cThat ticket is not an ultimate destination, but it is a reflection of how far we\u2019ve come, that no matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from or the gender with which you identify, that you can live your truth and dream big dreams all at the same time,\u201d McBride said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end, but it\u2019s the beginning.\u201d",
      "McBride\u2019s historic win comes during an election cycle where Republicans have leaned into anti-transgender rhetoric and political ads. The GOP spent more than $200 million on network television ads targeting trans people this year, according to data shared with NBC News on Tuesday by AdImpact, an analytics firm that tracks political ad spending. Former President Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have embraced anti-trans rhetoric on the campaign trail, and during the Republican National Convention in July, at least a dozen speakers mentioned gender or sexuality negatively in their speeches, according to an NBC News analysis."

      "Blunt Rochester, who is in her fourth term in the House, is a history-making politician, already the first woman and the first Black person to represent the state in Congress. Yet she stressed that her candidacy was not only about breaking barriers. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this to make history,\u201d she told NBC News. \u201cI\u2019m doing this to make a difference.\u201d",
      "Hansen, a former Walmart and Procter & Gamble executive, promoted his business experience as an advantage over being a career politician. His platform entailed fixing \u201cbroken\u201d schools, health care and prescription drug affordability, the environment, reducing gun violence and crime, and the economy. Katz is a physician and former state senator who was a Democrat but changed his party affiliation to independent. The candidates did not hold a debate.",

      "Currently, Laphonza Butler of California is the only Black woman serving in the Senate \u2014 and the third\u00a0in history, after Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed her last year to fill the seat of the late Dianne Feinstein; Butler opted not to seek election.",

      "Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey, said the race in Delaware was closely watched because of the scant numbers of Black women in the Senate. Aside from Butler, only Californian Kamala Harris, who served from 2017 to 2020, and Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, from 1993 to 1999, had made it to the Senate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking here about a history of not just under-representation \u2014 and keep in mind that Black women are nearly 8% of all Americans \u2014 but also long periods of no representation at all for Black women in the Senate,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cSo this certainly is a potentially historic moment, but we also should reflect on what is gained by having their voices in the conversation.\u201d",
      "Blunt Rochester ran for the seat being vacated by her mentor, Sen. Tom Carper, a Democrat who hired her as a congressional intern when she was a graduate student. At a town hall in the late 1980s, Carper said, he heard Blunt Rochester express a \"heartfelt interest in public service and in making a difference with her life.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Voter frustration with their economic lives was central in propelling Donald Trump to a second term. Now, it will be up to Trump to try to change that trajectory and deliver on his sweeping promises of economic revival.",
      "Trump will inherit an economy already on relatively solid footing. Inflation has slowed and wages have begun to catch up with higher prices.\u00a0While companies aren\u2019t hiring at the same breakneck pace as they were coming out of the pandemic, the job market remains strong by historic standards, with low unemployment and around one job opening for every person looking for work.",
      "But despite the signs of strength in the economy, the cost of living and overall dissatisfaction with the economy was repeatedly cited as a top concern by voters heading into the election. Housing costs have been a major pressure point on household budgets after rents increased an average of 24% over the past four years, and, with mortgage rates over 6%, buying a home has been out of reach for many households. Food has been another rising expense, with the average cost of groceries up 22% over the past four years and food banks seeing record numbers of people seeking help.",
      "Trump has floated a wide range of proposals that he says would improve America\u2019s financial picture, many of which will require action from Congress, where Republicans will control the Senate and hope to control the House. Among Trump\u2019s economic plans are deporting millions of immigrants, putting sweeping tariffs on all goods coming into the U.S., encouraging more oil production, lowering corporate taxes and eliminating taxes on social security income and tips.",
      "Here are the ways some of those proposals could play out on the economy:",
      "Tariffs",
      "While inflation has been a top issue for voters, one of Trump\u2019s central campaign promises \u2014 placing tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S. \u2014 would likely raise prices and cost workers their jobs, according to economists, business groups and even some Trump allies. Trump has rejected those assertions.",
      "\u201cTo me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is 'tariff,'\u201d Trump said during remarks at the Chicago Economic Club. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite word. It needs a public relations firm.\u201d",
      "Under Trump\u2019s proposal, the U.S would impose a tariff of at least 10% on all goods coming into the U.S. from overseas and a 60% tariff on products being imported from China. Tariffs are paid to the federal government by the company importing those goods, like a retailer or manufacturer. Those companies can either pass the costs along to consumers by raising prices or absorb the costs and take a smaller profit.",
      "If past tariffs are any indication, consumers will likely see higher prices. Not only do companies often pass along the increase, but competitors who are not subject to the tariff often also raise prices. Companies including AutoZone and Black & Decker have already warned investors that they will be raising prices if Trump carries through on his tariff proposal. Tariffs enacted by Trump in 2018 and 2019 led to higher prices for a range of goods, including washing machines, handbags and tires, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "In the shoe industry, consumers and retailers were hit with a 7.5% tariff that Trump put in place in 2019 on hundreds of millions of shoes imported from China. While some retailers absorbed the cost of those tariffs and took a hit to their bottom line, others passed the fee along to consumers by increasing the prices of their shoes, said Matt Priest, head of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America",
      "\u201cWe can attest to the fact that if you charge us more to bring a product in, it\u2019s going to cost more for the consumer to buy that product,\u201d said Priest.\u00a0\u201c It\u2019s kind of Econ 101.\u201d",
      "Trump has argued that putting tariffs on goods from China would encourage companies to move their plants to the U.S., creating jobs and boosting sales for U.S. producers.",
      "But multiple studies, including those of Trump\u2019s past tariffs and previous rounds of tariffs under different administrations, found that increasing tariffs didn\u2019t lead to a significant number of companies relocating to the U.S. nor did it create jobs for domestic producers. Rather, Trump\u2019s 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum led to a reduction in manufacturing employment because of higher costs for companies using steel and aluminum in their products, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Board.",
      "For shoemakers, Trump\u2019s 2019 tariffs didn\u2019t translate into any companies moving production to the U.S. because of the high labor costs and lack of supply chain and materials stateside, said Priest. He said he doesn\u2019t see another round of tariffs from Trump changing that calculus.",
      "\u201cIts higher labor costs, a lack of labor interest in making shoes, a lack of material and material suppliers here in the States,\u201d said Priest of moving shoe production to the U.S. \u201cYou can make the duties 200% on the imports, and it still won\u2019t happen. It\u2019s just not price competitive.\u201d",
      "Inflation",
      "Trump has promised to \u201cdefeat\u201d inflation, though the rate at which prices are increasing has already returned to its historical norm of  2% to 3% over the past several months after peaking in 2022.\u00a0 But prices for many essentials still remain well above their pre-pandemic levels.",
      "To lower housing costs, Trump has said he would allow homes to be built on federally protected land, something that could help increase the supply of homes in places like Nevada and Arizona. He\u2019s also said he would cut regulations for builders, although many regulations for housing are set at the state and local levels. He\u2019s said he would promote homeownership through tax incentives, but his campaign hasn\u2019t been specific on what those incentives would be.",
      "Trump has said he would lower costs overall by reducing energy prices by 50% during his first year in office, something industry experts have said is unlikely. To do this, Trump has said he would allow oil companies to drill in more places, like on federal land in Alaska, and remove barriers to speed production.",
      "Oil producers are already pumping record levels of oil in the U.S. and are constrained in just how much they can drill by limits on labor and infrastructure. Companies are also disincentivized from flooding the market with too much oil because it would drive down the price, causing them to potentially lose money on each barrel they pump. Oil prices are also set by a global market where other countries, like Saudi Arabia or Russia, could cut back on production to drive up prices and maintain profitability.",
      "Immigration",
      "Trump has said he will carry out \u201cthe largest deportation in the history of our country\u201d of undocumented immigrants, claiming it would help the economy by freeing up housing and opening up jobs for U.S. citizens.",
      "Business groups have warned, though, that deporting millions of immigrants could create a labor shortage that would ultimately drive up prices, especially in areas like food production and housing where immigrants make up a significant share of the workforce.",
      "In the construction industry, which is already facing a shortage of hundreds of thousands of workers, there are an estimated 1.5 million undocumented workers making up about 13% of the total workforce, according to data the Pew Research Center provided to NBC News.",
      "The National Association of Home Builders CEO Jim Tobin told NBC News last month that a massive deportation of immigrants would be \u201cdetrimental to the construction industry and our labor supply and exacerbate our housing affordability problems.\u201d",
      "The NABH and other industry groups have said a key reason for higher housing costs over the past several years has been a mismatch between supply and demand after housing construction tumbled following the Great Recession. As home builders have been ramping up the construction of single-family homes and apartment buildings in recent years, they have faced higher costs of labor and materials, further adding to the price of homes.",
      "Across the economy, an analysis by researchers at the University of New Hampshire found that a mass deportation of immigrants could reduce the U.S. economy, as measured by gross domestic product, by as much as 6.2%, or about $1.7 trillion in lost productivity.",
      "Taxes",
      "Trump has proposed a number of tax cuts, including a complete elimination of the federal income tax. But those plans have varying likelihoods of getting enacted, given that Congress would have to pass legislation to change the tax system. While some of the plans are thin on details and there are many variables for how his proposals would be enacted, economists at the University of Pennsylvania estimate Trump\u2019s tax and spending plans would increase the deficit by $4.1 trillion when accounting for the effects they would have on the wider economy.",
      "One of the most likely tax proposals to become a reality would be an extension of the tax cuts enacted during Trump\u2019s first administration, which are set to expire in 2025. Those cuts lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, reduced individual income tax rates, and increased the standard deduction.",
      "Trump has suggested he would lower the corporate tax rate even more, to 15%.",
      "One of Trump\u2019s more consistent campaign pledges has been eliminating taxes on tips, which could affect about 2.5% of workers who receive tips as part of their income. But it could cause major disruptions in how workers are paid if more industries shifted to a tipping system where workers are paid a minimum wage and expected to get the bulk of their income tax-free from tips. Even white-collar industries could adopt a system where a portion of employees' income is classified as tips.",
      "That could create havoc for workers and consumers and reduce the amount of income taxes the federal government brings in.",
      "Trump has also said that the income seniors receive from Social Security should be tax-free. About 40% of Social Security recipients pay federal income taxes, typically because they have other sources of income that raise them above a certain threshold where they are required to pay income tax, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "Eliminating a tax on social security would mean a loss of tax revenue for the federal government, which would then either add to the deficit or need to be offset by cuts."

      "Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n, who ascended to office vowing sweeping reforms to the criminal justice system and then faced intense criticism over public safety issues, lost his bid for re-election, The Associated Press projected.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n was defeated by Nathan Hochman, a former federal prosecutor who seized on voter concerns about crime and homelessness in the nation\u2019s most populous county and largest law enforcement jurisdiction.",
      "In recent weeks, Gasc\u00f3n made national headlines when he announced he supported clemency for Erik and Lyle Menendez, the brothers who were found guilty in the 1989 killing of their parents. The legal saga drew renewed public attention this fall after the debut of a Netflix miniseries and documentary about their lives.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n was swept into office in 2020 amid national fury over the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He harnessed the progressive energy surrounding that summer\u2019s protests over police misconduct and racial inequality, riding a political wave that in previous cycles helped elect crusading prosecutors in cities like Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia.",
      "In office, Gasc\u00f3n quickly got to work implementing his reformist agenda.",
      "He barred prosecutors in his office from seeking the death penalty and various sentencing enhancements, stopped the prosecution of juveniles as adults and ended cash bail for misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies.",
      "But many of those initiatives drew fierce backlash, including from some of the county\u2019s rank-and-file prosecutors.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n staved off two recall efforts, both of which failed to secure spots on the ballot. Meanwhile, the resistance to aggressive criminal justice reforms continued building across California. San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin was recalled from office in 2022 after his critics assailed him as a soft-on-crime progressive.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n and other Los Angeles political leaders have attempted to rebut charges that the city is unsafe, a perception deepened partly by videos of \u201csmash-and-grab\u201d retail robberies.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n faced 11 challengers in the county\u2019s March 5 nonpartisan primary, advancing to a runoff against Hochman, an independent who ran for California attorney general as a Republican in 2022.",
      "Hochman pledged to crack down on \u201clawlessness\u201d and framed his candidacy as a sharp break from the Gasc\u00f3n era.",
      "\u201cDA George Gasc\u00f3n has miserably failed to protect our residents, leading to a spiral of lawlessness that endangers all L.A. County residents,\u201d Hochman said in a statement announcing his candidacy. \u201cIt\u2019s time to stop playing politics with people\u2019s lives. It\u2019s time we had a DA who fights for victims\u2014not criminals.\u201d",
      "Gasc\u00f3n attempted to shift perceptions of his tenure and emphasized that he understood the spiking anxiety about public safety. But pre-election public polls showed him trailing Hochman. In a survey conducted Sept. 25 to Oct. 1, for example, Hochman was 30 percentage points ahead of Gasc\u00f3n.",
      "Hochman, 60, was an assistant U.S. attorney for the Central District of California in the 1990s. He then was the assistant attorney general for the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s tax division under former President George W. Bush.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n, 70, previously was San Francisco attorney general \u2014 a job once held by Vice President Kamala Harris before she won the state attorney general\u2019s office. He was also an assistant police chief in Los Angeles, as well as the police chief in Mesa, Arizona, and San Francisco."

    "story": [
      "BOSTON \u2014 The latest chapter in the Karen Read saga moves to the state\u2019s highest court, where her attorneys Wednesday are hoping to convince judges that several charges related to the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend should be dropped.",
      "Read is accused of ramming into John O\u2019Keefe with her SUV and leaving him to die in a snowstorm in January 2022. Read\u2019s attorneys argue she is being framed and that other law enforcement officers are responsible for O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. A judge declared a mistrial in June after finding jurors couldn\u2019t reach an agreement. A retrial on the same charges is set to begin in January, though both sides asked Monday for it to be delayed until April. 1.",
      "The defense is expected to reiterate arguments made in briefs to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that trying Read again on charges of\u00a0second-degree murder\u00a0and leaving the scene would be unconstitutional double jeopardy.",
      "Defense attorneys said five jurors came forward after her mistrial to say that they were deadlocked only on a manslaughter count and had agreed that she wasn\u2019t guilty on the other counts. But they hadn\u2019t told the judge.",
      "The defense also argues that affidavits from the jurors \u201creflect a clear and unambiguous decision that Ms. Read is not guilty\u201d and support their request for a evidentiary hearing on whether the jurors found her not guilty on the two charges.",
      "Read\u2019s defense attorneys cited a ruling in the case of Boston Marathon bomber\u00a0Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, in which a federal appeals court earlier this year ordered the judge who oversaw his trial to investigate the defense\u2019s claims of juror bias and determine whether his death sentence should stand.",
      "\u201cUnder the Commonwealth\u2019s logic, no defendant claiming that the jury acquitted her but failed to announce that verdict would be entitled to further inquiry, no matter how clear and well-supported her claim,\u201d according to the defense brief.",
      "The defense also arguing that the judge abruptly announced the mistrial in court without first asking each juror to confirm their conclusions about each count.",
      "\u201cThere is no indication that the court gave any consideration to alternatives, most notably inquiry regarding partial verdicts,\u201d according to the defense brief. \u201cAnd counsel was not given a full opportunity to be heard. The court never asked for counsel\u2019s views, or even mentioned the word mistrial.\u201d",
      "In August,\u00a0a judge\u00a0ruled Read can be retried on those charges. \u201cWhere there was no verdict announced in open court here, retrial of the defendant does not violate the principle of double jeopardy,\u201d the judge, Beverly Cannone, said in her ruling.",
      "In its brief to the court,\u00a0prosecutors wrote\u00a0that there\u2019s no basis for dismissing the charges of second-degree murder and leaving the scene of the accident.",
      "They noted in the brief that the jury said three times that it was deadlocked before a mistrial was declared. Prosecutors said the \u201cdefendant was afforded a meaningful opportunity to be heard on any purported alternative.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe defendant was not acquitted of any charge because the jury did not return, announce, and affirm any open and public verdicts of acquittal,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThat requirement is not a mere formalism, ministerial act, or empty technicality. It is a fundamental safeguard that ensures no juror\u2019s position is mistaken, misrepresented, or coerced by other jurors.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said Read, a former adjunct professor at Bentley College, and O\u2019Keefe, a 16-year member of the Boston police, had been drinking heavily before she dropped him off at a party at the home of Brian Albert, a fellow Boston officer. They said she hit him with her SUV before driving away. An autopsy found O\u2019Keefe had died of hypothermia and blunt force trauma.",
      "The defense portrayed Read as the victim, saying O\u2019Keefe was actually killed inside Albert\u2019s home and then dragged outside. They argued that investigators focused on Read because she was a \u201cconvenient outsider\u201d who saved them from having to consider law enforcement officers as suspects."

    "story": [
      "BOSTON \u2014 A jury on Tuesday found an Alabama man not guilty of killing an 11-year New Hampshire girl more than 35 years ago.",
      "A factor in the case was whether the jury believed DNA found under Melissa Ann Tremblay\u2019s fingernails was from Marvin \u201cSkip\u201d McClendon Jr. After telling a judge Monday they were deadlocked, the jury returned Tuesday and found McClendon not guilty on the sixth day of deliberations.",
      "\u201cMr. McClendon was greatly relieved by the verdict,\u201d McClendon\u2019s lawyer, Henry Fasoldt, told The Associated Press, adding that he would return home to Alabama after being held for two-and-a-half years. \u201cWe appreciate the jury\u2019s careful and thoughtful deliberations.\u201d",
      "Essex County District Attorney Paul F. Tucker said he \u201cdisappointed with the verdict\u201d but praised the efforts of prosecutors and law enforcement officers in the case.",
      "\u201cI recognize the work and dedication of the jury during their long deliberations in this case,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cMy thoughts are with the family of Melissa Ann Tremblay, who have suffered greatly due to the crime that took her life.\u201d",
      "Last year, a judge declared a mistrial in McClendon\u2019s prosecution after a jury deadlock. The body of the Salem, New Hampshire, girl was found in a Lawrence, Massachusetts, trainyard on Sept. 12, 1988, a day after she was reported missing.",
      "The victim had accompanied her mother and her mother\u2019s boyfriend to a Lawrence social club not far from the railyard and went outside to play while the adults stayed inside, authorities said last year. She was reported missing later that night.",
      "The girl\u2019s mother, Janet Tremblay, died in 2015 at age 70, according to her obituary. But surviving relatives have been attending court to observe the latest trial.",
      "The family, in statement, said they respected the process but believe McClendon was still guilty of murder based on the DNA results.",
      "\u201cThe DNA was Missy\u2019s way of trying to tell us who killed her,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cAs she was being attacked she fought for her life and got his DNA under her fingernails so that we would be able to get a match and make the person killing her pay for his crime. While he was found not guilty in a court of law, he will ultimately pay for his crime on the final Judgement day before God.\u201d",
      "After initially ruling out several suspects, including two drug addicts, early on, authorities turned their attention to McClendon.",
      "He was arrested at his Alabama home in 2022 based in part on DNA evidence.",
      "Essex County Assistant District Attorney Jessica Strasnick told the jury that comments McClendon made during his arrest showed he knew details of the crime and that he was \u201cfixated on the fact that she was beaten, ladies and gentlemen, because he knew that she wasn\u2019t just stabbed that day, that was she was beaten.\u201d",
      "A left-handed person like McClendon stabbed Tremblay, Strasnick said. She told jurors that the carpenter and former Massachusetts corrections officer was familiar with Lawrence, having frequented bars and strip clubs in the city. He also lived less than 20 miles away at the time of the killing.",
      "Strasnick told the jury that the DNA evidence taken from under Tremblay\u2019s fingernails excludes 99.8% of the male population.",
      "But Fasoldt said there was no proof the DNA came from under Tremblay\u2019s fingernails or was from McClendon.",
      "Fasoldt also said evidence shows that a right-handed person, rather than a left-handed person, could have stabbed Tremblay.",
      "He also argued that McClendon had \u201cno meaningful connection\u201d to Lawrence \u2014 other than that he lived 16 miles away in Chelmsford. He moved to Alabama in 2002 to a plot of land his family owned."

      "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz has come out as a \"gay woman.\"",
      "Moretz shared the news about her sexuality in a passionate Instagram post on Nov. 2 urging people to vote in the 2024 presidential election with women\u2019s reproductive rights and LGBTQ issues in mind.",
      "\"There is so much on the line this election. I believe the government has no right over my body as a woman, and that the decisions over my body should come ONLY from myself and my doctor,\" wrote Moretz.",
      "\"I believe in the need for legal protections that protects the LGBTQ+ community as a gay woman. We need protections in this country and to have access to the care we need and deserve,\" she added.",
      "She concluded her post by urging fans to come up with a \"plan\" to make sure they make it to a polling place on Nov. 5.",
      "TODAY.com reached out to Moretz for comment, but did not hear back at the time of publication.",
      "Moretz, who previously dated\u00a0Brooklyn Beckham, has been romantically linked to model Kate Harrison for more than five years. The two women often share photos of themselves together on Instagram, including in June 2023, when Harrison posted a selfie photo of them posing together at a March for gay women in New York City.",
      "Moretz\u00a0portrayed a gay teenager sent against her will to a conversion therapy camp in the 2018\u00a0coming-of-age\u00a0drama \"The Miseducation of Cameron Post.\"",
      "While promoting the movie, which is set in 1993, Moretz told Deadline that she had been an \"activist\" for the LGBT community since she was \"a little girl\" and had two brothers who were gay.",
      "Also during the film's promotion, Moretz became irritated when a reporter for\u00a0The Independent told her she was name-checked in an article about straight actors portraying gay characters.",
      "\u201cOh really?\u201d asked Moretz before laughing nervously. \u201cWell I think what\u2019s important is don\u2019t assume anyone\u2019s sexuality. I mean, across the board ... don\u2019t assume.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it comes down to the line that\u2019s in the movie,\u201d she continued. \u201c(Moretz's character) says, \u2018I don\u2019t see myself as a homosexual, I don\u2019t see myself as anything.\u2019 These are all societal pressures that we\u2019re being labelled as.",
      "\"We\u2019re all human, trying to be with the people that we fall in love with, and be the best person that we can be. But don\u2019t assume people\u2019s sexualities. And don\u2019t project your own issues onto them. Why don\u2019t we let people be who they wanna be?\u201d"

      "During every \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert, there comes a time that audiences are always waiting for: surprise-song o\u2019clock.",
      "This is when Taylor Swift sits down with just a guitar and a piano to play acoustic versions of two songs \u2014 sometimes mashups, sometimes not \u2014 that change between each show. And fans don\u2019t know what songs she\u2019s chosen that night until the surprise-song set starts.",
      "Swift kicked off the European leg of her \u201cEras Tour\u201d May 9 in Paris, fresh on the heels of releasing her 11th album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d on April 29. While the setlist saw some significant changes \u2014 including the addition of a new era \u2014 Swift upheld her tradition of performing surprise songs.",
      "She returned to the U.S. Oct. 18 for a run of shows in three more cities before she's set to close out the \"Eras Tour\" in Canada in December.",
      "Last year, Swift said she\u2019d aim not to repeat surprise songs during the \u201cEras Tour,\u201d leaving fans to track each night\u2019s performances like detectives, watching their favorite songs get picked off in the lead up to their own concert date.",
      "But after Swift announced that she \u201creset\u201d the eligibility of all songs for 2024 and introduced twists, it\u2019s impossible to predict what she\u2019ll do next.",
      "Intrepid Swifties keeping record of all the songs Swift has performed have noted that, while there are several songs that have been played multiple times, there are some tracks from across her 11 albums that the singer has not sung at all during the \"Eras Tour.\" Those include:",

      "Taylor Swift has kept up the memorable tradition of giving one lucky fan part of her costume during each \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert. On Nov. 2 \u2014 the second to last U.S. show of the tour \u2014 the encounter was a moment seven years in the making.",
      "During the part of the show dedicated to her fourth album \u201cRed,\u201d Swift walks down the catwalk while singing \u201c22\u201d and meets one attendee standing at the edge of the stage. Swift crouches down each night and takes off her black fedora to give to the fan.",
      "Recipients of the famed \u201c22\u201d hat include Bianka Bryant, daughter of Vanessa and the late Kobe Bryant; Mikael Arellano, a TikTok creator who went viral for his \u201cBejeweled\u201d choreography; and Gracie Elliott Teefey, Selena Gomez\u2019s little sister.",
      "Now, there's 7-year-old Eloise.",
      "Eloise received the hat during Swift\u2019s second Indianapolis show Saturday at Lucas Oil Stadium. The 7-year-old, wearing a pink, green, purple and blue sparkly jacket, shared a big hug with Swift. The singer then appeared to say to Eloise, \u201cLast time I saw you, you were a baby,\u201d while miming rocking an infant.",
      "The story goes like this: Seven years ago, Eloise's mom, Cindy Childs, started a livestream on Instagram that Swift watched and commented on. Childs, a longtime Swiftie, got to chat with the singer and show her baby Eloise, then just a few months old.",
      "According to screenshots posted by fans, Swift left a ton of comments on the livestream, including an all-caps \u201cELOISE\u201d and \u201cshe\u2019s a tiny baby and I will totally meet her and A when they\u2019re not 3 months old and jus tryna GET SOME REST.\u201d",

      "But it wasn't just Swift, Eloise and her mom who got a kick out of the sweet moment. Longtime Swifties were also emotional about the moment.",
      "\"I'M GONNA CRY!\" a fan wrote on X.",
      "\"In the clerb, we all cried over Eloise,\" another wrote.",
      "And one fan used a clip from \"Succession,\" in which Tom shouts, \"Excuse me, executives coming through,\" to show that only true Swift fans understand the meaning of the moment.",

      "Lime green is still very much having a moment, and you can thank Charli XCX\u2019s hit album, \u201cBrat,\u201d for that.",
      "Since the 32-year-old singer released \u201cBrat\u201d on June 7, the album \u2014 and its electric aesthetic \u2014 has dominated pop culture at all levels, from underground clubs to mini crossword clues.",
      "Recently, Collins Dictionary announced\u00a0\u201cbrat\u201d as its 2024 word of the year, defining it as \u201ccharacterized by a confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude.\u201d",
      "The high-energy dance pop album touches on partying, Von Dutch and womanhood, to name a few themes, and has inspired TikTok dances, marketing campaigns, and fashion trends, leading very online fans to coin the term \u201cbrat summer.\u201d",
      "Having evolved from the now-iconic album cover to a whole aesthetic, \u201cBrat\u201d is now a lifestyle embraced by Gen Z and millennials alike.",

      "The singer's highly anticipated remix album, \u201cBrat and it\u2019s completely different but also still brat,\u201d debuted on Oct. 11, featuring new collaborations with artists like Ariana Grande, Caroline Polachek, and Bon Iver.",
      "Charli XCX is also taking the brat aesthetic on the road as she performs her co-headline arena show with Australian singer Troye Sivan on the North American \"Sweat\" tour, which began in Detroit on Sept. 14 and ends in Seattle on Oct. 23.",
      "Now that brat summer has officially extended into brat autumn, here's everything you need to know about the trend, from viral dances to unexpected collabs.",
      "What is 'Brat Summer'?",
      "The brat summer trend is inspired by British singer Charli XCX's hit album \u201cBrat,\u201d which was released on June 7 and debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard charts.",
      "Fans were particularly taken by the album's distinctive yet minimalistic cover art: \u201cbrat\u201d written in low-res font on a lime green background.",
      "Soon after the album's release, Gen Z christened it the season of the brat, an aesthetic trend defined by party animal antics, cool-girl style, and lime green everything.",
      "With its messy, carefree vibe, brat summer borrows elements from other similar TikTok trends like feral girl summer and rat girl summer.",
      "The trend quickly took over TikTok, with tens of thousands of posts under the hashtag #bratsummer.",
      "While the word \u201cbrat\u201d usually evokes feelings of middle school angst, brat summer is all about accepting your imperfections while embracing the chaos.",
      "In an Instagram post on June 8, Charli XCX described the \u201cbrat\u201d album ethos as \u201cme, my flaws, my f--- ups, my ego all rolled into one.\u201d",
      "She further explained the meaning of \u201cbrat\u201d in a TikTok video.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re just like that girl who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things sometimes. Who feels herself but maybe also has a breakdown. But kind of like, parties through it, is very honest, very blunt. A little bit volatile. Like, does dumb things. But it\u2019s brat. You\u2019re brat. That\u2019s brat,\u201d she said in the video.",
      "'Brat Summer' Trends",

      "For some New Yorkers, brat green is inescapable: Charli XCX kicked off the \"Brat\" album release with a live performance in front of a giant green wall in Williamsburg.",
      "The brat wall was repainted to promote remixes and deluxe editions of the album (\u201cbrat and it\u2019s the same but there\u2019s three more songs so it\u2019s not\u201d) before posting its final message, \u201cok, bye!\u201d on July 2.",
      "Beyond the official album merch \u2014 including, naturally, a lime-green crop top emblazoned with \u201cbrat\u201d in giant, low-res letters \u2014 the brat ethos also infiltrated summer fashion.",
      "\u201cBrat\u201d style is a far cry from the \u201cclean girl\u201d trend that dominated viral fashion in 2022. It celebrates sweaty, party-girl chaos: smudged eyeliner, grungy street style, and plenty of Y2K inspiration.",
      "Charli XCX described the brat aesthetic in an interview with \u201cThe News Movement\" on June 10.",
      "\u201cIt can be like, so trashy,\u201d she said. \u201cJust like a pack of cigs and and a Bic lighter. And like, a strappy white top with no bra. That's like, kind of all you need.\u201d",

      "On Aug. 1, Charli XCX released a remix of \u201cGuess\u201d featuring another high-profile singer: Billie Eilish.\u00a0Eilish's verse and the accompanying music video teased the singer's romantic interest in Charli XCX.",

      "At a listening party on Oct. 10, the singer told fans that the goal of the remix album was to demonstrate \u201cthe infinite possibilities of dance music and music in general.\"",
      "\u201ci\u2019ve always had a bit of an issue with songs coming out and being cemented as one thing for eternity,\u201d she wrote in an Instagram post on Oct. 11. \u201ci think songs are endless and have the possibility to be continuously broken down, reworked, changed, morphed, mutilated into something completely unrecognizable.\u201d",
      "What does \u201cKamala is brat\u201d mean?",
      "Beyond outfit checks and viral dances, the brat summer trend transcended TikTok fame to become associated with an unlikely figure: Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "Shortly after President Biden announced he was withdrawing from the 2024 presidential election, Charli XCX expressed her support for Vice President Kamala Harris by complimenting her in an X post:",
      "The post made the rounds on social media and spurred a multitude of posts that paired videos of Vice President Harris with songs from \u201cbrat.\u201d",
      "Many of those videos also incorporate the \u201ccoconut tree\u201d meme inspired by a quote from one of Harris\u2019 past speeches.",
      "Harris' campaign team has also embraced the brat memes.",
      "The Kamala HQ campaign account on X changed their banner to mimic the \u201cbrat\u201d album cover art, with \u201ckamala hq\u201d written in low-res text on a lime green background.",
      "On Instagram, the Kamala HQ account made a post inspired by the brat aesthetic, including a screenshot of Charli XCX's original X post in the slideshow.",

      "The rapidly growing \u201cbrat\u201d discourse even moved from social media to mainstream political discussion.",
      "Rachel Maddow addressed the brat memes in a July 22 interview with Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar on MSNBC.",
      "\u201cLast night, Charli XCX tweeted \u2018Kamala is brat,\u2019\u201d Maddow said. \u201cTo be totally honest with you, I'm not totally sure what that means.\u201d",
      "'Brat Summer' extends into fall",
      "Despite brat summer's popularity, several news sites published articles speculating that the trend was waning.",

      "The dead included eight women and six children, according to a list provided by the Gaza Health Ministry\u2019s emergency service.\u00a0Separate strikes elsewhere in Gaza\u00a0early Tuesday killed another 10 people, according to health officials.",

Netanyahu was engulfed in scandal Monday over a case involving one of his aides that has sent shock waves across the country.",
      "The firestorm \u2014 brought into public view when an Israeli court loosened a gag order Sunday night \u2014 has enraged Netanyahu's political opponents and hostages\u2019 families. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and distanced himself from the case, but critics have alleged that he put hostages' lives and national security at risk to buttress his hard-line position in stalled cease-fire talks by leaking Gaza documents to friendly media outlets.",
      "In a ruling Sunday, the Rishon Le-Zion Magistrates\u2019 Court\u00a0said an investigation had been launched after suspicions arose within the Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Security Agency, or the Shin Bet, that \"classified and sensitive intelligence\" had been illegally taken from IDF systems.",
      "The action, the court said, may not only have caused \u201cserious harm to state security and the endangerment of intelligence sources,\" but it also could have harmed \"the goal of releasing the hostages\" who were taken captive during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.",
      "The court identified the central suspect in the case as Eliezer Feldstein, reported by Israeli media to have been one of Netanyahu\u2019s media advisers.",
      "In addition to Feldstein, three other people the court described as \"detainees involved in the activities\" were questioned. The court has yet to publicly identify them.",
      "Israeli media have reported that the information suspected of being leaked formed the basis of multiple articles on Hamas' approach to the hostage situation, including an article published by the London-based Jewish Chronicle that was later withdrawn after widespread criticism. NBC News was not immediately able to independently confirm that reporting.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle article had suggested that Hamas planned to move hostages out of Gaza through Egypt, while a separate article published by the German newspaper Bild reported that Hamas was drawing out negotiations for a cease-fire deal as a form of psychological warfare on Israel.",
      "Both articles drew skepticism from Israeli observers given their timing and the apparent cover they gave Netanyahu as he was accused of deliberately sabotaging cease-fire negotiations.",
      "\u201cThere was something very fishy about them. Also about the timing of everything,\u201d Mairav Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle and Bild did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The reports emerged as Netanyahu insisted on Israeli control over the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt, a demand that became a major sticking point in cease-fire talks. They also came as Netanyahu faced mounting outrage from hostages\u2019 families and much of the country's public over his failure to agree to a cease-fire deal after six hostages were killed in Hamas' captivity.",
      "While Israeli media had reported some details of the probe and the gag order had been partially lifted last week, it was not until Sunday that crucial and explosive allegations were revealed.",
      "In a statement before the ruling, Netanyahu's office said the materials suspected of being leaked had never reached the prime minister's office from the Military Intelligence Directorate and that Netanyahu had learned about the document in question from the media.",
      "It added that the aide implicated in the suspected leaks had \"never participated in security discussions, was not exposed or received classified information, and did not take part in secret visits.\"",
      "But political opponents, hostages\u2019 families and critics expressed outrage over the potential involvement of one of Netanyahu's aides.",
      "\"It\u2019s left me yet again disappointed but not surprised by this government,\" said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui was taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7.",
      "\"I feel utterly betrayed, not just as a hostage father but as an Israeli citizen,\" he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "Dekel-Chen said that if the allegations raised in the investigation are true, it would be the latest in a \"long series\" of moments when Netanyahu's government has \"invented reasons to not move forward in the negotiation process.\"",
      "Gil Dickmann's cousin Carmel Gat was one of six hostages killed in Hamas captivity \u2014 an incident that sparked national outrage not long before the media reports were published.",
      "He noted the timing but said that if the intention was to sway public opinion, \"it didn't work,\" as he pointed to major demonstrations in the following days pressuring Netanyahu to secure a cease-fire.",
      "In a statement, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of those still in Hamas captivity, expressed \u201coutrage and deep concern\u201d at the possibility that at least one Netanyahu aide may have \u201cworked to undermine public support\u201d for a deal.",
      "Benny Gantz, who resigned from Netanyahu's now-dissolved war Cabinet in June, said on X that \"if sensitive security information was stolen and used as a tool in a political survival campaign, it\u2019s not just a criminal offense; it\u2019s a national crime.\"",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid rejected claims from Netanyahu's office that Netanyahu had been previously unaware of the materials alleged to have been leaked.",
      "\"If Netanyahu didn\u2019t know that his close aides were stealing documents, planting spies within the IDF, forging documents, exposing intelligence sources, and passing classified documents to the foreign press to stop the hostage deal\u2014what *does* he know?\" Lapid said on X.",
      "Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said that even if Netanyahu was not directly involved, the suspected leak would have emerged from a \u201cwell-oiled machine that is already accustomed to taking sensitive information and manipulating it for political purposes.\u201d",
      "But she said that would not \"come as a surprise at all.\"",
      "\"I think for the people who are already convinced that Netanyahu was playing with the public's consciousness and wasn't interested in a hostage deal, this is kind of just further proof,\" she said."

      "Israel has long been critical of UNRWA, set up in the wake of the 1948 war that broke out at the time of the creation of the state of Israel, accusing it of anti-Israel bias and saying it perpetuates the conflict by maintaining Palestinians in a permanent refugee status.",

The ban does not refer to operations in the Palestinian territories or elsewhere.",

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday fired his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, a long-rumored move that was announced on Election Day in the U.S. Netanyahu and Gallant had repeatedly clashed over the conduct of the war in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "Protests erupted in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem in response to the decision, with critics accusing Netanyahu of prioritizing his own political survival over Israel's best interests, while families of those held hostage in Gaza expressed deep concern over the impact Gallant's firing could have on efforts to secure the release of their loved ones.",
      "Gallant will be replaced by Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who thanked Netanyahu in a social media post for trusting him with the role. Gideon Saar, a former Netanyahu opponent, will become foreign minister and cement support for the fragile ruling coalition keeping the embattled Israeli leader in power.",
      "\u201cIn the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and the minister of defense,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cUnfortunately, although in the first months of the campaign there was very fruitful work, during the last months this trust cracked between me and the minister of defense.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu added that there were significant \u201cgaps\u201d between what the Cabinet had decided and what he termed \u201cthe campaign.\u201d",
      "He added that most members of the government and the Cabinet shared a \u201ccrisis of trust\u201d with Gallant.",
      "Gallant, in response Tuesday, said, \u201cThe security of the State of Israel always was, and will always remain, my life\u2019s mission.\u201d",
      "In a later address, he said Netanyahu had informed him of the decision earlier that evening.",
      "He said he was fired over discord on three key issues, including his support for Israel making \"painful compromises\" in order to ensure the release of hostages who remain held in Gaza, as well as his calls for a commission of inquiry to investigate Israel's failures on Oct. 7, 2023, and his support for legislation that would remove exemptions allowing ultra-Orthodox Jewish men to avoid military conscription.",
      "Signs of strains in the Gallant-Netanyahu relationship appeared over the last months. Gallant was scheduled to meet with his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in Washington in early October \u2014 a trip Gallant initiated \u2014 but it was postponed at Netanyahu\u2019s request.",
      "Gallant, who has spent decades in the military,\u00a0has been critical of Netanyahu\u2019s approach to the conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah.",
      "His firing drew immediate criticism from opposition leader Benny Gantz, who said it was \u201cpolitics at the expense of national security.\u201d",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid condemned the decision as an \"act of madness\" and accused Netanyahu of \"selling Israel's security and the IDF fighters for a disgraceful political survival.\"",
      "In a statement, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum expressed its \"deep concern\" about the decision and about how it would affect \"the fate of 101 hostages held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for nearly 400 days.\"",
      "Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on X: \"The last thing the State of Israel needs right now is an upheaval and a rupture in the middle of the war.\"",
      "Netanyahu's decision was welcomed by his ultranationalist national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who congratulated him on the move.",
      "\"With Gallant ... it is not possible to achieve absolute victory,\" Ben-Gvir wrote on X.",
      "In a nationally televised statement in May, Gallant challenged Netanyahu over his refusal to discuss a cease-fire and hostage deal. He said that would force Israel to have to rule over the Palestinian enclave again.",
      "\u201cWe must make tough decisions for the future of our country, favoring national priorities above all other possible considerations, even with the possibility of personal or political costs,\u201d Gallant said over the summer.",
      "In the United States, a spokesperson for the National Security Council said Gallant has been an important partner on Israel's defense.",
      "\u201cAs close partners, we will continue to work collaboratively with Israel\u2019s next Minister of Defense,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "A U.S. official called Gallant's firing a surprise.",
      "\u201cThe surprising decision to fire Defense Minister Gallant is concerning, especially in the middle of two wars and as Israel prepares to defend against a potential attack from Iran,\" the official said. \"We have real questions about the reasons for Gallant\u2019s firing and about what is driving the decision.\u201d",
      "Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Gallant had been a \"trusted partner as Israel\u2019s Minister of Defense.\"",
      "\"America\u2019s commitment to Israel\u2019s security remains ironclad and the U.S. Department of Defense will continue to work closely with Israel\u2019s next Minister of Defense,\" he said.",
      "Mustafa Barghouti, head of the Palestinian National Initiative political party, said Gallant's firing was \"evidence of a deep internal rift in the Israeli system as a result of the failure of the Israeli aggression to achieve its goals.\"",
      "In the days after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, which Israeli officials say killed more than 1,200 people, Gallant announced a \"complete siege\" of Gaza.",
      "\"No electricity, no food, no water, no gas \u2014 it's all closed,\" Gallant said at the time, adding that his military was fighting against \"human animals\" in Gaza, where local officials say more than 43,000 people have been killed.",
      "Netanyahu fired Gallant in March 2023, after he publicly disagreed with the government and pushed to stop a controversial plan to overhaul the judicial system. The move prompted mass protests and led Netanyahu to reverse the decision."

      "Tropical Storm Rafael slipped by western Jamaica en route to the Cayman Islands and was expected to strengthen into a hurricane Tuesday evening, federal forecasters said.",
      "Rafael, which formed Sunday as Potential Tropical Cyclone 18, is about 45 to 50 miles southeast of the Cayman Islands and was producing winds of 70 mph, National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan said in a video update Tuesday.",
      "\"The center will be moving over those islands this evening, likely as a hurricane,\" he said.",
      "Hurricane status requires sustained winds of at least 74 mph, which denote the start of Category 1 strength; Category 2 is defined by damaging, sustained winds of at least 96 mph, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "The storm was moving northwest at 15 mph, the hurricane center said in its 4 p.m. ET Tuesday update.",
      "Forecasters said Rafael was \u201cgetting better organized\u201d as its center passed Jamaica. It\u2019s expected to undergo \u201csteady to rapid intensification\u201d over the next 24 to 36 hours, and it could reach Category 2 hurricane strength just before it reaches Cuba late Wednesday morning or early Wednesday afternoon, Brennan said.",
      "Rafael is the 17th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, and it will be the 11th hurricane if it strengthens further, as expected. The season lasts until Nov. 30, though peak activity is usually around Sept. 10.",
      "The storm system is expected to approach the U.S. later in the week, the hurricane center said. A tropical storm watch was issued Monday afternoon for the lower and middle Florida Keys and for the Dry Tortugas, which was upgraded Tuesday morning to a tropical storm warning.",
      "Brennan said tornadoes were possible in the southwest corner of Florida, including the Keys, starting Wednesday morning and spanning through the afternoon.",

Rafael is also forecast to weaken rapidly as it is approaching landfall on the Gulf Coast.",
      "The Keys could get 1 to 3 inches of rain in the latter half of the week, the National Hurricane Center said in its 4 p.m. update Tuesday.",
      "Brennan said the storm could mellow in the Gulf, where average sea surface temperatures have been measured at 76 degrees, and lose its hurricane status. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration experts say hurricanes need 80-degree water, ideally, to fuel their organization and expansion.",
      "\"We could see a slow-motion and a decaying system across the northern Gulf of Mexico,\" he said.",
      "A hurricane warning has been issued for the Cayman Islands, and the Cuban government has upgraded all areas previously covered by hurricane watches to hurricane warning status, which indicates hurricane conditions are likely in 36 hours, the hurricane center said.",
      "Havana is among the areas under a hurricane warning, the center said.",
      "Rafael is forecast to dump 3 to 6 inches of rain across much of the western Caribbean and up to 10 inches in some areas. The heaviest precipitation is expected in Jamaica.",
      "Sorm surge up to 3 feet is expected in the Cayman Islands on Tuesday, the hurricane center said. Flooding and mudslides could also occur in parts of Jamaica and Cuba.",
      "This hurricane season has proven to be an active one. Parts of the Southeast are still reeling from hurricanes Helene and Milton, which hit two weeks apart in late September and early October.",
      "Forecasters predicted an exceptionally busy hurricane season, in part because of record-high sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic.",

    "story": [
      "SAN DIEGO \u2014 Former military defense contractor Leonard \u201cFat Leonard\u201d Francis was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years in prison for masterminding a decade-long bribery scheme that swept up dozens of U.S. Navy officers, federal prosecutors said.",
      "U.S. District Judge Janis L. Sammartino also ordered Francis to pay $20 million in restitution to the Navy and a $150,000 fine, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. He was also ordered to forfeit $35 million in \u201cill-gotten proceeds from his crimes,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Prosecutors said the sentence results from Leonard\u2019s first guilty plea in 2015 concerning bribery and fraud, his extensive cooperation with the government since then, and another guilty plea Tuesday for failing to appear for his original sentencing hearing in 2022.",
      "Shortly before he was due to be sentenced in September 2022, Leonard cut off a GPS monitor he was wearing while under house arrest and fled the country. He was later arrested in\u00a0Venezuela\u00a0and brought back to the U.S. in December 2023.",
      "Sammartino sentenced him to more than 13 \u00bd years for the bribery and fraud charges plus 16 months for failing to appear, to be served consecutively.",
      "\u201cLeonard Francis lined his pockets with taxpayer dollars while undermining the integrity of U.S. Naval forces,\u201d U.S. Attorney Tara McGrath said in Tuesday\u2019s statement. \u201dThe impact of his deceit and manipulation will be long felt, but justice has been served today.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said Francis\u2019 actions led to one of the biggest bribery investigations in U.S. military history, which resulted in the conviction and sentencing of nearly two dozen Navy officials, defense contractors and others on various fraud and corruption charges.",
      "An enigmatic figure who was 6-foot-3 and weighed 350 pounds at one time, Francis owned and operated his family\u2019s ship servicing business, Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd. or GDMA, which supplied food, water and fuel to vessels. The Malaysian defense contractor was a key contact for U.S. Navy ships at ports across Asia for more than two decades. During that time, Francis wooed naval officers with Kobe beef, expensive cigars, concert tickets and wild sex parties at luxury hotels from Thailand to the Philippines.",
      "In exchange, officers, including the first active-duty admiral to be convicted of a federal crime, concealed the scheme in which Francis would overcharge for supplying ships or charge for fake services at ports he controlled in Southeast Asia. The officers passed him classified information and even went so far as redirecting military vessels to ports that were lucrative for his Singapore-based ship servicing company.",
      "In a federal sting, Francis was lured to San Diego on false pretenses and arrested at a hotel in September 2013. He pleaded guilty in 2015, admitting that he had offered more than $500,000 in cash bribes to Navy officials, defense contractors and others. Prosecutors say he bilked the Navy out of at least $35 million. As part of his plea deal, he cooperated with the investigation leading to the Navy convictions. He faced up to 25 years in prison.",
      "While awaiting sentencing, Francis was hospitalized and treated for renal cancer and other medical issues. After leaving the hospital, he was allowed to stay out of jail at a rental home, on house arrest with a GPS ankle monitor and security guards.",
      "But three weeks before his scheduled sentencing in September 2022, he snipped off his monitor and made a brazen escape, setting off an international search. Officials said he fled to Mexico, made his way to Cuba and eventually got to Venezuela.",
      "He was\u00a0arrested more than two weeks after his disappearance\u00a0\u2014 caught before he boarded a flight at the Simon Bolivar International Airport outside Caracas. Venezuelan officials said he intended to reach Russia.",
      "The cases were handled by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in an effort to be independent of the military justice system. But they have came under scrutiny.",
      "The\u00a0felony convictions of four former Navy officers were vacated\u00a0following allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Sammartino agreed to allow them to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and pay a $100 fine each.",
      "Last year, Sammartino ruled that the lead federal prosecutor in the officers\u2019 case committed \u201cflagrant misconduct\u201d by withholding information from defense lawyers, but that it was not enough to dismiss the case."

    "story": [
      "KYOTO, Japan \u2014 The world\u2019s first wooden satellite, built by Japanese researchers, was launched into space Tuesday in an early test of using timber in lunar and Mars exploration.",
      "LignoSat, developed by Kyoto University and homebuilder Sumitomo Forestry, will be flown to the International Space Station on a SpaceX mission and later released into orbit about 250 miles above the Earth.",
      "Named after the Latin word for \u201cwood,\u201d the palm-sized LignoSat is tasked with demonstrating the cosmic potential of renewable material as humans explore\u00a0living in space.",
      "\u201cWith timber, a material we can produce by ourselves, we will be able to build houses, live and work in space forever,\u201d said Takao Doi, an astronaut who has flown on the Space Shuttle and studies human space activities at Kyoto University.",
      "With a 50-year plan of planting trees and building timber houses on the moon and Mars, Doi\u2019s team decided to develop a NASA-certified wooden satellite to prove that wood is a space-grade material.",
      "\u201cEarly 1900s airplanes were made of wood,\u201d said Kyoto University forest science professor Koji Murata. \u201cA wooden satellite should be feasible, too.\u201d",
      "Wood is more durable in space than on Earth because there\u2019s no water or oxygen that would rot or inflame it, Murata added.",
      "A wooden satellite also minimizes the environmental impact at the end of its life, the researchers say.",
      "Decommissioned satellites must re-enter the atmosphere to avoid becoming\u00a0space debris. Conventional metal satellites create aluminum oxide particles during re-entry, but wooden ones would burn up with less pollution, Doi said.",
      "\u201cMetal satellites might be banned in the future,\u201d Doi said. \u201cIf we can prove our first wooden satellite works, we want to pitch it to Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX.\u201d",
      "After a 10-month experiment aboard the International Space Station, the researchers found that hinoki, a kind of magnolia tree native to Japan and traditionally used for sword sheaths, is best suited for spacecraft.",
      "LignoSat is made of hinoki, using a traditional Japanese crafts technique without screws or glue.",
      "Once deployed, LignoSat will stay in orbit for six months, with the electronic components onboard measuring how wood endures the\u00a0extreme environment\u00a0of space, where temperatures fluctuate from -100 to 100 degrees Celsius every 45 minutes as it orbits from darkness to sunlight.",
      "LignoSat will also gauge wood\u2019s ability to reduce the impact of space radiation on semiconductors, making it useful for applications such as\u00a0data center construction, said Kenji Kariya, a manager at Sumitomo Forestry Tsukuba Research Institute.",
      "\u201cIt may seem outdated, but wood is actually cutting-edge technology as civilization heads to the moon and Mars,\u201d he said. \u201cExpansion to space could invigorate the timber industry.\u201d"
