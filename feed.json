      "NEW YORK -- Remember what you searched for in 2024? Google does.",
      "Google released its annual \u201cYear in Search\u201d on Tuesday, rounding up the top trending queries entered into its namesake search engine in 2024. The results show terms that saw the highest spike in traffic compared to last year \u2014 ranging from key news events, notably global elections, to the most popular songs, athletes and unforgettable pop-culture moments that people looked up worldwide.",
      "Sports \u2014 particularly soccer and cricket \u2014 dominated Google's overall trending searches in 2024. Copa Am\u00e9rica topped those search trends globally, followed by the UEFA European Championship and ICC Men's T20 World Cup.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. election led news-specific searches worldwide. Queries about excessive heat and this year's Olympic Games followed.",
      "U.S. President-elect Donald Trump topped searches in Google's people category this year \u2014 followed by Catherine, Princess of Wales, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who also led athlete-specific searches. Meanwhile, the late Liam Payne, Toby Keith and O.J. Simpson led search trends among notable individuals who died in 2024.",
      "In the world of entertainment, Disney and Pixar's \u201cInside Out 2\u201d was the top trending movie of the year, while Netflix's \u201cBaby Reindeer\u201d led TV show trends. And Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us\u201d dominated song trends.",
      "That's just the tip of the iceberg. Queries for the Olympic village's chocolate muffin, made famous by Norwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen over the summer games, led Google's global recipe trends this year. The New York Times' \u201cConnections\u201d puzzle topped game searches. And in the U.S., country-specific data shows, many people asked Google about online trends like the word \u201cdemure\u201d and \u201c mob wife aesthetic.\u201d",
      "You can find more country-specific lists, and trends from years past, through Google\u2019s \u201cYear in Search\u201d data published online. The California company said it collected 2024 search results from Jan. 1 through Nov. 23 of this year.",
      "Google isn't the only one to publish an annual recap or top trends as 2024 draws to a close. Spotify Wrapped, for example, as well as Collins Dictionary and Merriam-Webster\u2019s words of the year, have offered additional reflections for 2024."

    "story": [
      "High-profile legal battles are nothing new for Texas attorney Tony Buzbee",
      "HOUSTON -- High-profile legal battles are nothing new for Texas attorney Tony Buzbee, with his latest being a lawsuit he's filed against Jay-Z, accusing the iconic rapper as well as Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs of sexually assaulting a minor at an awards show after-party in 2000.",
      "The lawsuit against Jay-Z is part of a series of civil cases the Houston-based Buzbee has filed against Combs, who remains jailed in New York as he awaits trial on federal charges that he coerced and abused women for years.",
      "In his legal career, Buzbee has represented a variety of clients. He helped acquit Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton at his impeachment trial in the Texas Senate last year. He represented more than two dozen women who accused Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson of sexual misconduct and assault. Buzbee has also made a couple of unsuccessful runs at elected office, including a bid to be Houston\u2019s mayor.",
      "His critics say he\u2019s full of bluster and bombast. Jay-Z said the lawsuit against him is part of an extortion attempt. Buzbee's law firm has said he\u2019s worked to amplify the voices of the marginalized and to \u201cpursue justice against powerful figures.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a society where we typically don\u2019t believe the accuser. We blame the victim and by proxy we blame her lawyers,\u201d Buzbee said during a March 2021 news conference.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Buzbee, his involvement in the lawsuits against Combs and what other cases he\u2019s handled.",
      "Buzbee is a well-known name in Texas courtrooms who has won billions of dollars in settlements for his clients.",
      "He grew up in northeast Texas, the son of a butcher and a high school cafeteria worker. After graduating from Texas A&M University, he served in the U.S. Marine Corps. Buzbee later went to law school and founded his own firm.",
      "His style is \u201ccharacterized by his aggressive legal tactics, his ability to command media attention and his knack for turning complex legal battles into public narratives that resonate with juries and the public alike,\" according to his law firm's website.",
      "Buzbee has said his firm is representing more than 150 people, both men and women, who allege sexual abuse and exploitation at the hands of Combs.",
      "Buzbee's firm, which has set up a 1-800 number for accusers, has filed a wave of suits against the hip-hop mogul. Buzbee\u2019s lawsuits allege that many of the people he represents were abused at parties in New York, California and Florida where individuals were given drinks that were laced with drugs.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers have dismissed Buzbee\u2019s lawsuits as \u201cshameless publicity stunts, designed to extract payments from celebrities who fear having lies spread about them, just as lies have been spread about Mr. Combs.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Jay-Z issued a statement in which he accused Buzbee of trying to blackmail him by getting him to agree to a legal settlement over allegations he and Combs raped a woman when she was 13 years old.",
      "\u201cI have no idea how you have come to be such a deplorable human Mr. Buzbee, but I promise you I have seen your kind many times over,\u201d Jay-Z said in his statement. \u201cYou claim to be a marine? Marines are known for their valor, you have neither honor nor dignity.\u201d",
      "Buzbee said in a Sunday Facebook post he \u201cwon't be bullied or intimidated.\u201d",
      "\u201cSunlight is the best disinfectant and I am quite certain the sun is coming,\" Buzbee said.",
      "In 2009, his firm won a $100 million settlement for 10 workers who were sicked by a chemical release at a refinery in suburban Houston.",
      "Buzbee has also represented politicians, including Paxton and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry in an abuse-of-power case.",
      "In 2013, he settled lawsuits for 10 teenagers who had accused eccentric Texas millionaire Stanley Marsh 3 of paying them for sexual acts.",
      "Buzbee has also settled lawsuits that he filed on behalf of 25 women who had accused Watson, when he was with the Houston Texans, of exposing himself, touching them with his genitals or kissing them against their will during massage appointments.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve handled some of the largest cases in this state,\u201d Buzbee said during the 2021 news conference.",

      "It\u2019s a discombobulating experience, after a \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d trilogy that was built, down to every frame and hobbit hair, for the big screen, to see something so comparatively minor, small-scaled and TV-sized as \u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim.\u201d",
      "The film, set 183 years before the events of \u201cThe Hobbit,\u201d is a return to Middle-earth that, despite some very earnest storytelling, never supplies much of an answer as to why, exactly, it exists.",
      "\u201cRohirrim,\u201d which sounds a little like the sound an orc might make sneezing, is perhaps best understood as a placeholder for further cinematic universe extrapolation from J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s books. (A live-action movie about Gollum is due out in 2026.) Here, the thin basis in Tolkien comes from the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d appendix, which lists a history of Rohan, the plains kingdom south of the Elven forest of Lothl\u00f3rien.",
      "A small army of screenwriters \u2013 Jeffrey Addiss, Will Matthews, Phoebe Gittins and Arty Papageorgiou \u2013 have from those faint embers conjured a fiery war movie, made as an anime by director Kenji Kamiyama (\u201cGhost in the Shell: Stand Along Complex,\u201d \u201cBlade Runner: Black Lotus\u201d). The obviously talented Kamiyama fashions some dazzling vintage anime visuals that \u2014 and perhaps this isn\u2019t all bad \u2014 feels a world apart from Peter Jackson\u2019s Middle-earth features.",
      "But \u201cThe War of Rohirrim\u201d also feels conspicuously closer to 1990s direct-to-video release than an heir to some of the grandest big-screen fantasy storytelling of the past 25 years. Though there are many \u2014 too many \u2014 examples of Hollywood over-mining once-rich intellectual property, this dull, appendix-extracted anime adds to a not particularly Tolkienist tradition.",
      "Tolkien diehards, though, may be grateful for whatever \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d morsels they can find. And there is some precedent. Before Jackson (an executive producer here) built Middle-earth in New Zealand, \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d prompted a pair of 1970s animated TV specials and a not-much-remembered animated 1978 movie.",
      "\u201cThe War of Rohirrim\u201d concerns the adventures of Hera (voiced by Gaia Wise), daughter of Helm Hammerhand ( Brian Cox ), the Rohan king. Cox, coming off of \u201cSuccession,\u201d again finds himself beset with trouble over the future of his throne.",
      "Things get underway when Freka (Shaun Dolley), leader of the Dundelings, offers his son Wulf (Luke Pasqualino) to marry Hera and take the throne. After a swift refusal, a fight ensues, and with a mere punch, Helm accidentally kills Freka. Given how extreme Wulf\u2019s vengeance is following this punch, it\u2019s fair to wonder if \u201cThe War of Rohirrim\u201d could have been started just as easily with a slap or, perhaps, an overly aggressive noogie.",
      "But only self-seriousness reigns in this \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d adventure. When the battle begins, Hera must save her people, which she strives to do by retreating to a fortress dug into a mountainside. Hera\u2019s story is said to be one lost to history in the opening narration, but \u201cThe War of Rohirrim\u201d is just as much an origin story for the stronghold that will later be known as Helm\u2019s Deep.",
      "I don\u2019t begrudge any Tolkien addict a little anime fun \u2014 and maybe these references and callbacks will be enough to conjure some of the majesty of the books or Jackson\u2019s movies. You can tell \"Rohirrim\u201d was made with sincere belief in the world Tolkien created. But I found the connective tissue, like the few notes from Howard Shore\u2019s original score that float in, only reinforced how such grander movie ambitions once came to Rohan. \u201cThe War of the Rohirrim\u201d does manage to recapture one trait of the earlier films: at 134 minutes, it\u2019s long.",
      "\u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,\u201d a New Line release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for strong violence. Running time: 134 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

      "Kilbourne's book will be published next fall by Graywolf Press, Cave Canem announced Tuesday. Cave Canem is a nonprofit center based in New York that helps develop and promote the works of Black poets.",

      "\u201cInterstellar\u201d had been a labor of love, with Nolan fighting against the tides of a changing industry to use film, certain of its value. Like McConaughey\u2019s Cooper, an astronaut clinging to skills that were all but obsolete in his dust bowl reality, \u201cInterstellar\u201d was made by a celluloid-loving filmmaker when the format was least valued.",
      "\u201cCelluloid film was very threatened. Digital was taking over everything,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cWe put an enormous amount of work and effort into the IMAX 70mm film format release at the time feeling like we didn\u2019t know how much longer we\u2019d be able to do that.\u201d",
      "During its time, \u201cInterstellar\u201d was received warmly and an unambiguous success, but it also had its detractors. Its five Oscar nominations and win were all for crafts. And yet in the decade since, \u201cInterstellar\u201d has become beloved, a true classic. Nolan observed that it was the film that people kept wanting to talk about, telling him what it meant to them and asking if it was ever going to be re-released. Those grand emotions and sentimental themes of love, family and exploration that were a liability with some are now its most cherished qualities.",
      "\u201cA lot of these people were younger people who, it was clear to me, had seen the film in the home and hadn\u2019t had the chance to see it on the big screen,\u201d Nolan said.",
      "While there have been \u201cInterstellar\u201d rereleases internationally, in China and at the Science Museum in London, Nolan saw an opportunity and spoke to IMAX and Paramount, now under a new regime, about a proper North American re-release for its 10th anniversary. The prints, Nolan said, hadn't aged a day.",
      "IMAX hardly needed convincing: They\u2019ve had the anniversary date circled on the calendar. For years, \u201cInterstellar\u201d was by far the biggest request on their social channels.",
      "\u201cWe saw this coming from the beginning,\u201d IMAX CEO Rich Gelfond said. \u201cIt reminded us in a small way of the frenzy around \u2018Oppenheimer.\u2019 But the result is far beyond our expectations.\"",
      "\u201cInterstellar\u201d is now the ninth highest-grossing IMAX release of all time and is closing in on eight (currently occupied by \u201cThe Last Jedi.\u201d) The company is currently exploring options for re-releases in different territories.",
      "The \u201cOppenheimer\" effect was real in redeeming film's value for the business.",
      "IMAX screens accounted for some 20% of the nearly $1 billion this year's Oscar best picture winner made globally (it ranks at No. 5 for IMAX). While filmmakers have long cherished film stock, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d had studios, distributors and theaters taking note of the demand. Earlier this year the film showings of \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d were sold out for four weeks. And there's more to come: Ryan Coogler's new film \u201cSinners,\" opening in March 2025, was shot with IMAX cameras.",
      "The \u201cInterstellar\u201d release was fairly \u201clow key\" when it came to promotion, but it also didn\u2019t need much \u2014 fans made sure of that. Before IMAX had even announced that tickets were on sale, some noticed that AMC had made them available. News spread on socials and overnight every 70mm IMAX showing at the Lincoln Square location in New York had sold out. It wasn\u2019t just the \u201cprimetime\u201d slots either: The 1 AM showtimes were at capacity too.",
      "After the weekend's turnout surpassed expectations, they added more 70mm IMAX screenings through the week which also filled up quickly.",
      "While Nolan is in some ways an anomaly, as the rare filmmaker whose name alone can draw crowds for original fare, there are lessons to be learned from the weekend.",
      "\u201cIt just shows our industry once again that audiences truly understand the difference between a communal, big screen theatrical experience that they crave even on films that they\u2019ve had the opportunities to see in the home,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cThat theatrical experience that we all know and love is so powerful and so exciting. It\u2019s a very clear demonstration of it, especially coming amidst all the great successes right now, \u201cWicked,\u201d\u201cGladiator II,\u201d\u201cMoana 2.\u201d",
      "\"Audiences are coming out in droves for that experience that we all love so much.\u201d",
      "Before the weekend, Nolan was able to see the film again on the big screen for the first time since the original release, accompanied by his Oscar-winning \u201cOppenheimer\u201d cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema. \u201cInterstellar\u201d was their first collaboration and Hoytema\u2019s introduction to IMAX cameras (where he proved that they could be handheld if you tried hard enough).",
      "\u201cIt was really, really fun,\" Nolan said.",
      "He also approved the new 4K UHD \u201cInterstellar\" set that's now available.",
      "Since \u201cOppenheimer's\" big night at the Oscars and Nolan's best director win, there's been much speculation about his next film with near daily rumors circulating about casting and genre, none of which have been officially confirmed. It's not something he's speaking publicly about yet. One thing he will say, however, is that he\u2019s in the throes of intensive testing for a new film technology with IMAX to use in the next production.",
      "\u201cThey have an incredible engineering staff, really brilliant minds doing extraordinary work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see innovation in the celluloid film arena still happening and happening at the highest level possible.\u201d",
      "And he\u2019s still making time to go to the movies. Over the weekend, Nolan went to see \u201cWicked\u201d at a theater in Burbank where he also peeked into one of the IMAX presentations of his film.",
      "\u201cIt was pretty magical to see a full house on that film,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a very special thing to see, 10 years later.\u201d"

      "Even through a year of nonstop news about elections, climate change, protests and the price of eggs, Americans still found time to read",
      "NEW YORK -- Even through a year of nonstop news about elections, climate change, protests and the price of eggs, there was still time to read books.",
      "U.S. sales held steady according to Circana, which tracks around 85% of the print market, with many choosing the relief of romance, fantasy and romantasy. Some picked up Taylor Swift's tie-in book to her blockbuster tour, while others sought out literary fiction, celebrity memoirs, political exposes and a close and painful look at a generation hooked on smartphones.",
      "Here are 10 notable books published in 2024, in no particular order.",
      "Asking about the year's hottest reads would basically yield a list of the biggest hits in romantasy, the blend of fantasy and romance that has proved so irresistible fans were snapping up expensive \u201cspecial editions\u201d with decorative covers and sprayed edges. Of the 25 top sellers of 2024, as compiled by Circana, six were by romantasy favorite Sarah J. Maas, including \u201cHouse of Flame and Shadow,\u201d the third of her \u201cCrescent City\u201d series. Millions read her latest installment about Bryce Quinlan and Hunter Athalar and traced the ever-growing ties of \u201cMaasverse,\u201d the overlapping worlds of \u201cCrescent City\u201d and her other series, \u201cThrone of Glass\u201d and \u201cA Court of Thorns and Roses.\u201d",
      "If romantasy is for escape, other books demand we confront. In the bestselling \u201cThe Anxious Generation,\u201d social psychologist Jonathan Haidt looks into studies finding that the mental health of young people began to deteriorate in the 2010s, after decades of progress. According to Haidt, the main culprit is right before us: digital screens that have drawn kids away from \u201cplay-based\u201d to \u201cphone-based\u201d childhoods. Although some critics challenged his findings, \u201cThe Anxious Generation\u201d became a talking point and a catchphrase. Admirers ranged from Oprah Winfrey to Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee, who in a letter to state legislators advocated such \u201ccommonsense recommendations\u201d from the book as banning phones in schools and keeping kids off social media until age 16.",
      "Bob Woodward books have been an election tradition for decades. \u201cWar,\u201d the latest of his highly sourced Washington insider accounts, made news with its allegations that Donald Trump had been in frequent contact with Russian leader Vladimir Putin even while out of office and, while president, had sent Putin sophisticated COVID-19 test machines. Among Woodward's other scoops: Putin seriously considered using nuclear weapons against Ukraine, and President Joe Biden blamed former President Barack Obama, under whom he served as vice president, for some of the problems with Russia. \u201cBarack never took Putin seriously,\u201d Woodward quoted Biden as saying.",
      "Former (and future) first lady Melania Trump, who gives few interviews and rarely discusses her private life, unexpectedly announced she was publishing a memoir: \u201cMelania.\u201d The publisher was unlikely for a former first lady \u2014 not one of the major New York houses, but Skyhorse, where authors include such controversial public figures as Woody Allen and Trump cabinet nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. And its success was at least a minor surprise. Melania Trump did little publicity for the book, and offered few revelations beyond posting a video expressing support for abortion rights \u2014 a break from one of the cornerstones of GOP policy. But \u201cMelania\u201d still sold hundreds of thousands of copies, many in the days following her husband's election.",
      "Taylor Swift was more than a music story in 2024. Like \u201cMelania,\u201d the news about Taylor Swift's self-published tie-in to her global tour isn't so much the book itself, but that it exists. And how well it sold. As she did with the \u201cEras\u201d concert film, Swift bypassed the established industry and worked directly with a distributor: Target offered \u201cThe Eras Tour Book\u201d exclusively. According to Circana, the \u201cEras\u201d book sold more than 800,000 copies just in its opening week, an astonishing number for a publication unavailable through Amazon.com and other traditional retailers. No new book in 2024 had a better debut.",
      "Midnight book parties are supposed to be for \u201cHarry Potter\u201d and other fantasy series, but this fall, more than 100 stores stayed open late to welcome one of the year's literary events: Sally Rooney's \u201cIntermezzo.\u201d The Irish author's fourth novel centers on two brothers, their grief over the death of their father, their very different career paths and their very unsettled love lives. \u201cIntermezzo\u201d was also a book about chess: \u201cYou have to read a lot of opening theory \u2014 that's the beginning of a game, the first moves,\u201d one of the brothers explains. \u201cAnd you're learning all this for what? Just to get an okay position in the middle game and try to play some decent chess. Which most of the time I can't do anyway.\u201d",
      "Lisa Marie Presley had been working on a memoir at the time of her death, in 2023, and daughter Riley Keough had agreed to help her complete it. \u201cFrom Here to the Great Unknown\u201d is Lisa Marie's account of her father, Elvis Presley, and the sagas of of her adult life, notably her marriage to Michael Jackson and the death of son Benjamin Keough. To the end, she was haunted by the loss of Elvis, just 42 when he collapsed and died at his Graceland home while young Lisa Marie was asleep. \u201cShe would listen to his music alone, if she was drunk, and cry,\u201d Keough, during an interview with Winfrey, said of her mother.",
      "Meanwhile, Cher released the first of two planned memoirs titled \u201cCher\u201d \u2014 no further introduction required. Covering her life from birth to the end of the 1970s, she focuses on her ill-fated marriage to Sonny Bono, remembering him as a gifted entertainer and businessman who helped her believe in herself while turning out to be unfaithful, erratic, controlling and so greedy that he kept all the couple's earnings for himself. Unsure of whether to leave or stay, she consulted a very famous divorcee, Lucille Ball, who reportedly encouraged her: \u201cF--- him, you're the one with the talent.\u201d",
      "A trend in recent years is to take famous novels from the past, and remove words or passages that might offend modern readers; an edition of \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\u201d cuts the racist language from Mark Twain's original text. In the most celebrated literary work of 2024, Percival Everett found a different way to take on Twain's classic \u2014 write it from the perspective of the enslaved Jim. \u201cJames,\u201d winner of the National Book Award, is a recasting in many ways. Everett suggests to us that the real Jim was nothing like the deferential figure known to millions of readers, but a savvy and learned man who concealed his intelligence from the whites around him, and even from Twain himself.",
      "Salman Rushdie's first National Book Award nomination was for a memoir he wished he had no reason to write. In \u201cKnife,\u201d he recounts in full detail the horrifying attempt on his life in 2022, when an attendee rushed the stage during a literary event in western New York and stabbed him repeatedly, leaving with him a blinded eye and lasting nerve damage, but with a spirit surprisingly intact.",
      "\u201cIf you had told me that this was going to happen and how would I deal with it, I would not have been very optimistic about my chances,\u201d he told The Associated Press last spring. \u201cI\u2019m still myself, you know, and I don\u2019t feel other than myself. But there\u2019s a little iron in the soul, I think.\u201d"

      "Vacation rental with the in-laws \u2014 for many, it\u2019s a setup for disaster. In Weike Wang\u2019s \u201cRental House,\u201d it\u2019s certainly that. It\u2019s also an opportunity for Wang, a wildly gifted writer, to explore the upside and downside of education, marriage and family. Add to the mix an interracial couple where one partner hails from an Appalachian background like that of JD Vance and the other\u2019s life was shaped by the policies of Chairman Mao, and you have all you need for a laugh-out-loud satire of American dysfunction.",
      "The heroes are Nate and Keru, who meet sort-of-cute at a Halloween party their senior year at Yale. She\u2019s in a leopard-print turtleneck, plaid jacket and shiny gold pants to represent \u201ca bad dress day.\u201d He\u2019s got a fin strapped to his back to stand for \u201cgreat white,\u201d as in shark, not, Keru later realizes, his status as another well-to-do Caucasian male at an Ivy League school. Nate is anything but that. His background is hillbilly, minus the elegy, the first generation in his family to go to college. Keru is first-gen, too, having emigrated to this country as a child with her Chinese parents.",
      "Both are whip smart. He studies fruit flies, she\u2019s in consulting. Five years into their marriage, they invite each set of parents to spend a week at their Cape Cod beach house. By then, they\u2019ve become doting parents of a giant sheepdog, Mantou, whose name means \u201csteamed bun\u201d in Chinese. As their parents arrive in staggered shifts, Wang gleefully pokes fun at each family\u2019s prejudices and quirks. \u201cTo use a dishwasher is to admit defeat,\u201d Keru\u2019s demanding father tells Nate sternly. But the light-hearted tone darkens when Keru, stressed out by her in-laws\u2019 visit, has a meltdown.",
      "In the second half of the book, the stakes are higher. It\u2019s five years later, and Keru is making gobs more money than her tenured professor husband though it requires 80-hour weeks. Easygoing Nate has been diagnosed with anxiety and even Mantou is depressed.",
      "This time, they rent a house in a luxury development in the Catskills, where Keru must harness her considerable problem-solving skills to steer their little ship of family through unexpected visits from nosy, obnoxious neighbors and Nate\u2019s ne\u2019er-do-well brother.",
      "Though ostensibly a comedy of manners built around an opposites-attract couple, Wang\u2019s novel, her third after \u201cChemistry\u201d and \u201cJoan Is Okay,\u201d is a poignant, profound meditation on this divided country enlivened by her dry wit and deadpan style.",

      "Brenda Lee's memories of recording \u201cRockin' Around the Christmas Tree\u201d are a little hazy now",
      "NEW YORK -- Her memories of recording \u201cRockin' Around the Christmas Tree\u201d are a little hazy. She remembers the producer placing decorations around the studio and blasting the air conditioner on a warm Nashville day to create a holiday spirit. The musicians, she recalls, nailed it in a couple of takes.",
      "That's about it. After all, Brenda Lee was 13 years old at the time \u2014 and it was 66 years ago, in 1958.",
      "Somewhat implausibly, her celebration of a \u201cChristmas party hop\u201d is more popular today than ever before. It's an unusual trajectory, even accounting for the fact that music listeners during the holiday season tend to embrace songs they've known for years.",
      "\u201cRockin'\u201d eclipsed Mariah Carey's perennial favorite \u201cAll I Want for Christmas is You\u201d last December to top the Billboard music chart and make Lee, at age 78, the oldest woman to achieve that feat. A week later, following a birthday, she beat her own mark. Kendrick Lamar likely stands in her way of doing it again this year.",
      "Another record: Sixty-five years represented the longest interval between a record being released and making it to No. 1.",
      "\u201cIt is a good song,\u201d Lee told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's a song that anybody can sing. You can join in, you can sing it, everyone is happy. I sure am glad that I have it. I never thought in my life that a Christmas song would be my legacy. But I'll take it.\u201d",
      "It's a phenomenon that music journalist Holly Gleason noticed recently while stopping for coffee in Nashville, near the neighborhood where Lee lives. The song came over the loudspeaker and the room \u2014 parents, kids, hipsters \u2014 erupted in singing and laughter. \u201cIt's kind of an ear worm on steroids,\u201d said Gleason, whose 2017 book \u201cWoman Walk the Line: How the Women in Country Music Changed Our Lives\u201d featured Lee, among others.",
      "The song manages the neat trick of sounding retro yet not dated. Sweet guitar licks snake around Lee's voice in the original recording. Boots Randolph's saxophone solo drives it home. The party flies by quickly, the song over in two minutes, six seconds.",
      "Composer Johnny Marks already had some seasonal hits to his credit, including \u201cRudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer\u201d and \u201cA Holly Jolly Christmas.\u201d He specifically sought out Lee for his new song in 1958 and it's easy to see why: Who better to convey its innocence and spirit than a 13-year-old girl at the forefront of the Baby Boom? Rock \u2018n\u2019 roll was in its infancy then, too.",
      "In the song, Lee sings about \u201cmistletoe hung where you can see, every couple tries to stop.\u201d",
      "In real life, she hadn't experienced her first kiss. \u201cLord, no,\u201d she said. \u201cNot to say I didn't want to. I wasn't even allowed to date until I was 16.\u201d",
      "The song hits plenty of holiday reference points \u2014 pumpkin pie, caroling, boughs of holly. You can overlook the part of the chorus that doesn't make much sense: what is the \u201cnew old-fashioned way,\u201d exactly?",
      "The simplicity of \u201cRockin' Around the Christmas Tree\u201d is a big part of its appeal, said Nathaniel Sloan, a musicologist at the University of Southern California and co-host of the \u201cSwitched on Pop\u201d podcast. Like many successful holiday songs, it evokes nostalgia for a happier, more peaceful time \u2014 even if that's more imagination than reality, he said.",
      "The style is more rockabilly than traditional rock or country, and Sloan believes that has much to do with why it continues to sound fresh.",
      "\u201cThe thing that has always stunned me about the song is that you're listening to a 13-year-old's performance, and it doesn't sound that way to me,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's a depth to the vocal, even a weathered quality, that I can't believe she was so young. It's pitch-perfect.\u201d",
      "For all of its success, the song was barely noticed upon its release in 1958. Not until two years later, when Lee's profile was higher through hits like \u201cI'm Sorry,\u201d did it make the music charts. Its biggest boost came 40 years after that, when \u201cRockin' Around the Christmas Tree\u201d was featured in the hit movie \u201cHome Alone.\u201d The movie itself has become a holiday staple, giving more exposure to the song each year.",
      "Her record company continues to push the song, recording a video in 2023 that included guest appearances by Tanya Tucker and Trisha Yearwood. This year it has released \u201cNoche Buena Y Navidad,\u201d a Spanish-language version using artificial intelligence to create a vocal derived from Lee's voice.",
      "Universal Music is holding a party for her in Nashville to celebrate her 80th birthday on Wednesday. \u201cShe's just a force and a character,\u201d said Cindy Mabe, the company's chairwoman and CEO. \u201cShe's full of spunk in the same way that 13-year-old girl was.\u201d",
      "\u201cRockin' Around the Christmas Tree\u201d made the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2019. It has been streamed more than 2.5 billion times globally and certified seven times Platinum, meaning at least seven million copies sold. Kelly Clarkson, Miley Cyrus, Meghan Trainor, Kacey Musgraves and the duo of Darlene Love & Ronnie Spector are among the artists who've covered it.",
      "Lee has sung it countless times over the years, most recently at a charity event last year. It made her concert setlist even in the heat of summer. How much money the song has earned is murky; the record company wouldn't talk about it. The bulk of its income would likely go to Marks' estate.",
      "\u201cIt has never been a money thing for me,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a love thing. The money is great, yes, and I\u2019m grateful. But I would be singing it on the corner for pennies because that\u2019s what I love to do.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 04:26:19 -0500",
    "summary": "New Zealand's racing minister says the country will outlaw greyhound racing, citing the injury rates for racing dogs",
    "story": [
      "New Zealand's racing minister says the country will outlaw greyhound racing, citing the injury rates for racing dogs",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand plans to outlaw greyhound racing because too many dogs are hurt or killed, the government said Tuesday, spelling an end to the practice in one of the few countries where it still operates.",
      "The racing of greyhounds as a betting sport was wildly popular at times last century. But the number of dogs euthanized due to race-day injuries, or because homes cannot be found for them after their short careers end, has provoked animal welfare campaigns and growing public distaste for the sport.",
      "Commercial greyhound racing continues in the United States, Australia, the U.K. and Ireland, with only two tracks remaining in the U.S. after many states ended the practice.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s ban is not yet law but has universal political support. The government plans to stop the racing from Aug. 1, 2026, to allow the 2,900 racing dogs to be rehomed and more than 1,000 people employed in the industry to find other work, Racing Minister Winston Peters said Tuesday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s greyhound racing industry has faced repeated reviews in recent years over its dog safety record, with multiple reports urging sweeping changes. Peters said the industry had made progress -\u2013 but not enough.",
      "Stricter policies governing when dogs can be euthanized, and rehoming programs that send retired New Zealand greyhounds abroad as pets when homes cannot be found domestically, have reduced the numbers killed each year. But the percentage of dogs injured \u201cremains persistently high,\u201d Peters said.",
      "\u201cThe time has come to make a call in the best interest of the animals,\u201d he said.",
      "Greyhound Racing New Zealand, an industry group, accused the government of not recognizing improvements made, including its commitment to tracking the care of every retired dog for the rest of its life. Tuesday\u2019s announcement was \u201ca devastating blow,\u201d said chair Sean Hannan.",
      "The animal welfare organization SPCA praised the government for showing \u201ccompassion for dogs made to work in a dangerous gambling industry.\u201d The practice has long been out of favor in New Zealand, spokesperson Arnja Dale said.",
      "Some lawmakers in parliament on Tuesday described the racing industry\u2019s end as inevitable following the steady decline of greyhound racing worldwide.",
      "Commercial racing operates in four other countries. In the U.S., its popularity peaked in the 1980s and the number of states allowing the practice has dwindled since then amid reports of dog mistreatment and the explosion of other gambling options.",
      "Only two tracks remain -\u2013 both in West Virginia -\u2013 after Iowa, Arkansas and Florida shuttered their racing industries. Greyhounds have become popular as pets in the U.S., and New Zealand has sent dozens of dogs to new owners there when homes could not be found in the country of 5 million people.",
      "Greyhound racing is also legal in Australia, where critics have decried the practice, and the rules governing it vary by state. Commercial racing currently operates throughout the U.K. and Ireland, but the Scottish parliament is considering a ban there.",
      "The practice remains legal in Mexico and Vietnam, but there are no longer operational tracks in either country, according to information supplied by Peters\u2019 office.",
      "Hours after it announced the end to greyhound racing, New Zealand's government rushed through a law to prevent dogs from being killed while the industry winds down, unless a veterinarian deems it unavoidable. This will prevent owners from euthanizing dogs for economic reasons, Peters said.",
      "Lawmakers unanimously agreed to the change.",
      "The law shutting down the industry will take longer, however, and is not expected to pass until next year after a period of public submissions. All political parties support the ban.",

    "summary": "A trustee who oversaw the bankruptcy auction of Alex Jones&rsquo; Infowars is asking a judge to approve The Onion&rsquo;s winning bid for the conspiracy-filled platform",
    "story": [
      "A trustee who oversaw the bankruptcy auction of Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars is asking a judge to approve The Onion\u2019s winning bid for the conspiracy-filled platform",
      "A trustee who oversaw the Infowars bankruptcy auction told a judge Tuesday that he picked The Onion's bid for the conspiracy-filled platform because was it far better than the only other proposal he received, from a company affiliated with Alex Jones.",
      "Trustee Christopher Murray testified during the second day of a hearing where a judge is scrutinizing Murray's decision to name the satirical news outlet's offer as the winning bid after a November auction that Jones alleges involved fraud and collusion.",
      "\u201cOnly two people showed up to bid and \u2026 one was just better than the other,\u201d Murray testified, referring to The Onion. Asked how much better it was, he said \u201cby a lot.\u201d",
      "It is not clear how quickly U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston will rule. Testimony on Tuesday was expected to go into the evening.",
      "The Onion, which wants to turn Infowars\u2019 website and social media accounts into parodies, offered $1.75 million in cash and other incentives for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction that concluded on Nov. 14. First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements, bid $3.5 million.",
      "Although The Onion\u2019s cash offer was lower than that of First United American, it also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo $750,000 of the auction proceeds due to them and give it to other creditors, providing the other creditors more money than they would receive under First United American\u2019s bid.",
      "Lopez could ultimately decide whether to void The Onion\u2019s bid, name the Jones-affiliated company the winner or hold another auction, among other possibilities.",
      "Jones did not attend the proceedings and instead broadcast from his studios in Austin.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t imagine the judge would certify this fraud,\u201d Jones said on his show Tuesday. \u201cI mean it\u2019s head-spinning the stuff they did and what they claimed.\u201d",
      "The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations from Jones and the company and accuse them of sour grapes.",
      "If The Onion wins, Jones expects to be kicked out of the Infowars studio and its web and social media platforms.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Jones repeatedly called the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified in court that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats from his followers.",
      "Jones has since acknowledged that the Connecticut school shooting happened.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "Murray testified that he did not favor either bidder over the other and was not biased.",
      "He also revealed that First United American submitted a revised bid in recent days, but he said he could not accept it because the Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut lawsuit objected.",
      "The Onion valued its bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million, because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "In a court filing last month, Murray's lawyers called First United American's request to disqualify The Onion's bid a \u201cdisappointed bidder's improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open election process.\u201d",
      "Murray's lawyer questioned him Tuesday afternoon. Attorneys for Jones and First United American were cross-examining him later Tuesday.",
      "In his opening argument Monday, Jones attorney Ben Broocks said there was no way The Onion should have been chosen over First United American.",
      "\u201cHow does a $1.75 million bid beat a $3.5 million bid?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow is that $1.75 million greater? Well, it\u2019s voodoo economics, to use a phrase.\u201d",
      "Auctioneer Jeff Tanenbaum on Monday defended both the value of the bid and its selection.",
      "Up for sale were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, as well as the rights to its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights."

      "NEW YORK -- Nikki Giovanni, the poet, author, educator and public speaker who went from borrowing money to release her first book to spending decades as a literary celebrity who shared blunt and conversational takes on everything from racism and love to space travel and mortality, has died. She was 81.",
      "Giovanni, subject of the prize-winning 2023 documentary \u201cGoing to Mars,\u201d died Monday with her lifelong partner, Virginia \u201cGinney\u201d Fowler, by her side, according to a statement from friend and author Ren\u00e9e Watson.",
      "\u201cWe will forever feel blessed to have shared a legacy and love with our dear cousin,\u201d said Allison (Pat) Ragan, Giovanni\u2019s cousin, in a statement on behalf of the family.",
      "The author of more than 25 books, Giovanni was a born confessor and performer whom fans came to know well from her work, readings and other live appearances and her years on the faculty of Virginia Tech, among other schools. Poetry collections such as \u201cBlack Judgement\u201d and \u201cBlack Feeling Black Talk\u201d sold thousands of copies, led to invitations from \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d and other television programs and made her popular enough to fill a 3,000-seat concert hall at Lincoln Center for a celebration of her 30th birthday.",
      "In poetry, prose and the spoken word, she told her story. She looked back on her childhood in Tennessee and Ohio, championed the Black Power movement, addressed her battles with lung cancer, paid tribute to heroes from Nina Simone to Angela Davis and reflected on such personal passions as food, romance, family and rocketing into space \u2014 a journey she believed Black women uniquely qualified for, if only because of how much they had already survived. She also edited a groundbreaking anthology of Black women poets, \u201cNight Comes Softly,\u201d and helped found a publishing cooperative that promoted works by Gwendolyn Brooks and Margaret Walker among others.",
      "For a time, she was called \u201cThe Princess of Black Poetry.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll I know is the she is the most cowardly, bravest, least understanding, most sensitive, slowest to anger, most quixotic, lyingest, most honest woman I know,\u201d her friend Barbara Crosby wrote in the introduction to \u201cThe Prosaic Soul of Nikki Giovanni,\u201d an anthology of nonfiction prose published in 2003. \u201cTo love her is to love contradiction and conflict. To know her is to never understand but to be sure that all is life.\u201d",
      "Giovanni's admirers ranged from James Baldwin to Teena Marie, who name-checked her on the dance hit \u201cSquare Biz,\u201d to Oprah Winfrey, who invited the poet to her \u201cLiving Legends\u201d summit in 2005, when other guests of honor included Rosa Parks and Toni Morrison. Giovanni was a National Book Award finalist in 1973 for a prose work about her life, \u201cGemini.\u201d She also received a Grammy nomination for the spoken word album \u201cThe Nikki Giovanni Poetry Collection.\u201d",
      "In January 2009, at the request of NPR, she wrote a poem about the incoming president, Barack Obama:",

      "Then clean the churn\"",
      "____",
      "Giovanni had a son, Thomas Watson Giovanni, in 1969. She never married the father, because, she told Ebony magazine, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get married, and I could afford not to get married.\u201d Over the latter part of her life she lived with her partner, Fowler, a fellow faculty member at Virginia Tech.",
      "She was born Yolande Cornelia Giovanni Jr. in Knoxville, Tennessee, and was soon called \u201cNikki\u201d by her older sister. She was 4 when her family moved to Ohio and eventually settled in the Black community of Lincoln Heights, outside Cincinnati. She would travel often between Tennessee and Ohio, bound to her parents and to her maternal grandparents in her \u201cspiritual home\u201d in Knoxville.",
      "As a girl, she read everything from history books to Ayn Rand and was accepted to Fisk University, the historically Black school in Nashville, after her junior year of high school. College was a time for achievement, and for trouble. Her grades were strong, she edited the Fisk literary magazine and helped start the campus branch of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee. But she rebelled against school curfews and other rules and was kicked out for a time because her \u201cattitudes did not fit those of a Fisk woman,\u201d she later wrote. After the school changed the dean of women, Giovanni returned and graduated with honors in history in 1967.",
      "Giovanni relied on support from friends to publish her debut collection, \u201cBlack Poetry Black Talk,\u201d which came out in 1968, and in the same year she self-published \u201cBlack Judgement.\u201d The radical Black Arts Movement was at its height and early Giovanni poems such as \u201cA Short Essay of Affirmation Explaining Why,\u201d \u201cOf Liberation\u201d and \u201cA Litany for Peppe\u201d were militant calls to overthrow white power. (\"The worst junkie or black businessman is more humane/than the best honkie\").",
      "\u201cI have been considered a writer who writes from rage and it confuses me. What else do writers write from?\u201d she wrote in a biographical sketch for Contemporary Writers. \u201cA poem has to say something. It has to make some sort of sense; be lyrical; to the point; and still able to be read by whatever reader is kind enough to pick up the book.\u201d",
      "Her opposition to the political system moderated over time, although she never stopped advocating for change and self-empowerment, or remembering martyrs of the past. In 2020, she was featured in an ad for presidential candidate Joe Biden, in which she urged young people to \u201cvote because someone died for you to have the right to vote.\u201d",
      "Her best known work came early in her career; the 1968 poem \u201cNikki-Rosa.\u201d It was a declaration of her right to define herself, a warning to others (including obituary writers) against telling her story and a brief meditation on her poverty as a girl and the blessings, from holiday gatherings to bathing in \u201cone of those big tubs that folk in chicago barbecue in,\u201d which transcended it.",

      "NEW YORK -- The bestselling author team of Marie Benedict and Victoria Christopher Murray has a new novel in the works, while celebrating a milestone for its best-known publication, \u201cThe Personal Librarian.\u201d",
      "Benedict and Murray are writing a historical thriller set in 1930s New York, featuring such real-life characters as the gangster Lucky Luciano and the Black assistant district attorney Eunice Hunton Carter and the \u201cnotorious madam\u201d who \u201cforge a bold and unlikely alliance.\u201d The book is currently untitled, and no release date has been set.",
      "\u201cTogether, they navigate the treacherous underworld of corruption and vice to bring down the New York City crime syndicate,\u201d the authors said in a statement released Monday through Berkley, a Penguin Random House imprint.",
      "Meanwhile, \u201cThe Personal Librarian\u201d has now sold 1 million copies, Berkley announced. Published in 2021, the novel tells the story of J.P.

      "Highly anticipated shows like the final season of \u201cStranger Things,\" \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d and \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d didn't even make it on the calendar and will instead return in 2025. Streamers and networks tightened their budgets by saying yes to less.",
      "Writing off this year's selection, however, seems unfair. There were new standout comedies, dramas, reality TV and remakes of old favorites that caught the attention of viewers, awards voters and the zeitgeist.",
      "In no particular order, here are 10 new shows from 2024 to check out before the new year.",
      "In 2024, pop culture experienced a Brodyssance when Netflix's \u201cNobody Wants This\u201d reminded many why they had a crush on Adam Brody in the early aughts when he was on \u201cThe O.C.\u201d In this rom-com created by Erin Foster, Brody plays a rabbi named Noah who begins dating a gentile named Joanne (the always entertaining Kristen Bell) and their courtship as thirtysomethings unfolds. Before reaching their happily ever after, a number of obstacles \u2014 like religious differences, family pressures and career goals \u2014 need to be addressed. Hope is not lost, however, and throughout it all Noah and Joanne remain a good match. The supporting cast, by the way, is also a delight.",
      "The British series \u201cSupacell\u201d introduced a smart spin on the superhero template. Created and written by Rapman, the show centers on a group of Black, working class people in London who discover they have superpowers. At first, it seems the powerful are linked by just the color of their skin but their real connection is a family history of sickle cell disease. The show addresses themes like the medical exploitation of the Black community, poverty and how the media often overlooks cases of missing people of color. The show has been renewed for a second season and is on Netflix.",
      "Another fresh take on the world of superheroes and their villains is \u201cThe Penguin,\u201d on Max. The story picks up after the 2022 film \u201cThe Batman\u201d starring Robert Pattinson but here, Batman is more a background character to the gangster story of Oz Cobb. Colin Farrell played the criminal kingpin in the Pattinson film and reprises that role here. Cristin Milioti has also gotten positive reviews \u2014 and a Golden Globe nomination \u2014 for her portrayal of villain Sofia Falcone.",
      "When CBS first announced a new \u201cMatlock\u201d with Kathy Bates in the lead role, it seemed like just a gender-flipped remake. Au contraire. Bates plays Madeline Kingston, a wealthy lawyer who comes out of retirement under the alias Mattie Matlock (with a similar folksy demeanor as Andy Griffith's). Her reason for returning to work is that she needs money but, in reality, she's out for revenge. It's also fun to see how the series addresses older people being often overlooked and underestimated, which Madeline sometimes leans into for her own benefit. It streams on Paramount+. (Bates also snagged a Globe nomination.)",
      "When \u201cVanderpump Rules\u201d spinoff \u201cThe Valley\u201d debuted on Bravo in spring, some fans rolled their eyes. It follows three former \u201cVanderpump\u201d castmates \u2014 Jax Taylor, Brittany Cartwright and Kristen Doute \u2014 now living more settled lives amid a new circle of friends. Taylor and Doute knew the assignment \u2014 or just quickly fell into old habits of saying too much and stirring the pot. The new cast also impressed. Janet Caperna positioned herself as both above the drama and very much living for it. Jesse Lally showed vulnerability over the demise of his marriage to castmate Michelle Sanai, while also being an unapologetic snob. Viewers watched Taylor and Cartwright's marriage spiral, too (they're now divorcing). It streams on Peacock.",
      "Another adaptation with a twist is Prime Video's \u201cMr. & Mrs. Smith,\u201d starring Donald Glover and Maya Erskine. It shares a title with the film starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, but differs dramatically: Glover and Erskine play spies assigned to pose as a married couple named John and Jane Smith. They quickly go from strangers to co-workers to lovers. Each episode sees John and Jane on a new assignment, with notable guest stars like Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Michaela Coel and Sharon Horgan. The show was nominated for 16 Emmy Awards and three Golden Globes.",
      "Andrew Scott stars in \u201cRipley,\u201d a neo-noir Netflix adaptation about the con artist and serial killer created by Patricia Highsmith. Like the 1999 movie starring Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law, this limited series is based on the Highsmith's \u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley.\u201d Tom Ripley is hired by a wealthy businessman to travel to Italy and encourage his son, Dickie, who is living a life of leisure, to return to the States. Ripley ends up becoming enamored with Dickie's lifestyle and the ruse turns deadly.",
      "Brian Jordan Alvarez created and stars in FX's \u201cEnglish Teacher\u201d as Evan, a high school teacher in Texas, juggling the normal demands of the job amid societal changes. In one episode, Evan must show sensitivity to a student who has self-diagnosed herself with a made-up disease. In another, he successfully gets the school's gun safety program shut down but then is told all faculty must receive firearm training. As the adults on the show often struggle with getting it right, it's the students who seem less bothered with labels. The show also has a great soundtrack. It streams on Hulu.",
      "\u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d had a triumphant first season on FX, winning a historic 18 awards at this year's Emmys \u2014 including best drama series and best actor and actress in a drama for Hiroyuki Sanada and Anna Sawai. It's set during the power struggles in feudal Japan and is based on a 1975 James Clavell novel. FX didn't skimp on the production value, netting comparisons to \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d It was originally planned as a limited series, but now two more seasons are planned. Episodes stream on Hulu.",
      "Jake Gyllenhaal starred in his first TV series, \u201cPresumed Innocent,\u201d for Apple TV+. Gyllenhaal is Rusty Sabich, a Chicago prosecutor accused of killing a colleague. Gyllenhaal's real brother-in-law, Peter Sarsgaard, plays Rusty's adversary, another lawyer trying to prove his guilt. The story comes from a Scott Turow novel that was made into a Harrison Ford film in 1990 but doesn't follow either to the letter. It was the streamer's most watched drama series so far and a second season has been ordered, with Gyllenhaal staying on as an executive producer."

      "The unnamed woman says she was hanging around Radio City Music Hall during the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards and managed to talk a limousine driver into bringing her to a celebrity-studded party at a private residence after the event.",
      "She said that while she was in the limousine, she was asked to sign a nondisclosure document. Once at the party, the lawsuit said, she took a drink that made her feel \u201cwoozy and lightheaded\u201d and went into a bedroom to lie down.",
      "She said that Combs and Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, then barged into the room along with another unnamed celebrity and raped her. The woman said she eventually escaped the room, fled the house and called for a ride from a nearby gas station.",

    "story": [
      "The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled that Ohio's product liability law prohibits counties from bringing public-nuisance claims against national pharmaceutical chains as they did as part of national opioid litigation",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The Ohio Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the state's product liability law prohibits counties from bringing public nuisance claims against national pharmaceutical chains as they did as part of national opioid litigation, a decision that could overturn a $650 million judgment against the pharmacies.",
      "An attorney for the counties called the decision \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "Justices were largely unanimous in their interpretation of an arcane disagreement over the state law, which had emerged in a lawsuit brought by Lake and Trumbull counties outside Cleveland against CVS, Walgreens and Walmart.",
      "The counties won their initial lawsuit \u2014 and were awarded $650 million in damages by a federal judge in 2022 \u2014 but the pharmacies had disputed the court's reading of the Ohio Product Liability Act, which they said protected them from such sanctions.",
      "In an opinion written by Justice Joseph Deters, the court found that Ohio state lawmakers intended the law to prevent \u201call common law product liability causes of action\" \u2014 even if they don't seek compensatory damages but merely \u201cequitable relief\u201d for the communities.",
      "\u201cThe plain language of the OPLA abrogates product-liability claims, including product-related public-nuisance claims seeking equitable relief,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are constrained to interpret the statute as written, not according to our own personal policy preferences.\u201d",
      "Two of the Republican-dominated court's Democratic justices disagreed on that one point, while concurring on the rest of the judgment.",
      "\u201cAny award to abate a public nuisance like the opioid epidemic would certainly be substantial in size and scope, given that the claimed nuisance is both long-lasting and widespread,\u201d Justice Melody Stewart wrote in an opinion joined by Justice Michael Donnelly. \u201cBut just because an abatement award is of substantial size and scope does not mean it transforms it into a compensatory-damages award.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the plaintiffs' co-liaison counsel in the national opioid litigation, Peter Weinberger, of the Cleveland-based law firm Spangenberg Shibley & Liber, lamented the decision.",
      "\u201cThis ruling will have a devastating impact on communities and their ability to police corporate misconduct,\" he said. \u201cWe have used public nuisance claims across the country to obtain nearly $60 billion in opioid settlements, including nearly $1 billion in Ohio alone, and the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s ruling undermines the very legal basis that drove this result.\u201d",
      "But Weinberger said Tuesday's ruling would not be the end, and that communities would continue to fight \u201cthrough other legal avenues.\u201d",
      "\"We remain steadfast in our commitment to holding all responsible parties to account as this litigation continues nationwide,\u201d he said.",
      "In his 2022 ruling, U.S. District Judge Dan Polster said that the money awarded to Lake and Trump counties would be used to the fight the opioid crisis. Attorneys at the time put the total price tag at $3.3 billion for the damage done.",
      "Lake County was to receive $306 million over 15 years. Trumbull County was to receive $344 million over the same period. Nearly $87 million was to be paid immediately to cover the first two years of payments.",
      "A jury returned a verdict in favor of the counties in November 2021, after a six-week trial. It was then left to the judge to decide how much the counties should receive. He heard testimony the next May to determine damages.",
      "The counties convinced the jury that the pharmacies played an outsized role in creating a public nuisance in the way they dispensed pain medication. It was the first time pharmacy companies completed a trial to defend themselves in a drug crisis that has killed a half-million Americans since 1999."

      "Judge Daniel Traynor of the U.S. District Court in North Dakota issued the order Monday from Bismarck, dealing a setback to a Biden administration rule that was estimated to allow 147,000 immigrants to enroll for coverage. Traynor's ruling came in a lawsuit filed over the policy and will remain in effect until the matter can go to trial.",
      "The ruling applies to immigrants in 19 states where Republican attorneys general sued to avoid having to comply with the new policy. They cited concern over immigrants possibly qualifying for public subsidies available to many people insured under the ACA.",
      "The GOP state officials argued that the rule created earlier this year by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would be a strong incentive for immigrants to remain in the U.S. illegally and could creating costs for states. They argued that both the Affordable Care Act and a 1996 law prohibit U.S. government benefits flowing to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\u201cDreamers\u201d are part of a program that makes them a low priority for deportation. However, President-elect Donald Trump won the Nov. 5 election promising \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d He will succeed President Joe Biden on Jan. 20.",
      "Traynor, a Trump appointee during his first term in office, concluded through what he called \u201ca common-sense inference\u201d that access to subsidized ACA coverage is a powerful incentive for people to remain in the U.S. illegally, creating a substantial risk that states will \u201csuffer monetary harm.\u201d",

      "CMS said in a statement Tuesday that it is reviewing the lawsuit but does not comment on litigation.",
      "Nicholas Esp\u00edritu, deputy legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, said some \u201cDreamers\u201d have been waiting for more than a decade to get \u201clife-sustaining\u201d health coverage through the ACA.",
      "\u201cJudge Traynor\u2019s ruling is both disappointing and wrong on the law,\u201d Esp\u00edritu said, promising his group would continue to fight the issue.",
      "But Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach called the decision \u201ca victory for the rule of law.\" He told reporters after a hearing in Bismarck in October that the Biden administration sought to redefine what it means to be an immigrant living in the U.S. legally by \u201cexecutive fiat,\u201d calling the rule \u201cAlice in Wonderland stuff.\u201d",
      "North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley added then that American taxpayers, through Congress, determine how the federal government treats immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t always come across as friendly and nice and cuddly, but it speaks to the access to our health care system, the cost of our health care system, and the burden on the American public, the taxpayer,\u201d he said.",
      "Kansas and North Dakota are the lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed in August. They've been joined by Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.",

      "\u201cThis looks like every other set of dietary guidelines since 1980: eat your veggies and reduce consumption of foods high in salt, sugar and saturated fat,\u201d Nestle said in an email. \u201cThis particular statement says nothing about balancing calories, when overconsumption of calories, especially from ultra-processed foods, is the biggest challenge to the health of Americans.\u201d",
      "The nutrition panel concluded that a healthy diet for people aged 2 years and older is higher in vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fish and and vegetable oils that are higher in unsaturated fat.",
      "It is lower in red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, refined grains and saturated fat. It may also include fat-free or low-fat dairy and foods lower in sodium and may include plant-based foods.",
      "The panel, which met for nearly two years, was the first to focus on the dietary needs of Americans through what they called a \u201chealth equity lens,\u201d said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a Massachusetts General Hospital obesity expert who was part of the group. That meant considering factors such as household income, race, ethnicity and culture when recommending healthy diets. It will help ensure that the guidance \u201creflects and includes various population groups,\u201d she said in an email.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods include the snacks, sugary cereals and frozen meals that make up about 60% of the American diet.",
      "The panel considered more than 40 studies, including several that showed links between ultraprocessed foods and becoming overweight or developing obesity. But the nutrition experts had concerns with the quality of the research, leaving them to conclude that the evidence was too limited to make recommendations.",
      "That decision is likely to bump up against the views of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the nominee to lead the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, who has questioned potential conflicts of interest among members of the dietary guidelines panel and vowed to crack down on ultraprocessed foods that contribute to chronic disease.",
      "The panel also didn't revise recommendations that suggest limiting alcohol intake to two drinks or less a day for men and one drink or less a day for women.",
      "In 2020, the last time the guidance was updated, the government rejected the advice of scientific advisers to recommend less alcohol consumption.",
      "Two groups \u2014 the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine and a committee of the government agency that oversees substance abuse \u2014 are expected to release reports in the coming months on the effects of moderate alcohol use to inform the guidelines.",
      "The advisory panel acknowledged that the diets of most Americans don't meet the current guidelines. More than half of all U.S. adults have one or more diet-related chronic health conditions and 18 million U.S. households have insecure sources of food, according to the report.",
      "\u201cNutrition-related chronic health conditions and their precursors continue to threaten health through the lifespan,\" the report concludes. \u201cWhich does not bode well for the future of health in the United States.\u201d",
      "The scientific report informs the dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years. Tuesday\u2019s recommendations now go to HHS and the Agriculture Department, where officials will draft the final guidance set for release next year.",
      "Starting Wednesday, the public will have 60 days to comment on the guidance. HHS and USDA officials will hold a public meeting Jan. 16 to discuss the recommendations.",
      "The new guidance, which will be finalized by the incoming Trump administration, is consistent with decades of federal efforts to reduce diet-related disease in the U.S., said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "\u201cBroadly, I think these are well-formulated recommendations that the incoming administration would do well to adopt,\u201d Lurie said.",

      "Cases of dengue have been surging globally as warmer weather brought on by climate change enables mosquitoes to expand their reach.",
      "The Pan American Health Organization \u2014the regional office of the World Health Organization in the Americas \u2014 said deaths from dengue are also rising.",
      "More than 7,700 deaths have been reported in the Caribbean and the Americas so far in 2024, a more than 200% increase, compared to 2,467 deaths in 2023, according to the organization.",
      "The number of cases in the region, which includes the United States, is the highest reported since record keeping began in 1980, PAHO director Jarbas Barbosa said at a news conference.",
      "\u201cThis is linked directly to climatic events,\u201d he said, referencing warmer temperatures, droughts and flooding. A fast population growth, unplanned urbanization and poor sanitation have contributed to the rise in dengue.",
      "The virus has surged worldwide since last year and spread to areas previously free of dengue, according to PAHO.",
      "Brazil is reporting the highest number of dengue cases with more than 10 million, followed by Argentina, with more than 580,000, and Mexico with more than half a million.",
      "In the Caribbean, Guyana is leading with more than 41,000 cases, followed by French Guiana, the Dominican Republic and Martinique.",
      "Meanwhile, local dengue transmission has been reported in California, Florida and Texas this year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "There are four types of dengue virus, simply known as 1, 2, 3 and 4. Having one type of virus doesn't provide immunity from others.",
      "For the first time in a decade, dengue serotype 3 has predominated in Mexico, Central America and parts of the Caribbean in the second half of the year, according to Thais dos Santos, PAHO\u2019s advisor on arboviral diseases.",
      "Many infected people don\u2019t get sick, but some experience headache, fever and flu-like symptoms. Severe cases can cause serious bleeding, shock and death. Repeated infections can be especially dangerous.",
      "Dengue cases usually surge during the wet season, but by late March, Puerto Rico already had declared an epidemic, with officials warning last month that it cannot be controlled unless residents cooperate. The U.S. territory has reported more than 4,900 cases and at least nine deaths so far this year. Victims include a 17-year-old girl and a 31-year-old woman.",
      "The cases in Puerto Rico nearly quadrupled from last year, according to government data.",
      "Lydia Plat\u00f3n, a 55-year-old English professor at the University of Puerto Rico, got dengue in October. \u201cYou have fever all the time. You have horrible chills,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that my energy has returned yet.\u201d",
      "Her neighborhood reported five cases in six weeks, which she blames on heavy rains at the time and stagnant and accumulated water. One of the cases was her 17-year-old daughter. Plat\u00f3n said she now lights incense and sprays herself with repellant every afternoon.",
      "Puerto Rico officials are urging people to get rid of stagnant water where mosquitoes lay eggs. The government in Trinidad and Tobago has started issuing fines to people whose properties have become breeding sites for mosquitoes.",
      "This year, more than one-third of cases in Costa Rica, Mexico and Paraguay have been reported in children younger than 15, with Guatemala reporting a high number of child deaths, Barbosa said.",
      "Vaccines against dengue have been introduced in Peru, Brazil and Argentina, with Honduras slated to receive them next year, but they\u2019re meant mostly for children and are most effective in those already infected with dengue once, dos Santos said.",
      "She noted that supplies are limited and that vaccines are not expected to have a big impact on transmission. She stressed that preventive measures remain crucial.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s no mosquito, there\u2019s no dengue,\u201d she said."

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- The federal government has sued South Carolina, saying the state has not done enough to make sure people with serious mental illnesses are taken out of group homes and helped to get back into the community where they can work and lead independent lives.",
      "The lawsuit filed Monday said the state violates the Americans with Disabilities Act by opting, through money and policy decisions, to leave people with mental illnesses in group homes where they can't choose what to eat, pick their own roommate, find a way to work at a job or go to church and other activities.",
      "The state has known about the issues since a different 2016 lawsuit and federal officials warned them of the problems and possible legal action in a 23-page report in May 2023, U.S. Justice Department lawyers said in court papers.",
      "\u201cPeople with disabilities in South Carolina can and must be able to receive services in their own homes, rather than being isolated in institutions,\u201d Kristen Clarke, an assistant attorney in the agency's Civil Rights Division, said in a statement.",
      "While Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster questioned the timing of the lawsuit, coming in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden's administration, he is working on solutions to the problems brought up in the suit, spokesman Brandon Charochak said in a statement.",
      "One idea is to combine the state Department of Mental Health and the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs and put the new agency in the governor's cabinet under his supervision.",
      "\u201cThe fact remains that our state\u2019s healthcare delivery system is fractured with non-cabinet agencies that are unaccountable and inefficient. The governor believes the time to change this is now,\u201d Charochak said.",
      "Federal officials suggested spending more money and making sure the state's Medicaid program makes adequate payments for programs called assertive community treatments.",
      "Under the prgrams, teams visit people with serious mental illnesses in their home. There is at least one psychiatrist, two psychiatric nurses, specialists in employment and substance abuse, and other professionals.",
      "Research has found the teams often can head off a mental health crisis. They also can provide crisis teams that can respond quickly to prevent bigger issues, from police involvement to psychiatric hospital stays, the Justice Department investigation found.",
      "There are only four teams in South Carolina \u2014 in Columbia, Greenville and Dillon \u2014 and they don't provide statewide coverage. They also have low staffing.",
      "Currently, about 1,000 people live in group homes. A large number of them told federal investigators they wanted to live on their own, but ran into problems.",
      "Federal officials spent months investigating what are officially called community residential care facilities, talking to residents, administrators and people who provide treatment outside the homes for those with mental illnesses who are living independently.",
      "The identities of those who spoke were kept anonymous for their privacy, including one group home resident who pointed out the living conditions weren\u2019t much different than decades ago when people with mental illness were housed in giant centers with no private rooms and little individualized care.",
      "Residents of the group home often only get to leave for a monthly outing to Walmart or Dollar General. They have no way of working because they can\u2019t get transportation to a job. Sometimes the home is fenced in with locked doors and security cameras.",
      "\u201cSomething like a little asylum in here,\u201d the resident told investigators.",
      "The homes are required by law to post calendars with activities. Investigators found almost all of them were events inside the home like arts and crafts, \u201cname that tune,\u201d Bible study, bingo, \u201cbubble-blowing fun\u201d and coloring pages, federal officials told the state.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no vision of ever getting out. There\u2019s no vision of having a real life. \u2026 There\u2019s no vision of anything. They just feel stuck. That\u2019s almost like hospitals used to be, 150 years ago,\u201d a state employee who regularly visits one home told investigators.",
      "The report cited the case of a 40-year-old man who lived independently for three years when a break-in at his apartment caused a mental health crisis that led to several months in a psychiatric hospital. He was released to a group home, where he has lived for 11 years. He told investigators he wants to live independently but has been offered no help.",
      "A 43-year-old woman told investigators she had a mental crisis in 2020 and went to a group home because her parents thought it would help her rebuild her independence. Now the parents are trying to get her out because she got no help for living skills.",
      "Others had a financial crisis that coincided with a mental crisis and need help with affordable housing or job skills."

    "story": [
      "Authorities in Mexico say a total of 17 children have died in central Mexico from suspected contamination of IV feeding bags, after four more deaths were confirmed",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Authorities in Mexico said Tuesday that a total of 17 children have died in central Mexico from suspected contamination of IV feeding bags after four more deaths were confirmed.",
      "David Kershenobich, the country\u2019s public health secretary, said 16 of the victims were underweight, premature babies being treated at hospitals; the other victim was 14 years old.",
      "He said that two bacteria, including a multidrug-resistant bug, were suspected in the deaths.",
      "Investigators say the bacterial contamination apparently happened at a plant in the city of Toluca that manufactured the IV nutrition mixture, and that the company had been temporarily shut down and use of the product had been halted.",
      "The first infections were reported starting Nov. 22 and the last was identified on Dec. 3. Around 20 other patients had been sickened by the infection and were being treated for it.",
      "All 13 of the first deaths occurred at three government hospitals and one private one in the State of Mexico, on the outskirts of Mexico City.",
      "Kershenobich said he did not expect any other deaths, but noted authorities had \u201cdetected other possible outbreaks with similar characteristics in Mexico State, which are under investigation.\u201d",
      "Three more deaths were found to have occurred in the neighboring state of Michoacan and one in the north-central state of Guanajuato. Authorities said the same bacteria, and the same IV bags, were implicated in all the deaths.",
      "Earlier, the federal Public Health Department ordered doctors across the country not to use IV nutrition bags made by the company Productos Hospitalarios S.A de C.V., though the exact source of the infections is still under investigation. Phone calls to numbers listed for the company and emails seeking comment went unanswered.",
      "The outbreak appeared to involve Klebsiella oxytoca, a multidrug-resistant bacteria, and enterobacter cloacae, which caused blood infections in the babies.",
      "It was the latest public blow to Mexico\u2019s tottering, underfunded healthcare system. Last month, the director of the country\u2019s flagship national cardiology institute said the hospital didn\u2019t have money to buy essential supplies, calling the situation \u201ccritical.\u201d",
      "Dr. Jorge Gaspar, the hospital\u2019s director, wrote an internal letter saying that budget cuts \u201chave affected the acquisition of supplies necessary for the institution\u2019s functioning.\u201d In a subsequent public letter the next day, he clarified that the initial message was intended for an \u201cinternal\u201d audience and assured the public that \u201cwe are working to solve the situation.\u201d",
      "Mexico has been plagued by contaminated medical supply scandals for years.",
      "In 2023, authorities arrested an anesthesiologist they blamed for an outbreak of meningitis that killed 35 patients and sickened 79.",
      "The doctor, whose name was withheld, apparently carried his own morphine from one private hospital to another, spreading a fungal infection that contaminated the medication at the first clinic, authorities said.",
      "The drug may not have been stored properly. Some smaller hospitals or maternity clinics in Mexico don\u2019t have their own dispensing pharmacies or are not authorized to handle controlled medications like opiates, and thus long relied on anesthesiologists to bring their own.",
      "In 2020, 14 people died after a hospital run by Mexico\u2019s state-owned oil company gave a drug to dialysis patients that was contaminated with bacteria. More than 69 patients were sickened in that outbreak.",
      "Former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office on Sept. 30, frequently complained that drug supply companies were charging too much, and so he essentially revamped the whole medical purchasing system, pledging to provide Mexicans healthcare that is \u201cbetter than in Denmark.\u201d",
      "However, the new system of government-run warehouses has foundered, plagued by chronic shortages of supplies and drugs, while a gargantuan government supply depot L\u00f3pez Obrador set up and called the \u201cmega drug store\u201d now sits largely empty.",

      "A U.S. health panel says women should have the option of taking their own test samples for cervical cancer screening",
      "Women should have the option of taking their own test samples for cervical cancer screening, an influential health panel said Tuesday.",
      "Draft recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force are aimed at getting more people screened and spreading the word that women can take their own vaginal samples to check for cancer-causing HPV.",
      "Women in their 20s should still get a Pap test every three years. But after that \u2014 from age 30 to 65 \u2014 women can get an HPV test every five years, the panel said.",
      "And those HPV tests can be done with samples collected either by a doctor or by the patient herself in a mobile clinic or medical office. Women ages 30 to 65 can still opt for a Pap test done by a doctor every three years, or a Pap plus an HPV test every five years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very hopeful that self-collection will help even more women get screened and help us reduce even further the burden of cervical cancer among women,\u201d said task force vice chair Dr. John Wong of Tufts University School of Medicine.",
      "Earlier this year, U.S. regulators expanded the use of two HPV test kits to include self-collection. Studies show women and doctors take samples with similar accuracy.",
      "For now, the tests are only for use in health care settings; home testing may be on the horizon.",
      "HPV, or human papillomavirus, is very common and is spread through sex. Most HPV infections clear up on their own, but persistent infection can lead to cancer of the cervix. Most cervical cancers occur in women who are inadequately screened, diagnosed or treated.",
      "To collect a sample, a swab or brush from the kit is inserted into the vagina and rotated. It is put in a tube and processed at a lab.",
      "The HPV tests detect high-risk types of the virus. In contrast, a Pap test looks for abnormal cells in the cervix.",
      "Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden already use self-collection for cervical cancer screening.",
      "Deaths from cervical cancers have declined in the U.S. in the past decade, and there is an HPV vaccine recommended for preteens that is preventing cancer in women and men. Still, nearly 14,000 new cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed in the U.S. this year and there were an estimated 4,360 deaths.",
      "Black women, Native American women and Hispanic women still have higher death rates compared to white women. Women living in isolated areas also have higher than average death rates.",
      "For many women, transgender men and nonbinary people, collecting their own sample could be more comfortable than the stirrups and speculum used by a doctor.",
      "The draft advice remains largely the same as the group's previous recommendations from 2018. For example, women younger than 21 don't need to be screened for cervical cancer. Neither do women older than 65 who've had regular screenings with normal results. And women of any age who've had a total hysterectomy don't need to be screened.",
      "The recommendations are open for comment through Jan. 13.",

      "A federal appeals court is expected to hear arguments over whether Idaho should be prohibited from enforcing a strict abortion ban during medical emergencies when a pregnant patient\u2019s life or health is at risk",
      "PASADENA, Calif. -- A federal appeals court is expected to hear arguments Tuesday afternoon over whether Idaho should be prohibited from enforcing a strict abortion ban during medical emergencies when a pregnant patient's life or health is at risk.",
      "The state law makes it a felony to perform an abortion unless the procedure is necessary to prevent the death of the patient. President Biden\u2019s administration sued Idaho two years ago, contending the law violates a federal rule called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, because it prevents doctors from performing abortions that save their patients from serious infections, organ loss or other major medical issues.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case earlier this year, but bounced it back to the lower court on a procedural issue, leaving unanswered questions about the legality of the state abortion ban.",
      "Dr. Jessica Evans-Wall, an emergency room physician in Boise, Idaho, hopes the 9th Circuit ruling will provide some clarity for her and other Idaho physicians.",
      "\u201cFor a lot of us in emergency care, it's not just about reproductive health or those rare but really important life-threatening situations when someone would need an emergency abortion. It's about EMTALA as a whole,\u201d Evans-Wall said Tuesday morning. The federal law was created to ensure that hospitals couldn't refuse to treat emergency patients just because they are uninsured or for other reasons, she noted.",
      "\u201cThat feels really precious and important in emergency situations, because we want to take care of anyone who walks through the door, for any reason, at any time,\u201d Evans-Wall said. \u201cIf we say the state law overrides the EMTALA statute, what does that do for the strength of EMTALA protections moving forward?\u201d",
      "Idaho officials have argued in court filings that the state abortion ban doesn\u2019t violate EMTALA. Instead, they say the fetus or embryo should be considered a patient with protections under EMTALA as well. They also argue that doctors have enough wiggle room under the law to use their best judgment about when to treat pregnant people with life-threatening medical conditions.",
      "\u201cTaking EMTALA for what it actually says, there is no direct conflict with Idaho\u2019s Defense of Life Act,\u201d attorneys representing the Idaho Legislature wrote in court filings earlier this month. \u201cNothing in EMTALA requires physicians to violate state law. And nothing in Idaho law \u2014 whether in EMTALA-covered circumstances or beyond \u2014 denies medical care to pregnant women.\u201d",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening complications during pregnancy each year. Those complications can include major blood loss, sepsis, or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "\u201cWe're only involved when there's an emergency, when a patient's life or health is affected,\u201d said Evans-Wall. \u201cI think it sometimes comes across like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re choosing the pregnant person over the pregnancy,' but the truth is if that pregnant person is having serious complications where their life or health is at risk then the viability of that pregnancy is not there. It's not a choice that we're making saying we're going to prioritize the pregnant person over that pregnancy. Because of the medical circumstances, that choice has already been made.\u201d",
      "Still, some state abortion bans have made medical decisions that once seemed clear feel particularly fraught for emergency room physicians. Complaints that pregnant patients were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.",
      "\u201cThese harms are not hypothetical,\u201d Idaho's largest hospital system, St. Luke's Health System, wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief in October. \u201cIn all of 2023, before Idaho's law went into effect, only one pregnant patient presenting to St. Luke\u2019s with a medical emergency was airlifted out of state for care. Yet in the few months when Idaho\u2019s new abortion law was in effect, six pregnant St. Luke\u2019s patients with medical emergencies were transferred out of state for termination of their pregnancy.\u201d",
      "One of those patients had severe preeclampsia \u2014 a condition that causes dangerously high blood pressure that can be fatal if untreated \u2014 and the others had premature rupture of their membranes, putting them at risk of life-threatening infections, St. Luke's said.",
      "\u201cThe stakes could not be higher,\u201d ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project Deputy Director Alexa Kolbi-Molinas said Monday. She noted recent news reports in Texas about women who died after being denied appropriate treatments for incomplete miscarriages. \u201cThe reality is, exceptions don't work. They don't actually protect the health and rights of pregnant people regardless of what is written on the page, and that is just the reality when you threaten physicians with criminal penalties.\u201d",

      "California lawmakers will consider a bill to require labels on social media platforms warning of their effects on young people\u2019s lives",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California, home to some of the largest technology companies in the world, would be the first U.S. state to require mental health warning labels on social media sites if lawmakers pass a bill introduced Monday.",
      "The legislation sponsored by state Attorney General Rob Bonta is necessary to bolster safety for children online, supporters say, but industry officials vow to fight the measure and others like it under the First Amendment. Warning labels for social media gained swift bipartisan support from dozens of attorneys general, including Bonta, after U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to establish the requirements earlier this year, saying social media is a contributing factor in the mental health crisis among young people.",
      "\u201cThese companies know the harmful impact their products can have on our children, and they refuse to take meaningful steps to make them safer,\u201d Bonta said at a news conference Monday. \u201cTime is up. It\u2019s time we stepped in and demanded change.\u201d",
      "State officials haven't provided details on the bill, but Bonta said the warning labels could pop up once weekly.",
      "Up to 95% of youth ages 13 to 17 say they use a social media platform, and more than a third say that they use social media \u201calmost constantly,\u201d according to 2022 data from the Pew Research Center. Parents\u2019 concerns prompted Australia to pass the world\u2019s first law banning social media for children under 16 in November.",
      "\u201cThe promise of social media, although real, has turned into a situation where they\u2019re turning our children\u2019s attention into a commodity,\u201d Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, who authored the California bill, said Monday. \u201cThe attention economy is using our children and their well-being to make money for these California companies.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers instead should focus on online safety education and mental health resources, not warning label bills that are \u201cconstitutionally unsound,\u201d said Todd O\u2019Boyle, a vice president of the tech industry policy group Chamber of Progress.",
      "\u201cWe strongly suspect that the courts will set them aside as compelled speech,\u201d O\u2019Boyle told The Associated Press.",
      "Victoria Hinks' 16-year-old daughter, Alexandra, died by suicide four months ago after being \u201cled down dark rabbit holes\u201d on social media that glamorized eating disorders and self-harm. Hinks said the labels would help protect children from companies that turn a blind eye to the harm caused to children\u2019s mental health when they become addicted to social media platforms.",
      "\u201cThere's not a bone in my body that doubts social media played a role in leading her to that final, irreversible decision,\u201d Hinks said. \u201cThis could be your story.\"",
      "Common Sense Media, a sponsor of the bill, said it plans to lobby for similar proposals in other states.",
      "California in the past decade has positioned itself as a leader in regulating and fighting the tech industry to bolster online safety for children.",
      "The state was the first in 2022 to bar online platforms from using users\u2019 personal information in ways that could harm children. It was one of the states that sued Meta in 2023 and TikTok in October for deliberately designing addictive features that keep kids hooked on their platforms.",

Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, also signed several bills in September to help curb the effects of social media on children, including one to prohibit social media platforms from knowingly providing addictive feeds to children without parental consent and one to limit or ban students from using smartphones on school campus.",

      "As Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet begins to take shape, the nominees offer a preview of how his administration might handle abortion after he repeatedly flip-flopped on the issue on the campaign trail",
      "CHICAGO -- As Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet begins to take shape, those on both sides of the abortion debate are watching closely for clues about how his picks might affect reproductive rights policy in the president-elect\u2019s second term.",
      "Trump\u2019s cabinet picks offer a preview of how his administration could handle abortion after he repeatedly flip-flopped on the issue on the campaign trail. He attempted to distance himself from anti-abortion allies by deferring to states on abortion policy, even while boasting about nominating three Supreme Court justices who helped strike down the constitutional protections for abortion that had stood for half a century.",
      "In an NBC News interview that aired Sunday, Trump said he doesn't plan to restrict medication abortion but also seemed to leave the door open, saying \u201cthings change.\u201d",
      "\u201cThings do change, but I don't think it's going to change at all,\u201d he said.",
      "The early lineup of his new administration, including nominations to lead health agencies, the Justice Department and event the Department of Veterans Affairs, has garnered mixed \u2014 but generally positive \u2014 reactions from anti-abortion groups.",
      "Abortion law experts said Trump's decision to include fewer candidates with deep ties to the anti-abortion movement could indicate that abortion will not be a priority for Trump's administration.",
      "\u201cIt almost seems to suggest that President Trump might be focusing his administration in other directions,\" said Greer Donley, an associate law professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.",
      "Karen Stone, vice president of public policy at Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said while many of the nominees have \u201cextensive records against reproductive health care,\u201d some do not. She cautioned against making assumptions based on Trump's initial cabinet selections.",
      "Still, many abortion rights groups are wary, in part because many of the nominees hold strong anti-abortion views even if they do not have direct ties to anti-abortion activists. They're concerned that an administration filled with top-level officials who are personally opposed to abortion could take steps to restrict access to the procedure and funding.",
      "After Trump\u2019s ambiguity about abortion during his campaign, \"there\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about what policy is going to look like,\" said Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law. That approach may be revealed as the staffs within key departments are announced.",
      "Trump announced he would nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Health and Human Services Department, which anti-abortion forces have long targeted as central to curtailing abortion rights nationwide. Yet Kennedy shifted on the issue during his own presidential campaign.",
      "In campaign videos, Kennedy said he supports abortion access until viability, which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks, although there is no defined timeframe. But he also said \u201cevery abortion is a tragedy\u201d and argued for a national ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a stance he quickly walked back.",
      "The head of Health and Human Services oversees Title X funding for a host of family planning services and has sweeping authority over agencies that directly affect abortion access, including the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The role is especially vital amid legal battles over a federal law known as EMTALA, which President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has argued requires emergency abortion access nationwide, and FDA approval of the abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "Mini Timmaraju, president of the national abortion rights organization Reproductive Freedom for All, called Kennedy an \u201cunfit, unqualified extremist who cannot be trusted to protect the health, safety and reproductive freedom of American families.\u201d",
      "His potential nomination also has caused waves in the anti-abortion movement. Former Vice President Mike Pence, a staunch abortion opponent, urged the Senate to reject Kennedy\u2019s nomination. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the national anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said the group had its own concerns about Kennedy.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no question that we need a pro-life HHS secretary,\" she said.",
      "Fox News correspondent Marty Makary is Trump\u2019s pick to lead the FDA, which plays a critical role in access to medication abortion and contraception. Abortion rights groups have accused him of sharing misinformation about abortion on air.",
      "Russell Vought, a staunch anti-abortion conservative, has been nominated for director of the Office of Management and Budget. Vought was a key architect of Project 2025, a right-wing blueprint for running the federal government. Among other actions to limit reproductive rights, it calls for eliminating access to medication abortion nationwide, cutting Medicaid funding for abortion and restricting access to contraceptive care, especially long-acting reversible contraceptives such as IUD\u2019s.",
      "Despite distancing himself from the conservative manifesto on the campaign trail, Trump is stocking his administration with people who played central roles in developing Project 2025.",
      "Trump acknowledged that drafters of the report would be part of his incoming administration during the Sunday interview with NBC News, saying \u201cMany of those things I happen to agree with.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese cabinet appointments all confirm that Project 2025 was in fact the blueprint all along, and the alarm we saw about it was warranted,\u201d said Amy Williams Navarro, director of government relations for Reproductive Freedom for All.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, is a former television talk show host who has been accused of hawking dubious medical treatments and products. He voiced contradictory abortion views during his failed Senate run in 2022.",
      "Oz has described himself as \u201cstrongly pro-life, praised the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, claimed \u201clife starts at conception\u201d and referred to abortion as \u201cmurder.\u201d But he also has echoed Trump\u2019s states-rights approach, arguing the federal government should not be involved in abortion decisions.",
      "\u201cI want women, doctors, local political leaders, letting the democracy that\u2019s always allowed our nation to thrive to put the best ideas forward so states can decide for themselves,\u201d he said during a Senate debate two years ago.",
      "An array of reproductive rights groups opposed his Senate run. As CMS administrator, Oz would be in a key position to determine Medicaid coverage for family planning services and investigate potential EMTALA violations.",
      "As Florida\u2019s attorney general, Pam Bondi defended abortion restrictions, including a 24-hour waiting period. Now she\u2019s Trump\u2019s choice for attorney general.",
      "Her nomination is being celebrated by abortion opponents but denounced by abortion rights groups concerned she may revive the Comstock Act, an anti-vice law passed by Congress in 1873 that, among other things, bans mailing of medication or instruments used in abortion.",
      "An anti-abortion and anti-vaccine former Florida congressman, David Weldon, has been chosen to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which collects and monitors abortion data across the country.",
      "Former Republican congressman Doug Collins is Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs amid a political battle over abortion access and funding for troops and veterans. Collins voted consistently to restrict funding and access to abortion and celebrated the overturning of Roe v. Wade.",
      "\u201cThis is a team that the pro-life movement can work with,\" said Kristin Hawkins, president of the national anti-abortion organization Students for Life.",

      "Freddie Leatherbury hasn\u2019t spoken to Mangione since they graduated in 2016 from Gilman School in Maryland. He said Mangione was a smart, friendly and athletic student who came from a wealthy family, even by the private school\u2019s standards.",

      "\u201cOur family is shocked and devastated by Luigi\u2019s arrest,\u201d Mangione's family said in a statement posted on social media late Monday by his cousin, Maryland lawmaker Nino Mangione. \u201cWe offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved.\"",
      "Mangione was arraigned and ordered held without bail during a brief court hearing. Asked if he needed a public defender, he asked if he could \u201canswer that at a future date.\u201d He eventually will be extradited to New York to face charges in connection with Thompson\u2019s death, Kenny said.",
      "Police found a three-page document with writings suggesting that Mangione had \u201cill will toward corporate America,\u201d Kenny said.",
      "The handwritten document \u201cspeaks to both his motivation and mindset,\u201d Tisch said.",
      "A law enforcement official who wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity said the document included a line in which Mangione claimed to have acted alone.",
      "\u201cTo the Feds, I\u2019ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn\u2019t working with anyone,\u201d the document said, according to the official.",
      "It also had a line that said, \u201cI do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming.\u201d",
      "Mangione also had a passport and $10,000 in cash \u2014 $2,000 of it in foreign currency, authorities said. Mangione, who said Hawaii was his most recent address, disputed the amount.",
      "Thompson, 50, was killed last Wednesday as he walked alone to a hotel, where UnitedHealthcare\u2019s parent company, UnitedHealth Group, was holding its annual investor conference, police said.",
      "UnitedHealth Group thanked law enforcement in a statement. \u201cOur hope is that today\u2019s apprehension brings some relief to Brian\u2019s family, friends, colleagues and the many others affected by this unspeakable tragedy,\u201d a company spokesperson said.",
      "The shooting shook U.S. businesses and the health insurance industry in particular, causing companies to rethink security plans and delete photos of executives from their websites.",
      "Mangione attended an elite Baltimore prep school, graduating as valedictorian in 2016, according to the school\u2019s website. He went on to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer science in 2020 from the University of Pennsylvania, a school spokesperson said.",
      "One of his cousins is a Maryland state legislator and his family bought a country club north of Baltimore in the 1980s. On Monday, police blocked off an entrance to the property, which public records link to the suspect's parents. A swarm of reporters and photographers gathered outside.",
      "Mangione went from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh after the shooting, and likely \u201cwas in a variety of locations across the state,\u201d said Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police said.",
      "\u201cBased on everything we have seen, he was very careful with trying to stay low profile, avoid cameras \u2014 not all that successfully in some cases, but that was certainly the effort he was making,\u201d Bivens said.",
      "In the days since the shooting, police turned to the public for help by releasing a collection of nine photos and video \u2014 including footage of the attack, as well as images of the suspect at a Starbucks beforehand.",
      "Photos taken in the lobby of a hostel on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side showed the suspect grinning after removing his mask, police said.",
      "On Monday, police credited news outlets for disseminating the images and the tipster for recognizing the suspect and calling authorities.",
      "Investigators earlier suggested the gunman may have been a disgruntled employee or client of the insurer. Ammunition found near Thompson\u2019s body bore the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d mimicking a phrase used by insurance industry critics.",
      "The gunman concealed his identity with a mask during the shooting yet left a trail of evidence, including a backpack he ditched in Central Park, a cellphone found in a pedestrian plaza and a water bottle and protein bar wrapper that police say he bought at Starbucks minutes before the attack.",
      "On Friday, police said the killer had left the city soon after the shooting. Retracing the gunman\u2019s steps using surveillance video, investigators say the shooter rode into Central Park on a bicycle and emerged from the park without his backpack. He made his way to a bus station that offers commuter service to New Jersey and routes to the East Coast, police said.",

      "Winter is a great time to experiment with new food preparations and flavors to keep your meals nutritious and interesting",
      "Winter is settling in across much of the U.S., erasing the freshness and vibrancy of months past.",
      "But the chilly season doesn't have to usher in weeks of lifeless, colorless dinner plates.",
      "Dieticians and food experts say winter is a great time to experiment with your food, try out underappreciated seasonal produce and cook a healthy meal for loved ones.",
      "\u201cEmbrace the cold, embrace the winter and appreciate the bounty,\u201d said Kristen Rasmussen, a culinary dietician and chef who teaches at the University of California Berkeley.",
      "Here are tips from nutrition experts on how to \u201cwinterize\u201d your meals.",
      "Only 1 in 10 Americans eat the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables each day, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows.",
      "Staple fruits and vegetables are generally available year-around in the grocery store, but it's also peak season for certain types of produce.",
      "Citrus fruits are among those fresh in winter \u2014 lemons, limes, oranges and more. When it comes to root vegetables, pull sweet potatoes and pumpkin out of Thanksgiving deserts and into savory meals and snacks. Try out parsnips, beets and radishes, too.",
      "And don't forget those winter greens: Rasmussen recommends including more members of the chicory family like radicchio, escarole and endive. (These can be on the bitter side, so they might be an acquired taste.) You can also test out different types of kale and the leafy tops of root vegetables, like radish greens.",
      "If fresh options are limited, experts say canned and frozen fruits and vegetables still have a lot of nutritional value, as long as you don't overcook them. Also make sure they don't have a lot of added salt or fat.",
      "Dried fruits \u2014 think apricots, dates and raisins \u2014 and nuts are also great to bring into salads, bakes and more.",
      "\u201cWithout a doubt, there's a lot of nutritional benefit, even in dried (fruits),\u201d said Linda Van Horn, a clinical nutrition epidemiologist at Northwestern University.",
      "Soups, stews and porridges span history and cultures. They are a great way to build out a well-rounded meal. They're also easily adaptable to any flavor palate, easy to make and great to freeze.",
      "Plus, you can throw just about anything in them.",
      "\u201cThe benefit of it is that it's all contained,\u201d Van Horn said, noting nutrients that leak out of the ingredients while cooking stay in the broth.",
      "These cozy meals are also a great way to try out different beans and legumes, which Rasmussen called a \u201cnutritional powerhouse.\u201d They're also affordable, accessible and an excellent source of plant-protein and fiber said Alicia Henson, a pediatric clinical dietician at the University of California San Francisco's Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital.",
      "Meanwhile, porridges \u2014 at breakfast and beyond \u2014 are a great way to try out different grains and lend themselves as a base to any cultural flavor, from congee to atole to overnight oats.",
      "\u201cYou can make it savory or sweet, you can put leftovers on top, lemon or salsa macha, chili oil or an egg,\" Rasmussen said. \"There's so much versatility.\u201d",
      "When it comes to flavor, let rosemary, thyme, nutmeg and star anise shine all winter \u2014 not just for a holiday meal.",
      "Spices and herbs are a great source of flavor and nutrition. For example, turmeric is known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits. Some spices have more research on them than others, Rasmussen said. But they're worth still worth experimenting with in meals, experts agreed.",
      "Liven up snacks and drinks with spices, from smoky chilies to so-called \u201cwarming\u201d spices \u2014 cloves, ginger and cumin.",
      "Adding aromatic spices to teas can be great in the winter, whether you're grating your own ginger into the cup or popping in a tea bag, said Susan Aaronson, director of dietetics education at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health. Spices are also great to add to plain popcorn and other snacks \u2014 and a way to avoid extra salt and fats that often come in pre-made options.",
      "Winter can be particularly isolating for some people, so eat seasonally with friends and family beyond the holidays.",
      "Eating things that are in season can help people connect with the sources of their food and the environment, as well as learn about other cultures and take pride in their own, experts said.",
      "For nearly a decade, Aaronson and some friends meet for a \u201csoup group,\u201d where they share and eat \u201cexperimental\u201d soups they've each made through the fall and winter.",
      "\u201cIt's just a fun way to socialize and try new things,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "People with substance use disorder are not getting a direct say on how most opioid settlement money is used",
      "People with substance use disorder across the country are not getting a formal say in how most of the approximately $50 billion in opioid lawsuit settlement money is being used to stem the crisis, a new analysis found.",
      "Some advocates say that is one factor in why portions of the money are going to efforts they don't consider to be proven ways to save lives from overdose, including equipment to scan jail inmates for contraband, drug-sniffing police dogs and systems to neutralize unneeded prescription medications.",
      "In Jackson County, West Virginia, officials voted earlier this year to use more than $500,000 in settlement funds for a first-responder training center and a shooting range. They also allocated $35,000 to a quick response team that works with overdose survivors.",
      "Josh George, who has been in recovery for three years after 23 years of drug use, primarily heroin, now runs a recovery group with his wife and other family members.",
      "Some of the money could have gone to the county's only recovery house, he said.",
      "\u201cAll these people were doing it on their own dime,\" George said, \u201ctrying to help these people.\u201d",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers, pharmacy chains and other companies have agreed to settlements to resolve thousands of lawsuits filed by state, local and Native American tribal governments claiming the companies\u2019 practices contributed to the crisis.",
      "Opioids have been a major problem in the U.S. since the late 1990s, with the deadliest stretch earlier this decade reaching more than 80,000 annually. The major causes have shifted from prescription pills to heroin to fentanyl and other lab-produced substances often added to other illicit drugs.",
      "Funds from the multi-billion dollar nationwide settlements began rolling out in 2022 and will continue until at least 2038. The agreements require most of the money be used to fight the crisis but offer great flexibility in how to do it.",
      "Christine Minhee of Opioid Settlement Tracker and Vital Strategies, a public health organization, released a state-by-state guide on Monday outlining how government funding decisions are being made. The guide aims to help advocates know where to raise their voices.",
      "Using that information and other data, Minhee, who has tallied just under $50 billion in settlements excluding one with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma that the Supreme Court rejected, found advisory groups help determine spending of about half of it. But they have decision-making authority over less than one-fifth of it.",
      "Less than $1 in $7 is overseen by boards that reserve at least one seat for someone who is using or has used drugs, though some places where it's not required may have such members anyway.",
      "Brandon Marshall, a professor of epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health and a former member of the Rhode Island Opioid Settlement Advisory Committee, said he has observed that processes involving experts and people with drug use experience have made quick allocations to groups working on harm reduction and other areas because they know the groups.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a way to ensure that the funds are used effectively,\u201d he said. \u201cThose kinds of systems are also ensuring the funds are getting out the door faster.\u201d",
      "Public health advocates say the money should be used in ways proven to save lives, prevent drug use and focus on racial equity and that the decisions should be transparent.",
      "But many communities are following regular government spending practices rather than assessing local needs or consulting with experts or people impacted by the epidemic.",
      "Renville County, Minnesota, used $100,000 in settlement money to pay about two-thirds of the cost of a body scanner for the county jail to detect drugs on incoming inmates, even if they have swallowed bags of them.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly tell me that whoever made those decisions thinks that\u2019s the best use of the funding,\u201d said Alicia House, executive director of the Steve Rummler Hope Network, which provides overdose prevention and education across Minnesota.",
      "Renville County Sheriff Scott Hable said in an interview that keeping drugs out of the jail \u2014 without subjecting people entering to strip searches \u2014 fits with the facility\u2019s emphasis on treatment for inmates with substance use disorder.",
      "The scanner has been used nearly 1,400 times since last year, identifying contraband in six cases. Twice, it found packets of drugs inmates swallowed before entering, he said.",
      "The county\u2019s governing body made the spending decision. Sara Benson, the county\u2019s public health director, said the government is assembling an advisory group for future settlement use and wants to include people with lived experience.",
      "In West Virginia, Jackson County Commission President Dick Waybright said the training center will help law enforcement, EMS and 911 employees respond to the opioid crisis.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't just be throwing money to a program that wasn\u2019t going to last,\u201d he said in an interview. Besides, he said, no one else besides the quick response team requested funds from the first opioid settlement payment.",
      "George's mother, Kelly DeWees, said there are many needs in an area hit hard by addiction, including transportation for people in recovery, prevention education and counseling for children of those with substance use disorder. Breath of Life, the group her son and daughter-in-law run, could use help launching a recovery home.",
      "The group is requesting the $15,000 that currently remains in the county\u2019s fund and Waybright said he expects it to be awarded to them soon.",
      "For others, the spending decisions are even more personal.",
      "Tonia Ahern, a community coordinator for the National Center for Advocacy and Recovery, lost her son to an overdose when he was 29. She co-founded a group planning to produce a handbook of suggestions for New Jersey communities on how to use the funding.",
      "\u201cIf you haven\u2019t ever experienced it, you have no idea what they need,\u201d Ahern said."

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Vandals torched a car and sprayed graffiti with anti-Israel slogans on Wednesday in a Sydney suburb that is home to Australia's largest Jewish community. Officials condemned the attack as antisemitic.",
      "The incident in the eastern suburb of Woollahra came after federal police this week established a task force to investigate increasing antisemitic crimes across the country. Police said they are searching for two suspects, aged between 15 and 20, who were seen at the scene of the attack, wearing face masks, or balaclavas, and dark clothing.",
      "Police cordoned off the scene of the attack. It wasn't immediately known what the graffiti said.",
      "Last week's arson at a Melbourne synagogue marked an escalation in targeted attacks in Australia since the war began between Israel and the militant Hamas group started over a year ago in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Cars and buildings have previously been vandalized and torched across Australia in protests inspired by the war. This week, authorities declared the attack on Melbourne's Adass Israel Synagogue a terrorist attack, which increases the resources and information available to investigators.",
      "Also this week, federal police announced Special Operation Avalite to target those behind antisemitic attacks around the country \u2014 including the arson at the Melbourne synagogue, the attack on Jewish lawmaker Josh Burns\u2019 Melbourne office in June, and an attack last month on a car in Woollahra.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the Woollahra attack on Wednesday as an \u201coutrage\u201d and a \u201chate crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is another antisemitic attack and all Australians must condemn it,\u201d Albanese told Australian Broadcasting Corp. \u201cI stand with the Jewish community and unequivocally condemn this attack. There\u2019s no place for antisemitism in this country or anywhere else for that matter.\u201d",
      "He said he had been briefed by Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw on the attack and would soon be briefed by Special Operation Avalite officials, and rejected allegations the attack could be a criticism of Israel rather than Jews.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t an attack on a government, this is an attack on people because they happen to be Jewish,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThe idea that we take a conflict overseas and bring it here is something that is quite contrary to what Australia was built on.\u201d",
      "Government opponents argue that Albanese has been too slow to call out rising antisemitism for fear of alienating pro-Palestinian groups.",
      "Opposition Sen. Jane Hume said she knew a Jewish couple who were considering moving from Australia to Israel because they would feel safer there, despite the raging Mideast wars.",
      "\u201cBecause the government has prevaricated, because it has used weasel words and wishy-washy language, it does seem that those that are committing these offenses have been emboldened if not enabled by a government that has failed to take leadership,\u201d Hume said.",
      "The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish global human rights organization, issued a travel warning on Tuesday, urging Jews to \u201cexercise extreme caution\u201d in Australia as \u201ca result of the failure of Australian authorities to stand up against persistent demonization, harassment and violence against Jews and Jewish institutions in Australia.\u201d"

      "More towns and cities fell like dominoes in the following days, including Hama and Homs. Along the way, Assad\u2019s army melted away. Surrendered soldiers lined up for rebel-issued certificates of amnesty. Advancing rebel fighters passed army trucks and tanks abandoned on the side of the highway.",

Among the dead was a Syrian photographer, Anas Alkharboutli, who worked for Germany\u2019s DPA news agency. Friends mourned over his body, his press helmet and flak jacket laid on his chest.",
      "Overnight Saturday into early Sunday, the fighters marched unopposed into their greatest prize, the capital, Damascus. Assad and his family fled, ultimately taken in by his ally Russia.",
      "Assad's regime was deplored by many for its brutality and corruption. Insurgents and civilians celebrated his downfall by waltzing freely into his private residence and ransacking it.

A family posed in the palace\u2019s grandiose atrium lined with colored marble beneath a giant chandelier.",
      "Others streamed into the biggest symbol of Assad\u2019s police state, Saydnaya Prison, hoping to find relatives who had disappeared years or even decades earlier. One man held up nooses he found \u2014 a reminder of the mass executions that rights groups say killed thousands of inmates. Insurgents set fire to a military court building, where rights group say death sentences were churned out after perfunctory trials that often lasted just minutes.",
      "Some insurgents danced in the streets while others posed \u2014 cheering \u2014 on an army tank. Many waved the flag of the Syrian opposition, green, white and black with three red stars, instead of the Assad-era flag of red, white and black with two green stars.",
      "The insurgent takeover has pushed the country into the unknown. There is potential for more chaos with jihadi militants hoping to seize power and the possibility of conflicts between the many armed factions. But with the end of Assad\u2019s rule, it is a time for celebration."

      "The killings blamed on gang leader Micanor Alt\u00e8s, also known as Monel Felix and Wa Mikan\u00f2, were triggered by his son\u2019s illness and eventual death, according to the National Human Rights Defense Network and the Cooperative for Peace and Development.",
      "The two rights groups said Alt\u00e8s blamed Vodou religious leaders and older people in the community of practicing witchcraft and harming his son.",

      "He said his father, Marcel Cang\u00e9, was killed after three men showed up at his home on Friday night and demanded he go with them. The older Cang\u00e9 was already preparing for bed because he was going to church early Saturday and liked to be punctual. When he requested that the men allow him to put on a shirt and pants, they told him it wasn\u2019t necessary, according to his son.",

      "Cang\u00e9 said he personally knows some 30 other people who were killed. His mother and sister, who lived with his father, survived.",
      "\u201cI lost a best friend, someone who supported me my whole life,\u201d Cang\u00e9 said.",

      "Cases of dengue have been surging globally as warmer weather brought on by climate change enables mosquitoes to expand their reach.",
      "The Pan American Health Organization \u2014the regional office of the World Health Organization in the Americas \u2014 said deaths from dengue are also rising.",
      "More than 7,700 deaths have been reported in the Caribbean and the Americas so far in 2024, a more than 200% increase, compared to 2,467 deaths in 2023, according to the organization.",
      "The number of cases in the region, which includes the United States, is the highest reported since record keeping began in 1980, PAHO director Jarbas Barbosa said at a news conference.",
      "\u201cThis is linked directly to climatic events,\u201d he said, referencing warmer temperatures, droughts and flooding. A fast population growth, unplanned urbanization and poor sanitation have contributed to the rise in dengue.",
      "The virus has surged worldwide since last year and spread to areas previously free of dengue, according to PAHO.",
      "Brazil is reporting the highest number of dengue cases with more than 10 million, followed by Argentina, with more than 580,000, and Mexico with more than half a million.",

      "There are four types of dengue virus, simply known as 1, 2, 3 and 4. Having one type of virus doesn't provide immunity from others.",

      "Dengue cases usually surge during the wet season, but by late March, Puerto Rico already had declared an epidemic, with officials warning last month that it cannot be controlled unless residents cooperate. The U.S. territory has reported more than 4,900 cases and at least nine deaths so far this year. Victims include a 17-year-old girl and a 31-year-old woman.",

      "Her neighborhood reported five cases in six weeks, which she blames on heavy rains at the time and stagnant and accumulated water. One of the cases was her 17-year-old daughter. Plat\u00f3n said she now lights incense and sprays herself with repellant every afternoon.",
      "Puerto Rico officials are urging people to get rid of stagnant water where mosquitoes lay eggs. The government in Trinidad and Tobago has started issuing fines to people whose properties have become breeding sites for mosquitoes.",
      "This year, more than one-third of cases in Costa Rica, Mexico and Paraguay have been reported in children younger than 15, with Guatemala reporting a high number of child deaths, Barbosa said.",
      "Vaccines against dengue have been introduced in Peru, Brazil and Argentina, with Honduras slated to receive them next year, but they\u2019re meant mostly for children and are most effective in those already infected with dengue once, dos Santos said.",
      "She noted that supplies are limited and that vaccines are not expected to have a big impact on transmission. She stressed that preventive measures remain crucial.",

      "Venezuela\u2019s political opposition is signaling a shift toward a flexible timeline for a government transition that it had long insisted would come next month when the new presidential term is set to begin",
      "MADRID -- Venezuela\u2019s political opposition on Tuesday signaled a shift toward a flexible timeline for a government transition that it had long insisted would come next month when the new presidential term is set to begin.",
      "The change came as the faction\u2019s candidate in the July presidential election, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, remained in exile in Spain and its leader Maria Corina Machado continued to hide in Venezuela, both efforts meant to avoid arrest, with only 30 days left before Venezuela\u2019s constitutionally mandated swearing-in ceremony.",
      "The move underscores the challenges the opposition coalition faces to deliver on its promise to remove President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from office, even as dozens of nations back the faction's claim to victory and denounce the government for electoral fraud.",
      "\u201cOn January 10, the one who is against the wall is really Maduro, not us,\u201d Machado said via livestream during an event in Madrid, that highlighted the repression ruling party opponents have faced since the July 28 election. \"When will that understanding really be reached and trigger the transition? It could be before, it could be on January 10, it could be after.\u201d",
      "Machado did not give details of the \u201cterms of a negotiation\u201d which she said the opposition has offered the government. But the faction has repeatedly said that a top priority is the release from prison of hundreds of people detained for being actual or perceived government opponents.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared him the election winner hours after polls closed. But unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts.",
      "Meanwhile, the main opposition coalition collected tally sheets from 80% of the nation\u2019s electronic voting machines, posted them online and said the voting records showed Gonz\u00e1lez won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. The government ignored calls for transparency from inside and outside Venezuela, and instead, the ruling party-controlled National Assembly sent Maduro an invitation for his swearing-in ceremony.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez left Venezuela in September for exile in Spain after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with an investigation into the publishing of the vote tally sheets, while Machado has been hiding for months at an undisclosed location, which she says is in Venezuela.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez again told reporters Tuesday that he is willing to return to Venezuela to take office. \u201cI see myself assuming the position for which I was voted by the majority of Venezuelans on July 28,\u201d he said without offering a timeframe.",
      "Dozens of governments, including the United States, have recognized Gonz\u00e1lez as the election winner, but it is unclear whether Maduro and allies would allow him to enter Venezuela.",
      "Anti-government protests erupted nationwide the day after the election, drawing repression from state security forces, which arrested more than 2,200 people, including political leaders, lawyers, poll workers, election volunteers and protesters, both minors and adults. Relatives of a few of the detained attended the event in Madrid and spoke of the conditions detainees face.",
      "The arrests had a chilling effect across the country, with people carefully choosing what they say in public or on social media. The move also hit the opposition's capacity to summon thousands to the streets. Not a single massive rally has taken place since August, but Machado sought to quelch doubts about the strength of her movement, arguing that it continues to gain \u201cmore and more support\u201d and characterizing the repression as the actions of a government \u201cin a terminal state.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were told that it was impossible for us to defeat the regime on July 28, and we did,\u201d she said. \u201cThe voices that today want us to believe that it is not possible to enforce (the election\u2019s result) will be wrong again. So, it is time to move forward firmly.\u201d"

      "MEXICO CITY -- Truck drivers blocked some major highways in central Mexico on Tuesday to protest that the government hasn\u2019t paid them for work they did on a tourist train line.",
      "The protest by truckers blocked two major highways leading north out of Mexico City for a few hours Tuesday morning, and other highways on the Yucatan Peninsula, where they had worked carrying gravel and other materials for the government's Maya Train project.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum acknowledged Tuesday that the subcontractor companies that hired the truck drivers hadn't paid them because the government owed them money.",
      "\u201cThe payments to the companies have started, so that they, in turn, can pay the truck drivers,\u201d Sheinbaum said.",
      "It was the latest in a series of complaints by workers and businessmen who said the cash-strapped government has fallen behind in payments.",
      "Mexico\u2019s federal government is running big budget deficits to pay for ambitious pet projects and entitlement programs from the previous administration.",
      "Last month, suppliers and contractors for the state-owned oil company published an open letter saying they hadn\u2019t been paid $5 billion for work they had done.",
      "\u201cThis situation ... has caused adverse affects on our finances and on the regions where we work,\u201d the Mexican Association of Petroleum Services Companies wrote in the letter.",
      "Under former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who was Sheinbaum\u2019s political mentor, the government began transferring large amounts of money to the state-run Pemex oil company, started large building projects and implemented cash handout programs.",
      "That led to federal budget deficits of about 6% of Mexico\u2019s gross domestic product in 2024. Mexico\u2019s treasury department said it would aim to reduce the deficit to 3.9% of GDP in 2025, but it was unclear if it could achieve that. L\u00f3pez Obrador left behind a lot of unfinished train and oil refinery projects, and Sheinbaum has expanded benefit programs for older people.",
      "In November, the Moody\u2019s ratings agency said it had downgraded the government\u2019s debt outlook from \u201cstable\u201d to \u201cnegative\u201d while reaffirming Mexico\u2019s Baa2 overall credit rating, saying increased government debt represented a risk for Mexico.",
      "The cash crunch has left Sheinbaum scrambling to find money with new and unusual taxes and funding sources.",
      "Earlier this week, Sheinbaum said that much of the money gained by eliminating independent oversight and regulatory agencies will go to the army to fund a rise in soldiers\u2019 pay.",
      "In November, Mexico\u2019s Congress approved charging every cruise ship passenger a $42 immigration fee, with much of that money also going to the armed forces.",
      "L\u00f3pez Obrador and Sheinbaum have put the army in charge of everything airports, airlines and train lines, and many of the military-run projects appear to be big money losers, which may help explain the government\u2019s urge to find extra funding for the armed forces.",
      "For example, the army largely built the \u201cMaya Train,\u201d a tourist line which runs in a loop around the Yucatan Peninsula. But the train has drawn only 20% of the ridership expected when it was proposed.",
      "The Maya Train started service on Dec. 16, 2023. While it\u2019s not completely finished \u2014 two relatively little-used stretches are scheduled to enter service later this month \u2014 the most popular and heavily-travelled parts of the line are already in service.",
      "As of Dec. 8, authorities announced the train line had carried a little more than 600,000 passengers in its first 51 weeks. That is only one-fifth of the 3 million passengers authorities had claimed it would carry per year."

      "Dragging on for several months, the investigation has stunned the French rugby world. The French Rugby Federation expressed its \u201crelief and satisfaction\" with the judge's decision. It said the athletes, who had been suspended due to the seriousness of the allegations, would be eligible to return to the national team \u201cif their sporting performances allow for it.\u201d",
      "It wasn't the only scandal to hit the touring French team during its stay in Argentina. The federation separately fined and suspended French fullback Melvyn Jaminet for 34 weeks over a racist outburst that he posted on social media.",
      "The federation said that this close shave with the law served as a reminder \u201cof the need to create new conditions to prevent and avoid risky behavior in high-level rugby, in order to train responsible and exemplary players.\u201d",

      "Nearly a decade after hundreds of thousands of Syrians arrived in Germany, many are now well-integrated and settled in jobs \u2014 and tens of thousands have gained German citizenship",
      "BERLIN -- Nearly a decade after he arrived in Germany from Syria and took a selfie with then-Chancellor Angela Merkel, Anas Modamani has finished his university studies and has a German passport.",
      "He\u2019s less positive about some German politicians\u2019 reactions to the fall of Bashar Assad, which was followed within hours by the first talk of Syrians returning.",
      "\u201cBerlin has become my second home, I will definitely stay here,\u201d Modamani said Tuesday. \"I managed it\u201d \u2014 a reference to Merkel's famous slogan \u201cWe will manage it,\u201d coined as Germany faced the challenge of integrating hundreds of thousands of migrants.",
      "As Syrians took to the streets of Berlin Sunday, far-right leader Alice Weidel wrote on social platform X that anyone celebrating a \u201cfree Syria\u201d in Germany \u201cevidently no longer has a reason to flee. He should return to Syria immediately.\u201d",
      "With a German election approaching and the government under longstanding pressure to reduce irregular migration, some mainstream opposition politicians also appeared eager to kickstart the return of Syrians.",
      "On Monday, prominent conservative lawmaker Jens Spahn suggested on n-tv television the government could say that \u201cfor everyone who wants to go back to Syria, we will charter planes for them, they will get a starting fund of 1,000 euros ($1,055).\u201d He stressed, though, that it will take time before it's clear whether things have stabilized.",
      "Such ideas strike Syrians as indecently hasty. Modamani, a 27-year-old from Damascus who came to Germany in 2015, said he was \u201cshocked\" by reports of the 1,000-euro proposal.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s a terrible idea,\" he said as he sat over lunch with Syrian friends at a Berlin restaurant. \"The situation in Syria is still just as dangerous as before.\u201d",
      "Modamani, who says he shares an apartment with his girlfriend from Ukraine and finished his studies in business communication, illustrates what German officials acknowledge is the successful integration of many Syrians. A deputy interior minister, Juliane Seifert, said Syrians are \u201ca group that has significantly above-average educational qualifications,\u201d among them many doctors.",
      "The number of Syrians gaining German citizenship has risen from 6,700 in 2020 to 75,500 last year, when they were the biggest single group and accounted for 38% of all naturalizations.",
      "Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, whose conservative party has talked tough on migration, said Tuesday that many Syrian refugees are now \u201csuperbly integrated in our country, have a job and are urgently needed here\u201d and no one is thinking of getting such people to leave Germany.",
      "\u201cThose who have already integrated well are still cordially welcome,\u201d Herrmann told Deutschlandfunk radio Tuesday. \u201cBut it is clear that there are also people who have been here for 10 years and don\u2019t have a job and haven\u2019t integrated well, and then it\u2019s right to help them return to their homeland\u201d if Syria stabilizes.",
      "It's not surprising that hopes of a more stable Syria raise hopes in Germany of reducing immigration. Official figures show that, at the end of October, there were nearly 975,000 Syrian nationals in Germany, a country of 83 million. The majority had some kind of refugee or other protected status.",
      "On Monday, Germany and a string of other European countries announced that they were suspending decisions on Syrians' asylum applications as they wait for the situation in Syria to become clearer. Over 47,000 cases are pending in Germany, one of the main destinations for Syrians outside the Middle East.",
      "Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said that is the right thing to do, but it would be \u201cunserious to speculate in such a volatile situation\u201d about the eventual return of Syrians.",
      "Among those who will may face a longer wait is Basil Khalil, a 26-year-old Kurdish Syrian who said he applied for asylum Monday after crossing from Turkey into Bulgaria and traveling to Germany on the back of a truck. Khalil said he spent the last nine years as a refugee in Turkey, but was worried that Turkish authorities may soon start deporting Syrians.",
      "\u201cI applied for asylum in Germany because I\u2019m afraid that back in Syria I may get drafted as a soldier,\u201d he told The Associated Press as his cousin translated for him.",
      "\u201cBut if the German government will deport me, then I guess I will go back,\u201d Khalil said. \u201cWe Syrians have been through so much suffering, all we want to do is survive.\u201d",
      "Tarek Alaows, a spokesperson for pro-refugee group Pro Asyl, said that \u201cmany from the Syrian community naturally want to return ... Many want to participate in the reconstruction. But they must not be forced to leave the country\u201d for a still-unstable Syria.",
      "Alaows, 35, who fled Damascus in 2015 and became a German citizen over three years ago, said many Syrians in Germany were concerned to hear public calls so soon for the quick return of Syrians.",
      "\u201cThese debates that are going on right now \u2014 nobody needs them,\u201d he said.",
      "Yamn Molhem, who arrived 10 years ago, sees it the same way. The 39-year-old father of four now manages the Aldimashqi restaurant on Berlin\u2019s Sonnenallee boulevard, known for its many Arabic stores and businesses.",
      "\u201cAll of my family has left Aleppo, and the situation in Syria is generally very unstable,\u201d he said.",
      "Molhem said he is applying for a German passport, proudly adding that his youngest son already has one.",
      "\u2019They can\u2019t deport our family,\u201d said, \u201cMy son is German.\u201d",
      "In general, Molhem said, Germans should think twice before they even consider sending back Syrians who work, pay taxes and help keep the economy running.",
      "\u201cSyrians don\u2019t just sleep here,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "Cyprus' defense minister says that bolstering the defense capacity of the east Mediterranean island nation by getting new armaments is critical for a country so close to the war-wracked Middle East",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Bolstering Cyprus ' defense capacity is critical for the east Mediterranean island nation so close to the war-wrecked Middle East, the country's defense minister said Tuesday.",
      "The priority for Cyprus is to procure better defense systems, said Defense Minister Vasilis Palmas. The minister, who spoke to The Associated Press in the nation's capital of Nicosia, outlined some defense plans though he would not go into specifics about arms procurement programs.",
      "\u201cThe situation in the eastern Mediterranean, with its continuous shifting geostrategic balances and competing interests makes it even more pressing for the island to bolster its defensive capabilities,\u201d Palmas said.",
      "Meanwhile, a senior government official confirmed to the AP that Cyprus recently received a part of the Israeli-made Barak MX integrated air defense system.",
      "The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter, said he expects the delivery of the rest of the system soon, with the whole system becoming fully operational in mid-2025.",
      "The Israeli ground-based system is capable of simultaneously intercepting missiles, drones and aircraft from as far as 93 miles (150 kilometers) away, and represents a significant upgrade to Cyprus' defense shield, which had until recently only consisted of Soviet-era weapons, such as the BUK M1-2 missile system.",
      "Cyprus in recent years pivoted away from Russian weapons systems as part of a broader, pro-Western strategy to bring the small nation's armed forces up to EU and NATO standards. The Cypriot president, Nikos Christodoulides, said earlier this month that Cyprus could apply to join NATO with U.S. help, once conditions allow for it.",
      "Palmas said closer diplomatic and military ties with the United States have enabled Cyprus to leverage its geographic location as the closest European Union member to the Mideast to expand its diplomatic outreach in regional peace efforts and help in providing humanitarian assistance.",
      "Earlier this year, some 20,000 tons of humanitarian aid was shipped directly to Gaza via a maritime corridor from Cyprus. That effort halted as fighting intensified but efforts are underway to reestablish the supply route, this time via the Israeli port of Ashdod.",
      "The closer ties with the U.S. in recent years culminated in the lifting of a decades-old arms embargo Washington imposed on ethnically divided Cyprus to prevent an arms race.",
      "Cyprus\u2019 split came in 1974 when Turkey invaded after a coup on the island aiming at uniting it with Greece. Turkey continues to maintain more than 35,000 troops in the island\u2019s breakaway, Turkish Cypriot north.",
      "Following the lifting of the U.S. arms embargo, Cyprus\u2019 elite underwater demolition teams have reportedly been recently supplied with modern, U.S.-made M5 carbines \u2014 rifles more suited for special warfare teams.",
      "Palmas also told the AP that work is underway to enlarge Cyprus' air base in the island\u2019s southwest, including a longer runway.",
      "A major upgrade is also in the pipeline, he said, for the Mari naval base on the southern coast, also significantly expanding its facilities to accommodate warships and submarines of allied and friendly countries."

      "Belarus\u2019 authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko says his country is hosting dozens of Russian nuclear weapons and will prepare facilities for the planned deployment of Moscow\u2019s newest hypersonic ballistic missile",
      "MOSCOW -- Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko said Tuesday his country is hosting dozens of Russian nuclear weapons and will prepare facilities for the planned deployment of Moscow's newest hypersonic ballistic missile.",
      "His remarks came after he and President Vladimir Putin signed a treaty last week that gave security guarantees to Belarus, Moscow\u2019s closest ally, including the possible use of Russian nuclear weapons to help repel any aggression.",
      "The pact follows Moscow's revision of its nuclear doctrine, which for the first time placed Belarus under the Russian nuclear umbrella amid the tensions with the West over the conflict in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI have warned all my enemies, \u2018friends\u2019 and adversaries: If you step on the border, the answer will be momentary,\u201d Lukashenko said.",
      "Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for over 30 years and has relied on Kremlin subsidies and support, allowed Russia to use his country\u2019s territory to send troops into neighboring Ukraine in 2022 and to host some of its tactical nuclear weapons.",
      "Unlike nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that can destroy entire cities, tactical nuclear weapons for use against troops on the battlefield are less powerful.",
      "Russia hasn't disclosed how many, but Lukashenko said Tuesday that his country currently has several dozen of them.",
      "\u201cI have brought nuclear warheads here, and not just a single dozen of them,\u201d Lukashenko said in an apparent reference to the tactical weapons, adding that the West failed to track their deployment.",
      "\u201cThey haven't even noticed when we brought them here,\u201d he added.",
      "Earlier this year, Russian and Belarusian militaries held joint nuclear drills. They involved Belarus\u2019 Russia-supplied Iskander short-range ballistic missiles that can be fitted with nuclear warheads and warplanes equipped to carry nuclear bombs.",
      "The deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly if Moscow decides to use them. It also extends Russia\u2019s capability to target several NATO allies in Eastern and Central Europe.",
      "During the signing of the security pact on Dec. 6, Lukashenko asked Putin to deploy more advanced weapons in Belarus, including the Oreshnik intermediate range ballistic missile that Russia used for the first time last month against Ukraine.",
      "Putin responded that Oreshnik missiles could be deployed to Belarus in the second half of 2025, adding that they will remain under Russian control but Moscow will allow Minsk to select the targets.",
      "\u201cWe will determine targets for them here in Belarus, not the Russians,\u201d Lukashenko said Tuesday. \u201cAnd we will push the button together if needed, God forbid.\u201d",
      "He noted that Belarus has about 30 facilities for nuclear-capable ballistic missiles left over from the Cold War era when it was part of the USSR and hosted Soviet nuclear weapons.",
      "He added that a Belarus manufactures the large vehicles that serve as mobile launchers for Russian ballistic missiles, including Oreshnik.",
      "Putin has hailed Oreshnik\u2019s capability, saying its multiple warheads that plunge to a target at Mach 10 are immune from interception and are so powerful that the use of several of them in one conventional strike could be as devastating as a nuclear attack.",
      "Speaking Tuesday, Putin charged that \u201ca sufficient number of these advanced weapon systems simply makes the use of nuclear weapons almost unnecessary.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s missile forces chief declared that the missile, which can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, has a range allowing it to reach all of Europe.",
      "The revamped nuclear doctrine that Putin signed last month formally lowered the threshold for Russia\u2019s use of its nuclear weapons, a move that follows U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russian territory with American-supplied longer-range missiles.",
      "The doctrine says Moscow could use nuclear weapons \u201cin response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction\u201d against Russia or its allies, as well as \u201cin the event of aggression\u201d against Russia and Belarus with conventional weapons that threaten \u201ctheir sovereignty and/or territorial integrity.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Authorities in Mexico say a total of 17 children have died in central Mexico from suspected contamination of IV feeding bags, after four more deaths were confirmed",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Authorities in Mexico said Tuesday that a total of 17 children have died in central Mexico from suspected contamination of IV feeding bags after four more deaths were confirmed.",
      "David Kershenobich, the country\u2019s public health secretary, said 16 of the victims were underweight, premature babies being treated at hospitals; the other victim was 14 years old.",
      "He said that two bacteria, including a multidrug-resistant bug, were suspected in the deaths.",
      "Investigators say the bacterial contamination apparently happened at a plant in the city of Toluca that manufactured the IV nutrition mixture, and that the company had been temporarily shut down and use of the product had been halted.",
      "The first infections were reported starting Nov. 22 and the last was identified on Dec. 3. Around 20 other patients had been sickened by the infection and were being treated for it.",
      "All 13 of the first deaths occurred at three government hospitals and one private one in the State of Mexico, on the outskirts of Mexico City.",
      "Kershenobich said he did not expect any other deaths, but noted authorities had \u201cdetected other possible outbreaks with similar characteristics in Mexico State, which are under investigation.\u201d",
      "Three more deaths were found to have occurred in the neighboring state of Michoacan and one in the north-central state of Guanajuato. Authorities said the same bacteria, and the same IV bags, were implicated in all the deaths.",
      "Earlier, the federal Public Health Department ordered doctors across the country not to use IV nutrition bags made by the company Productos Hospitalarios S.A de C.V., though the exact source of the infections is still under investigation. Phone calls to numbers listed for the company and emails seeking comment went unanswered.",
      "The outbreak appeared to involve Klebsiella oxytoca, a multidrug-resistant bacteria, and enterobacter cloacae, which caused blood infections in the babies.",
      "It was the latest public blow to Mexico\u2019s tottering, underfunded healthcare system. Last month, the director of the country\u2019s flagship national cardiology institute said the hospital didn\u2019t have money to buy essential supplies, calling the situation \u201ccritical.\u201d",
      "Dr. Jorge Gaspar, the hospital\u2019s director, wrote an internal letter saying that budget cuts \u201chave affected the acquisition of supplies necessary for the institution\u2019s functioning.\u201d In a subsequent public letter the next day, he clarified that the initial message was intended for an \u201cinternal\u201d audience and assured the public that \u201cwe are working to solve the situation.\u201d",
      "Mexico has been plagued by contaminated medical supply scandals for years.",
      "In 2023, authorities arrested an anesthesiologist they blamed for an outbreak of meningitis that killed 35 patients and sickened 79.",
      "The doctor, whose name was withheld, apparently carried his own morphine from one private hospital to another, spreading a fungal infection that contaminated the medication at the first clinic, authorities said.",
      "The drug may not have been stored properly. Some smaller hospitals or maternity clinics in Mexico don\u2019t have their own dispensing pharmacies or are not authorized to handle controlled medications like opiates, and thus long relied on anesthesiologists to bring their own.",
      "In 2020, 14 people died after a hospital run by Mexico\u2019s state-owned oil company gave a drug to dialysis patients that was contaminated with bacteria. More than 69 patients were sickened in that outbreak.",
      "Former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office on Sept. 30, frequently complained that drug supply companies were charging too much, and so he essentially revamped the whole medical purchasing system, pledging to provide Mexicans healthcare that is \u201cbetter than in Denmark.\u201d",
      "However, the new system of government-run warehouses has foundered, plagued by chronic shortages of supplies and drugs, while a gargantuan government supply depot L\u00f3pez Obrador set up and called the \u201cmega drug store\u201d now sits largely empty.",

    "story": [
      "A Japanese man who lived through the American atomic bombing of Nagasaki has accepted this year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of an organization of survivors",
      "OSLO, Norway -- A 92-year-old Japanese man who lived through the American atomic bombing of Nagasaki described on Tuesday the agony he witnessed in 1945, including the charred corpses of his loved ones and the ruins of his city, as he accepted this year's Nobel Peace Prize on his organization's behalf.",
      "The prize was awarded to Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots movement of Japanese atomic bombing survivors who have worked for nearly 70 years to maintain a taboo around the use of nuclear weapons. The weapons have grown exponentially in power and number since being used for the first and only time in warfare by the United States on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945.",
      "The bombings pushed Japan to surrender to the Allies. They killed some 210,000 people by the end of 1945, but the full death toll from radiation is certainly higher.",
      "As the survivors reach the twilight of their lives, they are grappling with the fear that the taboo against using the weapons appears to be weakening. It was a concern expressed by the 92-year-old-survivor, Terumi Tanaka, who delivered the acceptance lecture in Oslo's City Hall to an audience that included Norway's royal family.",
      "\u201cThe nuclear superpower Russia threatens to use nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine, and a cabinet member of Israel, in the midst of its unrelenting attacks on Gaza in Palestine, even spoke of the possible use of nuclear arms,\u201d Tanaka said. \u201cI am infinitely saddened and angered that the nuclear taboo threatens to be broken.\u201d",
      "That concern drove the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award this year's prize to the Japanese organization, though it had honored other nuclear non-proliferation work in the past.",
      "J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes, the chair of the committee, said in introducing the laureates that it was important to learn from their testimony as the nuclear dangers grow.",
      "\u201cNone of the nine countries that possess nuclear weapons \u2014 the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea \u2014 appear interested in nuclear disarmament and arms control at present,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the contrary, they are modernizing and building up their nuclear arsenals.\u201d",
      "He said the Norwegian Nobel Committee was calling upon the five nuclear weapon states that have signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \u2014 the U.S., Russia, China, France and the U.K. \u2014 to take seriously their obligations under the treaty, and said others must ratify it.",
      "\u201cIt is naive to believe our civilization can survive a world order in which global security depends on nuclear weapons,\u201d Frydnes said. \u201cThe world is not meant to be a prison in which we await collective annihilation.\u201d",
      "In his speech, Tanaka described the attack on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after the first bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.",
      "He recalled the buzzing sound of a bomber jet followed by a \u201cbright, white light,\" and then an intense shock wave. Three days later, he and his mother sought out loved ones who lived near the hypocenter.",
      "\u201cMany people who were badly injured or burned, but still alive, were left unattended, with no help whatsoever. I became almost devoid of emotion, somehow closing off my sense of humanity, and simply headed intently for my destination,\u201d he said.",
      "He found the charred body of an aunt, the body of her grandson, his grandfather on the brink of death with severe burns and another aunt who had been severely burned and died just before he arrived. In all, five family members were killed.",
      "He described the efforts of survivors to use their experiences to try to abolish nuclear weapons for the sake of humanity, and to try to receive compensation from the Japanese state, which started the war, for their suffering.",
      "\u201cI hope that the belief that nuclear weapons cannot \u2014 and must not \u2014 coexist with humanity will take firm hold among citizens of the nuclear weapon states and their allies, and that this will become a force for change in the nuclear policies of their governments,\u201d he said."

      "The U.N. mission said that the theme for this year\u2019s International Human Rights Day emphasized how rights empowered people to build a better future.",
      "\u201cRegrettably, we continue to see the opposite unfold in Afghanistan,\u201d said Roza Otunbayeva, who is the head of the mission. \u201cThere is an ongoing, dangerous erosion of human rights protections, with women and girls bearing the brunt.\u201d",
      "The human rights record of authorities was especially marked by their systemic discrimination against women and girls, who are excluded from most areas of daily and public life, including education and work, according to the mission.",
      "\u201cIf Afghans, in particular women and girls, continue to be denied their rights, this constitutes a clear and intentional failure to protect and be responsible for the well-being of all who live in Afghanistan,\u201d said Fiona Frazer, representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in Afghanistan.",
      "Authorities routinely reject criticism of their policies, calling it interference or inconsistent with realities on the ground.",
      "On Tuesday, the government\u2019s chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said that proof of the country\u2019s human rights could be seen in the reduced number of casualties.",
      "Muhajid, without referencing the U.N. statement, said that courts and other institutions were at the service of all Afghans to help them resolve disputes or difficulties.",
      "People\u2019s rights were lost during the war and these were now restored, Mujahid told state-run media RTA.",
      "In an audio clip posted on X, he said that countries should see human rights from the perspective of Islam, Afghan culture and beliefs. He said that it was unprincipled for one country to impose its culture and values on another.",
      "\u201cWe have our religion, we have our beliefs, we have our culture,\u201d Mujahid said in the clip. \u201cWe can define our rights and recognize our obligations in observing these rights.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani said that while it was the government\u2019s responsibility to implement God\u2019s will in Afghanistan, Islam shouldn't be represented or monopolized in a way that excluded people who disagreed with officials.",
      "Rulers shouldn't impose their will on others, he told people at a madrassa in Kabul, his latest remarks appearing to project a softer and more pragmatic side to him.",
      "Haqqani leads a powerful network blamed for some of the bloodiest attacks against Afghanistan\u2019s former Western-backed government.",
      "But, in the past three years, he has made some speeches acknowledging the hardships facing Afghans and alluding to his discontent with the Taliban's current style of leadership and decision-making.",
      "Those in government shouldn't be narrow-minded, Haqqani said in a 12-minute audio file shared by the Interior Ministry with The Associated Press on Monday. He didn't mention any names.",
      "\u201cWe should not think the sky will fall if people do not follow us,\u201d the minister said. The government was unresponsive to people because it didn't have answers to their questions, creating a challenge within the Taliban's Islamic system, he said.",
      "Haqqani is still wanted by the U.S. on an up to $10 million bounty over his involvement in an attack that killed an American citizen and other assaults."

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the witness stand for the first time in his long-running trial on corruption charges",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the witness stand Tuesday for the first time in his long-running trial on corruption charges. But long before these accusations emerged, Netanyahu has been vexed by a flurry of embarrassing scandals and allegations.",
      "Netanyahu consistently and vehemently denies wrongdoing and has assailed investigations into his conduct or that of his family as witch hunts driven by a hostile media and a biased justice system.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some of the scandals that have beset Netanyahu, his family and his aides since he began to dominate Israel\u2019s political scene.",
      "Close confidants of Netanyahu are suspected of receiving bribes to advance a deal to purchase submarines and other warships from Germany. Netanyahu is not a suspect in that case. But a state commission of inquiry looking into the affair earlier this year sent a letter to the prime minister warning him that he could be harmed by its conclusions.",
      "The committee did not detail the precise accusations against Netanyahu, but painted a picture of improper decision-making at multiple levels in government, the defense establishment and the military. He denies wrongdoing.",
      "A spokesperson for the Israeli leader has been charged with leaking classified information to German tabloid \u201cBild\u201d that indictments alleged harmed Israel's wartime security and interests. Netanyahu himself has not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Critics say the leak was meant to sway public opinion to be more in favor of Netanyahu's negotiating positions with Hamas, and diminish public pressure on him to reach a deal to release hostages held by the militants. Another Netanyahu aide is being investigated for doctoring documents, a move critics say was meant to protect Netanyahu from future investigations into his wartime conduct.",
      "In 2016, an official expense report revealed that Netanyahu spent more than $600,000 of public funds on a six-day trip to New York, including $1,600 on a personal hairdresser. Three years earlier, he was criticized for spending $127,000 in public funds for a special sleeping cabin on a five-hour flight to London. Netanyahu contended he was unaware of the cost and halted the practice. He also was forced to stop purchasing ice cream from an artisanal Jerusalem parlor after news erupted that his office ran up a $2,700 bill for his favorite flavors, vanilla and pistachio.",
      "His wife, Sara, has also been charged with misusing some $100,000 in public funds to order lavish meals from celebrity chefs at the prime minister\u2019s official residence, even though she already had cooks on the government payroll. She agreed to pay $15,000 for misusing state funds as part of a plea deal.",
      "Allegations also mounted against the Netanyahus for using government money to purchase furniture for their private beach house and to cover the medical expenses of Sara Netanyahu\u2019s late father. The attorney general ultimately dismissed the allegations.",
      "Netanyahu was suspected of double billing travel expenses and using state funds to cover personal travel in the 2000s, while he was finance minister and opposition leader. After a drawn-out investigation, the attorney general dismissed the case.",
      "Netanyahu's household staff has repeatedly accused Sara Netanyahu of explosive tirades and mistreatment.",
      "During Netanyahu\u2019s first stint as prime minister, the family\u2019s nanny said she was fired by Netanyahu\u2019s wife for burning a pot of vegetable soup. The young woman said she was thrown out of the family\u2019s home without her clothes or passport, and later was ordered to pick up her belongings dumped outside the front gate. Netanyahu\u2019s office said the woman was fired because she was prone to violent outbursts.",
      "Two household aides have won damages in lawsuits accusing Sara Netanyahu of abusive conduct. In 2016, a Jerusalem court awarded one domestic worker over $42,000 in damages. Netanyahu and his wife have both rejected the accusations. In 2018, a recorded phone conversation surfaced of the prime minister's wife screaming at her publicist about how a gossip column omitted mention of her educational credentials.",
      "In 2018, a recording surfaced of Netanyahu\u2019s eldest son, Yair, joyriding with his super-rich buddies to Tel Aviv strip clubs in a drunken night out in a taxpayer-funded government vehicle. He later apologized.",
      "The 33-year-old Netanyahu has also sparked controversy for lewd and offensive social media posts over the years, such as his publishing a caricature that drew on classic antisemitic tropes. Facebook briefly suspended his account after he wrote he would prefer an Israel without any Muslims.",
      "Back in the 1990s, rumors circulated that a videotape existed depicting Netanyahu and his image consultant, a married woman named Ruth Bar, in \u201ccompromising romantic situations.\u201d In response, Netanyahu went on television and confessed to adultery, even though the tape never turned up.",
      "During his first term in office in the 1990s, Netanyahu was suspected of appointing a crony as attorney general in exchange for political support from the ultra-religious Shas party. Prosecutors called Netanyahu\u2019s conduct \u201cpuzzling\u201d but ultimately closed the case, citing lack of evidence.",
      "During that same spell in office, Netanyahu and his wife were suspected of pocketing gifts and foreign contributions received from world leaders \u2014 items considered state property. The Netanyahus also were suspected of accepting favors from a contractor. Both cases were closed without charges."

      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump is promising expedited federal permits for energy projects and other construction worth more than $1 billion. But like other Trump plans, the idea is likely to run into regulatory and legislative hurdles, including a landmark law that requires federal agencies to consider the environmental impact before deciding on major projects.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social site Tuesday, Trump said anyone making a $1 billion investment in the United States \u201cwill receive fully expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no way limited to, all Environmental approvals.\u201d",
      "\u201cGET READY TO ROCK!!!\" he added.",
      "While Trump did not specify who would be eligible for accelerated approvals, dozens of energy projects proposed nationwide, from natural gas pipelines and export terminals to solar farms and offshore wind turbines, meet the billion-dollar criteria.",
      "Environmental groups slammed the proposal, calling it illegal on its face and a clear violation of the National Environmental Policy Act, a 54-year-old law that requires federal agencies to study the potential environmental impact of proposed actions and consider alternatives.",
      "\u201cTrump is unabashedly and literally offering to sell out America to the highest corporate bidder,'' said Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, an environmental group. She said the plan was \u201cobviously illegal\u201d and another example of Trump \u201cputting special interests and corporate polluters in the driver\u2019s seat, which would result in more pollution, higher costs and fewer energy choices for the American people.\u201d",

      "Energy analyst Kevin Book said Trump's post showed his usual flair for showmanship but said there was a real concern underlying it: a bipartisan push for permitting reform to speed up major environmental projects that now take years to win approval.",
      "\u201cThe substance here is he is really serious about trying to get permitting reform done,\" said Book, managing partner at ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington research firm.",
      "\u201cPermitting delays are an impediment in many sectors \u2014 including energy \u2014 and there are multiple billion-dollar investments waiting for permitting reform,\" Book said.",
      "A bipartisan plan championed by Senate Energy Committee Chairman Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the committee's top Republican, would speed up permitting for major energy and mineral projects, but its chances are uncertain in the final few weeks of the current Congress.",
      "Their plan would boost energy projects of all types, bringing down prices, creating domestic jobs and allowing the U.S. to continue as a global energy leader, Barrasso and Manchin say.",
      "Critics say the bill would open major expanses of public lands and waters for oil and gas drilling and gut executive and judicial review.",
      "\u201cChecking off wish lists for oil, gas and mining companies is not permitting reform,\u201d said Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee.

      "Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, said Trump's second term will be a \u201cgolden age of regulation-cutting,'' including a promise to \u201cdrill, baby, drill.''",

      "In the short term, Trump's post makes permitting reform less likely this year, Book said, as Republicans seek to wait until next year when they will control both chambers of Congress and the White House. But the issue is likely to return quickly in the new year.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday named Andrew Ferguson as the next chair of the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "He will replace Lina Khan, who became a lightning rod for Wall Street and Silicon Valley by blocking billions of dollars' worth of corporate acquisitions and suing Amazon and Meta while alleging anticompetitive behavior.",
      "It was one of several evening announcements Trump made via his social media platform, including that he was naming Kimberly Guilfoyle as Ambassador to Greece, a longtime supporter who was engaged to his son Don Jr., and ally and former inaugural chairman Tom Barrack as Ambassador to Turkey.",
      "Ferguson is already one of the FTC's five commissioners, which is currently made up of three Democrats and two Republicans.",
      "\u201cAndrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship, and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding, \u201cAndrew will be the most America First, and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country\u2019s History.\u201d",
      "The replacement of Khan likely means that the FTC will operate with a lighter touch when it comes to antitrust enforcement. The new chair is expected to appoint new directors of the FTC's antitrust and consumer protection divisions.",
      "\u201cThese changes likely will make the FTC more favorable to business than it has been in recent years, though the extent to which is to be determined,\u201d wrote Anthony DiResta, a consumer protection attorney at Holland & Knight, in a recent analysis.",
      "Deals that were blocked by the Biden administration could find new life with Trump in command.",
      "For example, the new leadership could be more open to a proposed merger between the country\u2019s two biggest supermarket chains, Kroger and Albertsons, which forged a $24.6 billion deal to combine in 2022. Two judges halted the merger Tuesday night.",
      "The FTC had filed a lawsuit in federal court earlier this year to block the merger, claiming the deal would eliminate competition, leading to higher prices and lower wages for workers. The two companies say a merger would help them lower prices and compete against bigger rivals like Walmart.",
      "One of the judges said the FTC had shown it was likely to prevail in the administrative hearing.",
      "Yet given the widespread public concern over high grocery prices, the Trump administration may not fully abandon the FTC's efforts to block the deal, some experts have said.",
      "And the FTC may continue to scrutinize Big Tech firms for any anticompetitive behavior. Many Republican politicians have accused firms such as Meta of censoring conservative views, and some officials in Trump's orbit, most notably Vice President-elect JD Vance, have previously expressed support for Khan's scrutiny of Big Tech firms.",
      "Barrack, a wealthy financier, met Trump in the 1980s while helping negotiate Trump\u2019s purchase of the renowned Plaza Hotel. He was charged with using his personal access to the former president to secretly promote the interests of the United Arab Emirates, but was acquitted of all counts at a federal trial in 2022.",
      "Trump called him a \u201cwell-respected and experienced voice of reason.\u201d",
      "Guilfoyle is a former California prosecutor and television news personality who led the fundraising for Trump's 2020 campaign. Trump called her \u201ca close friend and ally,\u201d and praised her \u201csharp intellect make her supremely qualified.\u201d She had been engaged to Don Jr. since 2020, they arrived together at the convention center on election night and she was on stage with the family.",
      "\u201cI am so proud of Kimberly. She loves America and she always has wanted to serve the country as an Ambassador. She will be an amazing leader for America First,\u201d Don Jr. posted.",

    "summary": "The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled that Ohio's product liability law prohibits counties from bringing public-nuisance claims against national pharmaceutical chains as they did as part of national opioid litigation",
    "story": [
      "The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled that Ohio's product liability law prohibits counties from bringing public-nuisance claims against national pharmaceutical chains as they did as part of national opioid litigation",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The Ohio Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the state's product liability law prohibits counties from bringing public nuisance claims against national pharmaceutical chains as they did as part of national opioid litigation, a decision that could overturn a $650 million judgment against the pharmacies.",
      "An attorney for the counties called the decision \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "Justices were largely unanimous in their interpretation of an arcane disagreement over the state law, which had emerged in a lawsuit brought by Lake and Trumbull counties outside Cleveland against CVS, Walgreens and Walmart.",
      "The counties won their initial lawsuit \u2014 and were awarded $650 million in damages by a federal judge in 2022 \u2014 but the pharmacies had disputed the court's reading of the Ohio Product Liability Act, which they said protected them from such sanctions.",
      "In an opinion written by Justice Joseph Deters, the court found that Ohio state lawmakers intended the law to prevent \u201call common law product liability causes of action\" \u2014 even if they don't seek compensatory damages but merely \u201cequitable relief\u201d for the communities.",
      "\u201cThe plain language of the OPLA abrogates product-liability claims, including product-related public-nuisance claims seeking equitable relief,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are constrained to interpret the statute as written, not according to our own personal policy preferences.\u201d",
      "Two of the Republican-dominated court's Democratic justices disagreed on that one point, while concurring on the rest of the judgment.",
      "\u201cAny award to abate a public nuisance like the opioid epidemic would certainly be substantial in size and scope, given that the claimed nuisance is both long-lasting and widespread,\u201d Justice Melody Stewart wrote in an opinion joined by Justice Michael Donnelly. \u201cBut just because an abatement award is of substantial size and scope does not mean it transforms it into a compensatory-damages award.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the plaintiffs' co-liaison counsel in the national opioid litigation, Peter Weinberger, of the Cleveland-based law firm Spangenberg Shibley & Liber, lamented the decision.",
      "\u201cThis ruling will have a devastating impact on communities and their ability to police corporate misconduct,\" he said. \u201cWe have used public nuisance claims across the country to obtain nearly $60 billion in opioid settlements, including nearly $1 billion in Ohio alone, and the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s ruling undermines the very legal basis that drove this result.\u201d",
      "But Weinberger said Tuesday's ruling would not be the end, and that communities would continue to fight \u201cthrough other legal avenues.\u201d",
      "\"We remain steadfast in our commitment to holding all responsible parties to account as this litigation continues nationwide,\u201d he said.",
      "In his 2022 ruling, U.S. District Judge Dan Polster said that the money awarded to Lake and Trump counties would be used to the fight the opioid crisis. Attorneys at the time put the total price tag at $3.3 billion for the damage done.",
      "Lake County was to receive $306 million over 15 years. Trumbull County was to receive $344 million over the same period. Nearly $87 million was to be paid immediately to cover the first two years of payments.",
      "A jury returned a verdict in favor of the counties in November 2021, after a six-week trial. It was then left to the judge to decide how much the counties should receive. He heard testimony the next May to determine damages.",
      "The counties convinced the jury that the pharmacies played an outsized role in creating a public nuisance in the way they dispensed pain medication. It was the first time pharmacy companies completed a trial to defend themselves in a drug crisis that has killed a half-million Americans since 1999."

      "General Motors says it will retreat from the robotaxi business and stop funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle unit",
      "DETROIT -- General Motors said Tuesday it will retreat from the robotaxi business and stop funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle unit.",
      "Instead the Detroit automaker will focus on development of partially automated driver-assist systems for personal vehicles like its Super Cruise, which allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel.",
      "GM said it would get out of robotaxis \u201cgiven the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.\u201d",
      "The company said it will combine Cruise's technical team with its own to work on advanced systems to assist drivers.",
      "GM bought control of San Francisco-based Cruise automation in 2016 with high hopes of developing a profitable fleet of robotaxis.",
      "Over the years GM invested billions in the subsidiary and eventually bought 90% of the company from investors, all while racking up millions in losses.",
      "GM\u2019s brushoff of Cruise represents a dramatic about-face from years of full-blown support that left a huge financial dent in the automaker. The company invested $2.4 billion in Cruise only to sustain years of uninterrupted losses, with little in return. Since GM bought a controlling stake in Cruise for $581 million in 2016, the robotaxi service piled up more than $10 billion in operating losses while bringing in less than $500 million in revenue, according to GM shareholder reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "The automaker even announced plans for Cruise to generate $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, but it scaled back spending on the company after one of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts dragged a San Francisco pedestrian who was hit by another vehicle in 2023.",
      "The California Public Utilities Commission alleged Cruise then covered up details of the crash for more than two weeks.",
      "The embarrassing incident resulted in Cruise\u2019s license to operate its driverless fleet in California being suspended by regulators and triggered a purge of its leadership \u2014 in addition to layoffs that jettisoned about a quarter of its workforce.",
      "GM CEO Mary Barra told analysts on a conference call Tuesday the the new unit will focus on personal vehicles and developing systems that can drive by themselves in certain circumstances.",
      "The company has agreements to buy another 7% of Cruise and intends to buy the remaining shares so it owns the whole company.",
      "The move is another step back from autonomous vehicles, which have proved far harder to develop than companies once anticipated. Two years ago, crosstown rival Ford Motor Co. disbanded its Argo AI autonomous vehicle venture in Pittsburgh that it co-owned with Volkswagen.",
      "At the time the company said it didn\u2019t see a path to profitability for a number of years.",
      "Yet other companies are pressing forward with plans to deploy autonomous vehicles and expanding their services.",
      "Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo is accelerating plans to broaden its robotaxi service beyond areas of metropolitan Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Last week the company said it would begin testing its driverless Jaguars in Miami next year, with plans to start charging for rides in 2026.",
      "The move comes less than a month after Waymo opened up its robotaxi service to anyone looking for a ride in an 80-square-mile (129 square kilometer) area of Los Angeles. Waymo also has plans to launch fleets in Atlanta and Austin next year in partership with ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "In April, a company called Aurora Innovation plans to start hauling freight on Texas freeways using fully driverless semis.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said his company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels using Tesla's \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.",
      "But an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into Full Self-Driving's ability to see in low visibility conditions cast doubt on whether Teslas are ready to be deployed without humans behind the wheel.",
      "The agency began the investigation in October after getting reports of four crashes involving \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. An Arizona pedestrian was killed in one of the crashes.",
      "GM said it will work with Cruise\u2019s leadership to restructure the company and refocus Cruise\u2019s operations on driver assist systems. The company expects the restructuring to reduce spending by more than $1 billion annually.",
      "Cruise has about 2,300 employees and will retain a presence in San Francisco, GM said. It\u2019s too early to talk about employment levels until the restructuring is completed next year, a spokesman said.",
      "Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, said Cruise will bring its software, artificial intelligence and sensor development to GM to team up on improving GM\u2019s driver-assist systems.",
      "\u201cWe want to leverage what already has been done as we go forward, and we think we can do that very effectively,\u201d Barra said.",
      "Shares of GM rose about 3% in trading after Tuesday's closing bell. They are up about 47% for the year.",

About two minutes later, the controller cleared pilots of the Southwest Boeing 737 to land on the main runway, followed shortly by the Diamond crew telling the controller that they were stopped on the runway, as directed.",
      "As they were completing their landing rollout, the Southwest pilots told the controller that there was another aircraft on the main runway, the NTSB said. Both planes taxied to their parking areas without further incident."

    "story": [
      "A Delaware judge says a UPS driver who crashed his truck after downing several beers while driving is not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation for his injuries",
      "DOVER, Del. -- A UPS driver who crashed his truck after downing several beers while driving is not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation for his injuries, a Delaware judge has ruled.",
      "Superior Court Judge Kathleen Vavala ruled late last week that Delaware\u2019s Industrial Accident Board abused its discretion and erred as a matter of law in awarding compensation to Timothy Willis.",
      "\u201cVoluntary intoxication while working deviates from the ordinary course of employment,\u201d the judge noted, saying the board\u2019s decision \u201cexceeded the bounds of reason.\u201d",
      "Willis crashed his semi-truck into a guardrail in Baltimore County, Maryland, in June 2021. He began his shift the night before in Delaware and drove to Pennsylvania before heading to Maryland to drop off the trailer portion of his rig. Willis was headed back to Delaware to drop off the semi-cab before driving home to New Jersey when he barreled into a guardrail at about 4 a.m.",
      "\u201cWillis typically packs a cooler of beers to celebrate the end of his shift while driving back home; but on the day of the crash, he started early,\u201d Vavala wrote, noting that Willis admitted drinking three beers. \u201cWillis admitted he usually drinks beer and drives on the way home from work; attended AA meetings to curb his drinking; and was drinking and driving sometime before the crash,\u201d the judge noted.",
      "Responding officers saw Willis throwing several beer cans out of the truck. Officers said he was slurring his speech, sweating profusely, smelled of alcohol and had defecated on himself.",
      "Officers found an open can of Miller Lite on the running board of the truck, two cans on the ground, and another in the cooler. Willis refused to perform field sobriety checks, but two blood tests taken hours later registered blood alcohol levels of 0.19 and 0.181, both more than twice the legal limit. He was charged with drunken driving but avoided a formal conviction by entering a \u201cprobation before judgment\u201d agreement.",
      "The Industrial Accident Board refused to consider the blood alcohol tests because they were not properly authenticated. It also excluded statements Willis made during his Maryland court hearing. Board members then awarded Willis compensation, saying the accident occurred at a time and place where he was reasonably expected to be while working. They also concluded that violation of UPS\u2019s zero-tolerance alcohol policy did not in itself mean the accident was \u201coutside the course and scope of employment.\u201d They also said UPS failed to demonstrate that Willis was intoxicated at the time.",
      "The board noted that the alcohol in question was light beer with lower alcohol content compared to other beers and that it was unclear when he had been drinking. The board also lent some credence to Willis\u2019 claim that he crashed after swerving to avoid a deer.",
      "Vavala said the board correctly noted that Willis had not been convicted of DUI and it correctly excluded the breathalyzer results. She determined, however, that the board abused its discretion in prohibiting cross-examination of Willis about statements he made during his Maryland plea hearing. She also said the board erred in finding that Willis was acting within the course and scope of his employment when he crashed.",
      "\u201cA truck driver cannot reasonably drink, nor is he expected to drink, alcohol while operating a semi-trailer weighing thousands of pounds on curving back roads at close to four in the morning,\u201d Vavala wrote. \u201cSuch conduct not only violates company policy \u2014 it is also prohibited by law.\u201d",
      "\u201cFinally, to affirm the board\u2019s decision would set a dangerous precedent that employees can get away with driving impaired on the job \u2014 as long as it\u2019s light beer \u2014 despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary,\u201d Vavala concluded.",
      "The judge's ruling did not indicate Willis' employment status with UPS."

      "The proposed merger between supermarket giants Kroger and Albertsons floundered on Tuesday after judges overseeing two separate cases both halted the merger.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a preliminary injunction blocking the merger Tuesday after holding a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon.",
      "Later Tuesday, Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle issued a permanent injunction barring the merger in Washington after concluding it would lessen competition in the state and violate Washington's consumer-protection laws.",
      "Kroger and Albertsons said Tuesday they are disappointed in the decisions and are reviewing their options. The companies could appeal, although the deal could fall apart in the time it would take for those cases to be considered.",
      "Kroger and Albertsons in 2022 proposed what would be the largest grocery store merger in U.S. history. The companies said a merger would help them better compete with big retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon.",
      "But the Federal Trade Commission sued earlier this year, asking Nelson to block the $24.6 billion deal until an in-house administrative judge at the FTC could consider the merger. Attorneys general from Arizona, California, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Wyoming and the District of Columbia joined the FTC's lawsuit.",
      "Nelson agreed to pause the merger, saying that the FTC had shown it was likely to prevail in the administrative hearing.",
      "\u201cAny harms defendants experience as a result of the injunction do not overcome the strong public interest in the enforcement of antitrust law, especially given the difficulty in disentangling a premature merger,\u201d she wrote in her opinion.",
      "The FTC called Nelson\u2019s decision \u201ca major victory for the American people\" that will protect them from higher grocery prices. In Washington, Governor-elect Bob Ferguson, who brought the case against Kroger and Albertsons as the state\u2019s attorney general, called the state court\u2019s decision \u201can important victory for affordability, worker protections and the rule of law.\u201d",
      "Federal regulators argued that combining the two chains would be bad for consumers and workers by eliminating competition.",
      "A coalition of United Food and Commercial Workers local unions representing more than 100,000 Kroger and Albertsons employees applauded the court decisions Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThis mega-merger would be bad for workers who deserve a workplace where they can be paid well for their labor, be safe and be respected,\u201d the unions said.",
      "Kroger had promised to invest $1 billion in lower grocery prices, an additional $1 billion in higher grocery worker wages and $1.3 billion to improve Albertsons stores. But Nelson wasn't swayed.",
      "\u201cThe promise to make a price investment is not legally binding, and the court must give limited weight to a non-binding promise made during these proceedings,\u201d she wrote in her decision. Nelson added that the companies can still invest in lower prices if the FTC approves the merger in its administrative hearings.",
      "The federal case now moves to the FTC, although Kroger and Albertsons have asked a different federal judge to block the in-house proceedings. Colorado is also trying to halt the merger in its own state trial.",
      "It is not yet clear what impact the change in administrations will have on the FTC's willingness to consider the merger. In past hearings, lawmakers from both parties were skeptical that the merger would bring down grocery prices.",
      "Kroger and Albertsons currently compete in 22 states, closely matching each other on price, quality, private label products and services like store pickup. The FTC and the state of Washington argued that a merger would eliminate that competition and raise prices for already struggling consumers. The FTC also said the merger would hurt workers since Kroger and Albertsons would no longer compete to hire them.",
      "But Kroger and Albertsons argued their merger would preserve consumer choice by allowing them to better compete against its growing rivals. In its testimony, Albertsons warned Nelson that it might have to lay off workers, close stores and even exit some markets if the merger weren't allowed to proceed.",
      "Under the merger agreement, Kroger and Albertsons would sell 579 stores in places where their locations overlap to C&S Wholesale Grocers, a New Hampshire-based supplier to independent supermarkets that also owns the Grand Union and Piggly Wiggly store brands.",
      "The FTC and the state of Washington argued that C&S is ill-prepared to take on the stores and may want the option to sell or close them. Both judges agreed.",
      "\u201cThe current competition between Kroger and Albertsons' stores is fierce in the state of Washington,\" Ferguson said in court before his ruling was released. \"Wholesaler C&S, with its limited retail experience and infrastructure, will not be able to replicate the ferocity of that competition or compete effectively in Washington against the colossus that is a merged Kroger and Albertsons.\u201d",
      "Kroger, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, operates 2,800 stores in 35 states, including brands like Ralphs, Smith\u2019s and Harris Teeter. Albertsons, based in Boise, Idaho, operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw\u2019s. Together, the companies employ around 710,000 people.",
      "Shares in Kroger Co. rose 5% in trading Tuesday, while those in Albertsons Co. fell 2%."

      "The athletes whose lawsuit against the NCAA is primed to pave the way for schools to pay them directly also want a players' association to represent them in the complex contract negotiations that have overtaken the sport.",
      "Grant House, Sedona Prince and Nya Harrison wrote to the judge overseeing what's known as the House settlement, saying that although they are generally happy with the terms of the proposed settlement \u201cthere still remains a critical need for structural changes to protect athletes and prevent the failures of the past.\u201d",
      "That, they said, would be a players' association, which they believe will help their voices be better heard as the NCAA and its schools move toward a system to share hundreds of millions in TV and ticket revenue with players.",
      "The players said an association would help standardize name-image-likeness (NIL) contracts to establish minimum payments and health protections \u201cand to create an ecosystem where athletes can thrive.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile professional leagues include athletes in these decisions through their respective players' associations, the college system continues to prevent our players' association from representing us at the decision-making tables,\u201d the letter said.",
      "The settlement, with a price tag of $2.8 billion that will be distributed over the next 10 years to players both past and present, does not address whether athletes should be considered employees of the schools. That's an issue the NCAA is asking Congress to prevent for fear the costs could wreck college sports.",
      "The NCAA did not immediately respond to a message from The Associated Press seeking comment Tuesday.",
      "Earlier this year, the head of the National College Players Association confirmed that a licensing organization that works with the NFL Players\u2019 Association had emailed thousands of college football players, encouraging them to join the NCPA. Separately, the chairman of another group trying to organize college athletes, athletes.org, said it already had some 4,000 members. The players who wrote the letter said they wanted to work with athletes.org.",
      "A hearing to approve the settlement is set for April 7. The request could shape how U.S. Judge Claudia Wilken views the settlement's long-term chances of succeeding, but plaintiffs' attorney Jeffrey Kessler said the letter was an endorsement of the settlement and he doesn't expect it to impact the agreement.",
      "\u201cAll three of these athletes fully support approval of the settlement but wanted to express their additional views that a players' association is also desirable,\" Kessler said. \u201cI salute their devotion to these issues and their fellow college athletes.\u201d",
      "Whether college athletes can ever be considered school employees is a thorny topic. There are multiple issues in front of the National Labor Relations Board, including a complaint against USC and the Pac-12; a unionization effort by the men\u2019s basketball team at Dartmouth; an unfair labor complaint against Notre Dame; and a federal lawsuit in Pennsylvania filed by former Villanova football player Trey Johnson.",
      "All of it could lead to college athletes being granted employee status, though court battles are assured.",

    "story": [
      "If you want to get yourself thoroughly depressed, spend a little time looking at statistics about Americans\u2019 retirement preparedness",
      "If you want to get yourself thoroughly depressed, spend a little time looking at statistics about Americans\u2019 retirement preparedness.",
      "In\u202f Vanguard\u2019s most recent How America Saves report, the average participant balance in Vanguard plans was $134,000 in 2023, but the median balance was just $35,000. For workers with Vanguard plans who were between ages 55 and 64, the average and median balances were $245,000 and $88,000, respectively, in 2023. Roughly half of people between age 55 and 66 have no retirement savings at all, according to\u202f U.S. Census Bureau data, and women are in worse shape than men from the standpoint of retirement preparedness.",
      "Clearly, many people are hurtling toward a shortfall, or living through one. And for people who are dramatically undersaved and largely reliant on Social Security for in-retirement living expenses, there\u2019s no getting around the fact that their standard of living in retirement is going to be lower than it was when they were working.",
      "Rather than looking to a single blockbuster solution to help make up for a savings gap, what if you were to consider a little bit of several prudent strategies\u2014being willing to cut your standard of living a bit in retirement, working a bit longer, and investing a bit better, for example?",
      "Employing more modest changes around the margins of your plan means they\u2019re apt to be more palatable from a lifestyle perspective, too; the thought of working until age 70 might not appeal but holding out until age 67 may be more doable.",
      "As pre-retirees have no doubt heard, working even a few years past traditional retirement age can deliver a threefer on the financial front, allowing additional savings and tax-deferred compounding, fewer years of portfolio drawdown, and perhaps delayed Social Security filing. Being willing to work part-time in retirement is another variation on this idea. Yet, as attractive as working longer looks by the numbers, it\u2019s a poor idea to make it the sole fallback plan, as many who plan to work longer are not able to.",
      "This is another exceptionally powerful lever, allowing individuals to pick up an increase in benefits for every year they delay Social Security filing beyond their full retirement ages up until age 70. In order to pull this off, however, an individual may need to work longer or draw from a portfolio earlier.",
      "The good news is that from a household budgetary standpoint, many individuals are best equipped to crank up their savings rates later in their careers. They\u2019re often in their peak earnings years, and other big-ticket preretirement expenses, such as home purchases and college funding, may be in the rearview mirror.",
      "The bad news is that with a shorter time horizon, those newly invested dollars will have less time to compound before they\u2019ll need to withdraw them. That doesn\u2019t mean that late-start retirees shouldn\u2019t bother with additional contributions: Even an additional $5,000 invested per year, earning a modest average return of 4% for 10 years, would translate into more than an additional $60,000 in retirement.",
      "This one\u2019s a gimme. Lower mutual fund expenses are correlated with better returns, so why wouldn\u2019t you work to bring your portfolio\u2019s total costs down? Lowering costs can be particularly advantageous as you enlarge your portfolio\u2019s stake in safer investments like bonds, where absolute investment returns, while better today than just a few years ago, are apt to be relatively low. Moreover, the differential between very strong- and very poor-performing investments can boil down to expenses.",
      "Retirees seeking the same dollar amount, adjusted for inflation, year after year in retirement will generally want to be more conservative with their starting amount for portfolio withdrawals. Meanwhile, those who are willing to employ a dynamic withdrawal approach, varying withdrawals based on how their portfolios have performed, can generally take a higher starting withdrawal percentage, as illustrated in\u202f our team\u2019s annual retirement-spending research.",

      "Truck drivers have blocked some major highways in central Mexico to protest the fact the government hasn't paid them for work they did on a tourist train line",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Truck drivers blocked some major highways in central Mexico on Tuesday to protest that the government hasn\u2019t paid them for work they did on a tourist train line.",
      "The protest by truckers blocked two major highways leading north out of Mexico City for a few hours Tuesday morning, and other highways on the Yucatan Peninsula, where they had worked carrying gravel and other materials for the government's Maya Train project.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum acknowledged Tuesday that the subcontractor companies that hired the truck drivers hadn't paid them because the government owed them money.",
      "\u201cThe payments to the companies have started, so that they, in turn, can pay the truck drivers,\u201d Sheinbaum said.",
      "It was the latest in a series of complaints by workers and businessmen who said the cash-strapped government has fallen behind in payments.",
      "Mexico\u2019s federal government is running big budget deficits to pay for ambitious pet projects and entitlement programs from the previous administration.",
      "Last month, suppliers and contractors for the state-owned oil company published an open letter saying they hadn\u2019t been paid $5 billion for work they had done.",
      "\u201cThis situation ... has caused adverse affects on our finances and on the regions where we work,\u201d the Mexican Association of Petroleum Services Companies wrote in the letter.",
      "Under former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who was Sheinbaum\u2019s political mentor, the government began transferring large amounts of money to the state-run Pemex oil company, started large building projects and implemented cash handout programs.",
      "That led to federal budget deficits of about 6% of Mexico\u2019s gross domestic product in 2024. Mexico\u2019s treasury department said it would aim to reduce the deficit to 3.9% of GDP in 2025, but it was unclear if it could achieve that. L\u00f3pez Obrador left behind a lot of unfinished train and oil refinery projects, and Sheinbaum has expanded benefit programs for older people.",
      "In November, the Moody\u2019s ratings agency said it had downgraded the government\u2019s debt outlook from \u201cstable\u201d to \u201cnegative\u201d while reaffirming Mexico\u2019s Baa2 overall credit rating, saying increased government debt represented a risk for Mexico.",
      "The cash crunch has left Sheinbaum scrambling to find money with new and unusual taxes and funding sources.",
      "Earlier this week, Sheinbaum said that much of the money gained by eliminating independent oversight and regulatory agencies will go to the army to fund a rise in soldiers\u2019 pay.",
      "In November, Mexico\u2019s Congress approved charging every cruise ship passenger a $42 immigration fee, with much of that money also going to the armed forces.",
      "L\u00f3pez Obrador and Sheinbaum have put the army in charge of everything airports, airlines and train lines, and many of the military-run projects appear to be big money losers, which may help explain the government\u2019s urge to find extra funding for the armed forces.",
      "For example, the army largely built the \u201cMaya Train,\u201d a tourist line which runs in a loop around the Yucatan Peninsula. But the train has drawn only 20% of the ridership expected when it was proposed.",
      "The Maya Train started service on Dec. 16, 2023. While it\u2019s not completely finished \u2014 two relatively little-used stretches are scheduled to enter service later this month \u2014 the most popular and heavily-travelled parts of the line are already in service.",
      "As of Dec. 8, authorities announced the train line had carried a little more than 600,000 passengers in its first 51 weeks. That is only one-fifth of the 3 million passengers authorities had claimed it would carry per year."

      "\u201cI was just so gratified by the response,\u201d Nolan said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s really thrilling when people respond to your work at any point. But 10 years later, to have new audiences coming and experiencing it in the way that we\u2019d originally intended it on the big IMAX screens and in particular on those IMAX film prints? It\u2019s really rewarding to see that it continues to have a life.\u201d",
      "\u201cInterstellar\u201d had been a labor of love, with Nolan fighting against the tides of a changing industry to use film, certain of its value. Like McConaughey\u2019s Cooper, an astronaut clinging to skills that were all but obsolete in his dust bowl reality, \u201cInterstellar\u201d was made by a celluloid-loving filmmaker when the format was least valued.",
      "\u201cCelluloid film was very threatened. Digital was taking over everything,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cWe put an enormous amount of work and effort into the IMAX 70mm film format release at the time feeling like we didn\u2019t know how much longer we\u2019d be able to do that.\u201d",
      "During its time, \u201cInterstellar\u201d was received warmly and an unambiguous success, but it also had its detractors. Its five Oscar nominations and win were all for crafts. And yet in the decade since, \u201cInterstellar\u201d has become beloved, a true classic. Nolan observed that it was the film that people kept wanting to talk about, telling him what it meant to them and asking if it was ever going to be re-released. Those grand emotions and sentimental themes of love, family and exploration that were a liability with some are now its most cherished qualities.",
      "\u201cA lot of these people were younger people who, it was clear to me, had seen the film in the home and hadn\u2019t had the chance to see it on the big screen,\u201d Nolan said.",
      "While there have been \u201cInterstellar\u201d rereleases internationally, in China and at the Science Museum in London, Nolan saw an opportunity and spoke to IMAX and Paramount, now under a new regime, about a proper North American re-release for its 10th anniversary. The prints, Nolan said, hadn't aged a day.",
      "IMAX hardly needed convincing: They\u2019ve had the anniversary date circled on the calendar. For years, \u201cInterstellar\u201d was by far the biggest request on their social channels.",
      "\u201cWe saw this coming from the beginning,\u201d IMAX CEO Rich Gelfond said. \u201cIt reminded us in a small way of the frenzy around \u2018Oppenheimer.\u2019 But the result is far beyond our expectations.\"",
      "\u201cInterstellar\u201d is now the ninth highest-grossing IMAX release of all time and is closing in on eight (currently occupied by \u201cThe Last Jedi.\u201d) The company is currently exploring options for re-releases in different territories.",
      "The \u201cOppenheimer\" effect was real in redeeming film's value for the business.",
      "IMAX screens accounted for some 20% of the nearly $1 billion this year's Oscar best picture winner made globally (it ranks at No. 5 for IMAX). While filmmakers have long cherished film stock, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d had studios, distributors and theaters taking note of the demand. Earlier this year the film showings of \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d were sold out for four weeks. And there's more to come: Ryan Coogler's new film \u201cSinners,\" opening in March 2025, was shot with IMAX cameras.",
      "The \u201cInterstellar\u201d release was fairly \u201clow key\" when it came to promotion, but it also didn\u2019t need much \u2014 fans made sure of that. Before IMAX had even announced that tickets were on sale, some noticed that AMC had made them available. News spread on socials and overnight every 70mm IMAX showing at the Lincoln Square location in New York had sold out. It wasn\u2019t just the \u201cprimetime\u201d slots either: The 1 AM showtimes were at capacity too.",
      "After the weekend's turnout surpassed expectations, they added more 70mm IMAX screenings through the week which also filled up quickly.",
      "While Nolan is in some ways an anomaly, as the rare filmmaker whose name alone can draw crowds for original fare, there are lessons to be learned from the weekend.",
      "\u201cIt just shows our industry once again that audiences truly understand the difference between a communal, big screen theatrical experience that they crave even on films that they\u2019ve had the opportunities to see in the home,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cThat theatrical experience that we all know and love is so powerful and so exciting. It\u2019s a very clear demonstration of it, especially coming amidst all the great successes right now, \u201cWicked,\u201d\u201cGladiator II,\u201d\u201cMoana 2.\u201d",
      "\"Audiences are coming out in droves for that experience that we all love so much.\u201d",
      "Before the weekend, Nolan was able to see the film again on the big screen for the first time since the original release, accompanied by his Oscar-winning \u201cOppenheimer\u201d cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema. \u201cInterstellar\u201d was their first collaboration and Hoytema\u2019s introduction to IMAX cameras (where he proved that they could be handheld if you tried hard enough).",
      "\u201cIt was really, really fun,\" Nolan said.",
      "He also approved the new 4K UHD \u201cInterstellar\" set that's now available.",
      "Since \u201cOppenheimer's\" big night at the Oscars and Nolan's best director win, there's been much speculation about his next film with near daily rumors circulating about casting and genre, none of which have been officially confirmed. It's not something he's speaking publicly about yet. One thing he will say, however, is that he\u2019s in the throes of intensive testing for a new film technology with IMAX to use in the next production.",
      "\u201cThey have an incredible engineering staff, really brilliant minds doing extraordinary work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see innovation in the celluloid film arena still happening and happening at the highest level possible.\u201d",
      "And he\u2019s still making time to go to the movies. Over the weekend, Nolan went to see \u201cWicked\u201d at a theater in Burbank where he also peeked into one of the IMAX presentations of his film.",
      "\u201cIt was pretty magical to see a full house on that film,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a very special thing to see, 10 years later.\u201d"

Mangione was arrested at a McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, while carrying a gun, mask and writings linking him to the ambush.",
      "Mangione is being held without bail in Pennsylvania on charges of possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. Late Monday, Manhattan prosecutors charged him with five counts, including murder, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a forged instrument.",
      "Here's the latest:",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre says \u201cviolence to combat any sort of corporate greed is unacceptable\u201d and the White House will \u201ccontinue to condemn any form of violence.\u201d",
      "She declined to comment on the investigation into the Dec. 4 shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson or reports that writings belonging to the suspect, Luigi Mangione, said insurance companies care more about profits than their customers.",
      "\u201cThis is horrific,\u201d Jean-Pierre said of the fatal shooting of Thompson as he walked in Manhattan.",
      "He didn\u2019t appear to say anything as deputies led him to a waiting car outside.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply grateful to the men and women of law enforcement whose efforts to solve the horrific murder of Brian Thompson led to the arrest of a suspect in Pennsylvania,\u201d Gov. Hochul said in the statement. \u201cI am coordinating with the District Attorney\u2019s Office and will sign a request for a governor\u2019s warrant to ensure this individual is tried and held accountable. Public safety is my top priority and I\u2019ll do everything in my power to keep the streets of New York safe.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s according to a spokesperson for the governor who said Gov. Hochul will do it as soon as possible.",
      "Luigi Nicholas Mangione, the suspect in the fatal shooting of a healthcare executive in New York City, apparently was living a charmed life: the grandson of a wealthy real estate developer, valedictorian of his elite Baltimore prep school and with degrees from one of the nation\u2019s top private universities.",
      "Friends at an exclusive co-living space at the edge of touristy Waikiki in Hawaii where the 26-year-old Mangione once lived widely considered him a \u201cgreat guy,\u201d and pictures on his social media accounts show a fit, smiling, handsome young man on beaches and at parties.",
      "Now, investigators in New York and Pennsylvania are working to piece together why Mangione may have diverged from this path to make the violent and radical decision to gun down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in a brazen attack on a Manhattan street.",
      "The killing sparked widespread discussions about corporate greed, unfairness in the medical insurance industry and even inspired folk-hero sentiment toward his killer.",
      "\u25b6 Read more about Luigi Mangione",
      "Peter Weeks, the Blair County district attorney, says he\u2019ll work with New York officials to try to return suspect Luigi Mangione there to face charges.",
      "Weeks said the New York charges are \u201cmore serious\u201d than in Blair County.",
      "\u201cWe believe their charges take precedent,\u201d Weeks said, promising to do what\u2019s needed to accommodate New York\u2019s prosecution first.",
      "Weeks spoke to reporters after a brief hearing at which a defense lawyer said Mangione will fight extradition. The defense asked for a hearing on the issue. In the meantime, Mangione will be detained at a state prison in western Pennsylvania.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office said Tuesday it will seek a Governor\u2019s warrant to secure Mangione\u2019s extradition to Manhattan.",
      "Under state law, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul can issue a warrant of arrest demanding Mangione\u2019s return to the state. Such a warrant must recite the facts necessary to the validity of its issuance and be sealed with the state seal. It would then be presented to law enforcement in Pennsylvania to expedite Mangione\u2019s return to New York.",
      "But Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks says it won\u2019t be a substantial barrier to returning Mangione to New York.",
      "He noted that defendants contest extradition \u201call the time,\u201d including in simple retail theft cases.",
      "Dickey, his defense lawyer, questioned whether the second-degree murder charge filed in New York might be eligible for bail under Pennsylvania law, but prosecutors raised concerns about both public safety and Mangione being a potential flight risk, and the judge denied it.",
      "Mangione will continue to be housed at a state prison in Huntingdon.",
      "He has 14 days to challenge the detention.",
      "Prosecutors, meanwhile, have a month to seek a governor\u2019s warrant out of New York.",

      "The account, which hasn\u2019t posted since June, was briefly suspended by X. But after a user inquired about it in a post Monday, Musk responded \u201cThis happened without my knowledge. Looking into it.\u201d The account was later reinstated.",
      "Other social media companies such as Meta have removed his accounts. According to X rules, the platform removes \u201cany accounts maintained by individual perpetrators of terrorist, violent extremist, or mass violent attacks, as well as any accounts glorifying the perpetrator(s), or dedicated to sharing manifestos and/or third party links where related content is hosted.\u201d",
      "Mangione is not accused of perpetrating a terrorist or mass attack \u2014 he has been charged with murder \u2014 and his account doesn\u2019t appear to share any writings about the case.",
      "He shouted something that was partly unintelligible, but referred to an \u201cinsult to the intelligence of the American people.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s there for an arraignment on local charges stemming from his arrest Monday.",
      "He was dressed in an orange jumpsuit as officers led him from a vehicle into the courthouse.",
      "Local defense lawyer Thomas Dickey is expected to represent the 26-year-old at a Tuesday afternoon hearing at the Blair County Courthouse. Dickey declined comment before the hearing.",
      "Mangione could have the Pennsylvania charges read aloud to him and may be asked to enter a plea.",
      "They include possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. In New York, he was charged late Monday with murder in the death of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Mangione likely was motivated by his anger with what he called \u201cparasitic\u201d health insurance companies and a disdain with corporate greed, said a a law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "He wrote that the U.S. has the most expensive healthcare system in the world and that the profits of major corporations continue to rise while \u201cour life expectancy\u201d does not, according to the bulletin, based on a review of the suspect\u2019s hand-written notes and social media postings.",
      "He appeared to view the targeted killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO as a symbolic takedown, asserting in his note that he is the \u201cfirst to face it with such brutal honesty,\u201d the bulletin said.",
      "Mangione called \u201cUnabomber\u201d Ted Kaczynski a \u201cpolitical revolutionary\u201d and may have found inspiration from the man who carried out a series of bombings while railing against modern society and technology, the document said.",
      "A felony warrant filed in New York cites Altoona Officer Christy Wasser as saying she found the writings along with a semi-automatic pistol and an apparent silencer.",
      "The filing echoes earlier statements from NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny who said Mangione had a three-page, handwritten document that shows \u201csome ill will toward corporate America.\u201d",
      "Mangione is now charged in Pennsylvania with being a fugitive of justice.",
      "A customer at the McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where Mangione was arrested said one of his friends had commented beforehand that the man looked like the suspect wanted for the shooting in New York City.",
      "\u201cIt started out almost a little bit like a joke, my one friend thought he looked like the shooter,\u201d said the customer, who declined to give his full name, on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a joke, but we laughed about it,\u201d he added.",
      "The warrant on murder and other charges is a step that could help expedite his extradition from Pennsylvania.",
      "In court papers made public Tuesday, a New York City police detective reiterated key findings in the investigation he said tied Mangione to the killing, including surveillance footage and a fake ID he used to check into a Manhattan hostel on Nov. 24.",
      "Police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania, found that ID when they arrested Mangione on Monday.",
      "Mangione is being held without bail in Pennsylvania on charges of possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. Late Monday, Manhattan prosecutors charged him with five counts, including murder, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a forged instrument.",
      "Mangione doesn\u2019t yet have a lawyer who can speak on his behalf, court officials said.",
      "Images of Mangione released Tuesday by Pennsylvania State Police showed him pulling down his mask in the corner of the McDonald\u2019s while holding what appeared to be hash browns and wearing a winter jacket and ski cap. In another photo from a holding cell, he stood unsmiling with rumpled hair.",
      "Mangione\u2019s cousin, Maryland lawmaker Nino Mangione, announced Tuesday morning that he\u2019s postponing a fundraiser planned later this week at the Hayfields Country Club north of Baltimore, which was purchased by the Mangione family in 1986.",
      "\u201cBecause of the nature of this terrible situation involving my Cousin I do not believe it is appropriate to hold my fundraising event scheduled for this Thursday at Hayfields,\u201d Nino Mangione said in a social media post. \u201cI want to thank you for your thoughts, prayers, and support. My family and I are heartbroken and ask that you remember the family of Mr. Thompson in your prayers. Thank you.\u201d",
      "Officers used New York City\u2019s muscular surveillance system. Investigators analyzed DNA samples, fingerprints and internet addresses. Police went door to door looking for witnesses.",
      "When an arrest came five days later, those sprawling investigative efforts shared credit with an alert civilian\u2019s instincts. A customer at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Pennsylvania noticed another patron who resembled the man in the oblique security-camera photos New York police had publicized.",
      "He remains jailed in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. By late Monday evening, prosecutors in Manhattan had added a charge of murder, according to an online court docket.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether Luigi Nicholas Mangione has an attorney who can comment on the allegations. Asked at Monday\u2019s arraignment whether he needed a public defender, Mangione asked whether he could \u201canswer that at a future date.\u201d"

      "Scottie Scheffler added another trophy to his awesome display Tuesday when he won the Jack Nicklaus Award as PGA Tour player of the year in a landslide, joining Tiger Woods as the only players to win the award three straight times.",
      "Scheffler won 91% of the vote from players and appeared to be the obvious choice given the victories he piled up, including an Olympic gold medal when he shot 62 on the final day.",
      "His seven PGA Tour wins included a second Masters title, and he became the first repeat winner of The Players Championship. He also won the Tour Championship to claim the FedEx Cup. His other four wins were all signature events against the strongest fields \u2014 Bay Hill and Memorial, Hilton Head and Hartford.",
      "While no one could match that year, there was the question of how players would view Xander Schauffele's rare feat of winning two majors in one year, at the PGA Championship and the British Open. Scheffler's standard was too much to overlook.",
      "Schauffele became the first player to win two majors and not be voted player of the year since the award began in 1990. Nick Faldo won the Masters and British Open in 1990, but he was not a PGA Tour member and ineligible for the award.",
      "Rory McIlroy was the third name on the ballot.",
      "Woods is an 11-time winner of the award, winning five straight times (1999 through 2003) and three straight times (2005-2007).",
      "McIlroy is the only other player to win the award three times, in 2012, 2014 and 2019.",
      "\u201cScottie took on challenges from the best players in the world on the biggest stages all season, and being honored as PGA Tour player of the year is the ultimate sign of respect from his peers,\" Commissioner Jay Monahan said.",
      "Scheffler also won the Byron Nelson Award for the second straight year for having the lowest scoring average. Overlooked as he kept winning titles was his streak of 28 consecutive rounds under par to start the year.",
      "He was not over par in any round until Saturday at the PGA Championship, the day after he was arrested going into Valhalla as a traffic fatality was being investigated. The charges were dropped a few weeks later, a strange episode in an otherwise spotless season.",
      "The PGA Tour keeps a huge menu of statistics \u2014 one of them \u201cdistance from the edge of the fairway\u201d \u2014 but Scheffler was around the top at most of the big ones involving strokes gained. He was first overall and approach to the green, second off the tee. He was 77th in putting, tried a new \u201cclaw\u201d putting grip in the Bahamas last week and won the Hero World Challenge by six.",
      "He shattered the PGA Tour earnings record, somewhat inevitable given the spike in prize money this year with 11 tournaments with prize funds of $20 million or more, not including the four majors.",
      "Scheffler won just over $29.2 million in 18 official tournaments with prize money, along with the $25 million FedEx Cup bonus and the $8 million bonus for leading the regular season.",

    "summary": "For the second straight Major League Baseball offseason, a norm-shattering contract has been the talk of the winter, with Juan Soto agreeing with the New York Mets on a $765 million, 15-year deal that&rsquo;s the richest in baseball history",

      "For the second straight Major League Baseball offseason, a norm-shattering contract has been the talk of the winter, with Juan Soto agreeing with the New York Mets on a $765 million, 15-year deal that\u2019s the richest in baseball history",
      "For the second straight Major League Baseball offseason, a norm-shattering contract has been the talk of the winter, with Juan Soto agreeing with the New York Mets on a $765 million, 15-year deal that's the richest in baseball history.",
      "It comes almost exactly one year after the Los Angeles Dodgers forked out a princely sum of $700 million on a 10-year, heavily deferred deal for two-way Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani. They are believed to be the two richest contracts in pro sports history.",
      "The way it's going, a contract approaching $1 billion doesn't seem out of the question.",
      "But several factors are working against it \u2014 at least in the near future.",
      "There's reason to believe the megadeals for Ohtani and Soto are unicorns in the baseball world. Both players are uniquely talented, surely, but both also had unusual circumstances propelling their value into the stratosphere.",
      "Ohtani is the greatest two-way player in baseball history, capable of improving any team on both sides of the ball. He's also the rare baseball player who has true international appeal. His every move ( like his unexpected marriage announcement ) is followed closely in his native Japan, adding another 125 million potential fans who buy merchandise, watch him play and help fill the Dodgers' coffers.",
      "Then there's Soto \u2014 a four-time All-Star and on-base machine who won a World Series with the Washington Nationals in 2019. The X-factor for him is he became a free agent at the prime age of 26, which is extremely hard to do under current MLB rules.",
      "Players have to be in the big leagues for six years before testing free agency. The precocious Soto debuted at 19 with the Nats, making him part of a rare group of players who reached the highest level of professional baseball as a teenager. That accelerated his free agency timeline.",
      "It's rare for players to debut that young, and rarer still for them to develop into stars and test the open market the first chance they get. Two recent examples are Manny Machado and Bryce Harper, who both reached free agency in 2019. Machado signed a free-agent record $300 million contract with San Diego, and Harper overtook him days later with a $330 million contract to join the Phillies.",
      "Most players debut in the big leagues from ages 22 to 26, which means free agency comes in their late 20s or early 30s. A typical example is Yankees slugger Aaron Judge, who is one of this generation's great players but didn't hit the market until he was 30.",
      "Judge played three seasons of college baseball for Fresno State before getting drafted by the Yankees in 2013 at age 21 \u2014 already two years older than Soto was when he made his MLB debut. It took a few years for the budding superstar to reach the majors, and he was 25 when he had his breakout season in 2018, smashing 52 homers to earn AL Rookie of the Year honors.",
      "By the time he reached free agency after the 2022 season, he had already passed age 30. It's a major factor that led to him signing a $360 million, nine-year deal with the Yankees, which seems downright reasonable these days after the Ohtani and Soto deals.",
      "Two major trends are colliding that will make it harder for guys like Soto to hit free agency in their mid 20s.",
      "First, MLB teams have been more likely in recent years to take college players early in the draft, betting on more experienced talents. Just 10 high school players were drafted among the top 30 picks in the 2024 draft.",
      "Second, teams are more eager to lock up young, premium talent on long-term deals very early in their careers, well before they hit free agency. Sometimes before they even reach the majors.",
      "Since Soto, just two players have debuted in MLB before their 20th birthday \u2014 Elvis Luciano and Junior Caminero. Luciano hasn't been back to the majors since his 2019 cup of coffee. Caminero is now 21 and has only played in 50 big league games.",
      "Among those that debuted at 20: Fernando Tatis Jr. signed a $340 million, 14-year deal with San Diego in 2021, years before reaching the open market. Milwaukee's Jackson Chourio got an $82 million, eight-year deal before even reaching the big leagues.",
      "Young stars Corbin Carroll ($111 million, eight years with Arizona), Bobby Witt Jr. ($288 million, 11 years with Kansas City) and Julio Rodriguez ($209.3 million, 12 years with Seattle) also got massive guarantees early in their 20s to forgo an early free agency.",
      "The exception and wild card: Blue Jays slugger Vladimir Guerrero Jr. will be a 26-year-old free agent next offseason. Guerrero hasn't been as consistent in his young career as Soto, but a standout 2025 season could position him to threaten Soto's deal.",
      "More likely is that the player to pass Soto isn't in the majors yet \u2014 and might not even be in pro baseball. When 25-year-old Alex Rodriguez signed his record $252 million, 10-year deal with Texas in 2001, it took over a decade for another player to match that total, when Albert Pujols got $240 million over 10 years from the Angels in 2012.",
      "For many players, passing up life-changing money in their early or mid 20s is too enticing, even if it means that they might not maximize their value on the free agent market later in their careers.",
      "Soto was determined to test the market. He famously turned down a $440 million, 15-year offer to stay with the Washington Nationals in 2022, betting that he could make even more as a free agent.",
      "Not many players would turn down that kind of cash.",
      "Then again, that's what makes Soto so unique. And it's also why his $765 million deal could be the industry standard for some time.",

      "\u201cThe Cardinals are changing direction, which is fine. All teams do that,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cSo if that\u2019s the way it is and they\u2019ve said it might be beneficial to move you and they were open and communicated about it, he's like: 'I get it. Let\u2019s just try and find a place where they\u2019re in a different place,' where he could just jump in and help the team go to the next level.\u201d",

      "On the first day of Sasaki\u2019s 45-day window to sign with an MLB team, agent Joel Wolfe said the 23-year-old right-hander likely will sign shortly after the 2025 international signing pool window opens on Jan. 15 and wouldn\u2019t wait until the Jan. 23 deadline.",
      "\u201cThe incentive to sign as early as possible is to get the visa process going so that he would be on time for spring training,\u201d Wolfe said Tuesday during a half-hour news conference in the winter meetings media room.",
      "Sasaki helped Japan win the 2023 World Baseball Classic and has a fastball clocked at 102.5 mph. The 6-foot-2 pitcher is 29-15 with a 2.10 ERA over four injury-shortened seasons with the Chiba Lotte Marines of Nippon Professional Baseball\u2019s Pacific League.",
      "Because he is under 25, Sasaki is treated by MLB as an international amateur and subject to signing bonus pools for minor league contracts usually allocated to 16-year-old Latin American prospects. The Los Angeles Dodgers kept $2,502,500 open in their 2024 bonus pool, leading other teams to speculate whether an agreement had been reached.",
      "\u201cThere was a lot of discussion in the media, in the league, in NPB about Roki\u2019s situation,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cThere were some accusations, allegations, all of them false, made about predetermined deals, things like that. However, MLB rightly wanted to make sure that this was going to be a fair and level playing field for everyone, so they did their due diligence and interviewed numerous parties ahead of time to make sure that that was the case.\u201d",
      "Wolfe said MLB preferred Sasaki\u2019s posting availability extend into the 2025 period, where team amounts will range from $7,555,500 to $5,146,200.",
      "\u201cMy advice to him is don\u2019t make a decision based on that because the long-term arc of your career is where you\u2019re going to earn your money,\u201d he said.",
      "Sasaki was 10-5 with a 2.35 ERA in 18 starts this year, limited by shoulder inflammation, and 7-4 with a 1.78 ERA in 15 starts in 2023, when he had an oblique injury. He pitched a perfect game against Orix in April 2022 and Wolfe said the experience of WBC games helped convince Sasaki to head to MLB earlier rather than later.",
      "\u201cRoki is somewhat quiet. He has a dry sense of humor. He\u2019s very witty. He\u2019s not verbose,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t necessarily love people that are verbose. Sometimes I will be talking to him and talking about some very important things, and at the end I\u2019ll ask him if he has any questions and he\u2019ll say: \u2018That was a lot of talking.\u2019\u201d",
      "Wolfe said Sasaki was traveling to the U.S. on Tuesday and teams will be invited to a central location for meetings starting next week,",
      "Sasaki intends to return to Japan before Christmas and stay in Japan for a week or two, and then decide whether he wants to visit MLB cities when he returns.",
      "Some teams already have sent PowerPoint and video presentations.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s no better place to do it than in New York with the pinstripes,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cWe recognize that this is a pitcher that has a chance to be an ace over here.\"",
      "Sasaki was 9 when his father and grandparents were killed during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. That experience impacted Sasaki\u2019s decision to sign this winter rather than wait until after the 2026 season, when he would be considered a foreign professional like the Dodgers\u2019 Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who signed a $325 million, 12-year contract last December.",
      "\u201cIf you look at some of the things that have happened in his life, some of the tragedies that have happened in his life, he does not take anything for granted,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cIt is not an absolute lock, as some people in baseball have assumed, that two years from now he\u2019s going to get a Yamamoto contract. Baseball just doesn\u2019t work that way. ... He could have Tommy John surgery. He\u2019s had two shoulder injuries. He\u2019s had oblique injuries.\u201d",

Sasaki's relationship with reporters in Japan has not been smooth.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of negativity in the media directed at him because he has expressed interest at going to play for MLB at such a young age and that\u2019s considered in Japan to be very disrespectful and sort of swimming upstream,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cA lot of people jumped on board there creating some false rumors about him and his family, and it was very detrimental to his mental state.\u201d",

      "Brooks Koepka is expecting Ryder Cup vibes when LIV Golf gets to square off against PGA Tour stars in Las Vegas next week",
      "Brooks Koepka feels like he could be stepping into another Ryder Cup environment, match play with bragging rights at stake, even if it's only two-man teams competing in one match instead of 12-man teams in 28 matches.",
      "Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau, each a major champion the last two years while playing for LIV Golf, take on Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy from the PGA Tour in a made-for-TV match at Shadow Creek in Nevada on Dec. 17.",
      "Scheffler is the No. 1 player in the world ranking after a nine-win season, which included another Masters and an Olympic gold medal. He faced off only four times against Koepka and DeChambeau.",
      "Koepka was asked if Scheffler could have won so much had he faced a full lineup of stars.",
      "\u201cScottie had a hell of a year. I think it\u2019s arguably one of the best years the tour has ever seen,\u201d Koepka said Tuesday. \u201cBryson had a hell of a year \u2014 he played 10 times better than I did. I played with him enough to know what he could have done on the PGA Tour. We all have a good feel how we would have fared on any tour.",
      "\u201cI think he (Scheffler) would have won a lot of his golf tournaments,\u201d Koepka said. \u201cBut I think we would have put up a good fight. It would have been interesting.\u201d",
      "He thinks \u201cThe Crypto.com Showdown\u201d at Shadow Creek north of Las Vegas will be enough to pique the interest of fans. Not only is it a rare chance outside the majors to see the best from LIV Golf and the PGA Tour, it has that spirit of team element.",
      "\u201cLet's be real \u2014 wouldn't you want to see a LIV versus PGA Tour Ryder Cup-style thing? That is what it is,\u201d Koepka said. \u201cThis is growing into a big thing. That's what will draw the fans.\u201d",
      "Except for a few European tour events, the stars from LIV Golf and the PGA Tour meet only four times a year in the majors. The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, which funds LIV Golf, and PGA Tour Enterprises have been negotiating a commercial deal. Still to be determined is how a minority investment from PIF would reunite the golf world.",
      "\u201cWhat we're doing is so unique for golf. It could start something going into the future,\u201d Koepka said.",
      "The PGA Tour signed off on the Las Vegas match by giving Scheffler and McIlroy releases to play. It is at least a start to more appearances, even if neither Koepka nor DeChambeau has any idea what that might look like.",
      "\u201cThe showdown is a great showcase for bringing the two tours a bit together,\u201d DeChambeau said. \u201cAnd I think what we're doing to do next year, all of us aligned, is bringing something a little bigger and badder, so we can have a couple of times \u2014 at least one more time \u2014 where we can see most of the best players on both sides competing.\u201d",

      "The athletes whose lawsuit against the NCAA is primed to pave the way for schools to pay them directly also want a players\u2019 association to represent them in the complex contract negotiations that have overtaken the industry",
      "The athletes whose lawsuit against the NCAA is primed to pave the way for schools to pay them directly also want a players' association to represent them in the complex contract negotiations that have overtaken the sport.",
      "Grant House, Sedona Prince and Nya Harrison wrote to the judge overseeing what's known as the House settlement, saying that although they are generally happy with the terms of the proposed settlement \u201cthere still remains a critical need for structural changes to protect athletes and prevent the failures of the past.\u201d",
      "That, they said, would be a players' association, which they believe will help their voices be better heard as the NCAA and its schools move toward a system to share hundreds of millions in TV and ticket revenue with players.",
      "The players said an association would help standardize name-image-likeness (NIL) contracts to establish minimum payments and health protections \u201cand to create an ecosystem where athletes can thrive.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile professional leagues include athletes in these decisions through their respective players' associations, the college system continues to prevent our players' association from representing us at the decision-making tables,\u201d the letter said.",
      "The settlement, with a price tag of $2.8 billion that will be distributed over the next 10 years to players both past and present, does not address whether athletes should be considered employees of the schools. That's an issue the NCAA is asking Congress to prevent for fear the costs could wreck college sports.",
      "The NCAA did not immediately respond to a message from The Associated Press seeking comment Tuesday.",
      "Earlier this year, the head of the National College Players Association confirmed that a licensing organization that works with the NFL Players\u2019 Association had emailed thousands of college football players, encouraging them to join the NCPA. Separately, the chairman of another group trying to organize college athletes, athletes.org, said it already had some 4,000 members. The players who wrote the letter said they wanted to work with athletes.org.",
      "A hearing to approve the settlement is set for April 7. The request could shape how U.S. Judge Claudia Wilken views the settlement's long-term chances of succeeding, but plaintiffs' attorney Jeffrey Kessler said the letter was an endorsement of the settlement and he doesn't expect it to impact the agreement.",
      "\u201cAll three of these athletes fully support approval of the settlement but wanted to express their additional views that a players' association is also desirable,\" Kessler said. \u201cI salute their devotion to these issues and their fellow college athletes.\u201d",
      "Whether college athletes can ever be considered school employees is a thorny topic. There are multiple issues in front of the National Labor Relations Board, including a complaint against USC and the Pac-12; a unionization effort by the men\u2019s basketball team at Dartmouth; an unfair labor complaint against Notre Dame; and a federal lawsuit in Pennsylvania filed by former Villanova football player Trey Johnson.",
      "All of it could lead to college athletes being granted employee status, though court battles are assured.",

      "Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco is scheduled to go to trial Thursday in the Dominican Republic in a sexual abuse case involving a 14-year-old girl",
      "Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco is scheduled to go to trial Thursday in the Dominican Republic in a sexual abuse case involving a 14-year-old girl.",
      "Now 23, Franco was having an All-Star season in 2023 before Dominican authorities began investigating allegations he had been in a relationship with a minor and paid her mother thousands of dollars for her consent.",
      "Here's what to know about the trial:",
      "Franco has been charged with sexually abusing a minor, sexual and commercial exploitation against a minor, and human trafficking. After an investigation that lasted over a year, judge Pascual Valenzuela of the northern province of Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, ruled in September that the evidence presented by prosecutors was worthy of the case moving to trial.",
      "Documents that prosecutors presented to the judge in July and were viewed by The Associated Press alleged that Franco, through his mother Yudelka Aybar, transferred 1 million pesos or $17,000 to the mother of the minor on Jan. 5, 2023, to consent to the abuse. The mother of the minor has been charged with money laundering and is under house arrest.",
      "Prosecutors say that the minor\u2019s mother went from being a bank employee to leading an ostentatious life and acquiring assets using the funds she received from Franco. During raids on the house of the minor\u2019s mother, prosecutors say they found $68,500 and $35,000 that they allege was delivered by Franco.",
      "After the hearing in September, Franco said \u201ceverything is in God\u2019s hands.\u201d He has otherwise refused to speak to the media.",
      "The trial will be held Dec. 12 at a court in the northern province of Puerto Plata. His case will be heard by either three or five judges. There are no jury trials in the Dominican Republic. The judges will hear the arguments from both sides and the witnesses' testimony, and then analyze the evidence and deliver a verdict. The trial could take up to eight months to conclude, based on the average duration of trials in the Dominican Republic.",
      "If convicted, Franco could face up to 20 years in prison.",
      "Franco has been free on supervised release, although he had been required to make monthly control visits to the judge.",
      "He was also arrested and granted another supervised release in November for illegally carrying a gun in his vehicle. The arrest followed an argument in an apartment complex parking lot. Another man and a woman also were detained in the confrontation. Two firearms were seized, police said. Dominican judge Viamerca Ruiz said Franco needs to report to court once a month while he is being investigated for carrying the firearm that was registered under his uncle\u2019s name. One of Franco's lawyers said because the gun has a license, \u201cthere's nothing illegal about it.\u201d",
      "A conviction for illegally possessing a firearm could prompt a three- to five-year prison sentence.",
      "No, but he was for nearly a year after Dominican authorities opened their probe.",
      "Franco, who signed a $182 million, 11-year contract with the Rays in 2021, was briefly placed on the restricted list and then administrative leave in August 2023 when Dominican authorities opened their investigation. Because administrative leave is not disciplinary under the sport's joint domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy, Franco was paid during that time.",
      "Technically, there is no leave during the offseason, and Franco was again placed on administrative leave at the start of the 2024 season until prosecutors filed the current charges on July 10. At that time, MLB placed Franco \u2014 who had a $2 million salary in 2024 \u2014 on its restricted list, cutting off the pay he had been receiving under administrative leave.",
      "He had been receiving 50% of his salary on administrative leave, a person familiar with his situation told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity because that detail had not been disclosed publicly. That meant Franco accrued $559,140, or half of his salary for 104 days of the 186-day season.",
      "MLB is likely to wait until the Dominican trial is concluded before deciding whether there will be any discipline.",

      "But an ugly win over Carolina in which Jalen Hurts only threw 21 passes for 108 yards left wide receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith in a bad mood. He made it clear the offense, specifically the passing attack, wasn\u2019t playing up to standard.",
      "He\u2019s right. Hurts has thrown for fewer than 200 yards in three straight games. But Saquon Barkley is running at a record-setting pace so the Eagles haven\u2019t had to rely on Hurts throwing to Brown and Smith as much as they have in the past.",
      "Brown caught four passes on four targets for 43 yards while Smith had four catches on six targets for 37 yards and one touchdown against the Panthers.",

      "But the damage was done.",
      "Or was it?",
      "While social media ran wild with news there\u2019s more trouble in Philadelphia, the Eagles have been here before. They fell apart last year after a 10-1 start, dropping six of their final seven games, including a lopsided loss in the playoffs to Tampa Bay.",

      "An Argentine court has dropped aggravated sexual assault charges against two professional French rugby players accused of raping a woman after a match in the country earlier this year",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- An Argentine court on Tuesday dropped aggravated sexual assault charges against two professional French rugby players accused of raping a woman after playing a match in the country earlier this year.",
      "The judge in Mendoza, some 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) west of the capital, Buenos Aires, dismissed the case against the 21-year-old athletes, Hugo Auradou and Oscar J\u00e9gou, citing insufficient evidence.",
      "\u201cThe facts under investigation do not constitute a crime,\" the court said.",
      "The explosive case began in July, when a 39-year-old Argentine woman filed a police complaint alleging that she was beaten, choked and repeatedly raped by the rugby players in their Mendoza hotel room.",
      "The rugby players have admitted to having sex with the plaintiff \u2014 whom they met at during an alcohol-fueled club night after their July 7 victory against Argentina\u2019s Pumas \u2014 but insisted that the encounter was consensual. They were held in preventive custody, then placed under house arrest, for a month.",
      "The defense said the dismissal reinforced their faith in the justice system.",
      "\u201cI think it will be a turning point,\u201d Germ\u00e1n Hnatow, an attorney representing one of the two players, told Radio Mitre Mendoza, a local radio station. \"There are many false accusations in terms of sexual crimes, in terms of gender violence, which cause harm.\u201d",
      "The plaintiff can appeal the ruling. She has not said whether she intends to and her defense lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Over the past few months, the case slowly unraveled as the defense punched holes in the woman\u2019s description of events. Citing questionable evidence presented before the court \u2014 including WhatsApp voice messages the plaintiff sent to her friend joking and boasting about the rough sex she had with them \u2014 the prosecution in September approved the athletes' return to France under certain conditions.",
      "The plaintiff's lawyer has explained any inconsistencies in her account as the result of her \u201cshock and extreme stress.\u201d She underwent physical examinations as part of the investigation and was found to have an acute bleeding ulcer and other injuries that she claimed were related to her assault.",
      "Dragging on for several months, the investigation has stunned the French rugby world. The French Rugby Federation expressed its \u201crelief and satisfaction\" with the judge's decision. It said the athletes, who had been suspended due to the seriousness of the allegations, would be eligible to return to the national team \u201cif their sporting performances allow for it.\u201d",
      "It wasn't the only scandal to hit the touring French team during its stay in Argentina. The federation separately fined and suspended French fullback Melvyn Jaminet for 34 weeks over a racist outburst that he posted on social media.",
      "The federation said that this close shave with the law served as a reminder \u201cof the need to create new conditions to prevent and avoid risky behavior in high-level rugby, in order to train responsible and exemplary players.\u201d",

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- There won't be a Stewart-Haas Racing in NASCAR next season now that Hall of Famer Tony Stewart has left the series and the four-car organization he co-owned with Formula 1 team owner Gene Haas.",
      "There also won't be a JTG Daugherty Racing team, but that's merely a rebrand under new ownership of the one-car organization that won Talladega in 2024 with Ricky Stenhouse Jr. There was no driver change for the No. 47 Chevrolet under what is now known as Hyak Motorsports.",
      "But SHR? Well, that put four drivers on the free-agent market and the future of three of its vaunted charters in limbo. The team will now be called Haas Factory \u2014 closer to what Haas F1 is known as \u2014 and Cole Custer returns from the Xfinity Series to NASCAR's top level to drive the car.",
      "The existing SHR drivers have taken seats all across the grid.",
      "Chase Briscoe, the only SHR driver to win a Cup race in 2024 and make the playoffs, probably had the softest landing. He was snapped up by Joe Gibbs Racing when Martin Truex Jr. decided to scale back to part-time racing in 2025.",
      "Josh Berry will replace Harrison Burton at Wood Brothers Racing in a move that both keeps him in a Ford but also Team Penske equipment. Penske drivers have won the last three Cup championships.",
      "Noah Gragson is slated to move to Front Row Motorsports, but that team joined 23XI Racing in refusing to sign NASCAR's final offer on charters and now is embroiled in an antitrust lawsuit against the sanctioning body. Front Row and 23XI are both hoping to expand to three cars in 2025 \u2014 but their current charters expire at the end of this month and, unless an agreement is reached, the teams will have to compete as \u201copen\u201d cars with no guarantee of a spot in the field or other protections.",
      "Further, to expand, both teams planned purchases of a charter each from SHR. NASCAR says there is no deal for charters on the table for 23XI and Front Row, and any transfer from SHR will not be honored.",
      "Ryan Preece was the final SHR driver to land a seat. He'll move to RFK Racing, which will grow from two cars to three for next season. RFK did not buy one of the SHR charters and instead will lease one in 2025 from Rick Ware Racing.",
      "In other driver moves for 2025, Kaulig Racing will have another lineup as it again moves AJ Allmendinger up from the Xfinity Series and has hired Ty Dillon to replace Daniel Hemric.",
      "Michael McDowell left Front Row for Spire Motorsports, which also brought back Justin Haley, the only driver to win a Cup race in Spire's short history.",
      "Shane van Gisbergen, the dramatic winner in his first-ever Cup race back in 2023, will race full-time at NASCAR's top level as Trackhouse Racing expands to three cars.",
      "Zane Smith, a former Truck Series champion, is slated to become the third driver at Front Row while Riley Herbst was promoted from the Xfinity Series. But with those two teams suing NASCAR and NASCAR saying the purchase of SHR's charters will not be approved, their fate remains unknown if the teams continue expansion plans as \u201copen\u201d cars.",
      "There are a handful of notable crew chief changes, starting with the offseason surprise at Joe Gibbs Racing to move Denny Hamlin crew chief Chris Gabehart into a management role. Bubba Wallace at 23XI, the team co-owned by Hamlin, also will have a new crew chief because his also was promoted.",
      "Jeremy Bullins, a longtime Penske employee, left Wood Brothers Racing to reunite with Brad Keselowski at RFK Racing. Rodney Childers, who spent more than a decade at SHR and won a Cup title there with Kevin Harvick, will move to Spire to be Haley's crew chief.",

      "Every shot tells a story and there were plenty of them this year in golf",
      "A driver off the deck and a 3-wood off a tee. One shot was simply to make the cut. Another was to win a major.",
      "Every shot tells a story, and there were plenty of them in 2024. Not all of them belong to Scottie Scheffler and Xander Schauffele, the two players who stood above all others.",
      "What follows are memorable shots that defined a memorable year.",
      "Byeong Hun An was two shots behind with four holes to play at the Genesis Championship in South Korea. It was time to make something happen no matter the risk. He was 290 yards away from an elevated green with water on the left. He hit driver off the deck and it was close to perfection, hitting the green and rolling out to 8 feet. An had to settle for birdie, but he went on to beat Tom Kim in a playoff for his second European tour title.",
      "Bryson DeChambeau hit only five fairways in the final round at Pinehurst No. 2, the fewest by a U.S. Open champion in 17 years. His best tee shot came on the 13th hole. He had just made bogey to fall two shots behind Rory McIlroy when DeChambeau drilled 3-wood onto the green to make birdie and stay close enough to overtake him in the end.",
      "Rafael Campos was tied for the lead going into the final round of the Bermuda Championship, aiming for his first PGA Tour victory and playing in a raging wind. On the par-5 seventh, he ripped a 2-iron from 256 yards to 2 feet for eagle that sent him on his way to becoming the first Puerto Rican to win on tour since Chi Chi Rodriguez.",
      "Bernhard Langer was trying to do the unthinkable \u2014 win for an 18th consecutive season on the PGA Tour Champions \u2014 when he was in a fairway bunker in a playoff against Y.E. Yang in the Ascension Charity Classic. The 67-year-old Langer hit hybrid out of the sand to 15 feet, an amazing shot at any age. Yang won the playoff, but Langer showed he had the goods. And he proved it by winning the last event of the year to extend a record among the most untouchable in golf.",
      "Xander Schauffele needed birdie on the par-5 18th at Valhalla to win his first major at the PGA Championship. Just his luck, his drive rolled down through the fairway and down the bank of a bunker. He stood in the sand with the ball well above his feet and water down the right side. Schauffele hit 4-iron so cleanly it rolled nearly to the green, leaving him a 35-yard pitch to 6 feet and a birdie putt to win.",
      "Honorable mention: Scottie Scheffler, coming off a double bogey, hitting 4-iron to 5 feet for birdie on the par-3 ninth hole on his way to winning the FedEx Cup.",
      "Chris Kirk was back in The Sentry at Kapalua for the first time in eight years, an absence that included stepping away because of alcoholism. Kirk was tied for the lead on Sunday and had 209 yards over a gorge on the par-4 17th in wind so deceptive he wasn't sure if it was a 7-iron or a 5-iron. He picked the 5-iron, stayed committed and hit it to 2 feet. The birdie carried him to a 65 and a one-shot victory, assuring his return next month.",
      "Nelly Korda already tied an LPGA record with five straight wins, including the first major of the year. She was a heavy favorite in the U.S. Women's Open at Lancaster Country Club. Three holes into the championship, it was over. She hit 6-iron \u2014 most players were hitting one or two clubs shorter \u2014 into a back bunker. She blasted out through the green and into the creek. From the fairway, her next two shots went into the water. She wound up with a 10, shot 80 and missed the cut.",
      "Francesco Molinari had not been the same since winning the British Open and going 5-0 in the Ryder Cup. He was due a break and he got one at his final hole Friday in the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2. He hit 7-iron just over the bunker and into the cup for a hole-in-one to make the cut on the number.",
      "Scottie Scheffler was on his way to a stunning rally on the final day at the Olympics when his drive on the 17th hole buried in deep rough. He gouged an 8-iron out and onto the green to 18 feet and holed the putt to take the lead. The rare show of emotion indicated how big that birdie was. Scheffler shot 62 to win the gold medal.",
      "Lottie Woad of England was shots behind with five to play in the Augusta National Women's Amateur when she delivered a charge so familiar to Masters champions. That included birdies on her last two holes for a 69 and a one-shot victory, the last one a 9-iron to 15 feet for what turned out to be the winner.",
      "Rory McIlroy had let tournaments get away in the majors (U.S. Open), at home (Irish Open) and in the European flagship event (Wentworth). He closed out the year in the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai, locked in a duel with Rasmus Hojgaard. They were tied when McIlroy took on a flag over the water on the 16th hole with a pitching wedge and stuffed it for a tap-in birdie that carried him to victory and the perfect way to end a long year.",
      "Honorable mention: Xander Schauffele with pitching wedge to 2 feet on the 11th hole at Royal Troon when he won the British Open. He made the only birdie on No. 11 in the final round.",
      "Bryson DeChambeau had a one-shot lead going to the final hole of the U.S. Open when he missed another fairway and put his next one in a front bunker, 55 yards away, one of the hardest shots in golf to judge. His sand wedge goes down as among the most famous shots in a career already filled with them, 4 feet away for a winning par at Pinehurst No. 2.",
      "Scottie Scheffler won the Masters by four shots, but it wasn't always that comfortable. He was tied with Collin Morikawa and Ludvig Aberg, one ahead of Max Homa, when his lob wedge at No. 9 flew past the hole, caught the ridge and was inches from going into the cup. He led the rest of the way.",
      "Grayson Murray felt he was starting to turn the corner in his personal life and on the golf course. No moment was bigger than the Sony Open, when he won a three-man playoff by making a 40-foot birdie putt across the 18th green. It remains a happy memory of Murray, who took his own life in May.",

    "story": [
      "Monaco\u2019s strategy of developing young talents who often go on to represent their national sides is bringing both sporting and financial benefits to the French league club",
      "MONACO -- Years before a statue in his honor was erected in the south-east corner of the Emirates Stadium, a young and ambitious Thierry Henry was honing his skills hundreds of miles from London, in a warmer, sunnier place on the French Riviera.",
      "The AS Monaco training academy.",
      "Henry, who went on to become the all-time top scorer for Arsenal, is one of the many French soccer stars who have emerged from the famed training program. Others include Lilian Thuram, David Trezeguet, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Henry's Arsenal teammate Emmanuel Petit.",
      "Several graduates from the academy are in the Monaco squad travelling to London to play Arsenal on Wednesday in the Champions League, including Maghnes Akliouche and Eliesse Ben Seghir.",
      "Ben Seghir, 19, is already a Morocco international and Monaco\u2019s top scorer in the French league. Akliouche\u2019s technical brilliance has not gone unnoticed and the 22-year-old is on the radar of big European clubs.",
      "\u201cWe are feeding the first team with good players coming from the academy every season,\u201d Monaco CEO Thiago Scuro told The Associated Press during an interview at the club. \u201cIt\u2019s a very beneficial setup.\u201d",
      "Marshalling the midfield and capable to play in defense, 21-year-old Soungoutou Magassa is another product of Monaco\u2019s youth program.",
      "Originally from the Paris region, Magassa was scouted when he was 12. A silver medalist with France at the Paris Olympics, he recently scored his first professional goal against Benfica in the Champions League.",
      "\u201cI was not necessarily the strongest at the academy, the one with the brightest future,\u201d Magassa told AP. \u201cBut we were very close, helping each other and aiming in the same direction. There was a lot of talent, and its shows today. Many of us have turned pro.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether Monaco coach Adi H\u00fctter\u2019s youthful side will emulate the class of 2017, when the Monaco of then-emerging Mbapp\u00e9 defeated Manchester City and dazzled past Borussia Dortmund to reach the semifinals of the Champions League. But there are clear signs that the club\u2019s commitment to youth development is once again paying off.",
      "After five games in the league phase of the Champions League, Monaco is the highest ranked French team, level on points with Arsenal and well positioned to make it to the knockout stage.",
      "\u201cWe want to play an aggressive football, very dynamic, and create a lot of chances, which is part of the DNA of Monaco,\u201d Scuro said. \u201cWe recruit players for this kind of football.\u201d",
      "Monaco celebrated its 100th anniversary last summer, but it was not before the mid-1950\u2019s that it really took off in the minuscule city-state on the French Riviera more famous for its billionaires.",
      "Because it's so small, Monaco has no league of its own. Its only professional soccer club \u2014 whose full name is Association Sportive de Monaco Football Club \u2014 has always played in the French league system.",
      "For long, the small population and the lack of youngsters playing soccer in the area was a handicap. The creation in 1975 of the academy known as the Diagonale \u2014 a reference to the diagonal stripe adorning the team\u2019s jersey designed by Princess Grace \u2014 changed the dynamics.",
      "Created by former president Jean-Louis Campora, the youth academy recruited some of the best coaches from the French national soccer institute. Campora quickly convinced parents of young soccer players across France it was the best place for their kids to thrive.",
      "During an era when foreign players were limited to three per team, the academy helped the club playing in the French league establish itself as a powerhouse. Monaco has won eight domestic league titles, five French Cups and made it to the Champions League final in 2004.",
      "With an annual budget of about 10 million euros ($10.6 million), the academy has trained many players who went on to represent their countries as pros. Potential recruits are assessed by some 20 people before enrolment decisions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful spider\u2019s web,\" said S\u00e9bastien Muet, head of the academy.",
      "The academy takes Under-17 players \u2014 some as young as 14 \u2014 who can stay at the center until they are 21-22. All are boys. While Monaco has a women\u2019s team, it\u2019s a small, separate entity with no link to the men's club.",
      "Some 55 trainees are currently enrolled at the center located just a stone\u2019s throw from Monaco\u2019s Louis II stadium. The students sleep, eat, study and receive medical care in the building.",
      "In addition to matches, they train between 12 and 14 hours per week. They attend secondary school 22 hours per week, supervised by teachers hired by the club.",
      "When the AP visited the center last week, a group of students were hard at work on \u201cThe Arctic, an attractive and fragile polar environment.\"",
      "For Muet, helping the young players find the \"right balance\" between sports and studies is a priority.",
      "\"We want to help them to be capable of thinking and analyzing, to be capable of flourishing in whatever field they choose for their professional life,\u201d he told AP.",
      "The busy schedule does not leave much time for recovery and leisure, beyond playing Playstation. Meanwhile, the director of studies Virginie Barilaro-Gollino tries her best to broaden her students\u2019 horizons.",
      "\u201cWe lack time, but we try to organize as many extracurricular activities as possible. Such as visits to the Monte-Carlo Ballets. Or bakery contests,\u201d she said.",
      "Promoting homegrown players to the pro team also contributes to healthy finances.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need to spend money to go abroad,\u201d Scuro said. \u201cYou have the solution in house.\u201d",
      "It has not always been obvious, though.",
      "A decade ago, Monaco was splashing cash to sign some of soccer's biggest stars. The club made headlines for recruiting Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez and Joao Moutinho for a combined fee of 130 million euros.",
      "At the time, Monaco looked determined to fight toe-to-toe with big spenders PSG for domestic supremacy. But facing a UEFA probe for overspending on transfers and wages as part of Financial Fair Play, owner Dmitry Rybolovlev \u2014 a Russian billionaire who invested millions of euros to bring Monaco back to the topflight in 2013 \u2014 made clear the club would focus on the development of young talents instead.",
      "Rybolovlev also invested 55 million euros to build a modern training complex where the first team and the reserve players train.",
      "The club now generates a huge income from the sale of players it developed either straight from the academy or after recruiting them from elsewhere. Mbapp\u00e9 was sold for 180 million euros to PSG while Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni joined Real Madrid for 80 million euros in 2022.",
      "That year, Monaco was ranked third behind Benfica and Real Madrid in the top 50 of clubs having generated the most income since July 2015 from the transfer of players who graduated from its youth academy, with around 285 million euros.",
      "Looking at the current crop of academy players, that strategy is likely to continue to yield dividends. During the October international break, no fewer than 20 players from the professional squad and the academy were called up by their national teams.",

      "Higgins, who has been hampered by hamstring and quadriceps injuries this season, is one of three NFL receivers with at least five touchdowns in each of the past five seasons.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m confident we are going to be able to do what it takes to bring Tee back,\u201d Burrow said. \u201cI know that I am going to do what it takes to get him back. So he can have those talks; those are going to be offseason discussions. I think we are excited about that opportunity.\u201d",
      "The Bengals picked up the fifth-year option on Chase's rookie contract this past offseason, keeping him under contract through 2025.",
      "Star Dallas receiver CeeDee Lamb missed the entire 2024 offseason in a contract holdout going into the fifth year of his rookie deal. Chase could make a similar decision after this season. Lamb's holdout ended with a $136 million, four-year deal late in the preseason.",
      "Burrow signed a $275 million, five-year extension in 2023, and the Bengals could restructure that contract to create salary cap room for other signings, including those of Higgins and Chase.",
      "The quarterback was asked after beating the Cowboys if he could imagine not playing with Chase, his teammate when LSU won the 2019 national championship.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to have that,\u201d Burrow said. \u201cWe feed off each other. We make each other better. We are both really smart players. It is tough to take that away when you have a really smart receiver that you can move around and do a lot of things with. Hopefully we can play together as long as we are in this league together.\u201d",

      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Micah Parsons rocked back and forth on the bench in agony after Cincinnati's winning touchdown that followed a botched blocked punt from his Dallas Cowboys.",
      "The star pass rusher couldn't bear to watch the end, so he left the field before the clock hit zeros in the Bengals' 27-20 victory Monday night.",
      "Joe Burrow's tiebreaking 40-yard touchdown pass to Ja'Marr Chase with 1:01 remaining was possible only because the Cowboys touched a blocked punt that would have put them in position for the victory in the final two minutes.",
      "\u201cOh, I hurt,\u201d Parsons said in the locker room, the normally loquacious two-time All-Pro pausing to try to find the right words. \u201cI won\u2019t wish this on anybody. You can\u2019t even put that in words, bro, to be honest.\u201d",
      "The Cowboys were about to get the ball back with the score tied on the first play after the two-minute warning when Nick Vigil blocked Ryan Rehkow's punt.",
      "Amani Oruwariye tried to field the bouncing ball when leaving it alone would have given Dallas possession. Oruwariye couldn\u2019t hold on, and the Bengals\u2019 Maema Njongmeta recovered at the Cincinnati 43-yard line with 1:53 remaining.",
      "The Burrow-Chase winner came three plays later with 1:01 to go. Dallas only got as far as its 48-yard line before a turnover on downs with 24 seconds remaining.",

      "\u201cThis one hurt me more than any loss this year, probably even worse than a playoff loss to be honest, because of where we were going, how we were playing, playing good football,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cI\u2019m going to sit on this, but I have to find a way to keep these guys alive. There\u2019s still football to be had.\u201d",

      "Leon Lett inexplicably slid in on the snow-covered field to try to recover a blocked field goal in the final seconds that would have given Dallas a victory over Miami. The Dolphins recovered and kicked a field goal on the final play for a 16-14 victory.",
      "On that bitterly cold day 31 years ago, owner Jerry Jones was shown celebrating on the sideline after the block, and the smile slowly disappeared as he realized something was still happening on the field.",

      "These Cowboys are trying to win without star quarterback Dak Prescott and seven-time All-Pro right guard Zack Martin, among others. Prescott had season-ending surgery on a torn hamstring last month, and Martin is set for season-ending ankle surgery next week.",
      "\u201cThat locker room is really devastated by the turn of events on the blocked kick,\u201d Jones said. \u201cObviously, we had a block kick call made, and then had one and so many odds that turn against us, and we all would say, \u2018Well, why block the kick? Just take the kick and get the field goal and kick it.\u2019 We\u2019ll all be second-guessing that one.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "For the first time in 36 seasons, the Cleveland Cavaliers are atop the NBA at the 25-game mark",
      "There was a conversation Cleveland guard Donovan Mitchell had during training camp, the topic being all the teams that were generating the most preseason buzz in the Eastern Conference. Boston was coming off an NBA championship. New York got Karl-Anthony Towns. Philadelphia added Paul George.",
      "The Cavs? Not a big topic in early October. And Mitchell fully understood why.",
      "\u201cWhat have we done?\u201d Mitchell asked. \u201cThey don't talk about us. That's fine. We'll just hold ourselves to our standard.\u201d",
      "That approach seems to be working.",
      "For the first time in 36 seasons \u2014 yes, even before the LeBron James eras in Cleveland \u2014 the Cavaliers are atop the NBA at the 25-game mark. They're 21-4, having come back to earth a bit following a 15-0 start but still better than anyone in the league at this point.",
      "\u201cWe've kept our standards pretty high,\u201d Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson said. \u201cAnd we keep it going.\u201d",
      "The Cavs are just one of the surprise stories that have emerged as the season nears the one-third-done mark. Orlando \u2014 the only team still unbeaten at home \u2014 is off to its best start in 16 years at 17-9 and having done most of that without All-Star forward Paolo Banchero. And Houston is 16-8, behind only the Cavs, Boston, Oklahoma City and Memphis so far in the race for the league's best record.",
      "Cleveland was a playoff team a year ago, as was Orlando. And the Rockets planted seeds for improvement last year as well; an 11-game winning streak late in the season fueled a push where they finished 41-41 in a major step forward after a few years of rebuilding.",
      "\u201cWe kind of set that foundation last year to compete with everybody,\u201d Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. \u201cObviously, we had some ups and downs with winning and losing streaks at times, but to finish the season the way we did, getting to .500, 11-game winning streak and some close losses against high-level playoff teams, I think we kind of proved that to ourselves last year that that's who we're going to be.\u201d",
      "A sign of the respect the Rockets are getting: Oddsmakers at BetMGM Scorebook have made them a favorite in 17 of 24 games so far this season, after favoring them only 30 times in 82 games last season.",
      "\u201cBased on coaches, players, GMs, people that we all know what they're saying, it seems like everybody else is taking notice as well,\u201d Udoka said.",
      "They're taking notice of Orlando as well. The Magic lost their best player and haven't skipped a beat.",
      "Banchero's injury after five games figured to doom Orlando for a while, and the Magic went 0-4 immediately after he tore his oblique. Entering Tuesday, they're 14-3 since \u2014 and now have to regroup yet again. Franz Wagner stepped into the best-player-on-team role when Banchero got hurt, and now Wagner is going to miss several weeks with the exact same injury.",
      "Ask Magic coach Jamahl Mosley how the team has persevered, and he'll quickly credit everyone but himself. Around the league, it's Mosley getting a ton of the credit \u2014 and rightly so \u2014 for what Orlando is doing.",
      "\u201cI think that has to do a lot with Mose. ... I have known him a long time,\u201d Phoenix guard Bradley Beal said. \u201cA huge fan of his and what he is doing. It is a testament to him and the way they\u2019ve built this team.\u201d",
      "The Magic know better than most how good Cleveland is, and vice versa. The teams went seven games in an Eastern Conference first-round series last spring, the Cavs winning the finale at home to advance to Round 2.",
      "Atkinson was brought in by Cleveland to try and turn good into great. The job isn't anywhere near finished \u2014 nobody is raising any banners for \u201cbest record after 25 games\u201d \u2014 but Atkinson realized fairly early that this Cavs team has serious potential.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re so caught up in like the process of improve, improve, improve each game, improve each practice,\" Atkinson said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of my philosophy. But then you hit 10-0, and obviously the media starts talking and all that, and you\u2019re like, \u2018Man, this could be something special brewing here.\u2019\u201d",

      "General Motors says it will retreat from the robotaxi business and stop funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle unit",
      "DETROIT -- General Motors said Tuesday it will retreat from the robotaxi business and stop funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle unit.",
      "Instead the Detroit automaker will focus on development of partially automated driver-assist systems for personal vehicles like its Super Cruise, which allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel.",
      "GM said it would get out of robotaxis \u201cgiven the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.\u201d",
      "The company said it will combine Cruise's technical team with its own to work on advanced systems to assist drivers.",
      "GM bought control of San Francisco-based Cruise automation in 2016 with high hopes of developing a profitable fleet of robotaxis.",
      "Over the years GM invested billions in the subsidiary and eventually bought 90% of the company from investors, all while racking up millions in losses.",
      "GM\u2019s brushoff of Cruise represents a dramatic about-face from years of full-blown support that left a huge financial dent in the automaker. The company invested $2.4 billion in Cruise only to sustain years of uninterrupted losses, with little in return. Since GM bought a controlling stake in Cruise for $581 million in 2016, the robotaxi service piled up more than $10 billion in operating losses while bringing in less than $500 million in revenue, according to GM shareholder reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "The automaker even announced plans for Cruise to generate $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, but it scaled back spending on the company after one of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts dragged a San Francisco pedestrian who was hit by another vehicle in 2023.",
      "The California Public Utilities Commission alleged Cruise then covered up details of the crash for more than two weeks.",
      "The embarrassing incident resulted in Cruise\u2019s license to operate its driverless fleet in California being suspended by regulators and triggered a purge of its leadership \u2014 in addition to layoffs that jettisoned about a quarter of its workforce.",
      "GM CEO Mary Barra told analysts on a conference call Tuesday the the new unit will focus on personal vehicles and developing systems that can drive by themselves in certain circumstances.",
      "The company has agreements to buy another 7% of Cruise and intends to buy the remaining shares so it owns the whole company.",
      "The move is another step back from autonomous vehicles, which have proved far harder to develop than companies once anticipated. Two years ago, crosstown rival Ford Motor Co. disbanded its Argo AI autonomous vehicle venture in Pittsburgh that it co-owned with Volkswagen.",
      "At the time the company said it didn\u2019t see a path to profitability for a number of years.",
      "Yet other companies are pressing forward with plans to deploy autonomous vehicles and expanding their services.",
      "Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo is accelerating plans to broaden its robotaxi service beyond areas of metropolitan Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Last week the company said it would begin testing its driverless Jaguars in Miami next year, with plans to start charging for rides in 2026.",
      "The move comes less than a month after Waymo opened up its robotaxi service to anyone looking for a ride in an 80-square-mile (129 square kilometer) area of Los Angeles. Waymo also has plans to launch fleets in Atlanta and Austin next year in partership with ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "In April, a company called Aurora Innovation plans to start hauling freight on Texas freeways using fully driverless semis.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said his company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels using Tesla's \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.",
      "But an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into Full Self-Driving's ability to see in low visibility conditions cast doubt on whether Teslas are ready to be deployed without humans behind the wheel.",
      "The agency began the investigation in October after getting reports of four crashes involving \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. An Arizona pedestrian was killed in one of the crashes.",
      "GM said it will work with Cruise\u2019s leadership to restructure the company and refocus Cruise\u2019s operations on driver assist systems. The company expects the restructuring to reduce spending by more than $1 billion annually.",
      "Cruise has about 2,300 employees and will retain a presence in San Francisco, GM said. It\u2019s too early to talk about employment levels until the restructuring is completed next year, a spokesman said.",
      "Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, said Cruise will bring its software, artificial intelligence and sensor development to GM to team up on improving GM\u2019s driver-assist systems.",
      "\u201cWe want to leverage what already has been done as we go forward, and we think we can do that very effectively,\u201d Barra said.",
      "Shares of GM rose about 3% in trading after Tuesday's closing bell. They are up about 47% for the year.",

      "On Monday, the FTC announced it was sending over 629,00 payments to eligible customers who submitted claims. About half of those refunds are PayPal payments, which should be redeemed within 30 days, and the rest are checks, which should be cashed within 90 days.",
      "The average refund is about $114, the FTC noted. This first round of payments amounts to a total of more than $72 million, according to the agency \u2014 leaving about $173 million left to be distributed.",
      "Impacted consumers can still apply for a refund online. People who are eligible for these payouts include Fortnite players who were charged in-game currency for items they didn\u2019t want or saw their account locked after complaining to a credit card company about wrongful charges between January 2017 and September 2022 \u2014 as well as parents whose child made charges on their credit cards without their knowledge from January 2018 through November 2018.",
      "You can learn more about applying for a refund on the FTC's website. The deadline for submitting a claim is January 10, 2025.",
      "At the time the settlement was announced in December 2022, Epic said it accepted the agreement because it wanted \"to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players.\u201d The Cary, North Carolina-based added that it was already rolling out changes \u201cto ensure our ecosystem meets the expectations of our players and regulators, which we hope will be a helpful guide for others in our industry.\u201d"

      "Cyprus' defense minister says that bolstering the defense capacity of the east Mediterranean island nation by getting new armaments is critical for a country so close to the war-wracked Middle East",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Bolstering Cyprus ' defense capacity is critical for the east Mediterranean island nation so close to the war-wrecked Middle East, the country's defense minister said Tuesday.",
      "The priority for Cyprus is to procure better defense systems, said Defense Minister Vasilis Palmas. The minister, who spoke to The Associated Press in the nation's capital of Nicosia, outlined some defense plans though he would not go into specifics about arms procurement programs.",
      "\u201cThe situation in the eastern Mediterranean, with its continuous shifting geostrategic balances and competing interests makes it even more pressing for the island to bolster its defensive capabilities,\u201d Palmas said.",
      "Meanwhile, a senior government official confirmed to the AP that Cyprus recently received a part of the Israeli-made Barak MX integrated air defense system.",
      "The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter, said he expects the delivery of the rest of the system soon, with the whole system becoming fully operational in mid-2025.",
      "The Israeli ground-based system is capable of simultaneously intercepting missiles, drones and aircraft from as far as 93 miles (150 kilometers) away, and represents a significant upgrade to Cyprus' defense shield, which had until recently only consisted of Soviet-era weapons, such as the BUK M1-2 missile system.",
      "Cyprus in recent years pivoted away from Russian weapons systems as part of a broader, pro-Western strategy to bring the small nation's armed forces up to EU and NATO standards. The Cypriot president, Nikos Christodoulides, said earlier this month that Cyprus could apply to join NATO with U.S. help, once conditions allow for it.",
      "Palmas said closer diplomatic and military ties with the United States have enabled Cyprus to leverage its geographic location as the closest European Union member to the Mideast to expand its diplomatic outreach in regional peace efforts and help in providing humanitarian assistance.",
      "Earlier this year, some 20,000 tons of humanitarian aid was shipped directly to Gaza via a maritime corridor from Cyprus. That effort halted as fighting intensified but efforts are underway to reestablish the supply route, this time via the Israeli port of Ashdod.",
      "The closer ties with the U.S. in recent years culminated in the lifting of a decades-old arms embargo Washington imposed on ethnically divided Cyprus to prevent an arms race.",
      "Cyprus\u2019 split came in 1974 when Turkey invaded after a coup on the island aiming at uniting it with Greece. Turkey continues to maintain more than 35,000 troops in the island\u2019s breakaway, Turkish Cypriot north.",
      "Following the lifting of the U.S. arms embargo, Cyprus\u2019 elite underwater demolition teams have reportedly been recently supplied with modern, U.S.-made M5 carbines \u2014 rifles more suited for special warfare teams.",
      "Palmas also told the AP that work is underway to enlarge Cyprus' air base in the island\u2019s southwest, including a longer runway.",
      "A major upgrade is also in the pipeline, he said, for the Mari naval base on the southern coast, also significantly expanding its facilities to accommodate warships and submarines of allied and friendly countries."

    "story": [
      "A trustee who oversaw the bankruptcy auction of Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars is asking a judge to approve The Onion\u2019s winning bid for the conspiracy-filled platform",
      "A trustee who oversaw the Infowars bankruptcy auction told a judge Tuesday that he picked The Onion's bid for the conspiracy-filled platform because was it far better than the only other proposal he received, from a company affiliated with Alex Jones.",
      "Trustee Christopher Murray testified during the second day of a hearing where a judge is scrutinizing Murray's decision to name the satirical news outlet's offer as the winning bid after a November auction that Jones alleges involved fraud and collusion.",
      "\u201cOnly two people showed up to bid and \u2026 one was just better than the other,\u201d Murray testified, referring to The Onion. Asked how much better it was, he said \u201cby a lot.\u201d",
      "It is not clear how quickly U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston will rule. Testimony on Tuesday was expected to go into the evening.",
      "The Onion, which wants to turn Infowars\u2019 website and social media accounts into parodies, offered $1.75 million in cash and other incentives for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction that concluded on Nov. 14. First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements, bid $3.5 million.",
      "Although The Onion\u2019s cash offer was lower than that of First United American, it also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo $750,000 of the auction proceeds due to them and give it to other creditors, providing the other creditors more money than they would receive under First United American\u2019s bid.",
      "Lopez could ultimately decide whether to void The Onion\u2019s bid, name the Jones-affiliated company the winner or hold another auction, among other possibilities.",
      "Jones did not attend the proceedings and instead broadcast from his studios in Austin.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t imagine the judge would certify this fraud,\u201d Jones said on his show Tuesday. \u201cI mean it\u2019s head-spinning the stuff they did and what they claimed.\u201d",
      "The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations from Jones and the company and accuse them of sour grapes.",
      "If The Onion wins, Jones expects to be kicked out of the Infowars studio and its web and social media platforms.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Jones repeatedly called the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified in court that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats from his followers.",
      "Jones has since acknowledged that the Connecticut school shooting happened.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "Murray testified that he did not favor either bidder over the other and was not biased.",
      "He also revealed that First United American submitted a revised bid in recent days, but he said he could not accept it because the Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut lawsuit objected.",
      "The Onion valued its bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million, because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "In a court filing last month, Murray's lawyers called First United American's request to disqualify The Onion's bid a \u201cdisappointed bidder's improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open election process.\u201d",
      "Murray's lawyer questioned him Tuesday afternoon. Attorneys for Jones and First United American were cross-examining him later Tuesday.",
      "In his opening argument Monday, Jones attorney Ben Broocks said there was no way The Onion should have been chosen over First United American.",
      "\u201cHow does a $1.75 million bid beat a $3.5 million bid?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow is that $1.75 million greater? Well, it\u2019s voodoo economics, to use a phrase.\u201d",
      "Auctioneer Jeff Tanenbaum on Monday defended both the value of the bid and its selection.",
      "Up for sale were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, as well as the rights to its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights."

      "About 87,000 people are being evacuated in a central Philippine region after a volcano erupted with a huge plume of ash and superhot streams of gas and debris hurtling down its slopes",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- About 87,000 people were being evacuated in a central Philippine region Tuesday a day after a volcano briefly erupted with a towering ash plume and superhot streams of gas and debris hurtling down its western slopes.",
      "The latest eruption of Mount Kanlaon on central Negros island did not cause any immediate casualties, but the alert level was raised one level, indicating further and more explosive eruptions may occur.",
      "Volcanic ash fell on a wide area, including Antique province, more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) across seawaters west of the volcano, obscuring visibility and posing health risks, Philippine chief volcanologist Teresito Bacolcol and other officials said by telephone.",
      "At least six domestic flights and a flight bound for Singapore were canceled and two local flights were diverted in the region Monday and Tuesday due to Kanlaon\u2019s eruption, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines.",
      "The mass evacuations were being carried out urgently in towns and villages nearest the western and southern slopes of Kanlaon which were blanketed by its ash, including in La Castellana town in Negros Occidental where nearly 47,000 people have to be evacuated out of a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) danger zone, the Office of Civil Defense said.",
      "More than 6,000 have moved to evacuation centers aside from those who have temporarily transferred to the homes of relatives in La Castellana by Tuesday morning, the town\u2019s mayor, Rhumyla Mangilimutan, told The Associated Press by telephone.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said authorities were ready to provide support to large numbers of displaced villagers and that his social welfare secretary flew early Tuesday to the affected region.",
      "\"We are ready to support the families who have been evacuated outside the 6-kilometer danger zone,\u201d Marcos told reporters.",
      "Government scientists were monitoring the air quality due to the risk of contamination from toxic volcanic gases that may require more people to be evacuated from areas affected by Monday\u2019s eruption.",
      "Disaster-response contingents were rapidly establishing evacuation centers and seeking supplies of face masks, food and hygiene packs ahead of the Christmas season, traditionally a peak time for holiday travel and family celebrations in the largely Roman Catholic nation.",
      "Authorities also shut schools and imposed a nighttime curfew in the most vulnerable areas.",
      "The Philippines\u2019 Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the nearly four-minute eruption of Kanlaon volcano on Monday afternoon had caused a pyroclastic density current \u2014 a superhot stream of gas, ash, debris and rocks that can incinerate anything in its path.",
      "\u201cIt's a one-time but major eruption,\u201d Bacolcol told the AP, adding that volcanologists were assessing if Monday's eruption spewed old volcanic debris and rocks clogged in and near the summit crater or was caused by rising magma from underneath.",
      "Few volcanic earthquakes were detected ahead of Monday's explosion, Bacolcol said.",
      "The alert level around Kanlaon was placed on Monday to the third-highest of a five-step warning system, indicating \u201cmagmatic eruption\" may have begun and may progress to further explosive eruptions.",
      "The 2,435-meter (7,988-foot) volcano, one of the country\u2019s 24 most-active volcanoes, last erupted in June sending hundreds of villagers to emergency shelters.",
      "In 1996, three hikers were killed near the peak and several others were later rescued when Kanlaon erupted without warning, officials said.",
      "Located in the so-called Pacific \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, the Philippines is also lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms a year and is among the countries most prone to natural disasters."

      "California lawmakers will consider a bill to require labels on social media platforms warning of their effects on young people\u2019s lives",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California, home to some of the largest technology companies in the world, would be the first U.S. state to require mental health warning labels on social media sites if lawmakers pass a bill introduced Monday.",
      "The legislation sponsored by state Attorney General Rob Bonta is necessary to bolster safety for children online, supporters say, but industry officials vow to fight the measure and others like it under the First Amendment. Warning labels for social media gained swift bipartisan support from dozens of attorneys general, including Bonta, after U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to establish the requirements earlier this year, saying social media is a contributing factor in the mental health crisis among young people.",
      "\u201cThese companies know the harmful impact their products can have on our children, and they refuse to take meaningful steps to make them safer,\u201d Bonta said at a news conference Monday. \u201cTime is up. It\u2019s time we stepped in and demanded change.\u201d",
      "State officials haven't provided details on the bill, but Bonta said the warning labels could pop up once weekly.",
      "Up to 95% of youth ages 13 to 17 say they use a social media platform, and more than a third say that they use social media \u201calmost constantly,\u201d according to 2022 data from the Pew Research Center. Parents\u2019 concerns prompted Australia to pass the world\u2019s first law banning social media for children under 16 in November.",
      "\u201cThe promise of social media, although real, has turned into a situation where they\u2019re turning our children\u2019s attention into a commodity,\u201d Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, who authored the California bill, said Monday. \u201cThe attention economy is using our children and their well-being to make money for these California companies.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers instead should focus on online safety education and mental health resources, not warning label bills that are \u201cconstitutionally unsound,\u201d said Todd O\u2019Boyle, a vice president of the tech industry policy group Chamber of Progress.",
      "\u201cWe strongly suspect that the courts will set them aside as compelled speech,\u201d O\u2019Boyle told The Associated Press.",
      "Victoria Hinks' 16-year-old daughter, Alexandra, died by suicide four months ago after being \u201cled down dark rabbit holes\u201d on social media that glamorized eating disorders and self-harm. Hinks said the labels would help protect children from companies that turn a blind eye to the harm caused to children\u2019s mental health when they become addicted to social media platforms.",
      "\u201cThere's not a bone in my body that doubts social media played a role in leading her to that final, irreversible decision,\u201d Hinks said. \u201cThis could be your story.\"",
      "Common Sense Media, a sponsor of the bill, said it plans to lobby for similar proposals in other states.",
      "California in the past decade has positioned itself as a leader in regulating and fighting the tech industry to bolster online safety for children.",
      "The state was the first in 2022 to bar online platforms from using users\u2019 personal information in ways that could harm children. It was one of the states that sued Meta in 2023 and TikTok in October for deliberately designing addictive features that keep kids hooked on their platforms.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, also signed several bills in September to help curb the effects of social media on children, including one to prohibit social media platforms from knowingly providing addictive feeds to children without parental consent and one to limit or ban students from using smartphones on school campus.",
      "Federal lawmakers have held hearings on child online safety and legislation is in the works to force companies to take reasonable steps to prevent harm. The legislation has the support of X owner Elon Musk and the President-elect\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook\u2019s founding."

      "Attorneys for Meta shareholders are asking a Delaware judge to sanction former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and fellow Facebook board member and current White House chief of staff Jeff Zients for deleting emails related to the Cambridge Anal...",
      "WILMINGTON, Del. -- Attorneys for Meta shareholders asked a Delaware judge Monday to sanction the company's former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and fellow Facebook board member and current White House chief of staff Jeff Zients for deleting emails related to the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, despite being told to preserve such records.",
      "The plaintiff attorneys contend that Sandberg and Zients used personal email accounts to communicate about key issues relating to their 2018 shareholder lawsuit that alleged Facebook officers and directors violated both the law and their fiduciary duties in failing for years to protect the privacy of user data.",
      "\u201cAlthough Sandberg and Zients received a litigation hold requiring them to preserve documents from these accounts, they both knowingly and permanently destroyed electronically stored information from such sources,\u201d attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "The plaintiffs say the former board members were either \u201creckless or intentional\u201d in destroying documents, noting that Sandberg deleted communications to and from her Gmail account after only 30 days, even after being notified of the \u201clitigation hold\u201d to preserve documents. Zients never disabled an auto-delete function on his email account, even though he, too, received a litigation hold and consulted with lawyers, they said.",
      "The plaintiffs argue that Sandberg and Zients should be prohibited from testifying about information they sent or received using their personal email accounts. They also say the burden of proof for any affirmative defense they present should be raised to a standard of \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d instead of the lower standard of a \u201cpreponderance\u201d of the evidence.",
      "Sandberg was deposed last week. Plaintiff attorney Max Huffman said Zients is \u201cbusy\u201d and will be deposed in February \u201cafter there\u2019s an effective transition in Washington.\u201d",
      "Defense attorney Berton Ashman described the email deletions as \u201cunfortunate\u201d but argued that the plaintiffs have not shown that they were prejudiced in any way.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no intent here to destroy relevant or responsive information,\u201d Ashman told Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster, adding that there no \u201ctrove of missing emails.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no grand scheme or suggestion of bad behavior,\u201d he added.",
      "Ashman said the vast majority of emails that Sandberg and Zients sent or received using their personal accounts were also received by other individuals at Facebook. He suggested that any emails that may have been deleted have been made available to the plaintiffs from other sources at Facebook.",
      "Huffman, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, said Sandberg does not deserve the benefit of the doubt.",
      "\u201cShe unilaterally controlled what was kept and what was destroyed,\u201d he told the judge.",
      "Laster, who is scheduled to preside over a non-jury trial in April, said he wanted to see a transcript of Sandberg\u2019s deposition before ruling on the motion for sanctions.",
      "Last year, the judge rejected a defense motion arguing that the lawsuit should be dismissed because the plaintiffs did not first demand that Facebook\u2019s board take legal action before filing litigation themselves. He agreed with the plaintiffs that such a demand would have been futile because of doubts that a majority of the relevant Facebook board members, many with close personal and business ties to Mark Zuckerberg, would be willing to confront the CEO and founder of the company over its privacy failures.",
      "Laster noted that, in deciding on a motion to dismiss, he was required to accept the allegations in the complaint as true.",
      "The complaint alleges that Facebook officials repeatedly and continually violated a 2012 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission under which Facebook agreed to stop collecting and sharing personal data on platform users and friends without their consent.",
      "Facebook later sold user data to commercial partners in direct violation of the consent order and removed disclosures from privacy settings that were required under consent order, the lawsuit alleges. The company\u2019s conduct resulted in significant fines from regulators in Europe and culminated in  the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018.  That case involved a British political consulting firm hired by Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign that paid a Facebook app developer for the personal information of tens of millions Facebook users.",
      "The fallout led to Facebook agreeing to pay unprecedented $5 billion penalty to settle FTC charges that the company violated the 2012 consent order by deceiving users about their ability to protect their personal information."

      "David Bieri, an international finance expert at Virginia Tech, said that China\u2019s investigation is \u201cnot about what Nvidia is doing in China, per se\u201d but rather a signal to the incoming Trump administration. China, Bieri said, is looking to set the tone of future relations.",

      "The legal filing was made after a panel of three judges on the same court sided with the government last week and ruled that the law, which requires TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance to divest its stakes in the social media company or face a ban, was constitutional.",
      "If the law is not overturned, both TikTok and its parent ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, have claimed that the popular app will shut down by Jan. 19, 2025. TikTok has more than 170 million American users who would be affected, the companies have said.",
      "In their legal filing on Monday, attorneys for the two companies wrote that even if a shutdown lasted one month, it would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "The company would also lose 29% of its total \u201ctargeted global\u201d advertising revenue for next year as well as talent since current and prospective employees would look elsewhere for jobs, they wrote.",

      "It's not clear if the Supreme Court will take up the case. But some legal experts have said the justices are likely to weigh in on the case since it raises novel issues about social media platforms and how far the government could go in its stated aims of protecting national security.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok the last time he was in the White House, has said he is now against such action.",
      "In their legal filing, the two companies pointed to the political realities, saying that an injunction would provide a \u201cmodest delay\u201d that would give \u201cthe incoming Administration time to determine its position \u2014 which could moot both the impending harms and the need for Supreme Court review.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for the two companies are asking the appeals court to decide on the request for an enforcement pause by Dec. 16. The Department of Justice said in a court filing on Monday that it will oppose the request. Justice officials also suggested that an expedited decision denying TikTok's request would give the Supreme Court more time to consider the case."

      "There were no immediate reports of casualties in the latest explosion of Mount Kanlaon, on central Negros island, but authorities shut schools and imposed a nighttime curfew after ash falling in several villages clouded the the visibility of motorists and sparked health concerns.",
      "\u201cIt sounded like a cannon,\u201d Mayor Jose Chubasco Cardenas of Canlaon city, which lies southeast of the volcano, told The Associated Press by telephone. \u201cThere have been quiet eruptions before, but this was one very loud.\u201d",
      "Disaster-response officials raised the danger level around Kanlaon due to \u201ca greater risk of hazardous volcanic activity\u201d and ordered villagers within a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) radius of the crater to be evacuated.",
      "About 100 people had fled to emergency shelters in Canlaon by nightfall after the midafternoon volcanic eruption, Cardenas said. The number of displaced people could reach more than 2,000 due to stronger prospects of more eruption, he added.",
      "The Philippines' Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the eruption had caused a pyroclastic density current \u2014 a superhot stream of ash, debris and rocks that can incinerate anything in its path.",

    "story": [
      "The Onion's bid to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars returned to a Texas courtroom",
      "An auction company executive involved in the liquidation of Alex Jones\u2019 conspiracy theory platform Infowars testified for nearly five hours Monday, as a bankruptcy judge in Texas began a hearing into whether The Onion satirical news outlet was properly named the winning bidder over a company affiliated with Jones.",
      "Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, was grilled by lawyers for Jones and the company in a Houston courtroom over how The Onion\u2019s bid came to be valued at $7 million and why a live auction was not held. He defended both the value of the bid and its selection after the two sealed offers were opened.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez continued the hearing to Tuesday afternoon, when the trustee overseeing the sale of Jones\u2019 assets is expected to take the stand. Lopez could ultimately decide whether to void The Onion\u2019s bid, name the Jones-affiliated company the winner or hold another auction, among other possibilities.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements and submitted the other bid, are alleging fraud and collusion in the auction that concluded on Nov. 14. The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations, accusing Jones and the company of sour grapes.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut. Jones repeatedly called the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families to help satisfy judgments issued by juries and judges in state courts in Connecticut and Texas. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "The Onion, which wants to turn Infowars\u2019 website and social media accounts into parodies, offered $1.75 million for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction, while First United American Companies bid $3.5 million.",
      "But The Onion\u2019s bid also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, chose The Onion, saying its proposal was better for creditors because they would receive more money. The Onion valued the bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million, because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "Tanenbaum testified that he agreed with the $7 million valuation and believed The Onion\u2019s bid conformed to the auction rules.",
      "A lawyer for Jones, Ben Broocks, asked Tanenbaum how it was possible that the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer boosted The Onion\u2019s offer to such a high amount.",
      "\u201cIt means the purchase price value has gone up because another purchase price would have to be higher than that value in order to provide the same net benefit to that group of creditors,\u201d Tanenbaum said.",
      "During his opening argument, Broocks said there was no way The Onion should have been chosen over First United American.",
      "\u201cHow does a $1.75 million bid beat a $3.5 million bid?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow is that $1.75 million greater? Well, it\u2019s voodoo economics to use a phrase.\u201d",
      "Broocks and a lawyer for First United American, Walter Cicack, also questioned why a live bidding round wasn\u2019t held after the sealed offers weren\u2019t submitted, as they said they expected, but the judge\u2019s order made live bidding optional.",
      "Jones has been criticizing the sale process on his show and social media sites, calling it \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d",
      "Joshua Wolfshohl, an attorney for Murray, told the judge Monday that no wrongdoing occurred during the auction. He called the complaints by Jones and First United American Companies unfounded.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of their complaints are just fantastic, imagined conspiracy theories that have no basis in reality,\u201d he said.",
      "Murray, The Onion and the Sandy families deny allegations of wrongdoing. In his own court filing, Murray called the allegations \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Up for sale at the auction were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, Texas, as well as its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened.",
      "On Friday, a Connecticut appeals court reduced by $150 million the original $1.44 billion judgment against Jones in the lawsuit against him in that state, but upheld the rest of the award. Jones\u2019 lawyer said he will ask Connecticut\u2019s highest court to review the appellate ruling. Jones is also appealing a $50 million judgment in a similar Texas defamation lawsuit."

      "TikTok's future in the U.S. appeared uncertain on Friday after a federal appeals court rejected a legal challenge to a law that requires the social media platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company or be banned by mid-January.",
      "A panel of three judges on The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled unanimously that the law withstood constitutional scrutiny, rebuffing arguments from the two companies that the statute violated their rights and the rights of TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "The government has said it wants ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to divest its stakes. But if it doesn't and the platform goes away, it would have a seismic impact on the lives of content creators who rely on the platform for income as well as users who use it for entertainment and connection.",
      "Here are some details on the ruling and what could happen next:",
      "In their lawsuit, TikTok and ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, had challenged the law on various fronts, arguing in part that the statute ran afoul of the First Amendment and was an unconstitutional bill of attainder that unfairly targeted the two companies.",
      "But the court sided with attorneys for the Justice Department who said that the government was attempting to address national security concerns and the way in which it chose to do so did not violate the constitution.",
      "The Justice Department has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say that Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread, or suppress, information. However, the U.S. hasn't publicly provided examples of that happening.",
      "The appeals court ruling, written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg, said the law was \u201ccarefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary.\" The judges also rejected the claim that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Furthermore, Ginsburg wrote the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \u201csuppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "TikTok and ByteDance are expected to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, but it's unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "TikTok indicated in a statement on Friday the two companies are preparing to take their case to high court, saying the Supreme Court has \u201can established historical record of protecting Americans\u2019 right to free speech.\"",
      "\"We expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\u201d a company spokesperson said.",
      "Alan Morrison, a professor at The George Washington University Law School, said he expects the Supreme Court to take up the case because of the novelty of the issues raised in the lawsuit. If that happens, attorneys for the two companies still have to convince the court to grant them an emergency stay that will prevent the government from enforcing the Jan. 19 divestiture deadline stipulated in the law, Morrison said.",
      "Such a move could drag out the process until the Justices make a ruling.",
      "Tiffany Cianci, a TikTok content creator who has supported the platform, said she was not shocked about the outcome of the court's ruling on Friday because lower courts typically defer to the executive branch on these types of cases. She believes the company will have a stronger case at the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cI believe that the next stages are more likely to produce a victory for TikTokers and for TikTok as a whole,\u201d Cianci said.",
      "Another wild card is President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the recent presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "The Trump transition team has not offered details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok.\" But spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement last month that he plans to \u201cdeliver\u201d on his campaign promises.",
      "After Trump takes office on Jan. 20th, it would fall on his Justice Department to enforce the law and punish any potential violators. Penalties would apply to any app stores that would violate a prohibition on TikTok and to internet hosting services which would be barred from supporting it.",
      "Some have speculated that Trump could ask his Justice Department to abstain from enforcing the law. But tech companies like Apple and Google, which offer TikTok's app on their app stores, would then have to trust that the administration would not come after them for any violations.",
      "Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said enforcement discretion \u2014 or executive orders \u2014 can not override existing law, leaving Trump with \u201climited room for unilateral action.\"",
      "There are other things Trump could potentially do. It's possible he could invoke provisions of the law that allow the president to determine whether a sale or a similar transaction frees TikTok from \u201cforeign adversary\u201d control. Another option is to urge Congress to repeal the law. But that too would require support from congressional Republicans who have overwhelmingly supported the prospect of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said he was \u201coptimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok\u201d and allow its continued use in the United States.",
      "ByteDance has said it won't sell TikTok. And even if it wanted to, a sale of the proprietary algorithm that powers TikTok is likely to get blocked under Chinese export controls that the country issued in 2020.",
      "That means if TikTok is sold without the algorithm, its likely that the buyer would only purchase a shell of the platform that doesn't contain the technology that made the app a cultural powerhouse.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in buying it.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital. The spokesperson did not disclose the identity of the participants."

      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat",
      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat. Researchers found at higher temperatures and humidity, the heat kills far more young people under 35 than those older than 50.",
      "For decades, health and weather experts have warned that the elderly and the youngest children were most vulnerable in heat waves. But this study looking at all deaths in Mexico from 1998 to 2019 shows that when the combination of humidity and temperature reach uncomfortable levels, such as the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (around 30 degrees Celsius) and 50% relative humidity, there were nearly 32 temperature-related deaths of people 35 years old for every temperature-related death of someone 50 and older.",
      "The study in Friday's journal Science Advances shows an especially surprising spike of heat-related deaths in an age group thought to be young and robust: People between 18 and 35. That age group alone had nine times as many temperature-related deaths as those older than 50.",
      "Study authors and outside experts are scrambling to figure out why. Demographics alone don't explain why more young adult Mexicans are dying in high heat than their elders. Two theories: Outdoor workers who can't escape the heat, and young people who don't know their limits.",
      "The trend is likely to widen as the world warms from human-caused climate change, according to computer simulations run by the study team.",
      "\u201cWe found that younger people are especially vulnerable to humid heat,\u201d study co-author Jeffrey Shrader, a climate economist at Columbia University, said. \u201cAs the climate warms, we're really going to be shifting the burden of temperature-related mortality towards younger individuals and away from older individuals who tend to be more vulnerable to cold temperatures.\u201d",
      "Data from cold weather shows more than 300 deaths of Mexican residents 50 and older for every young person dying from cold temperatures, according to the study.",
      "\u201cPeople of all ages are increasingly at risk from the rising temperatures, and this study shows that those that we might have considered relatively safe from heat-related adverse health outcomes might not be so much so,\u201d said Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown that monitors health effects of climate change. She was not part of the study team.",
      "\u201cHeat is a much more dangerous silent killer than most people acknowledge it to be, and that heat is increasingly putting our health and survival at risk,\" Romanello said in an email.",
      "Study authors decided to examine weather-related deaths in Mexico because that country not only has detailed mortality data, but it has a variety of different climates making it an ideal place to study in depth, Shrader said.",
      "Researchers also want to figure out whether this is just a situation in Mexico or other warmer sections of the globe have similar spikes in young adult deaths in high heat and humidity.",
      "Initially the team just wanted to look at deaths and what scientists call wet-bulb globe temperatures, but when they looked at age differences, they were surprised and looked in more detail, Shrader said. Wet-bulb temperature, which is intended to mirror how the body cools itself, is derived using a complicated measurement system that factors in humidity and solar radiation. A wet-bulb globe temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) is thought to be the limit for human survivability. Most places don\u2019t reach that level.",
      "Researchers determined temperature-related mortality by complex statistical analysis that compares numerous factors in the number of deaths and removes everything they can except temperature fluctuations, said study co-author Andrew Wilson, a Columbia climate economics researcher.",
      "Researchers also calculated the ideal temperature for when there are the fewest excess deaths at each age group. Younger adults' sweet temperature spot is about nine degrees Fahrenheit (five degrees Celsius) cooler than it is for older people, Shrader and Wilson said.",
      "Some outside health and climate experts were initially puzzled at the higher youth mortality seen in the study. Co-author Patrick Kinney, a professor of urban health and sustainability at Boston University, said it was likely the study included a higher proportion of outdoor workers exposed to heat than prior studies did.",
      "Study co-author Tereza Cavazos, a climate scientist at the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education in Mexico, said she remembers her father's generations taking siestas in the high heat of the day and that was healthy. That doesn't happen so much now, she said.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of population that is vulnerable in the future. Not even in the future, right now,\u201d Cavazos said. She mentioned three Mexican heat waves this year that hit in the middle of the country and kept the deadly heat going overnight so people had little relief. Usually cool nights allow a body to recover.",
      "Younger people often have a sense of invulnerability to weather extremes and do things that increase their risk, such as play sports in high heat, Cavazos said.",
      "\u201cHigh humidity makes it a lot harder for the body to cool itself through sweating \u2013 which is how our body primarily stays cool,\" said Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician and climate change expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. She was not part of the study team. \"So someone young and healthy working outside in heat and high humidity can reach a point where the body can no longer cool itself safely \u2013 causing a deadly form of heat injury called heat stroke.\u201d",

      "A federal appeals court panel on Friday unanimously upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok as soon as next month, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied TikTok's petition to overturn the law \u2014 which requires TikTok to break ties with its China-based parent company ByteDance or be banned by mid-January \u2014 and rebuffed the company's challenge of the statute, which it argued had ran afoul of the First Amendment.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\u201d said the court's opinion, which was written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg. \u201cHere the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary\u2019s ability to gather data on people in the United States.\u201d",
      "TikTok and ByteDance \u2014 another plaintiff in the lawsuit \u2014 are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, though its unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people,\u201d Hughes said. Unless stopped, he argued the statute \u201cwill silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.\u201d",
      "Though the case is squarely in the court system, it's also possible the two companies might be thrown some sort of a lifeline by President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "\u201cHe wants to save TikTok,\u201d Rep. Michael Waltz, Trump's pick for national security adviser, said Friday during an interview on Fox Business.",
      "The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat due to its connections to China.",
      "The U.S. has said it\u2019s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect. The European Union on Friday expressed similar concerns as it investigates intelligence that suggests Russia possibly abused the platform to influence the elections in Romania.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday.",
      "TikTok, which sued the government over the law in May, has long denied it could be used by Beijing to spy on or manipulate Americans. Its attorneys have accurately pointed out that the U.S. hasn\u2019t provided evidence to show that the company handed over user data to the Chinese government, or manipulated content for Beijing\u2019s benefit in the U.S. They have also argued the law is predicated on future risks, which the Department of Justice has emphasized pointing in part to unspecified action it claims the two companies have taken in the past due to demands from the Chinese government.",
      "Friday\u2019s ruling came after the appeals court panel, composed of two Republicans and one Democrat appointed judges, heard oral arguments in September.",
      "In the hearing, which lasted more than two hours, the panel appeared to grapple with how TikTok\u2019s foreign ownership affects its rights under the Constitution and how far the government could go to curtail potential influence from abroad on a foreign-owned platform. On Friday, all three denied TikTok\u2019s petition.",
      "In the court's ruling, Ginsburg, a Republican appointee, rejected TikTok's main legal arguments against the law, including that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder, or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. He also said the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \"suppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "\u201cContent on the platform could in principle remain unchanged after divestiture, and people in the United States would remain free to read and share as much PRC propaganda (or any other content) as they desire on TikTok or any other platform of their choosing,\u201d Ginsburg wrote, using the abbreviation for the People\u2019s Republic of China.",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan, the chief judge on the court, issued a concurring opinion.",
      "TikTok\u2019s lawsuit was consolidated with a second legal challenge brought by several content creators \u2014 for which the company is covering legal costs \u2014 as well as a third one filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. Other organizations, including the Knight First Amendment Institute, had also filed amicus briefs supporting TikTok.",
      "\u201cThis is a deeply misguided ruling that reads important First Amendment precedents too narrowly and gives the government sweeping power to restrict Americans\u2019 access to information, ideas, and media from abroad,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the organization. \u201cWe hope that the appeals court\u2019s ruling won\u2019t be the last word.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers who had pushed for the legislation celebrated the court's ruling.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\u201d said Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China.",
      "Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who co-authored the law, said \u201cit's time for ByteDance to accept\u201d the law.",
      "To assuage concerns about the company\u2019s owners, TikTok says it has invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user data.",
      "The company has also argued the government\u2019s broader concerns could have been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient.",
      "Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it\u2019s impossible to divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm \u2014 the platform\u2019s secret sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture plan \u2014 would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected from other global content.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were launching a consortium to purchase TikTok\u2019s U.S. business.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital."

But the election was thrown into turmoil Friday after the country\u2019s top court annulled results from the first round of voting.",

      "It is unclear from the intelligence release whether Georgescu was aware of the alleged campaign or assisted in it.",
      "European Commission officials said they asked the TikTok to comment on the files and to provide information on actions that it\u2019s taking in response. It\u2019s the second time the commission has asked the TikTok for information since the election\u2019s first round of voting on Nov. 24, and comes a day after it ordered the Chinese-owned platform to retain all election-related files and evidence.",
      "TikTok declined to comment.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned about mounting indications of coordinated foreign online influence operation targeting ongoing Romanian elections, especially on TikTok,\u201d Henna Virkkunen, the commission\u2019s executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, said in a post on X.",
      "TikTok has 24 hours to respond to the EU request, officials told a press briefing in Brussels",
      "Virkunnen said also called on TikTok to \u201curgently redress\u201d its policies on content moderation and amplification policies and comply with the bloc's Digital Services Act, a wide-ranging set of rules designed to clean up social media platforms.",

But now that the Romanian Constitutional Court has issued its unprecedented decision to cancel the initial results, the first round of voting will have to be held again.",

      "BANGKOK -- China has banned exports of key materials used to make a wide range of products, including smartphones, electric vehicles, radar systems and CT scanners, swiping back at Washington after it expanded export controls to include dozens of Chinese companies that make equipment used to produce advanced computer chips.",
      "Both sides say their controls are justified by national security concerns and both accuse the other of \u201cweaponizing\u201d trade. Analysts say the latest restrictions could have a wide impact on manufacturing in many industries and supply chains.",
      "\u201cCritical mineral security is now intrinsically linked to the escalating tech trade war,\u201d Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz of the Center for Strategic International Studies, wrote in a report on Beijing's decision.",
      "The full impact will depend partly on whether U.S. industries can compensate for any loss of access to the strategically important materials, equipment and components.",
      "Here\u2019s why this could be a tipping point in trade conflict between the two biggest economies, coming at a time when antagonisms already were expected to heat up once President-elect Donald Trump takes office, given his vows to hike tariffs on imports of Chinese-made products.",
      "China has banned, in principle, exports to the United States of gallium, germanium and antimony \u2014 critical minerals needed to make advanced semiconductors, among many other types of equipment. Beijing also tightened controls on exports of graphite, which is used in EV and grid-storage batteries. China is the largest source for most of these materials and also dominates refining of those materials, which are used both for consumer goods and for military purposes.",
      "The limits announced Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings.",
      "Next on the list of potential bans, experts say: tungsten, magnesium and aluminum alloys.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced its measures after the U.S. government ordered a slew of new measures meant to prevent sales to China of certain types of advanced semiconductors and the tools and software needed to make them. Washington also expanded its \u201centity list\u201d of companies facing strict export controls to include 140 more companies, nearly all of them based in China or Chinese-owned.",
      "Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the revised rules were intended to impair China\u2019s ability to use advanced technologies that \u201cpose a risk to our national security.\u201d The updated regulations also limit exports to China of high-bandwidth memory chips that are needed to process massive amounts of data in advanced applications such as artificial intelligence.",
      "Export licenses will likely be denied for any U.S. company trying to do business with the 140 companies newly added to the \u201centity list,\u201d as well as the dozens of others already on the list. The aim, officials said, is to stop Chinese companies from leveraging U.S. technology to make their own semiconductors.",
      "The Biden administration has been expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls while encouraging an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S. and other Western countries.",
      "Washington also extended the restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductor technology to companies in other countries, though it excluded companies in key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands that are thought to have adequate export controls of their own.",
      "In a word: very. For the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other producers of advanced technology and components, access to materials with such properties as high conductivity is crucial: gallium and germanium increasingly are used in advanced semiconductors in place of silicon.",
      "The materials subject to Chinese export controls are among 50 the United States Geologic Survey has designated as \u201ccritical minerals\u201d \u2014 non-fuel minerals essential to U.S. economic or national security that have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "Gallium topped that list. It is needed to make the same high-bandwidth memory chips the U.S. wants to avoid allowing China to access for use in artificial intelligence and defense applications. It's used to make LEDs, lasers and magnets used in many products. Germanium is used for optical fiber and solar panels, among other uses.",
      "A USGS study recently estimated the likely total cost to the U.S. economy from disruptions to supplies of gallium and germanium alone at more than $3 billion. But the situation is complicated. China imposed licensing requirements on exports of both metals in July 2023. It has not exported either to the U.S. this year, according to Chinese customs data. Antimony exports also have plunged.",
      "China produces the lion's share of most critical minerals, but there are alternatives. Japan also imports nearly all of its gallium, for example, but it also extracts it by recycling scrap metal.",
      "Washington has been moving to tap sources other than China, forming a \"Minerals Security Partnership\" with the EU and 15 other countries. President Joe Biden's visit to Africa this week highlighted that effort. Potential supply disruptions also have spurred efforts to tap U.S. deposits of rare earths and other critical materials in southeastern Wyoming, Montana, Nevada, Minnesota and parts of the American Southwest.",
      "Germanium has been extracted from zinc mined in Alaska and Tennessee and the U.S. government has a stockpile. The Department of Defense has a recycling program that can extract scrap germanium from night vision lenses and tank turret windows.",
      "But China's dominance as a supplier gives it an overwhelming cost advantage, and U.S. resource companies face strong pressures over the potential environmental impact of mines and refineries.",
      "Since then-President Trump launched a trade war against Beijing that has ramped up over time, China has adopted a relatively constrained and cautious approach in responding to the U.S. limits on access to advanced technology.",
      "Much depends on the future course of overall relations. It is unclear if Trump will follow through on his vows to push tariffs sharply higher once he takes office or if such declarations are the opening gambits in future trade negotiations.",
      "China hit back with its own tariff hikes, but excluded many items crucial for its own economy. It sanctioned certain companies, especially defense contractors doing business with Taiwan, but refrained from outright bans on exports of vital materials to the U.S.",
      "This time may be different.",
      "Just after China's Commerce Ministry announced its export ban, various Chinese industry associations including automakers and the China Semiconductor Association issued statements denouncing Washington's moves to curb access to strategically sensitive technologies and declaring that U.S. computer chips are unreliable.",
      "Beijing's announcement also extends its ban on exporting Chinese-produced gallium and other critical minerals to the U.S. to apply to all countries, entities and individuals, saying violators will \u201cbe held accountable according to law.\u201d",

      "The comments from Rafael Mariano Grossi came just hours after Iran said it conducted a successful space launch with its heaviest payload ever, the latest for its program that the West alleges improves Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program.",
      "The launch of the Simorgh rocket comes as Iran\u2019s nuclear program now enriches uranium at 60%, a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%. While Iran maintains its program is peaceful, officials in the Islamic Republic increasingly threaten to potentially seek the bomb and an intercontinental ballistic missile that would allow Tehran to use the weapon against distant foes like the United States.",
      "The moves are likely to further raise tensions gripping the wider Middle East over Israel\u2019s continued war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and as an uneasy ceasefire holds in Lebanon. However, Iran may as well be preparing the ground for possible talks with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who in his first term unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "The U.S. intelligence community in a report released Thursday said that while \u201cIran is not building a nuclear weapon\u201d it has \u201cundertaken activities that better position it to produce one, if it so chooses.\u201d",
      "The Iranian debate over seeking the bomb \u201crisks emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran\u2019s decision-making apparatus and shifting the thinking of current and future Iranian elites about the utility of nuclear weapons,\u201d the report added.",
      "Grossi, speaking to journalists in Bahrain, on the sidelines of the International Institute of Strategic Studies\u2019 Manama Dialogue, said his inspectors planned to see just how many centrifuges Iran would be spinning after Tehran informed his agency of its plans.",
      "\u201cI think it is very concerning,\u201d Grossi said. \u201cThey were preparing and they have all of these facilities sort of in abeyance and now they are activating that. So we are going to see.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIf they really make them turn \u2014 all of them \u2014 it's going to be a huge jump.\u201d",
      "An IAEA statement issued shortly after Grossi's remarks said Iran had begun feeding two cascades of advanced IR-6 centrifuges with uranium previously enriched up to 20% at its underground Fordo facility. That site is located under a mountain, protecting it from airstrikes.",
      "Cascades are a group of centrifuges that spin uranium gas together to more quickly enrich the uranium. The IR-6 centrifuges enrich uranium faster than Iran\u2019s baseline IR-1 centrifuges, which have been the workhorse of the country\u2019s atomic program. Adding 20% uranium, as opposed to 5% uranium previously planned, further speeds up that process.",
      "\u201cThe facility\u2019s updated design information showed that the effect of this change would be to significantly increase the rate of production,\u201d the IAEA statement said. Iran separately will start feeding natural uranium into eight other IR-6 cascades at Fordo as well to produce 5%-enriched uranium, it added.",
      "The IAEA warned in late November that Iran was preparing to begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges. That came as a response to the Board of Governors at the IAEA condemning Iran for failing to cooperate fully with the agency.",
      "Iran did not acknowledge the preparations. The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Meanwhile, the launch Friday took place at Iran\u2019s Imam Khomeini Spaceport in rural Semnan province, some 220 kilometers (135 miles) east of Tehran. That\u2019s the site of Iran\u2019s civilian space program, which has suffered a series of failed Simorgh launches in the past.",
      "The Simorgh carried what Iran described as an \u201corbital propulsion system,\u201d as well as two research systems to a 400-kilometer (250-mile) orbit above the Earth. A system that could change the orbit of a spacecraft would allow Iran to geo-synchronize the orbits of its satellites, a capability Tehran has long sought.",
      "It also carried the Fakhr-1 satellite for Iran\u2019s military, the first time Iran\u2019s civilian program is known to have carried a military payload.",
      "Iran also put the payload of the Simorgh at 300 kilograms (660 pounds), heavier than all its previous successful launches within the country. State television carried footage of a correspondent discussing the payload just as the Simorgh lifted off into the sky, as people called out: \u201cGod is the greatest!\u201d",
      "The U.S. military referred questions about the launch to the country\u2019s Space Command, which did not respond. Space experts said tracking data appeared to show the launch successfully put objects in orbit.",
      "The United States has previously said Iran\u2019s satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program expired in October 2023.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s work on space-launch vehicles \u2014 including its Simorgh \u2014 probably would shorten the timeline to produce an intercontinental ballistic missile, if it decided to develop one, because the systems use similar technologies,\u201d a U.S. intelligence community report released in July said.",
      "Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003.",
      "Under Iran\u2019s relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. The late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May.",
      "Iran\u2019s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who has been signaling he wants to negotiate with the West over sanctions, has yet to offer a strategy when it comes to Iran\u2019s ambitions in space. The Simorgh launch represented the first for his administration from the country\u2019s civil space program. Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard conducted a successful launch of its parallel program in September.",

      "In an era when online anger and social tensions are increasingly directed at the businesses consumers count on, Meta last year spent $24.4 million to surround CEO Mark Zuckerberg with security",
      "NEW YORK -- He\u2019s one of the most famous corporate leaders in the world, delivering products embraced by billions. But it\u2019s the haters that companies like Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta worry about.",
      "In an era when online anger and social tensions are increasingly directed at the businesses consumers count on, Meta last year spent $24.4 million on guards, alarms and other measures to keep Zuckerberg and the company\u2019s former chief operating officer safe.",
      "Some high-profile CEOs surround themselves with security. But the fatal shooting this week of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson while he walked alone on a New York City sidewalk has put a spotlight on the widely varied approaches companies take in protecting their leaders against threats.",
      "Thompson had no personal security and appeared unaware of the shooter lurking before he was gunned down.",
      "And today\u2019s political, economic and technological climate is only going to make the job of evaluating threats against executives and taking action to protect them even more difficult, experts say.",
      "\u201cWe are better today at collecting signals. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re any better at making sense of the signals we collect,\u201d says Fred Burton of Ontic, a provider of threat management software for companies.",
      "After Thompson's shooting, Burton said, \u201cI\u2019ve been on the phone all day with some organizations asking for consultation, saying, \u2019Am I doing enough?\u201d",
      "Since the killing, some health insurers have taken steps to safeguard their executives and rank-and-file workers.",
      "Medica, a Minnesota-based nonprofit health care firm, said Friday it is temporarily closing its six offices for security reasons and will have its employees work from home.",
      "\u201cAlthough we have received no specific threats related to our campuses, our office buildings will be temporarily closed out of an abundance of caution,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "A Medica spokesman said the company had also removed biographical information about its executives from its website as a precaution.",
      "UnitedHealth Group, parent of the insurer Thompson led, removed photos of its top executives from its website hours after the shooting, later removing their names and biographies.",
      "But well before the attack, some of the biggest U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector, were spending heavily on personal and residential security for their top executives.",
      "Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, reported the highest spending on personal security for top executives last year, filings culled by research firm Equilar show.",
      "Zuckerberg \u201cis synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,\u201d the Menlo Park, California, company explained earlier this year in an annual shareholder disclosure.",
      "At Apple, the world\u2019s largest tech company by stock valuation, CEO Tim Cook was tormented by a stalker  who sent him sexually provocative emails and even showed up outside his Silicon Valley home at one point before the company\u2019s security team successfully took legal action against her in 2022.",
      "Cook is regularly accompanied by security personnel when he appears in public. Still, the company\u2019s $820,000 allotted last year to protect top executives is a fraction of what other tech giants spent for CEO security.",
      "Just over a quarter of the companies in the Fortune 500 reported spending money to protect their CEOs and other top executives. Of those that did, the median payment for personal security doubled over the last three years to about $98,000.",
      "In many companies, investor meetings like the one UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Thompson was walking to when he was shot are viewed as very risky because details on the location and who will be speaking are highly publicized.",
      "\u201cIt gives people an opportunity to arrive well in advance and take a look at the room, take a look at how people would probably come and go out of a location,\u201d said Dave Komendat, president of DSKomendat Risk Management Services, which is based in the greater Seattle area.",
      "Some firms respond by beefing up security. For example, tech companies routinely require everyone attending a major event, such as Apple\u2019s annual unveiling of the next iPhone or a shareholder meeting, to go through airport-style security checkpoints before entering.",
      "Others forgo in-person meetings with shareholders. Government health insurance provider Centene Corp. joined that group Thursday, citing the UnitedHealthcare executive's death in announcing that its upcoming Investor Day will be held online, rather than in-person as originally planned.",
      "\u201cBut there are also company cultures that really frown on that and want their leaders to be accessible to people, accessible to shareholders, employees,\u201d Komendat said.",
      "Depending on the company, such an approach may make sense. Many top executives are little known to the public, operating in industries and locations that make them far less prone to public exposure and to threats.",
      "\u201cDetermining the need for and appropriate level of an executive-level protection program is specific to each organization,\u201d says David Johnston, vice president of asset protection and retail operations at the National Retail Federation. \u201cThese safeguards should also include the constant monitoring of potential threats and the ability to adapt to maintain the appropriate level of security and safety.\u201d",
      "Some organizations have a protective intelligence group that uses digital tools such as machine learning or artificial intelligence to comb through online comments to detect threats not only on social media platforms such as X but also on the dark web, says Komendat. They look for what\u2019s being said about the company, its employees and its leadership to uncover risks.",
      "\u201cThere are always threats directed towards senior leaders at companies. Many of them are not credible,\u201d Komendat said. \u201cThe question always is trying to determine what is a real threat versus what is someone just venting with no intent to take any additional action.\u201d",
      "Burton, a former special agent with the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service, points out that despite the current climate, there is little in the way of organized groups that target companies.",
      "Today, one of the primary worries are loners whose rantings online are fed by others who are like-minded. It\u2019s up to corporate security analysts to zero in on such dialogue and decide whether or not it represents a real threat.",
      "And CEOs aren\u2019t the only targets of disgruntled customers. In the U.S., there were 525 workplace fatalities due to assault in 2022, according to the National Safety Council. Industries including healthcare, education and service providers are more prone to violence than others, and taxi drivers are more than 20 times more likely to be murdered on the job than other workers, the group said.",
      "But the ambush of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Thompson this week is bound to get some CEOs second-guessing.",
      "\u201cWhat invariably happen at moments like this in time is you will get additional ears listening\u201d to security professionals seeking money to beef up executive protection, Burton says.",
      "\u201cBecause I can guarantee you there\u2019s not a CEO in America who\u2019s not aware of this incident.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Democrats in Michigan are pressing to pass reproductive health care legislation before the party loses its majority with the new legislative session next year",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Michigan Democrats are pushing this month to pass legislation they say will improve reproductive health care, in particular the safety of digital health data, ahead of Republicans taking over the state House in 2025.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is backing a bill designed to protect reproductive health data including data logged on menstrual cycle tracking apps. Similar legislation that has passed in other states is aimed at keeping the data from being used to target people seeking abortions.",
      "\u201cThis feels like a very urgent need for us to get this done while we have a window in Michigan with the Democratic majority for the next few weeks,\u201d said state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, sponsor of the digital privacy bill.",
      "The rush is a reaction to expectations that it will be harder to pass the reproductive health care policies Democrats favor after Republicans take control of the state House in January. Democrats kept control of the state Senate in the November election.",
      "Republicans have opposed the digital privacy bill over a section they say will stifle anti-abortion advertising.",
      "Other reproductive health bills to be considered during the December session that began Tuesday include a package on Black maternal health and an expansion of access to birth control.",
      "After the overturn of Roe v. Wade, some women in states with strict abortion bans began to worry that their health information could be used to track their reproductive status. Apps that track menstrual cycles became a major focus point.",
      "Abortion is constitutionally protected in Michigan. But McMorrow does not trust President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promise to veto any possible national abortion ban nor his campaign's efforts to distance itself from Project 2025, which proposed a rollback on abortion and contraception access.",
      "Period tracking apps allow women to take detailed day-by-day notes about their health, from how heavy their period flow is to additional symptoms such as cramping. They can log pregnancies and miscarriages.",
      "\u201cThese tools are really valuable,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cI just want to make sure that the guardrails are there when indications from the incoming federal administration is they would potentially weaponize the data in a way that is very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Federal law bars medical providers from sharing health data without a patient\u2019s consent but doesn\u2019t prevent digital tech companies from tracking menstrual cycles or an individual\u2019s location and selling it to data brokers. Legislation for federal bans have never gained momentum, largely because of opposition from the tech industry.",
      "How the legislation works varies from state to state. Washington state has digital privacy law that broadly covers all health-related data while Virginia has a law that explicitly prohibits the issuance of search warrants, subpoenas or court orders for electronic or digital menstrual health data.",
      "Michigan\u2019s proposal would require businesses or organizations to use reproductive health data only for the services it provides, and consumers must be informed of how the data is being used. In order to sell that data, an entity would need explicit, signed consent from the consumer. Consumers would also have the option to opt out from their data being sold at any time.",
      "It would also regulate retailers, who often compile data to target consumers with advertisements, and the use of geofencing, which allows marketers to target consumers with ads based on their location.",
      "The bill would prohibit identifying who is receiving reproductive health care by using location information and targeting them with advertisements. This would apply to people visiting fertility or abortion clinics.",
      "The geofencing provision of the bill has drawn objection from anti-abortion advocates. Genevieve Marnon, legislative director for Right to Life of Michigan, said in committee testimony Tuesday that the bill would prevent women visiting an abortion clinic from being reached by anti-abortion ads.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t safeguarding women\u2019s reproductive health data,\" she said. \u201cIt is limiting the options presented to women.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. John Damoose, who voted against the bill in committee, believes the geofencing provision encroaches on freedom of speech and religion by preventing anti-abortion advertising.",
      "The bill was voted out of committee Tuesday on party lines and advanced Thursday toward a final vote in the Senate chamber.",
      "Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy director at the Guttmacher Institute, expects the topic to be taken up by other state legislatures next year. Guttmacher, which supports abortion rights, tracks reproductive health trends.",
      "Over the past two years, Michigan Democrats have passed bills repealing a number of anti-abortion laws, including the state\u2019s 1931 ban, and adding surrogacy protections to state law. Lawmakers are considering a number of others related to reproductive health this month.",
      "A group of bills focused on improving maternal health for Black women would create a doula scholarship, among other measures. The Senate voted its package on the topic through to the House on Tuesday.",
      "Rep. Jaime Churches, a Democrat from the downriver area of Detroit who lost her seat in November, is trying to gain traction for two bills that would require insurance to cover fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilization and intrauterine insemination.",
      "Three bills seeking to expand access to birth control through insurance have passed the state House. McMorrow also introduced a series of bills aimed at providing long-lasting reversible contraception, such an implants or intrauterine devices, to patients who have given birth before they are discharged from a hospital.",
      "There is competition among Democrats for time during this short, lame duck session. Advocates for economic development, infrastructure and gun control measures are among the many looking to push through bills in the month that is left. Major contention over new paid sick leave and minimum wage requirements is likely to garner attention. Those discussions could reduce the amount of time available to debate reproductive health measures.",

      "Mangione, who was arrested in Pennsylvania for gun possession on Monday and faces charges in New York including second-degree murder, is challenging his extradition.",
      "\"He has constitutional rights and that's what he's doing,\" his attorney, Thomas Dickey, told reporters.",
      "At one point during Tuesday's court appearance, Mangione tried to interject while Dickey was attempting to convince the judge to release him on bail. He was discussing the $8,000 in U.S. currency and $2,000 in foreign currency Mangione was allegedly found with. Dickey instructed his client, \"Don't say a word.\"",
      "The judge ordered Mangione, 26, held without bail.",
      "The Manhattan District Attorney's Office said it will seek a governor's warrant to try to force Mangione's extradition. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement that she'll sign a request for the governor's warrant \"to ensure this individual is tried and held accountable.\"",
      "Dickey told reporters Mangione will plead not guilty to the Pennsylvania charges. He said he anticipates that Mangione will also plead not guilty to the second-degree murder charge in New York.",
      "The attorney said he has limited information about the facts of the New York murder case but he conceded Mangione is \"accused of some serious matters.\" He added that Mangione is \"taking it as well as he can.\"",
      "Dickey declined to answer when asked if Mangione has been in touch with his family.",
      "Mangione's mother filed in November a missing person report in San Francisco, seeking info on Mangione, according to two law enforcement sources. Repeated requests for information about the report went unanswered by the San Francisco Police Department. Both the chief and the spokesman referred questions to the NYPD.",
      "When Mangione was arrested on Monday, he had \"written admissions about the crime\" with him, according to the New York arrest warrant.",
      "Mangione had several handwritten pages on him that expressed a \"disdain for corporate America\" and indicated \"he's frustrated with the health care system in the United States,\" NYPD Chief of Detective Joe Kenny told ABC News' \"Good Morning America\" on Tuesday.",
      "Mangione's writings, obtained by ABC News, addressed to the \"Feds,\" said, \"I do apologize for any strife of traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming.\"",
      "He claimed that the U.S. has the most expensive health care system in the world, but ranks about No. 42 in life expectancy. He said UnitedHealthcare \"has grown and grown, but as our life expectancy? No the reality is, these [indecipherable] have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit.\"",
      "Mangione appears to have been inspired by the Unabomber, according to an NYPD intel analysis report obtained by ABC News.",
      "The report warned that like Ted Kaczynski -- whose 17-year bombing campaign killed three and injured 23 people -- Mangione may become a \"martyr\" who inspires \"a wide range of extremists\" to act.",
      "Mangione \"appeared to view the targeted killing ... as a symbolic takedown and a direct challenge to its alleged corruption and 'power games,'\" according to a confidential assessment of the crime by the NYPD intelligence bureau described to ABC News.",
      "Whether Mangione has a personal connection to UnitedHealthcare is unknown, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.",
      "A UnitedHealth Group spokesperson said in a statement, \"Our hope is that today's apprehension brings some relief to Brian's family, friends, colleagues and the many others affected by this unspeakable tragedy. We thank law enforcement and will continue to work with them on this investigation.\"",
      "Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Monday in connection with Thompson's Dec. 4 slaying.",
      "The NYPD was \"thrilled\" to get the call from Altoona police that they had a person of interest in custody, Tisch told \"GMA.\"",
      "Kenny said \"the key to this case\" was releasing photos of the suspect's face to the media and the public.",

      "\"We are grateful as a city to that person,\" Tisch said.",

      "\"We do have a lot of evidence in this case,\" Tisch told \"GMA.\"",
      "Mangione was apprehended \"in possession of the same New Jersey fake identification that was used\" to check into a hostel on New York's Upper West Side before Thompson was gunned down, she said.",
      "The gun Mangione was allegedly found with on Monday \"looks very similar\" to the gun used in the murder, \"with a similar suppressor,\" Tisch said. \"So there's a lot of reasons that we feel very strongly that he is the person of interest.\"",
      "Officers allegedly found a 3D printed pistol and a 3D printed silencer, according to the criminal complaint filed in Pennsylvania.",
      "\"The pistol had one loaded Glock magazine with six nine-millimeter full metal jack rounds. There was also one loose nine-millimeter hollow point round,\" the complaint said.",
      "Kenny described the weapon as a \"ghost gun,\" meaning it had no serial number and was untraceable.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 15:37:24 -0500",
    "summary": "A top government watchdog raised concerns over the handling of leak investigations during the first Trump administration that targeted members of Congress and the media.",
    "story": [
      "The investigations were not publicly disclosed until after Trump left office.",
      "A top government watchdog raised concerns Tuesday over the handling of leak investigations during the first Trump administration that targeted members of Congress and the media despite finding no evidence that the inquiries were politically motivated, according to a newly released report.",
      "Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz initiated the investigation after public reports that prosecutors, during President-elect Donald Trump's first term, had obtained warrants to access communications records for members of Congress, congressional staffers and reporters at CNN, the New York Times and the Washington Post to identify sources of apparent leaks of classified information.",
      "The investigations were not publicly disclosed until after Trump left office, in part because prosecutors had secured court orders that prevented lawmakers, their staff and media members from learning about the searches.",
      "While his name is not mentioned directly in the report, Kash Patel, Trump's pick for FBI director, was among the congressional staffers at the time of the Trump-era leak probe whose records were searched, a source familiar with the investigation confirmed.",
      "Patel has also said publicly on multiple occasions that he was subject to investigation by Trump's DOJ and was also informed by Google that the DOJ had sought information on his personal accounts.",
      "The report, which comes as Trump has threatened to take action against his political rivals and the media through the DOJ and FBI, reveals the scope of the leak investigations into members of Congress and their staff was much broader than previous reports suggested.",
      "Rep. Eric Swalwell and now-Sen. Adam Schiff, both California Democrats, previously revealed their records had been seized as part of the investigation, Horowitz's report revealed prosecutors also searched the records of 43 others who were congressional staffers at the time the leaked information was published.",
      "But Horowitz's report noted that the partisan affiliation of the staffers was not imbalanced -- 21 staffers whose records were searched were Democrats, 20 were Republicans, and two worked in nonpartisan positions. The inspector general investigation determined the basis for the staffers' records being searched was entirely due to their known ability to access the materials that were found to be leaked to the press, while the investigations into Schiff, then a congressman, and Swalwell were initially bolstered by information given to the department by an unidentified committee staffer who suspected them of leaking -- but provided no evidence to support the claims.",
      "Horowitz's report expressed concerns regarding the congressional leak investigations largely related to a lack of existing policies at the DOJ to provide senior-level oversight over such investigations that implicate the separation of powers. Records reviewed by Horowitz said the inquiries into members of Congress were conducted by career prosecutors almost entirely without senior-level supervision or notification and that there was no evidence they were pressured to carry out the inquiries despite Trump and other Republicans repeatedly singling out Schiff and Swalwell as possible leakers.",
      "According to Horowitz, that the department was able to carry out its sweeping investigation of the members of Congress and their staff solely on the basis of them having had access to the leaked information \"risks chilling Congress's ability to conduct oversight of the executive branch because it exposes congressional officials to having their records reviewed by the Department solely for conducting Congress's constitutionally authorized oversight duties.\"",
      "As for the Trump-era leak investigations of reporters from CNN, the New York Times and the Washington Post, Horowitz found that officials in the department violated several policies that existed at the time then-Attorney General William Barr authorized the investigations. Prosecutors failed to convene a News Media Review Committee that would normally be consulted in the process of investigations of leaks to members of the media and, in one of the investigations, failed to obtain approval from the director of national intelligence, according to the report.",
      "Upon disclosure of the news media leak investigations in 2021, Attorney General Merrick Garland convened several meetings with newsroom leaders across Washington, D.C., and ultimately implemented new DOJ policy that bars prosecutors from securing search warrants for reporters' records to obtain information about their sources.",
      "The future of that policy, however, remains very much in question -- given public comments by Trump and his top allies suggesting they fully intend to use the powers of the DOJ and the FBI to target political enemies and even possibly members of the media during his second term. While Horowitz's report offered up several recommendations for internal policy fixes to the issued identified in the report, all of which were accepted by the Biden DOJ, it will be up to leadership in the incoming Trump DOJ to determine whether those recommendations will be implemented."

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 18:14:30 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks were back on Capitol Hill to shore up support among GOP senators, including his embattled Pentagon pick Pete Hegseth.",
    "story": [
      "GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she had a \"good exchange\" with him Tuesday.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks were back on Capitol Hill on Tuesday looking to shore up support among Republican senators, including Pete Hegseth, his embattled choice for defense secretary.",
      "Hegseth last week faced significant headwinds after new allegations of financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety and other disqualifying behavior were reported by the New Yorker. ABC News has not independently confirmed the magazine's report, and Hegseth's denied many of the accusations.",
      "But he might be gaining back some ground. On Monday, a key Republican senator appeared to soften her view toward Hegseth.",
      "Sen. Joni Ernst, a member of the Armed Services Committee and, like Hegseth, a combat veteran, previously said she wasn't ready to back Hegseth. But after their second meeting on Monday, she said she'd be \"supporting him through this process\" -- though she would not say whether she would ultimately vote in favor of his confirmation.",
      "Hegseth said Tuesday he wouldn't speak for Ernst, but \"I appreciate the time\u2026. amazing conversation, foreign affairs, combat vet, welcomed all of her insight,\" he said while moving between meetings in Hart Senate Office Building.",
      "Political pressure has ramped up on Republican lawmakers to back Trump's Pentagon choice, as a conservative group with ties to Trump ally Elon Musk is spending half a million dollars on a new ad pushing for Hegseth's confirmation. An ad urging viewers to call their senator and push them to back Hegseth will run on national television, but will also be targeted online in Iowa -- Ernst's home state.",
      "ABC reported last week Trump was not making calls to senators on Hegseth, as he had for Matt Gaetz, his first choice for attorney general. But since then, the president-elect publicly backed Hegseth twice, once in a social media post and then in an interview with NBC that aired on Sunday. Trump told \"Meet the Press\" he still had confidence in Hegseth and that \"he's going to do fine.\"",
      "Then on Tuesday, the Trump team released a hype video for Hegseth that compiled friendly GOP senators praising him.",
      "\"Pete Hegseth is an exceptionally qualified, highly educated, and tough patriot who has not only served this country with courage, but has also devoted his life to advocating for our troops and veterans,\" Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"Mr. Hegseth's extensive military experience, combined with his steadfast commitment to restoring the Pentagon and our armed forces to greatness, will advance President Trump's vision of returning meritocracy, accountability, and efficiency to the United States military.\"",
      "Multiple Republican senators said on Tuesday they were seeing a positive turn in the tide for Hegseth.",
      "\"Right now, he is in pretty good shape. I think he is very smart,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham said after last week calling the reports about Hegseth \"very disturbing.\"",
      "\"So the accusations about mismanaging money and about non-consensual behavior. If they come forward, I will listen to those accusations, but they have to be credible and they have to be presented in a fashion that Pete can rebut. So, he's much better off this week than he was last week,\" Graham said.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, a key member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters after their meeting that he would support Hegseth during his confirmation.",
      "\"I will support Pete Hegseth, as I always say, barring any unforeseen circumstances. But I've known him a long time. I was satisfied with his answers and I think this is going to be a hard process on him and his family and some of it will be enormously unfair but I respect his willingness to give up a nice cushy job at Fox in order to serve the nation and the military that he has devoted a large percentage of his life to,\" Cornyn said.",
      "Hegseth had a high-stakes meeting Tuesday afternoon with Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, another Republican viewed as possibly opposing his confirmation.",
      "Asked by ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce if she had learned anything that swayed her at all, Murkowski replied, \"I had a good exchange with Mr. Hegseth.\"",
      "Then, when asked by reporters if she would support Hegseth's nomination, she answered, \"I had a good exchange and we'll see what the process bears.\"",
      "She continued, \"He's got probably at least half the Senate that he is going to visit with. He's got a process that is going to involve full vetting for the administration.\"",
      "Hegseth told reporters, \"I appreciate her very much. It was a wonderful meeting and a great discussion.\"",
      "ABC News previously reported Trump's team was focused on determining where female GOP senators stand, given they could decide his fate given the party's thin three-seat majority in the new Congress. Hegseth is also expected to meet with Sen. Susan Collins on Wednesday.",
      "Hegseth's agreed to an FBI background check, which many Republican senators said they wanted to be a part of the vetting process. He's also appeared to try to clean up his past comments about women in the military.",
      "Hegseth previously said women should not serve in combat roles. During an interview on Fox News on Monday, Hegseth claimed he wanted to \"clarify\" his position, though did not explicitly reverse his stance.",
      "\"I also want an opportunity here to clarify comments that have been misconstrued that I somehow don't support women in the military,\" he said. \"Some of our greatest warriors, our best warriors out there are women who serve, raise their right hand to defend this country and love our nation, want to defend that flag and do that every single day.\"",
      "Other Trump picks on the Hill on Tuesday included Kash Patel, the president-elect's selection for FBI director, and Tulsi Gabbard, his pick for director of national intelligence.",
      "Patel met with Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who afterwards voiced his support and told reporters he felt comfortable voting for him.",
      "\"If you're going to clean up the FBI and actually get them focused on mission rather than politics, refocus them on actually putting America first, doing their job, Kash is the perfect person for that,\" Mullin said.",
      "ABC News' Benjamin Siegel and Kelsey Walsh contributed to this report."

    "title": "America's swing to the right in 2024 was wide, if not always deep",
    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 16:58:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump gained ground in every state and most counties in the 2024 election compared to 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Trump gained ground in every state and most counties compared to 2020.",
      "Despite what you may have heard, the 2024 election was pretty close. President-elect Donald Trump won a clear victory in the Electoral College, but he leads outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris in the national popular vote by only 1.5 percentage points, 49.8 percent to 48.3 percent* \u2014 one of the smallest margins ever in a presidential race.",
      "Nonetheless, the magnitude of Trump's triumph may appear much larger because it featured a major swing to the right from where the nation voted in 2020. As President Joe Biden defeated Trump by about 4.5 points nationally four years ago, Trump's 2024 advantage represents about a 6-point shift to the right, which is the largest swing toward either party since 2008. Back then, Barack Obama's 7.3-point edge represented a nearly 10-point swing to the left from George W. Bush's 2.5-point win in 2004.",
      "Yet the national swing only tells part of the story. What particularly stands out this year is the breadth of the swing in Trump's direction across not only the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but also an overwhelming majority of the more than 3,000 counties or their equivalents in the United States. Compared with his showing in 2020, Trump didn't pick up a huge amount of ground in many places, but he did gain at least a little bit nearly everywhere. We can see this by drilling into the state-level and county-level data below.",
      "Every state swung to the right in 2024",
      "From one presidential election to the next, more states usually swing toward the party that gains ground compared with how it performed four years earlier. However, it's rare for every state to move in the same direction, even in elections where one candidate wins decisively. After all, changes in the makeup of the party coalitions and the varying appeal of individual candidates can lead different states to move in opposite directions. Plus, at least in a few historical cases, a third-party candidate may have won a meaningful share of the vote that cut more into one party's coalition than another.",
      "But in 2024, all 50 states and D.C. swung to the right to varying degrees based on their margins versus the 2020 race. This marked the first presidential election since 1976 in which all 51 components of the Electoral College moved in the same direction relative to how they voted four years earlier.",
      "Unlike 1976, though, all 50 states and D.C. moved to the right in 2024 even though the previous election was also highly competitive. That wasn't the case in the closely fought 1976 race won by Jimmy Carter: His victory came four years after a landslide result in 1972, when Richard Nixon carried 49 states and won by 23 points nationally \u2014 the largest popular vote edge a candidate has earned in the post-World War II era \u2014 making 1976's leftward swing more of a return to a highly competitive baseline.",
      "Although six other elections since 1976 featured larger swings than in 2024, at least one state in each of those contests still moved toward the party that lost ground. In 1980, Vermont was the only state where Carter's margin improved even as he lost reelection badly to Ronald Reagan. In 1984, Reagan built significantly on his 1980 margins while winning the only definite landslide since Nixon's 1972 victory, but seven states and D.C. still voted more Democratic than they had four years earlier. Republicans lost ground in 49 states while winning again in 1988, but George H.W. Bush's margin grew very slightly over Reagan's in Tennessee and D.C. When the elder Bush lost reelection in 1992, he did worse in nearly every state, but still managed to improve his margin slightly in Iowa. And when Obama won by the largest margin in recent years in 2008, five now-dark red states trended right (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia).",
      "While every state swung to the right in 2024, the extent of that swing did vary quite a bit. Weighted by each state's share of the national popular vote, the average state shifted 5.6 points to the right by margin from its 2020 result. Leading the way was New York, which Harris only won by about 13 points after Biden carried it by 23 points \u2014 a swing of more than 10 points. Other populous blue states like New Jersey (10 points) and California (9 points) also swung notably to the right, as did large red states like Florida (10 points) and Texas (8 points).",
      "Conversely, 36 states and D.C. shifted to the right by less than the weighted average. Those states tended to be less populous and therefore more rural, but also include most of the seven principal swing states in the 2024 race, which had the most concentrated campaign attention and spending during the election. Of those, only Arizona had a larger-than-average shift to the right of 5.8 points, while Nevada's 5.5-point rightward shift was about the same as the weighted average. Beyond that, Michigan swung just 4.2 points to the right, and the other four swing states \u2014 Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 all swung right by fewer than 3 points.",
      "Of all the states, Washington state had the smallest swing to the right, going from Biden +19 to Harris +18. The Washington outcome serves as yet another reminder that you should never rely on one data point as an indicator of things to come. After all, Washington's blanket and top-two primary results have often served as a decent predictor for the national political environment in the ensuing November election. But in 2024, Democrats running for the U.S. House of Representatives did better in the state's top-two primaries than they performed in 2020 or 2022, yet the November results saw Republicans nationally do much better than in 2020 and similar to their 2022 result in the national popular vote for the House.",
      "Most counties swung right to a small or medium degree",
      "Naturally, as one party gains more compared to the last election, it tends to gain a larger share of voters across the nation's counties, and county-level data can help us understand the depth and breadth of the swing behind an election's outcome. But a simple count of the number of counties that moved in one direction isn't especially helpful in painting this picture. After all, most counties are rural (and consistently conservative-leaning), but rocks and trees can't vote. Carter's 1976 victory was the last time a Democratic presidential nominee won more counties than the Republican did, yet Democrats have won five of the 12 White House contests since then.",
      "To get a read on the scope of county-level swings, it's more useful to consider the share of the nation's overall vote found in counties that moved toward one party or the other. That way, we better account for the vast differences in population across counties. By this measure, the rightward swing of Trump's 2024 victory featured substantial breadth. Compared with the 2020 election, 92 percent of voters lived in counties (or their equivalents) that swung toward Trump, while only 8 percent lived in places that moved toward Harris. The only recent election to rival that span is Obama's 2008 win, when 92 percent of voters lived in counties that swung to the left from the 2004 election.",
      "Now, the depth of Trump's swing was somewhat shallower than Obama's 2008 win, which isn't necessarily surprising considering 2008 saw a bigger overall swing nationally (9.7 points to the left). More than half of all votes in 2008 came from places that swung at least 10 points to the left by margin. By comparison, only 11 percent of 2024 votes hailed from counties that swung more than 10 points to the right, while 81 percent overall came from counties that shifted between zero and 10 points to the right.",
      "Compared to recent contests besides 2008, though, the broad scope of Trump's gains across much of the country seem striking. The third-biggest swing in the past quarter century after 2008 and 2024 came in 2012, when Obama won reelection but the country as a whole swung 3.4 points to the right. Yet even as much of the country swung slightly to the right that year, about 1 in 4 votes still came from counties that moved at least somewhat to the left. In 2020, we saw a similar story: Biden swung the country about 2.4 points to the left from 2016, but a tad more than 1 in 4 votes came from counties that swung right toward Trump.",
      "Another data point further suggests that the shift from 2020 to 2024 was not just broad, but especially consistent in its impacts across the country. Overall, the correlation between each county's margin in 2020 compared with 2024 was .995 on a scale of -1 to 1 \u2014 a near-perfect positive association between the two elections, and the strongest between the results in any two consecutive presidential elections dating back to 2000. To be clear, this does not mean that the results were the same in each county in 2020 and 2024. Rather, it broadly means that the more Republican a county voted in 2020, the more Republican it tended to vote in 2024.",
      "Although results in other recent pairs of elections have been highly correlated as well, the 2020-24 comparison is particularly notable because such an incredibly strong association happened even while the country swung 6 points to the right. This suggests that, broadly speaking, this ample national swing did not vary massively across the country. By contrast, the sizable 10-point swing to the left in 2008 from 2004 had a county-level correlation of .933, meaning that while the margins across counties were relatively similar, more places still saw some substantial movement that didn't correspond as closely. And in 2016, which saw particularly large county-level swings from 2012 because of the shifting nature of the Democratic and Republican coalitions at the start of the Trump era, the correlation between the two contests was .945.",
      "***",
      "The breadth of the nation's rightward swing could suggest a couple of larger possibilities. Considering 2008 saw the only similarly large national shift in recent times amid financial and global turmoil, the broad swing in 2024 seems to be another point in favor of larger fundamentals-based reasons for the shifts in this election. Dissatisfaction with the economic status quo and immigration, along with high disapproval of the incumbent president, were all clear boons for Trump's candidacy.",
      "At the same time, Trump's gains may have greater resonance moving forward. The relative consistency of the county-level shifts suggests that there weren't major coalition shifts this year, but even minor swings could be a harbinger. Notably, Trump improved most in more urban and more racially diverse places. Odds are that the 2028 election results will be highly correlated with the 2024 results, so even small coalition changes in this election could have a long-term impact on the makeup of the parties and the preferences of voters as we look ahead to future elections.",

    "summary": "A pressure campaign from allies of Donald Trump toward Senate skeptics of some of his Cabinet picks appears to be starting to pay off",
    "story": [
      "\"The president's been very clear of what he wants,\" one Republican said.",
      "A pressure campaign from allies of Donald Trump toward Senate Republican skeptics of some of his Cabinet picks appears to be starting to pay off in a sign of the president-elect's anticipated sway once he enters the Oval Office next month.",
      "Some GOP senators, such Joni Ernst of Iowa and South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, who had been dubious about how they'd vote on Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News host and Trump's pick for Pentagon chief, are sounding more optimistic on getting to \"yes,\" even if they're not quite there yet.",
      "And broader furor around other controversial nominees, including former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to be director of national intelligence, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, and Kash Patel to lead the FBI has drawn fewer headlines as the picks meet with senators, though all three are still expected to face tight confirmation processes.",
      "The shifts have come after Trump allies in Washington and in the news media underscored the importance of the president-elect getting his preferred administration in place and shone a glaring spotlight on potential holdouts, making clear that nothing short of their political survival was at stake.",
      "\"A month ago, they had running room and courage to oppose Hegseth. They've run out of runway and any courage now is false because the MAGA base is onto them and will make them pay,\" said one source close to the transition, referencing Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" mantra.",
      "After it appeared that Hegseth's nomination was on life support, the pressure campaign kicked into high gear.",
      "Trump himself has been more vocal recently about Hegseth, saying on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" over the weekend that \"we'll be working on his nomination\" and \"I've had a lot of senators calling me up saying he's fantastic.\" Trump's transition also released what essentially amounted to a hype video Tuesday, touting some senators' glowing remarks about Hegseth.",
      "A conservative group with ties to Elon Musk, the world's richest man who has carved out a powerful role inside Trump's orbit, is also spending $500,000 on a new ad pushing the Senate to confirm Hegseth. The ads push viewers to \"call your senator today and urge them to confirm Pete Hegseth\" and are airing nationally -- but also targeting digital platforms in Ernst's home state of Iowa.",
      "Those moves, compounded by electoral threats from Trump online media allies like Steve Bannon and Dan Bongino, seem to have moved the needle, even as Hegseth continues to bat away allegations of excessive drinking and sexual misconduct from former colleagues and one woman who claims he raped her.",
      "After predicting there would be \"a very thorough vetting before [Hegseth] moves forward,\" Ernst said after an \"encouraging\" meeting Monday, \"As I support Pete through this process, I look forward to a fair hearing based on truth, not anonymous sources.\"",
      "Graham, who had cast the claims against Hegseth as serious, also said Monday that he had \"a very positive, thorough and candid meeting\u201d with Hegseth and echoed that accusations should be \"supported by testimony before Congress -- not anonymous sources.\"",
      "The movement indicates the immense power Trump and his allies hold, and how influential they could be with the party's base. And the political graveyard is packed with the careers of Republican lawmakers who defied Trump, only to lose office in a primary.",
      "\"We will use every resource at our disposal to make sure that every one of Trump's nominees and Cabinet picks are confirmed. And if that does not happen, the ultimate recourse will be at the ballot box for those elected officials who choose to not vote for them,\" said a second source close to the transition. \"That includes Pete, that includes Bobby, that includes Kash, includes everybody.\"",
      "\"We've been very clear. And the president has made calls to various U.S. senators for some of his nominees. The president's been very clear of what he wants. Elon Musk has been very clear,\" the person added. \"When you're the world's richest man, and you have $350 billion, that makes politicians quake.\"",
      "To be sure, Hegseth himself has also been putting in the work to get confirmed. He's continued to deny the allegations against him, held a blitz of meetings with senators, and Ernst said he committed to appointing a senior official who would tackle the issue of sexual assault within the military.",
      "But the role of Trump's allies can't be dismissed.",
      "The pressure campaign is coming ahead of a new Congress in which Republicans will hold a 53-47 Senate majority, meaning any Cabinet pick cannot afford to lose more than three GOP votes if Democrats vote unanimously in opposition.",
      "Members of Congress are historically fervent in their defense of their role as an equal branch of government -- a role manifested in their \"advice and consent\" function regarding a president's Cabinet picks. Already, Senate opposition sunk the fortunes of former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Trump's pick for attorney general who had been accused of sexual misconduct that he denied.",
      "Yet Trump has a unique hold on his base, and threats of primaries in cases of disloyalty may be a permanent fixture for lawmakers to prevent opposition to Cabinet picks to mushroom over the next several weeks -- and to enforce support over next four years.",
      "\"I think that these senators are very susceptible to pressure because they've witnessed what's happened to members who are now former members who opposed the president. So, we're seeing a lot of members change their tune because they're worried and they don't ever be primaried out of office, and they don't want to have the president having some cross words for them,\" said Brian Darling, a GOP strategist and former Senate aide.",

      "Already, damage may have been done for Senate GOP critics, some Republicans warned.",
      "Even if every Republican senator comes around on all of Trump's picks, the president-elect's supporters have long memories -- and the strain of populism that is one of the country's dominant political drivers has piqued anti-incumbent fervor.",
      "\"Even her pushback has been noticed in Iowa,\" Bob Vander Plaats, an influential Christian conservative leader in Iowa, said of Ernst. \"You've seen a lot of people push back on her because of it, and there's been some calls from primarily those outside of Iowa going, 'she probably should be primaried.' I haven't seen anything real of that measure in Iowa yet. But it's a primary rich environment today.\"",

      "He also slammed Trump's economic plan as 'another tax cut for the very wealthy.'",
      "President Joe Biden delivered remarks Tuesday focused on his administration\u2019s economic legacy, drawing a sharp contrast between his four years in office and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s past and future terms.",
      "Biden, speaking at the Brookings Institution, reflected on the economy he inherited from Trump and his administration\u2019s work to help the country recover from COVID-19, arguing his approach to the economy benefited more people than Trump\u2019s trickle-down theory.",
      "Biden was critical of the Trump administration for having \u201cno plan, real plan, to get us through one of the toughest periods in our nation's history,\u201d but he said he did learn one thing from Trump.",
      "\u201cYou know, within the first two months of office, I signed the American Rescue Plan, the most significant economic recovery package in our history. I also learned something from Donald Trump -- he signed checks for people, 7,400 bucks, because we passed the plan and I didn't. Stupid,\u201d Biden said with a laugh, though he got the total amount of the stimulus checks wrong.",
      "When asked at the White House press briefing about the comment, Jared Bernstein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said the president was \u201cjoking.\u201d",
      "With the country at an \u201cinflection point\u201d after the 2024 elections, the president looked ahead to Trump\u2019s next term, saying, \u201cI pray to God the president-elect throws away Project 2025.\u201d He also bluntly called Trump\u2019s tariff threat \u201ca major mistake.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll accounts the incoming administration is determined to return the country to another round of trickle-down economics and another tax cut for the very wealthy that will not be paid for or, if paid for, is going to have a real cost, once again causing massive deficits or significant cuts in basic programs, health care, education, veterans' benefits,\u201d Biden said.",
      "\u201cOn top of that, he seems determined to impose steep universal tariffs on all imported goods brought to this country on the mistaken belief that foreign countries will bear the cost of those tariffs rather than the American consumer,\" Biden added. \"Who do you think pays for this? I believe this approach is a major mistake. I believe we have proven that approach is a mistake over the past four years. But we all know in time -- we all know in time what will happen.\"",
      "Speaking of his own administration\u2019s actions, Biden touted its work in bringing manufacturing back to the United States, boosting production of semiconductor chips, lowering health care costs and making major investments in infrastructure.",
      "Biden also praised his team\u2019s work to get inflation under control and raise wages, though he did acknowledge that \u201ctoo many working- and middle-class families struggle with high prices for housing and groceries and daily needs of life,\u201d and he pointed to the pandemic and the war in Ukraine for driving up inflation.",
      "Biden asked for his record to be compared to Trump\u2019s at the end of his successor\u2019s term.",
      "\u201cPresident Reagan said, and I quote, \u2018Facts are stubborn things. Facts are stubborn things.\u2019 They are. Here are the facts, a set marker of benchmarks, if you will, and we should measure the success or failure of our next four years: During my presidency, we created 60 million new jobs in America. Will the next president create jobs or, like Herbert Hoover, be the only president to lose jobs in his administration?\u201d asked Biden, who in the past year has referred to his political rival as \u201cDonald \u2018Herbert Hoover\u2019 Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201cDuring my presidency, we see the lowest average unemployment rate of ... any administration in 50 years,\u201d Biden added. \u201cWill the unemployment be higher or lower in the next four years?\"",

      "\u201cI believe the only way for a president to lead America now is to lead all of America. And I believe the economy I'm leaving at the moment -- and others can do better than I did, I'm not saying I was perfect -- but ends up, at this moment, the best economy, strongest economy in the world and for all Americans doing better,\u201d Biden said, adding that while he\u2019s leaving the presidency, he\u2019s \u201cnot going anywhere.\u201d"

      "They say Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs is their biggest concern.",
      "As Democratic governors prepare to navigate and resist parts of President-elect Donald Trump's next administration, one told ABC News she is most alarmed by Trump's tariff plan.",
      "\"Tariffs would be devastating to our economy, especially with the amount of trade we do with Canada,\" Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey told ABC News.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose a 25% across the board tariff on Mexico and Canada, in addition to a 10% tariff on goods imported from China. These are the U.S.'s top three trading partners. Economists warn this would raise prices on everyday goods and wreak havoc on the economy.",
      "\"I'm a governor who's come in, cut taxes, worked to lower housing costs, grow the economy. If he were to impose tariffs -- it would first of all -- I think it's not smart to do -- and it would be devastating to consumers,\" Healey said, \"Think about all the housing we're trying to build here right now -- what will that do to housing costs?\"",
      "In an interview with NBC News that aired on Sunday, Trump said he couldn't guarantee that his tariff plan would not raise prices for American consumers.",
      "Other Democratic governors, who gathered last weekend for the first time since the election for a winter meeting in Beverly Hills, California, said Trump's tariff proposals were a chief concern among a number of others: threats to entitlements, his immigration proposals, and repeals of climate and reproductive protections. Several high-profile governors told ABC News they're deep into preparations to use legislative, executive or legal actions to combat Trump's moves.",
      "At the Beverly Hilton over the weekend, the tight-knit group of Democratic talent -- many of whom will be some of the strongest detractors of Trump's policies and also some of the best-positioned to be at the top of the party's presidential ticket in 2028 -- gathered for private, closed-door meetings with one another, donors and other stakeholders. The group of about 18 governors and governors-elect, hosted by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, focused on how to navigate through Trump's leadership, according to several who spoke with ABC News, rather than any significant post-election analysis following the Democrats' losses last month.",
      "The group of governors in Beverly Hills included many of the likely 2028 contenders, including blue state leaders like Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who have been actively on offense against Republican leadership since Nov. 6, and red state ones like Democratic Governors Association Vice Chair and Chair-elect Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.",
      "Healey, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz were also on the guest list -- many of whom have questions looming about their own political futures.",
      "\"I would expect that we'll put up quite a fight to take the House back. And I think that we'll have an incredible bench in the primary '28,\" New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told ABC News about the plans of many of the governors.",
      "The governors are striking different tones as they prepare for Trump's presidency.",
      "The strongest, most combative voices of course have been from leaders like Newsom, who initiated a recently convened a special legislative session in California to increase funding for its Department of Justice and other agencies so they'll be able to quickly file litigation to challenge actions taken by a second Trump administration. Pritzker, too, has made not-so-veiled threats about how he'd approach the administration should it \"come for\" his people, and recently announced his position as co-chair, along with Jared Polis of Colorado, of a new nonpartisan coalition of governors committed to protecting the \"state-level institutions of democracy\" ahead of Trump's presidency.",
      "Other governors encouraged their peers to meet this moment offensively through their agendas.",
      "\"Democratic governors should approach this with strength and resolution and an activist agenda. Because this is the place where we can make progress too,\" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee told ABC News.",
      "\"You can't stop some 85% of the things I would like to do in that state, so I think the order of the day is defend where we can in fighting with an advance every day with our own ambitions and unaffected by him, so that shadow doesn't fall in our state,\" said Inslee, who is leaving his seat this winter to make way for incoming Gov. Bob Ferguson.",
      "But a different group of governors are acting much more lukewarm in their approaches, emphasizing their desire to \"work\" with the Trump administration and some citing past collaborations with the president-elect's team, like during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Beshear said last weekend that Democrats needed to lean into \"reason\" while Trump is in office and that he's willing to work with the incoming administration.",
      "\"The middle ground, middle of the road, common ground, common sense, is open. It's open,\" Beshear told a group of reporters on Saturday.",
      "Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, the DGA's chair, said this weekend that she wasn't yet anticipating Trump or his agencies' actions, but \"We will always look for ways to work together\" with the caveat that she'll \"draw the line\" on things \"that they push us to do that we think are wrong, illegal, anything like that.\"",
      "The varying approaches from governors to Trump's agenda could be a coordinated strategy as the group wrestles with how best to support each other within a party attempting to rebuild -- a complicated task as they also eye each other as potential presidential primary competition.",
      "\"We know how to create space to protect people and protect the priorities,\" Lujan Grisham told ABC, noting that she and many other governors aren't officially part of Pritzker and Polis' new coalition, for example. \"We did it on climate. We still do it on climate. We did it on reproductive premiums, we're gonna have to still do it on reproductive premiums, and we'll do some test cases in states that allow us to frame and direct these coalitions.\"",
      "\"We want to be strategic about what it is that we are announcing. And here's why: We've got a president-elect and a team that, before this and every day, said 'We're going to punish anyone in our way, and we're going to particularly punish states,'\" she went on. \"And the difference in California versus New Mexico -- California is definitely on the radar. I don't minimize what the Trump administration can negatively do to my state, but we're also very effective at watching and understanding what's occurring, and then we can deploy our joint efforts pretty damn fast.\"",
      "While governors can mount legal fights against parts of Trump's plan, the president can use executive power to impose sweeping tariffs.",
      "But for immigration, on the other hand, governors can resist Trump's proposals in clearer ways.",
      "Border state Gov. Lujan Grisham told ABC News she'd block Trump's ability to use detention centers, deploy the National Guard or even request data in her state if he attempted mass deportations.",
      "\"I take him at his word. He says he's going to do, try to do mass deportations,\" she said, adding that she wouldn't be a partner in those moves: \"There's a lot that he can't do by himself.\" .\"I mean, I've made it very clear over a number of years on this issue is that I will not use our National Guard to perform that kind of service,\" Kelly told reporters.",
      "\"I will not send them to the border. We have had Guard members go to the border, but they have been federalized when they've been down there. I don't see that as the role of the National Guard -- they are there to serve Kansas, Kansas issues, so I don't see that changing... The State Police are mine, and it's not their job, either. So we will take the same approach as we have with the Guard,\" Kelly added.",
      "On immigration, most Democratic governors agree that violent criminals need to be deported, noting that it's always been the case that local and state law enforcement work with federal authorities on investigating crimes. But where many governors draw the line is on deporting undocumented immigrants who have been living and working in America for a long time, arguing it's inhumane and damages the economy.",
      "\"We don't know what President Trump's immigration plan is going to look like at the end of the day. He is a master of saying something, creating a great deal of noise, and then the reality may be different. So I'm going to wait to see exactly what it is he ultimately proposes,\" incoming North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein told reporters about his plans to respond to Trump's immigration moves.",
      "\"The people of North Carolina have every right to be safe in their communities, and anybody who commits a violent crime must be held accountable, fully, and that's whether they're in this country as American citizens or they're here as undocumented people, and if they're here undocumented, they should be deported,\" Stein said.",
      "They also question how Trump will execute his plan. Trump could direct the National Guard to help with transport and logistics, but one Democratic governor told ABC News these are precious resources, and they need their National Guard for emergencies like storms, fires and severe flooding.",
      "Trump's team has discussed in the past how to strip federal resources from Democratic-run cities if they refuse to work with the administration on deporting undocumented immigrants, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "Blue state governors say they're concerned about the Trump administration weaponizing federal funding and \"picking winners and losers.\" One governor told ABC News their state is focused on locking down every federal dollar the state is entitled to, and securing all of the funding made available through the Biden administration's infrastructure law and CHIPS and Science Act.",
      "In California, Newsom has also started to \"Trump-proof\" his budget, which is one of the aims of his move to convene the legislature last week.",

Gabbard also bonded with lawmakers over sports, playing on the Congressional Softball Team with New York Democratic Sen.

      "The Biden administration wants to avoid a power vacuum after the rebel takeover.",
      "Following the downfall of the Bashar Assad regime, the Biden administration is trying to strike a careful balance -- promising to allow the Syrian people to chart their own course while also vowing to protect American interests and prevent an enduring power vacuum from taking hold in the country.",
      "In remarks addressing Assad's ouster on Monday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken struck a cautiously optimistic tone, noting that the historic moment presented \"considerable risks\" but promising that the U.S. was already working to avoid them.",
      "\"The Syrian people have to be the ones to choose their path, their future. Senior officials from this department are fanning out through the region as we speak, working with counterparts on how the United States can help support the Syrian people as they decide their own path for the future,\" he said.",
      "But in addition to backing the Syrian people, those officials are also pushing the administration's agenda, including working to gather intelligence on Austin Tice, a former U.S. Marine and freelance journalist who was kidnapped in Syria 12 years ago.",
      "Roger Carstens, the Biden administration's top hostage negotiator, travelled to Lebanon following Assad's ouster, according to a State Department official.",
      "A senior administration official said one of the reasons Carstens travelled to the country was to chase down an unconfirmed report that Tice was in the Syrian capital -- gathered from signals intelligence.",
      "While the U.S. tries to turn chaos in Syria into an opportunity to gather more information about Tice, the Biden administration is also trying to prevent ISIS from using that turmoil to launch a resurgence -- something Blinken said the group would certainly attempt.",
      "On Sunday, the U.S. military launched a series of punishing airstrikes on ISIS militants. Pentagon officials described the attacks as preemptive measures aimed at preventing the group from reorganizing in Syria and signaled additional strikes were likely.",
      "Another concern created by the demise of the Assad regime is the stockpiles of chemical weapons it may have left in the country. Although the Obama administration cut a deal with Russia, an Assad ally, to destroy the banned munitions, that deal was not fully implemented and efforts to inspect remaining arsenals have been unsuccessful.",
      "U.S. officials fear that stockpiles of the ingredients necessary to create these chemical weapons, if not the weapons themselves, remain in Syria and could fall into the hands of bad actors.",
      "The Israeli military said it carried out strikes on suspected chemical weapons and missile sites in recent days, but the full picture of where these depots may be located within Syria remains hazy.",
      "While the Biden administration celebrated the end of Assad's rule, anxiety over who will govern Syria next is palpable.",
      "U.S. officials fear the prolonged absence of a central authority in Syria could lead to an enduring post-revolution turmoil similar to the political and humanitarian crises still playing out in Libya and Sudan.",

      "He could return to the post after authoring an entire chapter of Project 2025, where he argues federal regulatory agencies that aren\u2019t under the control of the White House should have less autonomy: \u201cA President today assumes office to find a sprawling federal bureaucracy that all too often is carrying out its own policy plans and preferences \u2014 or, worse yet, the policy plans and preferences of a radical, supposedly 'woke' faction of the country,\" the chapter read.",
      "In the chapter, he outlined ways his office could help consolidate executive power by using existing tools to impose a crackdown on federal spending and work with Congress to pass policy and reforms that would rein in what he calls the \u201cadministrative state.\u201d",
      "In a November interview on the \"Tucker Carlson Show,\" Vought claimed he helped the president-elect to exert executive power during his first term: \u201cThe president wanted to fund the wall. We at OMB gave him a plan to be able to go and fund the wall through money that was Department of Defense and to use that because Congress wouldn\u2019t give him the ordinary money at the Department of Homeland Security.\u201d",

Carmack, notes that the \"CIA's success depends on firm direction from the President and solid internal CIA Director\u2013appointed leadership.

Tulsi Gabbard, tapped to be the director of national intelligence, has been scrutinized over her views on Russia and a 2017 meeting with Syria's Bashar Assad. Kash Patel, a longtime Trump ally chosen for FBI director, has vowed to take on the alleged \"deep state\" and Trump's enemies.",

To me, that is the goal,\" Cornyn said.",

      "Hegseth exited the meeting praising their conversation but would not say whether he felt Ernst was swayed to support him.",
      "\"She has been dedicated to making the Pentagon work for warfighters for a long time. We've had great, extensive conversations about that. I just appreciate her commitment to the process and am looking forward to working together,\" Hegseth said.",
      "When pressed by reporters again if he could say whether he was able to get Ernst to back him, he demurred. \"I would never speak for her,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Ernst later released a statement thanking Hegseth for his \"responsiveness and respect for the process.\" While Ernst didn't explicitly say she would vote yes on Hegseth's confirmation, she said she would \"support\" him through the process.",
      "\"Following our encouraging conversations, Pete committed to completing a full audit of the Pentagon and selecting a senior official who will uphold the roles and value of our servicemen and women -- based on quality and standards, not quotas -- and who will prioritize and strengthen my work to prevent sexual assault within the ranks,\" she said. \"As I support Pete through this process, I look forward to a fair hearing based on truth, not anonymous sources.\"",
      "A conservative nonprofit group with ties to billionaire Elon Musk is wading into Hegseth's confirmation fight. Building America's Future is spending half a million dollars on a new ad pushing the Senate to confirm Hegseth as defense secretary, a spokesperson confirmed to ABC News. The ad will run on national television and specifically target digital platforms in Iowa, Ernst's home state.",
      "Arriving Monday for her first slate of meetings was Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman and military veteran with no intelligence experience. Gabbard's been accused of voicing support for U.S. adversaries like Russia and support for now-deposed Syrian dictator Ha.",
      "Asked for her response to several of her former Democratic colleagues who say they consider her a national security risk, Gabbard pivoted the question to support Trump's position that the U.S. should \"not get involved\" in the aftermath of the Assad regime.",

      "A: There are many thousands of people running the airline every day. My job, honestly, over this period isn\u2019t so much about managing the chaos, it's managing really all the challenges, and we'll call it the headwinds that come our way. And I would say the vast majority of those are the uncontrollable.",
      "A: What\u2019s going on the (air-traffic control) system around us. If there weren't weather that we have to deal with and other complications that sometimes arise, running an airline would be pretty easy.",
      "A: Before the pandemic, we would have a big storm in the DFW (Dallas-Fort Worth) area or the Charlotte (North Carolina) area, and it would take us a couple of days (to recover). We set about coming through the pandemic and coming out that we are going to recover better than any carrier out there.",

Now, to your other question about competitors. I\u2019m not inside the other competitors' operations centers and looking at how they do that. Their networks are set up differently than ours. We do ask ourselves, \u2018OK, if something similar were to happen to us, what would we do?\u2019",
      "A: Weather is always a tough thing to predict. That\u2019s really going to be one of the largest things because it has the potential for having the most impact. Controller-wise, we stay in touch with (the Federal Aviation Administration). We have a team out here that is in constant communication with the FAA, looking at what\u2019s happening in the system, and we\u2019re building contingency plans if they think there are going to be some challenges.",
      "A: The only difference between summer and now is we have to deal with winter weather in some locations. So, deicing. But we\u2019re ready for that. The technology we have right now with the deicing vehicles ... we\u2019ve been able to reduce our throughput time on deicing by half and still meeting all the requirements that we need to in terms of adequately deicing the aircraft, but having one person do it.",
      "A: No. Boeing needs to be successful, they need to be able to deliver quality aircraft, but we haven't built our schedule for the holiday period that is dependent on getting any deliveries. We have enough buffer built in.",
      "A: Our frequent and premium travelers look at (the technology to catch line-jumpers) as a benefit of being loyal to American Airlines. It's a huge plus for our gate agents because they do like order.",
      "A: No. We just want a steady stream (of passengers) going in. The ability to get overhead bin space ... has gotten a lot better with some of the upgrades that we\u2019ve done with larger overhead bins on the vast majority of our aircraft. We're going to finish up the rest of the fleet in the next couple years with the large overhead bins. So that won\u2019t be the issue, but that used to be a bit of that driver there."

      "It was the largest suicide-murder in recent history, and a government-backed tour operator wants to open the former commune now shrouded by lush vegetation to visitors, a proposal that is reopening old wounds, with critics saying it would disrespect victims and dig up a sordid past.",
      "Jordan Vilchez, who grew up in California and was moved into the Peoples Temple commune at age 14, told The Associated Press in a phone interview from the U.S. that she has mixed feelings about the tour.",

      "The tour would ferry visitors to the far-flung village of Port Kaituma nestled in the lush jungles of northern Guyana. It\u2019s a trip available only by boat, helicopter or plane; rivers instead of roads connect Guyana\u2019s interior. Once there, it\u2019s another six miles via a rough and overgrown dirt trail to the abandoned commune and former agricultural settlement.",

      "\u201cWe think it is about time,\u201d she said. \u201cThis happens all over the world. We have multiple examples of dark, morbid tourism around the world, including Auschwitz and the Holocaust museum.\u201d",
      "The November 1978 mass suicide-murder was synonymous with Guyana for decades until huge amounts of oil and gas were discovered off the country\u2019s coast nearly a decade ago, making it one of the world\u2019s largest offshore oil producers.",
      "New roads, schools and hotels are being built across the capital, Georgetown, and beyond, and a country that rarely saw tourists is now hoping to attract more of them.",
      "An obvious attraction is Jonestown, argued Astill Paul, the co-pilot of a twin-engine plane that flew U.S. Rep. Leo J. Ryan of California and a U.S. news crew to a village near the commune a day before hundreds died on Nov. 18, 1978. He witnessed gunmen fatally shoot Ryan and four others as they tried to board the plane on Nov. 18 and fly back to the capital.",

      "\u201cI sat on the tourism board years ago and did suggest we do this, but the minister at the time lashed the idea down because the government wanted nothing to do with morbid tourism,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Until recently, successive governments shunned Jonestown, arguing that the country\u2019s image was badly damaged by the mass murder-suicide, even though only a handful of Indigenous people died. The overwhelming majority of victims were Americans like Vilchez who flew to Guyana to follow Jones. Many endured beatings, forced labor, imprisonment and rehearsals for a mass suicide.",

      "Today, all that is left is bits of a cassava mill, pieces of the main pavilion and a rusted tractor that once hauled a flatbed trailer to take temple members to the Port Kaituma airfield.",
      "Until now, most visitors to Jonestown have been reporters and family members of those who died.",
      "Organizing an expedition on one\u2019s own is daunting: the area is far from the capital and hard to access, and some consider the closest populated settlement dangerous.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still a very, very, very rough area,\u201d said Fielding McGehee, co-director of The Jonestown Institute, a nonprofit group. \u201cI don\u2019t see how this is going to be an economically feasible kind of project because of the vast amounts of money it would take to turn it into a viable place to visit.\u201d",
      "McGehee warned about relying on supposed witnesses who will be part of the tour. He said the memories and stories that have trickled down through generations might not be accurate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a game of telephone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not help anyone understand what happened in Jonestown.\u201d",
      "He recalled how one survivor had proposed a personal project to develop the abandoned site, but those from the temple community said, \u2018Why do you want to do that?\u2019",
      "McGehee noted that dark tourism is popular, and that going to Jonestown means tourists could say they visited a place where more than 900 people died on the same day.",

      "If the tour eventually starts operating, not everything will be visible to tourists.",
      "When Vilchez returned to Guyana in 2018 for the first time since the mass suicide-murder, she made an offering to the land when she arrived in Jonestown.",
      "Among the things she buried in the abandoned commune where her sisters and nephews died were snippets of hair from her mother and father, who did not go to Jonestown.",

      "Jim Desmond, the lone dissenter, said the policy protects people convicted of violent crimes, recounting the shooting death of 32-year-old Kate Steinle in San Francisco in 2015 and other high-profile attacks committed by people in the country illegally.",
      "\"These tragedies are preventable but sanctuary laws allow them to happen by allowing illegal criminals back into our communities instead of into the hands of ICE, said Desmond, a Republican.",
      "San Diego County, with 3.3 million residents and its location on the U.S. border with Mexico, is one of the more prominent local governments to ramp up protections for people in the country illegally. At the same time, some states and counties are gearing up to support Trump\u2019s deportation efforts.",
      "ICE has limited resources to carry out the mass deportations that Trump wants. Thus, it will rely heavily on sheriffs to notify it of people in their custody and hold them temporarily, if asked, to allow federal officials time to arrest them on immigration charges.",
      "Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has singled out San Diego as a place where the incoming administration's plans are complicated by \u201csanctuary\u201d laws, a loose term for state and local governments that restrict cooperation with federal immigration authorities. He said Sunday on Fox News Channel that that laws denying ICE access to county jails \u201cput the community at risk.\u201d In contrast to San Diego, Homan plans to meet with New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who has expressed interest in collaborating.",
      "The policy brings San Diego in line with seven other counties in California, including Los Angeles, the nation's largest, which recently adopted a policy that goes beyond state law, Vargas said.",
      "Vargas said \u201ca loophole\u201d in state law that allows sheriffs to work with ICE under limited circumstances for people convicted of violent crimes had resulted in the county transferring 100 to 200 people a year to immigration authorities. ICE will now need a judge\u2019s order to get help from the county.",
      "San Diego County Sheriff Kelly Martinez took issue with Vargas' use of \u201cloophole\u201d to describe state law. While she didn't take a position on the new county policy, she noted that California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, has blocked efforts to further restrict cooperation with ICE.",
      "\"While protecting the rights of undocumented immigrants is crucial, it is equally important to ensure that victims of crimes are not overlooked or neglected in the process,\" Martinez said."

      "NEW YORK -- After being acquitted of homicide, the military veteran who choked a volatile, mentally ill man on a New York subway told an interviewer he put himself in a \u201cvery vulnerable position\u201d but felt compelled to act.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll take a million court appearances and people calling me names and people hating me, just to keep one of those people from getting hurt or killed,\u201d Daniel Penny told Fox News in a clip that aired Tuesday, a day after the verdict.",
      "Meanwhile, scores of New Yorkers protested the trial outcome, holding signs and chanting Jordan Neely's name in a Manhattan square Tuesday evening.",
      "An anonymous Manhattan jury cleared Penny of a criminally negligent homicide charge in the death of Neely, 30. The jury had deadlocked last week on a more serious manslaughter charge, which was dismissed.",
      "Penny, who had served four years in the Marines, put Neely in a chokehold for about six minutes after Neely had an outburst that frightened riders on a subway car on May 1, 2023. Penny is white. Neely was Black.",
      "According to passengers, Neely hadn't touched anyone but had expressed willingness to die, go to jail \u2014 even to kill, some said. The former street performer was homeless, had schizophrenia, had synthetic marijuana in his system and had been convicted of assaulting people at subway stations.",
      "In his first extensive comments since the trial began, Penny told Jeanine Pirro that he's \u201cnot a confrontational person.\u201d But he said he wouldn't have been able to live with \u201cthe guilt I would have felt if someone did get hurt, if he did do what he was threatening to do.\"",
      "He said he put himself in a \u201cvery vulnerable position\u201d as he restrained Neely on the subway floor.",
      "\u201cIf I just let him go, I'm on my back now, he could just turn around and start doing what he said to me...killing, hurting,\" Penny said in the clips, aired ahead of the planned release of the full interview Wednesday on the Fox Nation streaming service.",
      "Penny, 26, also criticized officials involved in his prosecution as \u201cself-serving,\u201d suggesting that they were refusing to scrutinize their own roles in the conditions that led to his encounter with Neely.",
      "\u201cThese are their policies that clearly have not worked,\u201d Penny said. But, he added, \u201ctheir egos are too big just to admit that they\u2019re wrong.\u201d",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat whose office brought the case, said after the verdict that prosecutors \u201cfollowed the facts and the evidence from beginning to end.\u201d His office had no further comment Tuesday.",
      "During the monthlong trial, prosecutors said Penny went too far in responding to Neely, who was unarmed. The veteran's lawyers argued that he put his own safety on the line to protect other passengers from a threatening man.",
      "The case sparked national debate and divided New Yorkers over issues of homelessness and public safety in a city where millions ride the subway every day.",
      "Penny chose not to testify at the trial, but the anonymous jury heard what he told police in the minutes and hours after his encounter with Neely. Describing Neely as \u201ca crackhead\u201d who was \u201cacting like a lunatic,\u201d Penny said he put the man in a chokehold and \u201cjust put him out\u201d in order to prevent him from injuring anyone.",
      "\u201cI'm not trying to kill the guy,\u201d he told detectives in a recorded interview. \u201cI'm just trying to de-escalate the situation.\u201d",
      "A city medical examiner determined that the chokehold killed Neely, but Penny's defense challenged the finding.",
      "Jurors also heard testimony from other passengers on the train and saw videos that some recorded. The jury also heard from police, pathologists, a psychiatric expert, a Marine Corps instructor who taught Penny chokehold techniques and Penny\u2019s relatives, friends and fellow Marines."

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Two Department of Homeland Security agents in Utah sold drugs that were previously seized as evidence through an informant in an illegal scheme that brought in up to $300,000, according to court documents.",
      "The agents sold an illicit synthetic drug commonly known as \u201cbath salts\u201d to a confidential informant once or twice a week beginning last spring through early December, according to an FBI affidavit filed in the case. The transactions typically involved one ounce (28 grams) of the drug for $5,000 that would then be sold by the informant at a higher cost.",
      "The informant, who has a lengthy criminal history, had been recruited while in prison by federal agents to work for them upon his release. But in addition to conducting legitimate controlled buys from suspected drug dealers, the informant said he was compelled by the agents to engage in illegal sales, the affidavit said.",

      "The investigation began after the informant's defense attorney contacted the U.S. Attorney in Utah in October to report that Cole and the second agent had required him to engage in potentially unlawful acts. The informant then cooperated with the FBI \u201cfor monetary value and out of fear for his personal safety,\" the affidavit said.",
      "The informant said Cole and the second agent got the drugs that they sold to him from evidence seized in a prior Homeland Security investigation, according to the affidavit. The second agent \u201cappears to have evidence custodian duties,\" according to the affidavit, which said officials were still verifying the informant's allegations.",
      "Other details offered by the informant were confirmed through surveillance and other sources, the affidavit said.",
      "If found guilty, Cole could face up to 10 years or more in prison, according to court documents. In a motion seeking his detention, federal prosecutors said they had serious concerns that Cole might try to obstruct the case by interfering with witnesses, harming himself or fleeing.",
      "FBI spokesperson Sandra Barker declined to comment on the case or whether anyone else was being investigated.",
      "Cole and the second agent had their Homeland Security investigation credentials suspended but have not been fired, according to the affidavit. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump is promising expedited federal permits for energy projects and other construction worth more than $1 billion. But like other Trump plans, the idea is likely to run into regulatory and legislative hurdles, including a landmark law that requires federal agencies to consider the environmental impact before deciding on major projects.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social site Tuesday, Trump said anyone making a $1 billion investment in the United States \u201cwill receive fully expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no way limited to, all Environmental approvals.\u201d",
      "\u201cGET READY TO ROCK!!!\" he added.",
      "While Trump did not specify who would be eligible for accelerated approvals, dozens of energy projects proposed nationwide, from natural gas pipelines and export terminals to solar farms and offshore wind turbines, meet the billion-dollar criteria.",
      "Environmental groups slammed the proposal, calling it illegal on its face and a clear violation of the National Environmental Policy Act, a 54-year-old law that requires federal agencies to study the potential environmental impact of proposed actions and consider alternatives.",
      "\u201cTrump is unabashedly and literally offering to sell out America to the highest corporate bidder,'' said Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, an environmental group. She said the plan was \u201cobviously illegal\u201d and another example of Trump \u201cputting special interests and corporate polluters in the driver\u2019s seat, which would result in more pollution, higher costs and fewer energy choices for the American people.\u201d",

      "Energy analyst Kevin Book said Trump's post showed his usual flair for showmanship but said there was a real concern underlying it: a bipartisan push for permitting reform to speed up major environmental projects that now take years to win approval.",
      "\u201cThe substance here is he is really serious about trying to get permitting reform done,\" said Book, managing partner at ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington research firm.",
      "\u201cPermitting delays are an impediment in many sectors \u2014 including energy \u2014 and there are multiple billion-dollar investments waiting for permitting reform,\" Book said.",
      "A bipartisan plan championed by Senate Energy Committee Chairman Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the committee's top Republican, would speed up permitting for major energy and mineral projects, but its chances are uncertain in the final few weeks of the current Congress.",
      "Their plan would boost energy projects of all types, bringing down prices, creating domestic jobs and allowing the U.S. to continue as a global energy leader, Barrasso and Manchin say.",
      "Critics say the bill would open major expanses of public lands and waters for oil and gas drilling and gut executive and judicial review.",
      "\u201cChecking off wish lists for oil, gas and mining companies is not permitting reform,\u201d said Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee. He called the bill \u201ca dirty deal\u201d that would exempt some oil and gas drilling projects from federal review and \u201clet mining companies dump even more toxic waste on our public lands.\u201d",
      "Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, said Trump's second term will be a \u201cgolden age of regulation-cutting,'' including a promise to \u201cdrill, baby, drill.''",
      "\u201cIf you want to bring in money, he\u2019s going to move heaven and earth to get that money in the door and get it invested in the United States,'' Miller said Tuesday at a conference organized by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "The plan applies to both domestic and foreign investment, Miller said: \u201cHe wants to get the money and he wants to get the regulations cut and get the economy moving again. \u201d",
      "In the short term, Trump's post makes permitting reform less likely this year, Book said, as Republicans seek to wait until next year when they will control both chambers of Congress and the White House. But the issue is likely to return quickly in the new year.",

      "The ruling Monday in the case of 34-year-old Cedric Warren came exactly one week after Roger Golubski died in an apparent suicide just before the start of his criminal trial over allegations that he sexually assaulted Black women.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m very thrilled,\u201d Warren\u2019s father, Cedric Toney, said in a phone interview Tuesday.",
      "He said before Golubski supervised the investigation that led to his son's arrest, the former detective stalked his daughter and his son's mother. The allegation is similar to one raised in the case of Lamonte McIntyre, who served 23 years behind bars for a double homicide before he was freed. McIntyre\u2019s mother has said Golubski pressured her for sexual favors.",
      "But Wyandotte County Judge Aaron Roberts based his ruling in Warren's case on something different. He ruled from the bench that prosecutors failed to turn over information about the severe mental health issues of a key witness in the drug house shooting that killed Charles Ford and Larry Ledoux.",
      "The witness had schizophrenia, and offered a shifting account of what happened before he became the only person to link Warren to the killing, the defense wrote in court filings.",
      "Attorneys for Warren argued that the prosecution should have known about the witness\u2019 mental health struggles because they caused issues years earlier when he was charged with passing bad checks. A mental health exam in that case found the man was incompetent to stand trial and highlighted several psychiatric hospitalizations.",
      "Police officers also were aware of the witness' mental health struggles because they took him to a psychiatric facility after questioning him in the double homicide, the defense said.",
      "The defense wrote that the undisclosed evidence \u201cundermined his credibility and ability to competently and reliably recount events.\u201d",
      "The family's claims that Golubski harassed Warren's mother and sister haven't been aired in court, said Lindsay Runnels, an attorney for Warren. She said that is largely because a judge was focused on their allegations that evidence was withheld.",
      "\u201cAs far as Cedric Warren is concerned, out is out,\u201d she said, adding she is confident he will be released and possibly soon.",
      "But while Golubski's role in Warren's case didn't play a role in Roberts' decision, the allegations have led the county prosecutor\u2019s office to undertake a $1.7 million effort to reexamine other cases he worked on during his 35 years on the force.",
      "Cheryl Pilate, another attorney representing Warren, is pursuing another claim that a person Golubski investigated is innocent. She stressed that the problems in the community extended beyond one detective and that others also played a role.",
      "\u201cThis was a one witness case with no corroborating evidence,\" she said. \"And the witness was someone who was very vulnerable and had very significant mental health issues.\u201d"

      "A federal safety board says a corroded steam pipe and a defective natural gas fitting caused a powerful explosion at a Pennsylvania chocolate factory, killing seven workers when the company failed to evacuate",
      "Cascading failures involving a corroded steam pipe and a defective natural gas fitting caused a powerful explosion in 2023 at a Pennsylvania chocolate factory, killing seven workers when the company failed to evacuate, a federal safety board said Tuesday.",
      "About 70 production workers and 35 office staff at R.M. Palmer Co. were working in two adjacent buildings at the time of the blast. Employees in both buildings told federal investigators they could smell gas before the explosion. Workers at the plant have accused the company of ignoring warnings of a natural gas leak, saying the plant, in a small town 60 miles (96 kilometers) northwest of Philadelphia, should have been evacuated.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said the factory failed to have natural gas emergency procedures in place that could have resulted in an immediate evacuation. The explosion leveled one building and heavily damaged another, sending flames more than 40 feet (21 meters) into the air and causing $42 million in property damage.",
      "\u201cContributing to the accident's severity was R.M. Palmer Company's insufficient emergency response procedures and training of its employees, who did not understand the hazard and did not evacuate the buildings before the explosion,\u201d the National Transportation Safety Board said in its statement of probable cause, approved Tuesday at the board's meeting in Washington, D.C.",
      "Palmer has since adopted a revised policy on evacuations, but Jennifer Homendy, the NTSB board chair, said it\u2019s still insufficient because it advises staff to investigate and determine if evacuation is necessary.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what they did in this scenario,\u201d she said. \u201c'No, you leave.' Now, their response is they have other smells in their building because chocolate is being made. You know the difference between natural gas smell and chocolate. \u2018Get out, immediately.\u2019 So I think this actually provides significant confusion for their employees and they should change it.\u201d",
      "Palmer said in a statement that \u201cnot a day goes by that we do not remember and reflect on the heartbreaking loss of several colleagues and friends on that tragic day.\"",
      "The company added that it \"takes the health, safety and wellness of our employees very seriously and will continue to work tirelessly to ensure the health and safety of our employees and will proactively work with regulators to prevent any similar tragedy in the future.\u201d",
      "The federal safety agency also described the role of UGI Corp., the gas utility that provided service to the candy factory in West Reading.",
      "An old Palmer steam pipe that was already badly corroded finally cracked, allowing steam to escape and raising the temperature of UGI's gas fitting \u2014 so much so that it, too, cracked, federal safety investigators found. Gas then migrated underground and made its way into the basement of Palmer\u2019s second building, where it exploded. Investigators couldn\u2019t determine the ignition source.",
      "A UGI crew replacing gas lines in the area in 2021 \u2014 two years before the blast \u2014 was alerted to the presence of the steam pipe, but failed to notify the utility's safety managers so the pipe could be assessed for its impact on the gas fitting that ultimately failed, the five-member safety board found.",
      "\u201cBy not addressing the threat posed by the steam pipe, UGI Corporation's distribution integrity management program was not effective in preventing the accident,\u201d the safety board said in its findings. The board also said there was a delay in getting gas shut off after the blast because UGI did not properly mark its valves \u2014 and a critical valve had been paved over.",

      "\u201cSafety remains our main priority in the communities we serve, where we work, and where we live. UGI continues to work with customers that also operate underground steam lines, to make sure their systems and our natural gas systems can operate safely together,\u201d said John Mason, a company spokesperson. He said the company has \u201cfully cooperated\u201d with NTSB.",
      "The service tee that failed was made by DuPont and has a known tendency to crack. The plastic piping is still in widespread use around the country, but the safety board said many utilities may not be aware of the locations where it is most vulnerable to failure from elevated temperatures.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a good idea how much is out there,\" said Dane Spillers, an NTSB pipeline accident investigator.",
      "Board member J. Todd Inman compared the Palmer explosion to a 1996 blast at a shoe store in San Juan, Puerto Rico, that killed 33, saying the NTSB raised many of the same issues then. Federal regulators have long said that much of the plastic pipe manufactured for natural gas service from the 1960s through the early 1980s was susceptible to cracking.",
      "\u201cSometimes you think we can learn our lesson, or at least the operators can,\u201d he said.",
      "The NTSB issued a range of recommendations for UGI and other utilities, regulatory agencies, state governments and R.M Palmer itself. One recommendation: That businesses, homes, schools and other buildings served by natural gas install alarms that can detect a leak."

      "In coastal Southern California, a university has extensive plans for students to shelter in place in case of a wildfire",
      "MALIBU, Calif. -- The wildfire alert came in the middle of the night as some college students in Southern California were cramming for final exams and others were woken up in their dorms.",
      "But rather than run away from the impending blaze, some 3,000 students at Pepperdine University headed toward two buildings at the heart of the 830-acre (336 hectare) campus in coastal Malibu, California, to shelter in place.",
      "The protocol at the Christian university with picturesque views of the Pacific Ocean may seem to defy logic to those accustomed to scenes elsewhere in wildfire-prone California of thousands of residents evacuating fire zones in lengthy caravans of cars.",
      "For years, the university nestled in the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains has had a special protocol due to its unique terrain and design that calls for students to be brought to a library and campus center where they can get food and water and have their basic needs met, said Michael Friel, a Pepperdine spokesperson.",
      "The school began preparing students and community members on what to do in case of a wildfire during new student orientation at the beginning of the academic year. When the fire broke out Monday night, school officials started communicating with students around 11 p.m. and activated the shelter-in-place protocol about two hours later, spreading the word through text messages, email, social media and by going door to door.",
      "\u201cA lot of our students were woken up by a knock on the door, and we made sure they were aware of the conditions and we were able to get them out of harm\u2019s way,\u201d Friel said.",
      "The Franklin Fire quickly moved south, jumping over the famous Pacific Coast Highway and stretching to the coast, where large homes line the beach. Thousands of Southern California residents were under evacuation orders and warnings Tuesday with more than 8,100 homes and other structures under threat.",
      "County fire officials estimated that more than 3.5 square miles (9 square kilometers) of trees and dry brush had burned amid dangerous conditions fanned by dry, gusty Santa Ana winds that were expected to last into Wednesday.",
      "The cause of the fire was not immediately known.",
      "Ryan Song, a resident assistant at Pepperdine University, said he noticed the power went out at his dorm late Monday. When he looked out the window, he saw a huge pink glow.",
      "\u201cI thought, \u2018This is too bright,\u2019 and it got bigger and bigger,\u201d the 20-year-old junior said. \u201cI immediately went outside and saw that it was a real fire.\u201d",
      "Song and the other assistants went door to door to get students out. Most were calm and followed instructions, he said; a few who were scared rushed to their cars to get off campus.",
      "Song said he spent the next few hours racing back and forth in the dark between his dorm and the main campus to ensure no one was left behind.",
      "Pepperdine University officials said the campus was designed in the 1960s with fire safety in mind due to the region's experience with wildfires. Buildings were clustered together and covered in stucco while roadways were constructed to make it easy for firefighters to get in, said Phil Phillips, the school's executive vice president.",
      "During the 1990s, campus officials worked with Los Angeles County fire authorities to develop a safety plan, and authorities said the safest option for students would be to remain on campus. The school is diligent about brush clearance and has a plan to reduce smoke in shelter-in-place locations by taping shut doors and using air filters, he said.",
      "The nearby stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway can also become congested during an emergency, Phillips said, such as during the deadly Woolsey Fire in 2018.",
      "\u201cWhat you don't want is to be stuck,\u201d said Phillips, who has been at the campus for three decades \u2014 including as a student \u2014 and said he has been through seven fires. \u201cProtecting our students, providing for their safety is a moral obligation for us, so we take it really, really seriously.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, heavy smoke from the Franklin Fire, burning northeast of the school, billowed over the campus 29 miles (47 kilometers) west of Los Angeles, and classes were cancelled and final exams postponed. Firefighters had not contained any part of the blaze as of Tuesday afternoon.",
      "The campus was singed but no injuries were reported, and only one structure possibly was minimally damaged thanks to firefighters' hard work and collaboration from students, faculty and others on campus, Friel said.",
      "Jim Gash, the college's president, said the campus was no longer threatened on Tuesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cI am grateful that through prayer, preparation, and cooperation, our Pepperdine community safely navigated the challenges encountered over the last 12 hours,\" Gash said in a statement. \u201cOur prayers continue to go out to the Malibu community.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled that Ohio's product liability law prohibits counties from bringing public-nuisance claims against national pharmaceutical chains as they did as part of national opioid litigation",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The Ohio Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the state's product liability law prohibits counties from bringing public nuisance claims against national pharmaceutical chains as they did as part of national opioid litigation, a decision that could overturn a $650 million judgment against the pharmacies.",
      "An attorney for the counties called the decision \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "Justices were largely unanimous in their interpretation of an arcane disagreement over the state law, which had emerged in a lawsuit brought by Lake and Trumbull counties outside Cleveland against CVS, Walgreens and Walmart.",
      "The counties won their initial lawsuit \u2014 and were awarded $650 million in damages by a federal judge in 2022 \u2014 but the pharmacies had disputed the court's reading of the Ohio Product Liability Act, which they said protected them from such sanctions.",
      "In an opinion written by Justice Joseph Deters, the court found that Ohio state lawmakers intended the law to prevent \u201call common law product liability causes of action\" \u2014 even if they don't seek compensatory damages but merely \u201cequitable relief\u201d for the communities.",
      "\u201cThe plain language of the OPLA abrogates product-liability claims, including product-related public-nuisance claims seeking equitable relief,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are constrained to interpret the statute as written, not according to our own personal policy preferences.\u201d",
      "Two of the Republican-dominated court's Democratic justices disagreed on that one point, while concurring on the rest of the judgment.",
      "\u201cAny award to abate a public nuisance like the opioid epidemic would certainly be substantial in size and scope, given that the claimed nuisance is both long-lasting and widespread,\u201d Justice Melody Stewart wrote in an opinion joined by Justice Michael Donnelly. \u201cBut just because an abatement award is of substantial size and scope does not mean it transforms it into a compensatory-damages award.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the plaintiffs' co-liaison counsel in the national opioid litigation, Peter Weinberger, of the Cleveland-based law firm Spangenberg Shibley & Liber, lamented the decision.",
      "\u201cThis ruling will have a devastating impact on communities and their ability to police corporate misconduct,\" he said. \u201cWe have used public nuisance claims across the country to obtain nearly $60 billion in opioid settlements, including nearly $1 billion in Ohio alone, and the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s ruling undermines the very legal basis that drove this result.\u201d",
      "But Weinberger said Tuesday's ruling would not be the end, and that communities would continue to fight \u201cthrough other legal avenues.\u201d",
      "\"We remain steadfast in our commitment to holding all responsible parties to account as this litigation continues nationwide,\u201d he said.",
      "In his 2022 ruling, U.S. District Judge Dan Polster said that the money awarded to Lake and Trump counties would be used to the fight the opioid crisis. Attorneys at the time put the total price tag at $3.3 billion for the damage done.",
      "Lake County was to receive $306 million over 15 years. Trumbull County was to receive $344 million over the same period. Nearly $87 million was to be paid immediately to cover the first two years of payments.",
      "A jury returned a verdict in favor of the counties in November 2021, after a six-week trial. It was then left to the judge to decide how much the counties should receive. He heard testimony the next May to determine damages.",
      "The counties convinced the jury that the pharmacies played an outsized role in creating a public nuisance in the way they dispensed pain medication. It was the first time pharmacy companies completed a trial to defend themselves in a drug crisis that has killed a half-million Americans since 1999."

      "Police became convinced they were investigating a crime in the disappearance of University of Mississippi student Jimmie \u201cJay\u201d Lee when they interviewed the man now on trial in his death, a top officer testified Tuesday.",
      "Lee had been missing for two weeks when officers arrested Sheldon \u201cTimothy\u201d Herrington Jr. on July 22, 2022, said Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen. Authorities interviewed Herington twice that day, and he gave conflicting information about the hours before Lee vanished, the chief said.",
      "\u201cFrom the moment that we gave Tim Herrington the opportunity to tell the truth and he couldn\u2019t and he lied and we backed that up, we knew then,\u201d McCutchen said.",
      "Herrington, 24, is being tried on a capital murder charge in the death of Lee, 20, a gay man who was well known in the LGBTQ+ community at Ole Miss and in Oxford. Lee disappeared in Oxford, where Herrington\u2019s trial is in its second week.",
      "Prosecutors and the defense both called their final witnesses Tuesday, and Herrington did not testify. Closing arguments are set for Wednesday.",
      "Lee\u2019s body has never been found, but a judge has declared him dead.",
      "Herrington maintains his innocence and his attorney, Kevin Horan, told jurors last week that prosecutors have \u201czero\u201d proof Lee was killed.",
      "Lee has not contacted friends or family, and his financial transactions and once-prolific social media posts have stopped since the day he went missing, investigators testified.",
      "Before officers interviewed Herrington, they had already obtained sexually explicit text messages exchanged between social media accounts belonging to Herrington and Lee in the early hours of July 8, 2022, when Herrington disappeared in Oxford, McCutchen said.",
      "Lee communicated with his mother daily, and sent his last message to her hours before he vanished to wish her happy birthday, according to earlier testimony.",
      "Google records obtained through a warrant showed that Herrington searched \u201chow long does it take to strangle someone\u201d at 5:56 a.m., University Police Department Sgt. Benjamin Douglas testified last week.",
      "The final text message from Lee's phone was sent to a social media account belonging to Herrington at 6:03 a.m. from a spot near Herrington's apartment, and cellphone tower in another part of Oxford last located any signal from Lee's phone at 7:28 a.m., McCutchen said Tuesday. A security camera showed Herrington jogging at about 7:30 a.m. out of a parking lot where Lee's car was abandoned, investigators testified earlier.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for Jay Lee\u2019s body for two years, and we\u2019re not going to stop 'til we find it,\" McCutchen said in court Tuesday.",
      "On the day Lee vanished, Herrington was also seen on security cameras buying duct tape in Oxford and driving to his own hometown of about an hour away, police have testified.",
      "Herrington is from an affluent family in Grenada, Mississippi, about 52 miles (83.7 kilometers) southwest of Oxford, testified Ryan Baker, an Oxford Police Department intelligence officer who was a detective when he helped investigated the case.",
      "Herrington\u2019s grandfather is bishop of a church in Grenada, other family members work at the church and Herrington himself taught youth Sunday school classes there, Baker said. Herrington \u201cwas not portraying himself as gay\u201d to family or friends, Baker said. During testimony Tuesday, Herrington's father and grandfather both said Herrington had never spoken about having boyfriends.",
      "Herrington operated a furniture moving business with another man while they were students at the University of Mississippi, and they had a white box truck that Herrington drove to Grenada, Baker said. Security cameras at several businesses and a neighbor\u2019s house showed Herrington and the truck in Grenada hours after Lee disappeared, Baker said.",
      "During McCutchen's testimony Tuesday, Horan asked whether DNA tests on items taken from Herrington's apartment and the truck showed \u201cany trace evidence at all implicating my client.\u201d McCutchen said they did not, but police first searched Herrington's apartment two weeks after Lee vanished and they searched the box truck a few days after the apartment.",
      "Both Herrington and Lee had graduated from the University of Mississippi. Lee was pursuing a master\u2019s degree. He was known for his creative expression through fashion and makeup and often performed in drag shows in Oxford, according to a support group called Justice for Jay Lee.",
      "Prosecutors have announced they do not intend to pursue the death penalty, meaning Herrington could get a life sentence if convicted. Mississippi law defines capital murder as a killing committed along with another felony \u2014 in this case, kidnapping."

      "Erik Kristensen Sparre, 61, was jailed on charges of murder and aggravated assault in the killings of Harold and Thelma Swain, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a news release Monday. Sparre was arrested nearly four decades after the couple was fatally shot inside Rising Daughter Baptist Church in coastal Camden County.",
      "Sparre became the focus of a renewed investigation into the Swains' deaths after authorities concluded they had initially prosecuted the wrong man.",

      "Investigators and the courts took a fresh look at the case after attorneys for the Georgia Innocence Project tested DNA from hairs found in the hinge of a pair of eyeglasses left next to the victims' bodies. They said the DNA matched Sparre, who had once been considered a suspect, and not Perry.",
      "Meanwhile, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Sparre\u2019s alibi that he was working at a grocery story when the killings occurred, could not be true. The newspaper also raised doubts about Perry's conviction, noting that jurors were never told a key witness was paid a $12,000 reward before testifying.",

Utilities were also gearing up for potential power outages from damage caused by winds that could exceed 60 mph (97 kph) in some areas.",
      "One of the key factors driving the weather is an atmospheric river, which is a long band of water vapor that can transport moisture from the tropics to more northern areas, said Derek Schroeter, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine.",

      "NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s recent dinner with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his visit to Paris for the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral were not just exercises in policy and diplomacy.",
      "They were also prime trolling opportunities for Trump.",
      "Throughout his first term in the White House and during his campaign to return, Trump has spun out countless provocative, antagonizing and mocking statements. There were his belittling nicknames for political opponents, his impressions of other political figures and the plentiful memes he shared on social media.",
      "Now that's he's preparing to return to the Oval Office, Trump is back at it, and his trolling is attracting more attention \u2014 and eyerolls.",
      "On Sunday, Trump turned a photo of himself seated near a smiling first lady Jill Biden at the Notre Dame ceremony into a social media promo for his new perfume and cologne line, with the tag line, \u201cA fragrance your enemies can\u2019t resist!\u201d",
      "The first lady\u2019s office declined to comment.",
      "When Trudeau hastily flew to Florida to meet with Trump last month over the president-elect's threat to impose a 25% tax on all Canadian products entering the U.S., the Republican tossed out the idea that Canada become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "The Canadians passed off the comment as a joke, but Trump has continued to play up the dig, including in a post Tuesday morning on his social media network referring to the prime minister as \u201cGovernor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada.\u201d",
      "After decades as an entertainer and tabloid fixture, Trump has a flair for the provocative that is aimed at attracting attention and, in his most recent incarnation as a politician, mobilizing fans. He has long relished poking at his opponents, both to demean and minimize them and to delight supporters who share his irreverent comments and posts widely online and cheer for them in person.",
      "Trump, to the joy of his fans, first publicly needled Canada on his social media network a week ago when he posted an AI-generated image that showed him standing on a mountain with a Canadian flag next to him and the caption \u201cOh Canada!\u201d",
      "After his latest post, Canadian Immigration Minister Marc Miller said Tuesday: \u201cIt sounds like we\u2019re living in a episode of South Park.\"",
      "Trudeau said earlier this week that when it comes to Trump, \u201chis approach will often be to challenge people, to destabilize a negotiating partner, to offer uncertainty and even sometimes a bit of chaos into the well established hallways of democracies and institutions and one of the most important things for us to do is not to freak out, not to panic.\u201d",
      "Even Thanksgiving dinner isn't a trolling-free zone for Trump's adversaries.",
      "On Thanksgiving Day, Trump posted a movie clip from \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation\u201d with President Joe Biden and other Democrats\u2019 faces superimposed on the characters in a spoof of the turkey-carving scene.",
      "The video shows Trump appearing to explode out of the turkey in a swirl of purple sparks, with the former president stiffly dancing to one of his favorite songs, Village People\u2019s \u201cY.M.C.A.\"",
      "In his most recent presidential campaign, Trump mocked Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, refusing to call his GOP primary opponent by his real name and instead dubbing him \u201cRon DeSanctimonious.\u201d He added, for good measure, in a post on his Truth Social network: \u201cI will never call Ron DeSanctimonious \u2018Meatball\u2019 Ron, as the Fake News is insisting I will.\u201d",
      "As he campaigned against Biden, Trump taunted him in online posts and with comments and impressions at his rallies, deriding the president over his intellect, his walk, his golf game and even his beach body.",
      "After Vice President Kamala Harris took over Biden's spot as the Democratic nominee, Trump repeatedly suggested she never worked at McDonalds while in college. Trump, true to form, turned his mocking into a spectacle by appearing at a Pennsylvania McDonalds in October, when he manned the fries station and held an impromptu news conference from the restaurant drive-thru.",
      "Trump\u2019s team thinks people should get a sense of humor.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is a master at messaging and he\u2019s always relatable to the average person, whereas many media members take themselves too seriously and have no concept of anything else other than suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome,\u201d said Steven Cheung, Trump\u2019s communications director. \u201cPresident Trump will Make America Great Again and we are getting back to a sense of optimism after a tumultuous four years.\u201d",
      "Though both the Biden and Harris campaigns created and shared memes and launched other stunts to respond to Trump's taunts, so far America\u2019s neighbors to the north are not taking the bait.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we should necessarily look on Truth Social for public policy,\u201d Miller said.",
      "Gerald Butts, a former top adviser to Trudeau and a close friend, said Trump brought up the 51st state line to Trudeau repeatedly during Trump\u2019s first term in office.",
      "\u201cOh God,\u201d Butts said Tuesday, \u201cAt least a half dozen times.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is who he is and what he does. He\u2019s trying to destabilize everybody and make people anxious,\u201d Butts said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to get people on the defensive and anxious and therefore willing to do things they wouldn\u2019t otherwise entertain if they had their wits about them. I don\u2019t know why anybody is surprised by it.\u201d",

      "A lawyer for Michael Jeffries made a motion for a competency hearing during a court appearance Tuesday in federal court on Long Island.",
      "U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace's office, which is prosecuting the case, said there was no discussion in court as to why Jeffries was requesting the hearing.",
      "His attorney, Brian Bieber, declined to comment afterward, stating in an emailed reply that the request \"will be dealt with in Court as, and when, appropriate \u2013 according to the Judge.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Nusrat Choudhury gave Jeffries' lawyers until Dec. 24 to provide further information to the court, including how much of its motion can be sealed, according to Peace's office.",
      "The judge also set a Feb. 6 date for his lawyers to submit a report from a doctor evaluating Jeffries' competency. Prosecutors then have until April 8 to file their own doctor\u2019s report.",

    "story": [
      "Another recount won\u2019t be ordered by North Carolina election officials in a close state Supreme Court race after a partial hand recount failed to suggest the trailing Republican candidate could overtake the Democratic incumbent",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina election officials won't order another recount in a close state Supreme Court race after a partial hand recount failed to suggest the trailing Republican candidate could overtake the Democratic incumbent.",
      "Following the completion of a machine recount of over 5.5 million ballots last week, Democratic Associate Justice Allison Riggs maintained a 734-vote lead over Republican Jefferson Griffin, who is currently a state Court of Appeals judge. Griffin then requested a partial hand recount in which randomly chosen ballots from 3% of the voting sites in all 100 counties were reexamined.",
      "The law says a statewide hand recount would have been required if the sample results differed enough so that the result would be reversed if the difference were extrapolated to all ballots. But the sample tabulations, which finished Tuesday, showed Riggs actually picking up more votes than Griffin. As a result, the State Board of Elections said a total recount won't be ordered.",
      "The election, however, has not been fully resolved. The five-member state board was scheduled to hear arguments Wednesday on protests previously filed by Griffin and three GOP legislative candidates who also are in very close elections.",
      "Riggs, one of two Democrats on the seven-member court, declared victory again on Tuesday, and her campaign renewed calls for Griffin to concede. Griffin didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "The protests going before the state board, which question if well over 60,000 ballots should have been counted, cover three categories of voting. They include votes cast by people with voter registration records that lack driver\u2019s licenses or partial Social Security numbers; overseas voters who have never lived in North Carolina but whose parents were deemed state residents; and military or overseas voters who did not provide copies of photo identification with their ballots.",
      "Separately Tuesday, a Court of Appeals panel unanimously declined Griffin's request to order the state board to rule on the protests before Wednesday's meeting to accelerate the process.",
      "The board could dismiss the protests or \u2014 if problems are found \u2014 order corrected ballot tallies, more recounts or new elections. Decisions by the board \u2014 with a 3-2 Democratic majority \u2014 can be appealed to state courts. Other protests filed by Griffin and the legislative candidates are being first considered by county boards.",
      "The state Democratic Party filed a federal lawsuit last week seeking to block the State Board of Elections from ruling in any way to throw out the disputed ballots. The Democrats' lawyers say federal law prohibits such systematic challenges to voter eligibility for an election that has already passed. Some of the protests focus on activities that Republicans already sued over before the November election.",
      "Democratic officials and their allies held a news conference early Tuesday outside the state Supreme Court building and strongly criticized Griffin and other Republicans for initiating claims they say would disenfranchise legal voters. North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton said she fears the state Supreme Court could ultimately side with Republicans and remove the challenged ballots.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to make sure that people are raising their voices, that we are filing lawsuits where we can,\u201d Clayton said. \u201cAnd we are also trusting the process of our board of elections officials to do their job and to count every single vote.\u201d",
      "Griffin led Riggs by about 10,000 votes on election night, but that lead dwindled and flipped to Riggs as qualifying provisional and absentee ballots were added to the totals. Other types of protests filed by Griffin and the legislators are being considered by county boards.",
      "The Associated Press has not called the Supreme Court race and two of the three legislative races highlighted in the protests. In one of the two, Republican state Rep. Frank Sossamon trails Democratic challenger Bryan Cohn. A Cohn victory would mean Republicans fall one seat short of retaining their current veto-proof majority starting next month."

      "For months, a fugitive dog known as Scrim has transfixed the city of New Orleans",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- A scruffy little fugitive is on the lam again in New Orleans, gaining fame as he outwits a tenacious band of citizens armed with night-vision binoculars, nets and a tranquilizer rifle.",
      "Scrim, a 17-pound mutt that's mostly terrier, has become a folk hero, inspiring tattoos, T-shirts and even a ballad as he eludes capture from the posse of volunteers.",
      "And like any antihero, Scrim has a backstory: Rescued from semi-feral life at a trailer park and adopted from a shelter, the dog broke loose in April and scurried around the city until he was cornered in October and brought to a new home. Weeks later, he'd had enough. Scrim leaped out of a second-story window, a desperate act recorded in a now-viral video. Since then, despite a stream of daily sightings, he's roamed free.",
      "The dog\u2019s fans include Myra and Steve Foster, who wrote \u201cOde to Scrim\u201d to the tune of Ricky Nelson\u2019s 1961 hit, \u201cI\u2019m a Travelin\u2019 Man.\u201d",
      "Leading the recapture effort is Michelle Cheramie, a 55-year-old former information technology professional. She lost everything \u2014 home, car, possessions \u2014 in Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and in the aftermath, found her calling rescuing pets.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018This is what I should be doing,\u2019\u201d Cheramie said. \u201cI was born to rescue.\u201d",
      "She launched Zeus\u2019 Rescues, a nonprofit shelter that now averages 600 cat and dog adoptions a year and offers free pet food to anyone who needs it. She helped Scrim find the home he first escaped from.",
      "It was Cheramie's window Scrim leaped from in November. She's resumed her relentless mission since then, posting flyers on telephone poles and logging social media updates on his reported whereabouts. She's invested thousands of dollars on wildlife cameras, thermal sensors and other gear. She took a course offered by the San Diego Zoo on the finer points of tranquilizing animals.",
      "And she's developed a network of volunteers \u2014 the kind of neighbors who are willing to grid-search a city at 3 a.m.",
      "People like writer David W. Brown, who manages a crowd-sourced Google Map of all known Scrim sightings. He says the search has galvanized residents from all walks of life to come together. As they search for Scrim, they hand out supplies to people in need.",
      "\u201cBeing a member of the community is seeing problems and doing what you can to make life a little better for the people around here and the animals around you,\u201d Brown said.",
      "And neighbors like Tammy Murray, who had to close her furniture store and lost her father to Parkinson's disease. This search, she says, got her mojo back.",
      "\u201cLiterally, for months, I\u2019ve done nothing but hunt this dog,\u201d said Murray, 53. \u201cI feel like Wile E. Coyote on a daily basis with him.\u201d",
      "Murray drives the Zeus' Rescues' van towards reported Scrim sightings. She also handles a tactical net launcher, which looks like an oversized flashlight and once misfired, shattering the van's window as Scrim sped away.",
      "After realizing Scrim had come to recognize the sound of the van's diesel engine, Murray switched to a Vespa scooter, for stealth.",
      "Near-misses have been tantalizing. The search party spotted Scrim napping beneath an elevated house, and wrapped construction netting around the perimeter, but an over-eager volunteer broke ranks and dashed forward, leaving an opening Scrim slipped through.",
      "Scrim's repeated escapades have prompted near-daily local media coverage and a devoted online following. Cheramie can relate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all running from something or to something. He's doing that too,\u201d she said.",
      "Cheramie's team dreams of placing the pooch in a safe and loving environment. But a social media chorus growing under the hashtag #FreeScrim has other ideas \u2014 they say the runaway should be allowed a life of self-determination. The animal rescue volunteers consider that misguided.",
      "\u201cThe streets of New Orleans are not the place for a dog to be free,\u201d Cheramie said. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d",
      "Scrim was a mess when Cheramie briefly recaptured him in October, with matted fur, missing teeth and a tattered ear. His trembling body was scraped and bruised, and punctured by multiple projectiles. A vet removed one, but decided against operating to take out a possible bullet.",
      "The dog initially appeared content indoors, sitting in Cheramie's lap or napping beside her bed. Then while she was out one day, Scrim chewed through a mesh screen, dropped 13 feet to the ground and squeezed through a gap in the fence, trotting away.",
      "Murray said Cheramie's four cats probably spooked him.",
      "\u201cI wholeheartedly believe the gangster-ass cats were messing with him,\u201d Murray said. Cheramie thinks they may have gotten territorial.",
      "Devastated but undeterred, the pair is reassessing where Scrim might fit best \u2014 maybe a secure animal sanctuary with big outdoor spaces where other dogs can keep him company.",
      "Somewhere, Murray says, \u201cwhere he can just breathe and be.\u201d",

      "DETROIT -- General Motors said Tuesday it will retreat from the robotaxi business and stop funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle unit.",
      "Instead the Detroit automaker will focus on development of partially automated driver-assist systems for personal vehicles like its Super Cruise, which allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel.",
      "GM said it would get out of robotaxis \u201cgiven the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.\u201d",
      "The company said it will combine Cruise's technical team with its own to work on advanced systems to assist drivers.",
      "GM bought control of San Francisco-based Cruise automation in 2016 with high hopes of developing a profitable fleet of robotaxis.",
      "Over the years GM invested billions in the subsidiary and eventually bought 90% of the company from investors, all while racking up millions in losses.",
      "GM\u2019s brushoff of Cruise represents a dramatic about-face from years of full-blown support that left a huge financial dent in the automaker. The company invested $2.4 billion in Cruise only to sustain years of uninterrupted losses, with little in return. Since GM bought a controlling stake in Cruise for $581 million in 2016, the robotaxi service piled up more than $10 billion in operating losses while bringing in less than $500 million in revenue, according to GM shareholder reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "The automaker even announced plans for Cruise to generate $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, but it scaled back spending on the company after one of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts dragged a San Francisco pedestrian who was hit by another vehicle in 2023.",
      "The California Public Utilities Commission alleged Cruise then covered up details of the crash for more than two weeks.",
      "The embarrassing incident resulted in Cruise\u2019s license to operate its driverless fleet in California being suspended by regulators and triggered a purge of its leadership \u2014 in addition to layoffs that jettisoned about a quarter of its workforce.",
      "GM CEO Mary Barra told analysts on a conference call Tuesday the the new unit will focus on personal vehicles and developing systems that can drive by themselves in certain circumstances.",
      "The company has agreements to buy another 7% of Cruise and intends to buy the remaining shares so it owns the whole company.",
      "The move is another step back from autonomous vehicles, which have proved far harder to develop than companies once anticipated. Two years ago, crosstown rival Ford Motor Co. disbanded its Argo AI autonomous vehicle venture in Pittsburgh that it co-owned with Volkswagen.",
      "At the time the company said it didn\u2019t see a path to profitability for a number of years.",
      "Yet other companies are pressing forward with plans to deploy autonomous vehicles and expanding their services.",
      "Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo is accelerating plans to broaden its robotaxi service beyond areas of metropolitan Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Last week the company said it would begin testing its driverless Jaguars in Miami next year, with plans to start charging for rides in 2026.",
      "The move comes less than a month after Waymo opened up its robotaxi service to anyone looking for a ride in an 80-square-mile (129 square kilometer) area of Los Angeles. Waymo also has plans to launch fleets in Atlanta and Austin next year in partership with ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "In April, a company called Aurora Innovation plans to start hauling freight on Texas freeways using fully driverless semis.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said his company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels using Tesla's \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.",
      "But an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into Full Self-Driving's ability to see in low visibility conditions cast doubt on whether Teslas are ready to be deployed without humans behind the wheel.",
      "The agency began the investigation in October after getting reports of four crashes involving \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. An Arizona pedestrian was killed in one of the crashes.",
      "GM said it will work with Cruise\u2019s leadership to restructure the company and refocus Cruise\u2019s operations on driver assist systems. The company expects the restructuring to reduce spending by more than $1 billion annually.",
      "Cruise has about 2,300 employees and will retain a presence in San Francisco, GM said. It\u2019s too early to talk about employment levels until the restructuring is completed next year, a spokesman said.",
      "Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, said Cruise will bring its software, artificial intelligence and sensor development to GM to team up on improving GM\u2019s driver-assist systems.",
      "\u201cWe want to leverage what already has been done as we go forward, and we think we can do that very effectively,\u201d Barra said.",

      "HOUSTON -- High-profile legal battles are nothing new for Texas attorney Tony Buzbee, with his latest being a lawsuit he's filed against Jay-Z, accusing the iconic rapper as well as Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs of sexually assaulting a minor at an awards show after-party in 2000.",
      "The lawsuit against Jay-Z is part of a series of civil cases the Houston-based Buzbee has filed against Combs, who remains jailed in New York as he awaits trial on federal charges that he coerced and abused women for years.",
      "In his legal career, Buzbee has represented a variety of clients. He helped acquit Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton at his impeachment trial in the Texas Senate last year. He represented more than two dozen women who accused Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson of sexual misconduct and assault. Buzbee has also made a couple of unsuccessful runs at elected office, including a bid to be Houston\u2019s mayor.",
      "His critics say he\u2019s full of bluster and bombast. Jay-Z said the lawsuit against him is part of an extortion attempt. Buzbee's law firm has said he\u2019s worked to amplify the voices of the marginalized and to \u201cpursue justice against powerful figures.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a society where we typically don\u2019t believe the accuser. We blame the victim and by proxy we blame her lawyers,\u201d Buzbee said during a March 2021 news conference.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Buzbee, his involvement in the lawsuits against Combs and what other cases he\u2019s handled.",
      "Buzbee is a well-known name in Texas courtrooms who has won billions of dollars in settlements for his clients.",
      "He grew up in northeast Texas, the son of a butcher and a high school cafeteria worker. After graduating from Texas A&M University, he served in the U.S. Marine Corps. Buzbee later went to law school and founded his own firm.",
      "His style is \u201ccharacterized by his aggressive legal tactics, his ability to command media attention and his knack for turning complex legal battles into public narratives that resonate with juries and the public alike,\" according to his law firm's website.",
      "Buzbee has said his firm is representing more than 150 people, both men and women, who allege sexual abuse and exploitation at the hands of Combs.",
      "Buzbee's firm, which has set up a 1-800 number for accusers, has filed a wave of suits against the hip-hop mogul. Buzbee\u2019s lawsuits allege that many of the people he represents were abused at parties in New York, California and Florida where individuals were given drinks that were laced with drugs.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers have dismissed Buzbee\u2019s lawsuits as \u201cshameless publicity stunts, designed to extract payments from celebrities who fear having lies spread about them, just as lies have been spread about Mr. Combs.\u201d",

      "Miles Harford had been scheduled to enter a plea Monday to two counts of forgery, one count of abuse of a corpse and one count of theft during a court hearing in Denver that had been delayed four previous times.",
      "Last week, prosecutors filed additional charges against Harford including three more counts of abuse of a corpse for treating bodies or remains \u201cin a way that would outrage normal family sensibilities.\u201d The names of the victims were redacted from the motion to add the new charges, but the crimes date back to 2019.",

      "A Delaware judge says a UPS driver who crashed his truck after downing several beers while driving is not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation for his injuries",
      "DOVER, Del. -- A UPS driver who crashed his truck after downing several beers while driving is not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation for his injuries, a Delaware judge has ruled.",
      "Superior Court Judge Kathleen Vavala ruled late last week that Delaware\u2019s Industrial Accident Board abused its discretion and erred as a matter of law in awarding compensation to Timothy Willis.",
      "\u201cVoluntary intoxication while working deviates from the ordinary course of employment,\u201d the judge noted, saying the board\u2019s decision \u201cexceeded the bounds of reason.\u201d",
      "Willis crashed his semi-truck into a guardrail in Baltimore County, Maryland, in June 2021. He began his shift the night before in Delaware and drove to Pennsylvania before heading to Maryland to drop off the trailer portion of his rig. Willis was headed back to Delaware to drop off the semi-cab before driving home to New Jersey when he barreled into a guardrail at about 4 a.m.",
      "\u201cWillis typically packs a cooler of beers to celebrate the end of his shift while driving back home; but on the day of the crash, he started early,\u201d Vavala wrote, noting that Willis admitted drinking three beers. \u201cWillis admitted he usually drinks beer and drives on the way home from work; attended AA meetings to curb his drinking; and was drinking and driving sometime before the crash,\u201d the judge noted.",
      "Responding officers saw Willis throwing several beer cans out of the truck. Officers said he was slurring his speech, sweating profusely, smelled of alcohol and had defecated on himself.",
      "Officers found an open can of Miller Lite on the running board of the truck, two cans on the ground, and another in the cooler. Willis refused to perform field sobriety checks, but two blood tests taken hours later registered blood alcohol levels of 0.19 and 0.181, both more than twice the legal limit. He was charged with drunken driving but avoided a formal conviction by entering a \u201cprobation before judgment\u201d agreement.",
      "The Industrial Accident Board refused to consider the blood alcohol tests because they were not properly authenticated. It also excluded statements Willis made during his Maryland court hearing. Board members then awarded Willis compensation, saying the accident occurred at a time and place where he was reasonably expected to be while working. They also concluded that violation of UPS\u2019s zero-tolerance alcohol policy did not in itself mean the accident was \u201coutside the course and scope of employment.\u201d They also said UPS failed to demonstrate that Willis was intoxicated at the time.",
      "The board noted that the alcohol in question was light beer with lower alcohol content compared to other beers and that it was unclear when he had been drinking. The board also lent some credence to Willis\u2019 claim that he crashed after swerving to avoid a deer.",
      "Vavala said the board correctly noted that Willis had not been convicted of DUI and it correctly excluded the breathalyzer results. She determined, however, that the board abused its discretion in prohibiting cross-examination of Willis about statements he made during his Maryland plea hearing. She also said the board erred in finding that Willis was acting within the course and scope of his employment when he crashed.",
      "\u201cA truck driver cannot reasonably drink, nor is he expected to drink, alcohol while operating a semi-trailer weighing thousands of pounds on curving back roads at close to four in the morning,\u201d Vavala wrote. \u201cSuch conduct not only violates company policy \u2014 it is also prohibited by law.\u201d",
      "\u201cFinally, to affirm the board\u2019s decision would set a dangerous precedent that employees can get away with driving impaired on the job \u2014 as long as it\u2019s light beer \u2014 despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary,\u201d Vavala concluded.",
      "The judge's ruling did not indicate Willis' employment status with UPS."

      "Rent began to soar in 2021 due to high demand from tenants after lockdowns were lifted and limited numbers of available properties.",
      "The annual cost of renting has gone up by 27% in those three years, compared to a 19% rise in average earnings over the same period.",
      "However, the rate at which rents are rising is now the slowest for three years, the property portal has said, as potential tenants face limits on what they can afford.",
      "Signs of cooling market",
      "Renters have faced a \"red-hot\" market in recent years, with a host of prospective tenants chasing each available property, and rents surging on the back of the high demand. Demand is nearly a third higher than before the pandemic.",
      "It led some applicants to offer months of rent upfront, or to write CV-style letters to agents to try to get ahead of the competition.",
      "Zoopla said there were signs of this market cooling.",
      "But those with the least to spend, in the cheapest areas, may now be facing the sharpest rent rises.",

      "In towns and cities, average rents are rising fastest in Rochdale (up 11.9% in a year) and Blackburn (up 10%), and Birkenhead (up 9%). Zoopla said renters were seeking areas in and around major cities.",
      "Landlords' concerns",
      "Zoopla tracks rents when homes become vacant and are re-let at an open-market rent, accounting for about a quarter of the rental sector.",
      "The property portal has forecast rents rising at an average rate of 4% next year, with demand still outstripping supply.",
      "The increase would come, in part, as a result of fewer properties being made available by landlords.",
      "The National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) said that 31% of landlords were planning to sell properties they rent out in the next two years.",
      "It wants changes to housing taxation and reassurances over no-fault eviction rules.",

      "It comes as the embattled company saw a 40% increase in pollution incidents in the six months to 30 September, as its debts continued to swell, according to its latest set of results.",
      "Thames approaches a critical moment next week, with Ofwat set to decide whether to allow a proposed 59% increase in consumer bills over the next five years.",

      "But on Tuesday, Mr Weston defended bosses getting \u00a3770,000 in bonuses.",

      "Thames needs to raise about \u00a34bn in new equity too, which would not need to be paid back.",

    "story": [
      "Equipment hire giant Ashtead plans to move its primary stock market listing to the US in a fresh blow to the London Stock Exchange.",

      "The firm aims to move its primary listing to the US in the next 12 to 18 months, but it will keep a UK listing as an international company.",
      "The firm which hires out construction equipment, has more than 25,000 employees.",
      "Ashtead said annual profits would be lower than expected due to \"local commercial construction market dynamics in the US\", which is set to affect rental sales growth.",
      "Firms worth hundreds of billions of pounds have been quitting the London Stock Exchange for the US over the past few years, prompting concerns over how attractive the UK for investment.",
      "These include Cambridge-based microchip giant ARM Holdings, which now sells its shares in New York, and Paddy Power's owner Flutter.",
      "Ashtead said part of the reason it wants to move is to attract US investors.",
      "Although the US construction industry has been affected by higher interest rates making borrowing more expensive, the firm expects the market for its services to strengthen as rates are cut.",
      "Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said there had been \"rumblings\" that the firm also wanted to make the move as a \"justification to pay the top brass big money\".",
      "He said Ashtead had been criticised over a proposed $14m (\u00a311m) pay deal for chief executive Brendan Horgan which was deemed \"excessive\".",
      "\"That might be the case for UK-listed companies, but not US-listed ones,\" Coatsworth said.",
      "He added incoming US President Donald Trump \"favours American companies doing things for American people\" - moving the listing would be \"another tick in the box in its favour\".",
      "Coatsworth said the next logical move would be to sell its remaining UK operations which are \"tiny compared to the US business\".",
      "But an Ashtead spokesman said the move would not affect investment plans in the UK.",
      "Ashtead's move comes after UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves changed the government's self-imposed debt rules to free up billions for infrastructure investment.",
      "The rule change is expected to allow for up to \u00a350bn more borrowing to invest in big building projects such as roads, railways or hospitals.",
      "Ashtead was founded in England in 1947, and has been listed on the LSE since 1986. It expanded into the US in 1990, and in the early 2000s it became one of the largest equipment rental firms there."

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 17:00:17 GMT",
    "summary": "A substantial Severn Trent Water investment is based on IOU notes - BBC Panorama finds.",
    "story": [
      "One of England's top-rated water companies is using an accounting trick to artificially inflate its balance sheet by more than a billion pounds, BBC Panorama has discovered.",
      "Severn Trent Water claims that an investment is worth \u00a31.68bn in its accounts, when in reality it has no value to the overall business.",
      "The made-up money makes the company appear more financially robust and helps to support its bumper payouts to shareholders.",
      "Severn Trent denies the accounts are misleading and says Panorama's allegations are \"completely inaccurate\".",
      "The water company - which is regulated by Ofwat - is part of a complex web of companies in the wider Severn Trent plc group.",
      "It serves more than eight million people across central England and mid-Wales and has been awarded the Environment Agency's top four-star rating for environmental performance for a record five consecutive years. Its ultimate parent company, Severn Trent plc, is popular with investors, as it has consistently paid large dividends to shareholders.",
      "But some of Severn Trent's customers are unhappy. The Shrewsbury-based campaign group Up Sewage Creek wants more of the company's earnings to be used to combat pollution in local rivers. \"They've not updated the infrastructure, they've used our money to enrich themselves and enrich their shareholders,\" one of the campaigners told us.",
      "The complex accounting trick started in March 2017 when a shell company, with no money or assets, called Severn Trent Trimpley was set up as part of the group. Another Severn Trent company called Severn Trent Draycote - which owns the water company - agreed to buy Trimpley for \u00a32.",
      "Trimpley then issued additional shares and Draycote bought them for a staggering \u00a33bn.",
      "No money actually changed hands, however, as Draycote paid Trimpley with a \u00a33bn loan note - effectively an IOU. But, on paper, Trimpley immediately appeared to be worth \u00a33bn because it had the IOU.",
      "Severn Trent Water then acquired 49% of Trimpley - and that investment was valued in the water company's accounts at \u00a31.47bn. A hugely valuable asset appears to have been created for Severn Trent Water out of thin air.",
      "Panorama discovered the Trimpley investment through the work of retired auditor Stanley Root.",
      "He told the programme: \"This is as near to an unreal transaction as you can get - that has just been made up and put into the accounts to make the accounts look better.",
      "\"I think it misleads the reader to think that the net assets of Severn Trent Water Limited are higher than they are and that the company is in a much healthier position than it really is. So I think the balance sheet, the financial statements, are misleading.\"",
      "Since 2017, the made-up money on Severn Trent Water's books has grown in value because of interest payments.",
      "Draycote has agreed to pay Trimpley interest on the \u00a33bn IOU, which means the IOU gets bigger each year.",
      "As the value of the IOU goes up, so does the paper value of Trimpley. And that means Severn Trent Water's investment in Trimpley rises every year too.",
      "The Trimpley investment is now valued at \u00a31.68bn in the regulated water company's 2023/24 accounts.",
      "Those accounts were audited and signed off by Severn Trent Water's directors. When referring to the Trimpley investment, the accounts say: \"In the opinion of the directors the fair value of the company's investments are not less than the amount at which they are stated in the balance sheet.\"",
      "While that may be technically correct, the \u00a31.68bn value is based on an IOU that is ultimately backed up by Severn Trent Water itself.",
      "In the wider group accounts the made-up money is cancelled out by the IOU that Draycote issued, so it is only the balance sheet of the regulated water company, Severn Trent Water, that is inflated.",
      "So why do it? Severn Trent told the BBC that Trimpley was set up to allow the water company to legitimately account for future earnings, but that it has never been used for that purpose.",
      "Another possible explanation is that Trimpley helps support increased dividends.",
      "As well as bolstering the balance sheet, the made-up \u00a31.68bn has also been added to Severn Trent Water's retained earnings - that is the pot of money from which cash can be paid out to shareholders. The more money there is in that pot, the easier it is to justify large dividends.",
      "Since Trimpley was added to the accounts in 2017, Severn Trent Water Ltd has paid out \u00a31.615bn in dividends.",
      "Profits over the same period were \u00a31.246bn, so Severn Trent Water has paid out \u00a3369m more than it made in profit during that period. It looks like cash is being drained from the regulated water company.",
      "Auditor Stanley Root says water companies are under great pressure to pay substantial dividends and the Trimpley scheme helps Severn Trent Water deliver.",
      "\"It makes the company's balance sheet look more stable than it really is. It gives them the appearance of financial resilience. It helps to support the dividend payments they're making.\"",
      "Severn Trent denies that Trimpley has supported shareholder payouts: \"All dividends paid by Severn Trent are justified by earnings and any assertion otherwise is unjustified and wrong.\"",
      "However, it is clear that Trimpley is having a dramatic effect on the pot of money from which shareholders can be paid.",
      "Severn Trent Water's 2023/24 accounts - which include the \u00a31.68bn investment - report the company has very healthy retained earnings of \u00a31.84bn.",
      "But the accounts for the wider Severn Trent Group, where all the creative accounting is cancelled out, show retained earnings of just \u00a37.9m.",
      "Severn Trent says: \"Trimpley is an entirely legitimate, legal and transparent structure.\"",
      "Its accounts are independently audited and \"any suggestion that we have misled our investors, regulators and customers on the company's finances is false\".",
      "It says the IOU is \"very much a real asset\" as it is backed up by other group companies.",
      "Severn Trent also says it is in good financial health, it raised an additional billion pounds from shareholders last year and will continue to invest record amounts into infrastructure.",

      "The episode led to Elisabeth's representative to the trust writing a \"'Succession' memo\" that sought to prevent this from happening in real life, said reports.",

      "In 1999, the Murdoch Family Trust, which owns the media companies, was supposed to largely settle the succession plans.",
      "It led to Mr Murdoch giving his eldest children various jobs within his companies.",

      "It would be \"inflicting irreparable injury by silencing Petitioners and the 170 million Americans who use the platform each month,\" the filing added.",
      "The company also said that even a temporary ban could cause a loss of revenue, as well as a loss of users and creators who make content for the platform.",

      "It comes after a fresh crackdown by the US last week, which saw restrictions on sales to 140 companies including Chinese chip firms such as Piotech and SiCarrier without special permission.",
      "At the time, China responded with new tough rules restricting sales of key minerals to the US, including antimony, gallium, and germanium.",
      "Analysts noted that the move was significant for singling out the US for such restrictions, instead of instituting blanket limits.",

      "James Lewis, researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, said the move against Nvidia appeared to be another form of \"retaliation\" by Beijing.",

      "In prior cases when the US has imposed export controls, it has only delayed not stopped the other country's ability to gain access to the technology, Mr Lewis said, adding that he was skeptical that the AI at the heart of the dispute was as game-changing as the two sides contend.",
      "Regardless of the reasoning, however, he said he expected the tit-for-tat to continue.",

      "His case went to court. He says he almost missed the date after the notification went into his email junk folder. He lost.",

      "In other words, customers should be told clearly how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "Bearing in mind that something like 80% or 90% of cars are bought on finance - that is about two million vehicles a year, then the potential for many deals past and present failing that test is high.",
      "Analysts have suggested millions of buyers could each receive hundreds of pounds in compensation. Estimates of the total bill are up to \u00a330bn.",

      "Did the FCA go far enough?",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a rate that was higher than necessary.",
      "By banning these so-called discretionary commission arrangements, it declared it would save drivers \u00a3165m a year.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "However, it didn't decide to ban commissions or fees on a wider scale, or stipulate how dealers should disclose they were receiving payments from lenders.",
      "It may now face the ire of motorists who say it should have done more to protect them, as well as lenders and dealers who feel the regulator gave them the green light to carry on paying commission in the same way.",
      "It is planning to extend the time dealers have to deal with complaints.",
      "It wants any mass compensation, should that come to pass, to be administered in an orderly fashion. The nature of any such redress is currently uncertain.",

      "But a chip able to perform commercial applications would not appear before the end of the decade, he said.",
      "Initially these applications would be the simulation of systems where quantum effects are important",
      "\"For example, relevant when it comes to the design of nuclear fusion reactors to understand the functioning of drugs and pharmaceutical development, it would be relevant for developing better car batteries and another long list of such tasks\".",
      "What is quantum computing?",
      "Apples and oranges",
      "Mr Neven told the BBC Willow's performance meant it was the \"best quantum processor built to date\".",
      "But Professor Alan Woodward, a computing expert at Surrey University, says quantum computers will be better at a range of tasks than current \"classical\" computers, but they will not replace them.",
      "He warns against overstating the importance of Willow's achievement in a single test.",
      "\"One has to be careful not to compare apples and oranges\" he told the BBC.",
      "Google had chosen a problem to use as a benchmark of performance that was, \"tailor-made for a quantum computer\" and this didn't demonstrate \"a universal speeding up when compared to classical computers\".",
      "Nonetheless, he said Willow represented significant progress, in particular in what's known as error correction.",
      "In very simple terms the more useful a quantum computer is, the more qubits it has.",
      "However a major problem with the technology is that it is prone to errors - a tendency that has previously increased the more qubits a chip has.",
      "But Google researchers say they have reversed this and managed to engineer and program the new chip so the error rate fell across the whole system as the number of qubits increased.",
      "It was a major \"breakthrough\" that cracked a key challenge that the field had pursued \"for almost 30 years\", Mr Neven believes.",
      "He told the BBC it was comparable to \"if you had an airplane with just one engine -  that will work, but two engines are safer, four engines is yet safer\".",
      "Errors are a significant obstacle in creating more powerful quantum computers and the development was \"encouraging for everyone striving to build a practical quantum computer\" Prof Woodward said.",
      "But Google itself notes that to develop practically useful quantum computers the error rate will still need to go much lower than that displayed by Willow.",
      "Willow was made in Google's new, purpose-built manufacturing plant in California.",
      "Countries around the world are investing in quantum computing.",
      "The UK recently launched the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC).",
      "Its director, Michael Cuthbert, told the BBC he was wary of language that fuelled the \"hype cycle\" and thought Willow was more a \"milestone rather than a breakthrough\".",
      "Nevertheless, it was \"clearly a highly impressive piece of work\".",
      "Eventually quantum computers would help with a range of tasks including \"logistics problems such as cargo freight distribution on aircraft or routing of telecoms signals or stored energy throughout the national grid\", he said.",
      "And there were already 50 quantum businesses in the UK, attracting \u00a3800m in funding and employing 1300 people.",
      "On Friday, researchers from Oxford University and Osaka University in Japan published a paper showcasing the very low error rate in a trapped-ion qubit.",
      "Theirs is a different approach to making a quantum computer that's capable of working at room temperature - whereas Google's chip has to be stored at ultra low temperatures to be effective.",
      "Scientific findings from Google's development of Willow have been published in the journal Nature",

    "story": [
      "Elderly and vulnerable people in south-east England have told the BBC how they lost control of their money and property after dealing with a law firm based in Essex.",
      "They described how they were persuaded - and sometimes felt under pressure - to grant lasting power of attorney (LPA) to a man called Ron Hiller, a partner in the firm.",
      "LPA is a legal agreement in which someone appoints an \"attorney\" to make decisions on their behalf, either for finance or health and welfare.",
      "Attorneys are supposed to act in their clients' best interests. But we investigated 30 cases involving Mr Hiller and his firm, Craybeck Law, and found a disturbing pattern of events:",
      "People found they had no access to their bank accounts and no idea how much Mr Hiller was charging for being their attorneyLarge amounts of cash were withdrawn without a reasonable explanationProperties were sold for what owners and others considered was lower than market value, and possessions were cleared and disposed of without owners' knowledge or informed consent",
      "People found they had no access to their bank accounts and no idea how much Mr Hiller was charging for being their attorney",
      "Large amounts of cash were withdrawn without a reasonable explanation",
      "Properties were sold for what owners and others considered was lower than market value, and possessions were cleared and disposed of without owners' knowledge or informed consent",
      "There has been a massive rise in LPAs in England and Wales in recent years. In 2023, more than one million people registered - a rise of 37% on the year before.",
      "I spoke to dozens of vulnerable people, as well as their friends, family and neighbours, who expressed concern about Ron Hiller's business practices.",
      "My findings also raise concerns about the potential lack of oversight within the system, and whether the body that regulates attorneys - the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) - is able to deal with such problems.",
      "A spokesperson for Craybeck Law has denied any wrongdoing but said the firm could not respond to claims about specific individuals, because of client confidentiality.",
      "We made repeated attempts to speak to Mr Hiller in person, including at his home, but he did not respond.",
      "Carole's story",
      "Carole was in her 60s, living alone in a house in Uxbridge, west London.",
      "In April 2022 she was admitted to hospital with an infection. She never came back.",
      "Her friends and neighbours, Bert and Hazel, wanted to visit her in hospital but Covid restrictions were in place. Then the hospital told them she had been transferred to a care home.",
      "They rang the home repeatedly but were never put through. They left messages but their calls were not returned.",
      "Within months, Carole's house had been completely cleared out and sold for \u00a3355,000 - a low price, the neighbours thought, considering other houses in the street were fetching up to half a million.",
      "Hazel and Bert were worried about what was happening, but they had no legal right to know any more details.",
      "They wrote asking for my help, as they knew I had investigated a similar case.",
      "I managed to track down Sandie, Carole's cousin.",
      "Together we paid a visit to Carole's care home in the Hertfordshire town of Rickmansworth.",
      "Carole told us she was desperate to leave, but was stuck there. She said she had been introduced to Ron Hiller at the care home, and he had convinced her to grant him lasting power of attorney over her finances.",
      "Most people appoint family members to be their attorney but for Carole, this had not been an option. Her closest relative was Sandie - however, she lived about a 100-mile drive away and suffered from serious health problems.",
      "A property and finance LPA can be activated as soon as it is registered. Carole told us she had been in a lot of pain when she arrived at the care home, and her LPA shows\u00a0she agreed to grant these powers to Mr Hiller straight away.",
      "Since that point, she had been without her bank cards and had received no statements. She was also in the dark about how much she was paying Mr Hiller to manage her finances.",
      "She had wanted to call Hazel and Bert, but Mr Hiller had given her a new phone that didn't contain any of her old contacts.",
      "Carole told us he had advised her to sell her house in order to pay the care home fees, then later told her it had fetched a low price because nobody had wanted to buy in her area.",
      "As we sat talking, Sandie looked at her phone and discovered the house was on the market again. This time, the asking price was almost \u00a3100,000 more than when Mr Hiller had sold it for Carole.",
      "After meeting Carole in the care home, Sandie asked for detailed accounts from Craybeck Law.",
      "What came was a slow drip-feed of bank statements, with no real explanation of Mr Hiller's charges and hardly any receipts.",
      "However, they did show that large sums of money had been taken from Carole's account. Her bank card had been used to make a series of \u00a3300 cash withdrawals from ATMs in the Essex town of South Benfleet, near Mr Hiller's office.",
      "He told Sandie that Carole had authorised the withdrawals - but later, when Carole asked to see invoices, they were not produced.",
      "The statements also showed a charge for arranging for Carole's house to be cleared. I later discovered the work was given to Silverback Commerical Removals, and that the director of this firm was David James Hiller - the son of Ron Hiller.",
      "Craybeck Law denied there was any conflict of interest and said the decision to use Silverback was reached after quotes were sought from alternative providers. Carole has no record of these.",
      "I heard a similar story about house sales a few miles away in Watford.",
      "Ron Hiller was appointed to oversee the finances of an elderly woman called Elizabeth - her house had been sold for \u00a3350,000 after she went to live in a care home.",
      "It was then left empty and sold on a few months later for \u00a3525,000 - without any signs that improvements had taken place.",
      "Craybeck Law said it would not comment on individual cases but told us that the properties it handled were often in poor condition and that sometimes they needed to be sold quickly to cover care home fees, and \"to avoid the risk of a sale falling through\".",
      "Under pressure?",
      "Many of the people I spoke to, felt Ron Hiller had put them under pressure to appoint him as attorney.",
      "Some also told me they had been introduced to him by care professionals, who had led them to believe he was a qualified solicitor.",
      "On the website for Craybeck Law, Ron Hiller is described as a partner in the firm's elder client division. However, the letters after his name - MCICM - denote a diploma in credit management and debt collection.",
      "There is no mention of Ron Hiller on the official register of qualified solicitors either.",
      "A spokesperson for Craybeck Law denied Mr Hiller had ever given the impression he was a qualified solicitor. They added that changes to the law in 2008 meant that individuals who were not qualified solicitors were permitted to become partners in law firms.",
      "In the Hertfordshire town of Letchworth, a woman called Petra told me how an NHS social worker called Margaret Falegan had brought Mr Hiller to her house during a professional visit.",
      "Petra suffers from anxiety and had previously told Ms Falegan - whom she described as her mental health nurse - that she was having trouble with her bills.",
      "She felt she was being put \"very much\" under pressure to grant Mr Hiller power of attorney, even though she felt uneasy about him.",
      "The next day, she went to her local Citizens Advice Bureau and - with the help of the staff there - suspended the process.",
      "A few weeks later, she received a letter from Mr Hiller. It read: \"I've informed the mental health team, Stevenage, of your decision, as this may impact on the level of support they may have planned to provide you in the future.\"",
      "Whatever Mr Hiller had meant by this, Petra read it as a threat. She told me she was still upset about the letter months later, and it had destroyed her trust in the mental health team.",
      "I have heard of other cases where Margaret Falegan introduced Mr Hiller to potential clients in the course of her professional duties. In one, the appointment was made in spite of objections from the man's relatives that he had dementia and did not understand what he was signing.",
      "When I approached Ms Falegan for a response, she denied putting pressure on her clients to sign with Mr Hiller. However, she did not say whether her employer, Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (HPUFT), knew that he had accompanied her on client visits.",
      "In response to my findings, HPUFT said it had now launched an investigation into Ms Falegan, as well as other social workers who had introduced Ron Hiller to clients. The trust said it had also raised the matter with the appropriate professional bodies and the police.",
      "\"If an NHS or care worker is making introductions between their clients and potential attorneys that is very concerning,\" says consultant psychiatrist James Warner.",
      "\"If [elderly or vulnerable people] don't have the ability to decide who they want to appoint as their attorneys, they shouldn't be appointing attorneys.\"",
      "Craybeck Law said that when a potential client was introduced to the firm, a qualified individual - usually a social worker - would have a discussion with that person, to ensure they had the mental capacity to make the decision to appoint the firm as their attorney.",
      "They said this would take place without a Craybeck Law representative present.",
      "It also said the firm had processes to ensure that no individual felt coerced into signing powers of attorney.",
      "Wills",
      "In several of the cases I looked at, Craybeck Law - and chiefly Ron Hiller - not only acted as attorney but also executor of clients' wills.",
      "An executor is legally responsible for carrying out the instructions in a person's will and handling their estate.",
      "However, in at least two cases, Mr Hiller seems to have ignored the instructions he was given. One client was surprised when I told her that the will he had drawn up for her split her estate between four charities - including one she had never heard of.",
      "Another client told me he had not seen a copy of a will Mr Hiller had drawn up for him, and did not understand its contents.",
      "Valerie in Borehamwood also appointed Mr Hiller as attorney and executor of her will. After she died in 2022, it emerged that her family had been left out of her will and her entire estate - estimated at about \u00a3220,000 - was left to a police charity.",
      "Her brother and sister-in-law, John and Kaye, live in Australia and were not well-placed to challenge the will. The fact that family members were no longer beneficiaries also meant they were not entitled to any financial information.",
      "\"We couldn't see how much [Ron Hiller] was charging for probate or how much he charged every year for being her power of attorney,\" Kaye told me.",
      "Ann Stanyer, a leading lawyer in this field, told me that if an attorney is also the executor of a will, there is much less scope for proper scrutiny: \"They can both operate the powers of attorney during their lifetime and take fees through that, but they can then take big fees from the estate as well.\"",
      "Craybeck Law said that the firm was governed by the Solicitors Regulation Authority's (SRA) rules and principles, including strict conduct and ethical guidelines that it upheld.",
      "It said that much of what had been put to it was inaccurate and based on second- or third-hand hearsay and that it fully refuted the insinuations made about the way it supported its clients.",
      "The SRA has now confirmed it is looking into allegations made in this article.",
      "Moving on",
      "Carole has now moved out of the care home in Rickmansworth, and into a small flat in Folkestone near her cousin Sandy.",
      "She has the added work and expense of buying all the basics for her new home, because Ron Hiller disposed of all her furniture and most of her possessions.",
      "However, she is happy to be making a fresh start.",
      "Her story, and the others in this article, were only a few of those I heard about Ron Hiller. He has acted as attorney for scores of people - a fact that Ann Stanyer finds odd.",
      "\"You've got to run [LPA] properly and you can't possibly do that if you've got volumes of these things,\" she says. \"I have four or five which are active and that's more than enough.\"",
      "The Office of the Public Guardian doesn't appear to track when an attorney has an unusually large number of clients. A former senior judge at the Court of Protection, Denzil Lush, is concerned that the OPG is not designed to spot potential problems with the system.",
      "For instance, if an attorney's powers are revoked by more than one of their clients, the OPG does not automatically look at why this is happening.",
      "The issue has caught the attention of Parliament - a private members bill, which has gone to its second reading, proposes greater safeguards.",
      "Many MPs feel it is an urgent problem because of the sheer numbers involved. More than eight million people in England and Wales have now registered an attorney to act for them.",
      "The system was designed to protect elderly and vulnerable people, but the danger is that without better safeguards, it could be leaving them open to harm.",

      "Supply chains",
      "In the early days of the sea border's operation, there were some apocalyptic predictions of collapsing supply chains.",
      "That didn't happen, partially because the deal as originally agreed was never implemented.",
      "The EU eventually accepted that the arrangements for moving food and medicines were going to be unworkable and that NI would have to stay closer to some UK rules.",

      "Listen to Theo read this article",
      "\"Jaguar has no desire to be loved by everybody,\" said Gerry McGovern as he strode across the stage on a slightly chilly evening in Miami last week. It was a bold statement from Jaguar Land Rover's creative director, but it summed up the aura around the relaunch of one of the UK's most famous brands.",
      "On 18 November, a short teaser ad was released that ignited social media. Lasting just 30 seconds, it showed models in bizarre and brightly coloured outfits but did not feature a single car.",
      "The New York Post described it as \"the latest example of idiotic and woke corporate virtue signalling\". Elon Musk took a dig on X, asking Jaguar's official account: \"Do you sell cars?\"",
      "Then came the actual launch at a Miami art fair. Mr McGovern stood on stage beside two cars, resplendent in \"Miami Pink\" and \"London Blue\" shades. Both were examples of Jaguar's new Type 00 \u2013 a concept car that won't ever go on sale, but is meant to showcase the brand's plans for the future. Angular, aggressive, with a huge bonnet and more than a hint of Batmobile, the new design also polarised opinions.",
      "\"Even Gen Z hate the new 'woke' Jaguar!\" declared the Daily Mail. \"Mark my words, Jaguar will go bust,\" Reform Party leader Nigel Farage predicted on X. But the former Top Gear presenter James May told the BBC that the fact the ad was being talked about so widely has \"got to be a bit of a result for Jaguar, hasn't it\"?",
      "Jaguar's managing director Rawdon Glover also hit back, insisting the company needed to be \"bold and disruptive\" in order to get its message across.",
      "But some insiders argue that Jaguar's problems run deeper than a five-minute frenzy on social media.",
      "A 'steady road to nowhere'",
      "Even before the furore over the advert, \"the brand was on a steady road to nowhere\", argues Matthias Schmidt, founder of industry intelligence firm Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "\"The traditional Jaguar demographic was slowly being diluted through natural attrition and customers jumping ship to other brands.\"",
      "So, the publicity that the ad and the launch have drawn appear to have been welcomed within the business.",
      "As Gerry McGovern drily quipped from the stage: \"We're delighted to have your attention.\"",
      "Controversy, he added, had always surrounded British creativity when it was at its best.",
      "Behind all the noise, what is happening at Jaguar is pretty simple. It is being re-launched as an all-electric brand as part of a major restructuring at JLR, instigated by its parent company, the Indian conglomerate Tata.",
      "Jaguar's current models, including the I-Pace, the E-Pace and the F-Type, are no longer being sold in the UK. Instead, the first of a new generation of cars will hit the road in 2026.",
      "Alongside this transition to battery power comes a move upmarket, with the new models expected to cost upwards of \u00a3100,000.",
      "The reasons for doing all this are twofold. Firstly, Jaguar has been struggling to sell enough cars or to make enough money. Secondly, JLR needs to build more electric cars to satisfy regulators, who are working to phase out the sale of new petrol and diesel models.",
      "Steve McQueen and the glory days",
      "It's a far cry from the brand's glory days, when the E-Type placed Jaguar firmly at the heart of swinging-sixties British cool. Steve McQueen owned one. So did Frank Sinatra. Peter Sellers gave one to his wife, Swedish superstar Britt Ekland. George Best, who knew a thing or two about fast cars and a fast lifestyle, had several.",
      "But for decades, the stereotype of a Jaguar buyer has been a well-to-do company boss - almost certainly male, with expensive cufflinks and a set of golf clubs in the boot. Not so long ago he might have been seen smoking a cigar as well.",
      "That might be a little unfair on Jaguar. It has has clearly tried to appeal to female buyers and to families, with offerings such as the F-Pace. Nicknamed the \"She-Type\", this was praised by Good Housekeeping magazine after its launch for its seats designed with women in mind.",
      "But Jaguar continues to be perceived by many as a supplier of upmarket exec-mobiles - and this is a segment of the market where competition is fierce.",
      "\"They've been chasing BMW and Audi sales for years and despite some decent cars have struggled to be profitable,\" explains Rachel Burgess, magazine editor at Autocar.",
      "\"Now, they're trying to target the likes of Bentley and Porsche, looking at high net-worth individuals, who would be spending far more on a car than the level at which Jaguars used to be priced.\"",
      "A long-brewing reinvention",
      "The reinvention of Jaguar has been brewing for many years. Tata bought the brand from Ford in 2008, following nearly two decades under American ownership. During that period, Ford invested significant sums and overhauled its manufacturing and quality control processes. But it failed to make the business profitable and, at the height of the global financial crisis, put Jaguar up for sale.",
      "After taking control of both Jaguar and Land Rover, Tata merged the two into JLR: that brought stability and removed immediate doubts over Jaguar's future.",
      "But while JLR has performed relatively well over the past decade, despite the downturn caused by the Covid pandemic, it is the part of the business that used to be Land Rover that has been driving recent growth.",
      "This has been largely thanks to strong demand for luxury SUVs in markets such as North America and China, as well as in the UK.",
      "In April, the company reported an increase in annual sales across its Range Rover, Defender and Discovery brands of nearly 25%, helping to drive revenues and profits up across the business. Jaguar's sales did rise as well \u2013 by 7%. But that came after five years of steady decline.",
      "In the 2018-19 financial year, Jaguar sold more than 180,000 vehicles. In 2023-24, the figure was 66,866 \u2013 a relatively small proportion of JLRs overall sales of 431,737.",
      "By 2021, other pressures were mounting on JLR, not least the introduction of increasingly stringent environmental rules in the UK and the EU. At the time, JLR had only one electric model in its line-up, the I-Pace.",
      "In February 2021, JLR's chief executive Thierry Bollor\u00e9 announced a new strategy: a wholesale revamp of its range, with all models to become available in electric form by the end of the decade. But crucially, he said Jaguar would be \"re-imagined\" as an all-electric brand.",
      "Although Mr Bollor\u00e9 would leave at the end of the following year, his plan was picked up by his successor, Adrian Mardell \u2013 who promised the company would invest \u00a315bn to turn it into reality.",
      "Within JLR, there is widespread recognition that something had to change.",
      "Fewer cars, bigger profit margins",
      "\"Jaguar's performance over the past 10 years has been challenging,\" Rawdon Glover admitted in a previous BBC interview. He pointed out that Jaguar had been trying to succeed in a high-volume market, where the bigger players can keep their costs down through economies of scale.",
      "\"While our vehicles were highly competent, and critically acclaimed, actually the ability to commercially succeed in that environment was challenging,\" he said.",
      "The move upmarket, in theory at least, gives Jaguar the opportunity to sell fewer cars, but with much bigger profit margins.",
      "\"I'm fully in agreement that they had to do something,\" says Andy Palmer, an industry veteran and former CEO of Aston Martin who has also been a leading executive at Nissan.",
      "\"But it's very brave to be planning to walk away from 85% of your customer base. They are going to have to find new customers to replace them. And acquisition of new customers is always more expensive than retaining existing ones.\"",
      "The big question, though, is whether the changes being made are the correct ones.",
      "'Like a luxury hotel that doesn't refurbish'",
      "Arguably, one of the reasons why Jaguar's rebrand has attracted such attention is because although relatively few people buy the actual cars, the name itself still resonates with cultural significance, thanks to a heritage going back more than seven decades.",
      "In its early days, under founder Sir William Lyons, Jaguar was truly innovative, and it knew how to grab attention. In 1948, it launched the XK120, an elegant two-seater sports car with swooping lines and a powerful six-cylinder engine. As the name implied, it had a top speed of 120mph, making it the world's fastest production car at the time.",
      "In a country still recovering from the ravages of World War Two, this was a revelation. Jaguar had originally planned to build just 200, but demand was so high, it ended up making more than 12,000.",
      "Victories in motorsport put Jaguar's name in lights, especially at the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans - but the company continued to produce striking machines off track as well.",
      "A number of these have stood the test of time, not least the Mark II and its successor, the S-Type. First produced in 1959, this was a luxury saloon that happened to have plenty of bad-boy appeal.",
      "Arguably Jaguar's greatest moment, however, came with the launch of the E-Type in 1961, which came with 150mph performance, and movie-star cachet. It was the car to be seen in and gave the Jaguar badge a lustre that lasted for decades.",
      "But nostalgia alone will not sell cars. Jaguar has been harking back to former glories for a long time.",
      "\"I would certainly say they've been trading off nostalgia for decades,\" says Matthias Schmidt.",
      "Prior to the relaunch, he says Jaguar has been \"like a luxury hotel that doesn't feel the need to refurbish its brand\". He adds: \"The failure to look over one's shoulders and see what the competition is doing can be fatal.\"",
      "Genius or risky?",
      "This week's relaunch seems designed to get the brand out of a comfortable rut and attempt to make it edgy again, while retaining at least some of its past cachet. Or, as Gerry McGovern put it from the Miami stage, \"recapture the essence of Jaguar's original creative conviction\".",
      "Under normal circumstances, the debut of a new car might gain a certain amount of attention in motoring magazines and websites, but it would rarely, if ever, get onto the front pages.",
      "The company has not said who was behind the teaser ad that went viral - generating more than three million views on YouTube - but JLR has been working with Accenture's creative marketing arm, Accenture Song, for three years.",
      "Accenture has not commented.",
      "Branding experts have mixed views about the campaign.",
      "\"What we had was a really bold advertising campaign, that has now been followed through seamlessly with a concept car that completely matches the campaign,\" says Mark Beaumont, founder of branding agency Dinosaur.",
      "\"It is potentially a masterclass in advertising awareness\".",
      "But Tim Parker, strategy director at Conran Design Group, thinks it is a risky strategy. \"They have indeed copied nothing that has come before in the brand's rich heritage, but at what cost?",
      "\"Few brands ever succeed by alienating their traditional customer base over the longer term,\" he continues. \"If the goal is to build relevance in a crowded luxury EV market, then differentiation makes sense \u2013 but only if the underlying strategy is coherent.\"",
      "'Does the world need the Jaguar brand?'",
      "What we have not seen yet, however, or at least in any detail, is an actual road-going car. The concept is just that \u2013 an idea.",
      "Jaguar is in the process of developing three new models, the first of which is unlikely to go on sale until late 2026. All we have been told is that it will be powerful, with more than 575hp, and have a range of more than 430 miles.",
      "It has begun road-testing, and a handful of leaked photos show a large boxy machine that is both similar to the concept \u2013 and very different.",
      "Why these Israeli men volunteered to fight - but now refuse to return to Gaza",
      "'I spent 30 years as a therapist to killers - and no-one is born evil'",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "For any car company, trying to negotiate the transition to electric vehicles without alienating any of its customers is going to be challenging. And for a brand like Jaguar, with the scent of petrol and the sound of six and 12 cylinder engines built into its DNA, it likely to be even harder.",
      "But among all of this is another question that hasn't yet been asked. That is, does that DNA even matter any more - and how useful really is it when it comes to selling cars today?",
      "Andy Palmer puts it more bluntly: Jaguar, he thinks, may well be disposable.",
      "\"I think it's a very fair question to ask \u2013 does JLR actually need the Jaguar brand? Does the world need the Jaguar brand?\"",
      "We won't find out the answer until 2026. In the meantime, we know what Jaguar's plan is. Now it has to deliver.",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 10:34:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Officials will be able to rubberstamp development plans without local authority permission under the changes.",
    "story": [
      "Housing Secretary Angela Rayner has said overhauling planning rules to bypass local authorities will remove \"chaos and subjectiveness\" from the system.",
      "The planned changes will give local authority planning officers the power to rubberstamp development proposals without permission from council committees, as long as they comply with locally agreed plans and national regulations on standards.",
      "House builders have broadly welcomed the streamlining but the Conservatives have accused Labour of \"ignoring\" communities.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Rayner told councils to \"get your plans in order\" as the government targets its manifesto pledge to build 1.5 million new homes.",
      "The deputy prime minister said the government will require all councils to formalise developments' plans, the absence of which has caused developments to \"get stuck in the system\".",
      "Rayner continued: \"Because we haven't had these compulsory plans locally, we've seen speculative development where greenbelt land has been developed on... we've told councils they've got to have those plans.",
      "\"If developers follow the national framework, which protects the environment and looks at other elements, then they shouldn't be stuck in the system for years.\"",
      "She pushed back on the suggestion the government is riding roughshod over councils, saying the changes were necessary to bring about what would be the biggest increase in house building since the 1950s.",
      "\"It's going to take a lot of change to deliver that,\" Rayner added.",
      "Tory shadow Treasury minister Richard Fuller said the government's building target is \"reasonable\", but added: \"If you want to achieve that, you've got to bring the people with you, and, unfortunately, Labour seem to be saying that Angela [Rayner] is best and local people can be ignored.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer restated his pledge to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029 despite accepting it could be \"a little too ambitious\".",
      "The fast-track planning process would apply to housing proposals and associated infrastructure such as schools, if they had already been broadly agreed as part of local development plans where councils set out a strategy for land use in their areas.",
      "If the proposals \"comply\" with these plans, the government has said, they could \"bypass planning committees entirely to tackle chronic uncertainty, unacceptable delays and unnecessary waste of time and resources\".",
      "According to government planning statistics, between January and March 2024 only 19% of major applications were determined within the statutory 13-week period and only 38% of minor applications were determined in the statutory eight-week period.",
      "Judge Labour on six targets, Starmer says in major speech",
      "Starmer seeks to take control after bumpy start",
      "Will Keir Starmer be able to meet his new pledges?",
      "The push for more homes may be popular among those voters struggling to get on the housing ladder.",
      "But even small housing projects are often opposed by people living nearby for a variety of reasons, including concerns about the impact on local schools, doctors, roads and parking.",
      "Rayner said ministers across government had been instructed to ensure new infrastructure projects are targeted at areas which will see new housing development.",
      "She added: \"Many people will say, 'I don't mind housing but we don't have the roads, we're already struggling to get a GP appointment'. Fixing those foundations at the same time is crucial to get the buy-in from those local areas.\"",
      "Taking away the option for local people to prevent a development by making a case at a planning committee may result in a political backlash, particularly in rural areas.",
      "Labour has already angered farmers by bringing agricultural land within the scope of inheritance tax, and needs to nurture support outside cities if it is to maintain political strength.",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA) said that, far from planning delays being to blame for holding up house building, a million proposed homes had in fact been agreed in principle by councils in their local strategies but developers had not brought forward plans.",
      "Councillor Adam Hug, housing spokesperson for the association representing councils, said local authorities and communities \"need to be full partners in tackling the housing crisis together\".",
      "He added this could be achieved with \"new development supported by the infrastructure needed to make communities thrive and proper consultation and engagement that can help ensure local people are able to benefit\".",
      "The Home Builders Federation (HBF) said that while \"democratic involvement and oversight of planning\" was a \"fundamental element of the process\" it could be \"very frustrating for applicants to have the principle of development debated over and over again\".",
      "The housing ministry also hopes to streamline the strategic planning process and introduce a requirement for better training for members of planning committees. A Planning and Infrastructure Bill will be introduced next month.",
      "Many in local government and the housebuilding industry believe the now-mandatory target of 1.5 million new homes by 2029 will be impossible to meet.",
      "A Conservative spokesman said the government had \"set a house building 'target' that the OBR has already said they can't achieve because of their own Budget\".",
      "The HBF agreed with the LGA that councils needed more planning resources and also called for more financial help for young home buyers.",
      "Kate Henderson, the National Housing Federation's chief executive, told the BBC reforms were needed to meet the \"massive challenge\" of hitting the government's \"really ambitious\" house-building target.",
      "She said local authorities have to \"plan for the population now and for the population in the future\", and called on government to facilitate coordination across council areas to ensure social and affordable housing is provided as part of any increase in house-building.",
      "Next week the government will announce further reforms by updating England's planning rulebook, the National Planning Policy Framework."

      "The report from the Labor Department showed employers added 227,000 jobs, led by healthcare firms, restaurants and bars.",
      "It marked a strong rebound from October, when jobs growth dropped sharply amid disruption from major storms and labour strikes.",
      "The figures emerged as analysts debate how much the US central bank will cut interest rates in the months ahead.",
      "The Federal Reserve started reducing rates in September, saying lower borrowing costs were needed to keep the economy on track and stave off weakening in the labour market.",
      "A month later, jobs growth flatlined, as strikes at Boeing and other firms as well as hurricanes put millions of workers off the payroll.",
      "But the bounceback in growth in the latest report supports the view that the weakness was largely temporary. Hiring in October and September was also stronger than previously estimated, the Labor Department said.",

      "TikTok's bid to overturn a law which would see it banned or sold in the US from early 2025 has been rejected.",
      "The social media company had hoped a federal appeals court would agree with its argument that the law was unconstitutional because it represented a \"staggering\" impact on the free speech of its 170 million US users.",

      "TikTok says it will now take its fight to the US Supreme Court, the country's highest legal authority.",
      "The US wants TikTok sold or banned because of what it says are its owners links to the Chinese state - links TikTok and parent company Bytedance have always denied.",
      "The court agreed the law was \"carefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary, and it was part of a broader effort to counter a well-substantiated national security threat posed by the PRC (People's Republic of China).\"",
      "But TikTok said it was not the end of its legal fight.",
      "\"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "They added that the law was based on \"inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information\" and a ban would censor US citizens.",
      "Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 US Presidential Election may also present a lifeline for the app.",
      "Despite unsuccessfully attempting to ban TikTok during his first term in 2020, he said in the run-up to the November elections he would not allow the ban on TikTok to take effect.",
      "When and why could the US ban TikTok?",
      "Is TikTok really a danger to the West?",
      "Trump will be inaugurated on 20 January - the day after the law says TikTok must be be banned or sold.",
      "However, it remains to be seen whether he will follow through on his pre-election vow.",
      "Professor James Grimmelmann of Cornell University said the president-elect would be \"swimming upstream to give TikTok a reprieve\".",
      "\"The anti-China sentiment in the US Congress is very strong, so there are now substantial constituencies in both parties that want TikTok to be restricted from the US market,\" he told BBC News.",

      "Tiffany Cianci, a small business advocate and TikTok creator, said she was \"not shocked\" by Friday's decision - but told BBC News she would not be shifting her TikTok content or presence to the platform's rivals, such as Instagram.",
      "\"I'm not going to do what they want and take my content to their platforms where it's not as successful where it's more likely to be censored, where I am more likely to have less control over my audience,\" she said.",
      "Nonetheless, other platforms are positioning themselves for a post-TikTok social media landscape.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook as well as Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads, has sought to build rivals to TikTok's short form videos within its own apps, and made changes that users have likened to TikTok amid questions over the app's US future.",
      "Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at eMarketer, said there would be \"major upheaval\" if a TikTok appeal were to fail at the Supreme Court and a ban was enforced.",
      "She said this would be \"benefitting Meta, YouTube and Snap, while hurting content creators and small businesses that rely on the app to make a living.\"",
      "But TikTok won't be easily recreated, said Cory Johnson, Chief Market Strategist at Epistrophy Capital Research. Johnson said deep learning models power TikTok's recommendation engine.",
      "\"Enabling such complex AI and big data processing at TikTok's immense scale requires a colossal and expensive technical infrastructure,\" Johnson said.",
      "He said TikTok's hyper-targeting and China's data laws pose significant risks, and pointed to Elon Musk's alterations to algorithms at his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, as a cautionary tale.",
      "In the run-up to the U.S. election, Musk's political posts received more views than all U.S. political campaign ads on X's disclosure dataset, Johnson said.",
      "\"We have very real and very recent experience in America with a social media network tweaking its algorithms to favor certain voices,\" he added."

      "Figures show that almost one million Canadian tourists visited Cuba last year, the top country of origin for visitors by some margin.",
      "As such, a recent decision by the Canadian tour operator, Sunwing Vacations Group \u2013 one of Cuba\u2019s leading travel partners \u2013 to remove 26 hotels from its Cuba portfolio is a blow to the island\u2019s struggling tourism industry.",
      "Sunwing took the decision after Cuba endured a four-day nationwide blackout at the end of October, caused by failures with the country's aging energy infrastructure.",
      "This was followed by another national power cut last month, when Hurricane Rafael barrelled its way across the island, worsening an already-acute electricity crisis.",
      "A third countrywide blackout then happened on Wednesday, 4 Dec, after Cuba's largest power plant broke down.",
      "\u201cCuba has had some volatility in the last few weeks and that may shake consumer confidence,\u201d Sunwing\u2019s chief marketing officer, Samantha Taylor told the Pax News travel website last month.",
      "\u201cThere are incredible places to go in Cuba,\u201d she stressed, keen to emphasise that the company isn\u2019t pulling out of Cuba altogether. \u201cBut we also recognise that if clients are a little uncomfortable, we need to give them options.\u201d",
      "Specifically, that involved drawing up a list of what they called \u201chidden gems\u201d \u2013 alternative holiday destinations in the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and Colombia.",
      "The implications for Cuba are clear.",
      "With tourism now the island\u2019s principal economic motor, and the main source of foreign currency earnings after remittances, that an important tour operator is pointing its customers towards other countries\u2019 beaches over crumbling energy infrastructure is a real concern.",
      "\u201cOur message to Canadians is that tourism is one of the economy\u2019s priorities,\u201d said Lessner G\u00f3mez, director of the Cuban Tourism Board in Toronto in a statement. \u201cThe Ministry of Tourism has been preparing for the winter season to deliver better services, uninterrupted supplies, a better airport experience, and more and new car rentals.\u201d",
      "While Cuba\u2019s tourism agency tries to ease fears about the extent of the electricity blackouts, few can deny that these have been extremely difficult months on the island. Hurricane Rafael was only the latest storm to hit Cuba in a frenetic Atlantic hurricane season in which more powerful and more frequent storms are the new normal.",
      "Of course, severe weather is a problem across the Caribbean. But for Cuba, there are other complications in play.",
      "Donald Trump\u2019s re-election to the White House and his choice for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, stand to make life even more complicated for Cubans than it already is.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the Cuban Revolution\u2019s hardest moment,\u201d says former Cuban diplomat, Jes\u00fas Arboleya. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I see nothing on the horizon whatsoever which allows for an optimistic view of the future of US-Cuba relations.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has handed US policy towards Cuba to those sectors of the Cuban American right who have essentially lived off anti-Castro policies since their origins.\u201d",
      "Mr Arboleya adds that Marco Rubio, currently a US Senator for Florida, is the leading voice among them. He is a Cuban American long opposed to the communist government in Havana.",
      "His parents were Cubans who moved to the US in 1956, three years before Fidel Castro seized power, but his grandfather fled the Castro-led turn to communism on the island.",
      "\u201cPeople are horrified by the idea of another Donald Trump presidency. It spells real trouble,\u201d echoes Cuban political commentator and editor of Temas magazine, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Current US policy towards Cuba is \u201csomewhat schizophrenic\u201d, he argues.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, the State Department facilitates support to the private sector, and [pushes for] economic changes in Cuba. But on the other hand, Congress and Senate seem to freeze any advances on those reforms.\u201d",
      "The expectation is, however, that a future Secretary of State Rubio will coalesce the US\u2019s Cuba policy around a single idea - maximum pressure on the island by tightening the already-harsh sanctions.",
      "Cubans fear that could mean the suspension of commercial flights to Cuba, or even the closure of the US Embassy in Havana, which was officially reopened in 2015 after decades of frosty relations.",
      "If implemented, such steps would be deliberately designed to further harm Cuba\u2019s floundering tourism trade, the aim to hit the communist-run nation when it\u2019s down. Tourist numbers to Cuba have almost halved since the high point of nearly five million visitors during the Obama-era d\u00e9tente with Cuba.",
      "Between 2015-2017 US visitors flocked to the island under more relaxed travel restrictions, keen to experience a country that had long been denied them. Around the same time, the Cuban government embarked on a major hotel-building spree, confident that demand would remain strong over the next decade.",
      "However, there followed a double blow to Cuban tourism from which it hasn\u2019t fully recovered. First, the Trump Administration rolled back President Obama\u2019s engagement policies, and then the Covid-19 pandemic sent the industry into freefall.",
      "With many of those hotels now registering much lower occupancy rates than originally predicted, and real difficulties in providing the five-star customer experience as advertised amid the blackouts and shortages, some question the strategy of putting so many eggs in the tourism basket in the first place.",
      "\u201cWhy has Cuba invested 38% [of government funds] on average over the past decade in hotels and infrastructure connected to international tourism, but only 8 to 9% on energy infrastructure?\u201d asks economist Ricardo Torres at the American University in Washington DC. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. The hotels run on electricity.\u201d",
      "Even with all the current challenges, most visitors agree that Cuba remains a unique travel experience. The cliches \u2013 classic cars, cigars and mojitos \u2013 still appeal to many, while others prefer to travel the island absorbing its history, culture and music.",
      "Yet as tour operator Sunwings\u2019 decision to step back shows, some tourists are finding it hard to appreciate Cuba during its energy crisis, especially if it\u2019s about to be exacerbated by a hostile administration \u2013 and Secretary of State \u2013 in Washington."

      "Sweden has a global reputation for championing gender equality, so why are young women embracing a social media trend that celebrates quitting work?",
      "Vilma Larsson, 25, previously had jobs in a grocery store, a care home and a factory. But she quit work a year ago to become a stay-at-home-girlfriend, and says she\u2019s never been happier.",
      "\u201cMy life is softer. I am not struggling. I am not very stressed.\u201d",
      "Her boyfriend works remotely in finance, and while he spends his days on his laptop, she\u2019s at the gym, out for coffee, or cooking. The couple grew up in small towns in central Sweden, but now travel a lot, and are spending the winter in Cyprus.",
      "\u201cEvery month he gives me a salary from his money that he made. But if I need more, I'll ask him. Or if I need less, I don't - I just save the rest,\u201d explains Ms Larsson.",
      "She shares her lifestyle on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok, where she\u2019s amassed 11,000 followers. Some of her posts have had almost 400,000 likes, although she says she\u2019s not making an income from her content.",
      "She uses the hashtags \u201chemmaflickv\u00e4n\u201d and \u201chemmafru\u201d (Swedish for stay-at-home girlfriend and housewife) and describes herself as a \u201csoft girl\u201d \u2013 an identity that embraces a softer, more feminine way of living rather than focussing on a career.",
      "The soft girl lifestyle has been a microtrend on social media in different parts of the world since the late 2010s. But in Sweden \u2013 with five decades of policies designed to promote dual income households behind it \u2013 the concept\u2019s recent popularity has sparked both surprise and division.",
      "Ungdomsbarometern \u2013  Sweden\u2019s largest annual survey of young people \u2013 first put the national spotlight on Swedes embracing the soft girl trend a year ago, after it became a popular choice when 15 to 24-year-olds were asked to predict trends for 2024.",
      "Another study released by Ungdomsbaromatern this August suggested it was even becoming an aspiration among younger schoolgirls, with 14% of seven to 14-year-olds identifying as soft girls.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about leaning away from this \u2018girl boss\u2019 ideal that we've seen for a lot of years, where there are very, very high demands for success in every aspect of life,\u201d explains Johanna G\u00f6ransson, a researcher for Ungdomsbarometern.",
      "There is no official data on the number of young \u201csoft girls\u201d quitting work altogether and living off their partners like Ms Larsson, and Ms G\u00f6ransson says it is likely to be a small proportion.",
      "But it\u2019s nevertheless become a major talking point in Sweden, from opinion pieces in broadsheet newspapers, to panel discussions at Almedalen \u2013 a huge annual cross-party political event \u2013 and on Swedish public service television.",
      "Gudrun Schyman \u2013 the co-founder and former leader of Sweden\u2019s feminist party Feministiskt initiativ - says she\u2019s taken part in recent debates on the issue. She believes women living off their partners wealth is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d, and \u201ca step backwards\u201d for gender equality.",
      "Ms Schyman argues that young Swedes have been influenced by the country\u2019s right-wing coalition government, which collaborates with the nationalist Sweden Democrats party, as well as the \u201cbroader development\u201d of populism in Europe and the United States.",
      "She also thinks there\u2019s a lack of awareness about life in Sweden before it embraced policies designed to promote gender equality, such as heavily subsidised childcare and shared parental leave. \u201cYoung women today don't carry the history of how women had to fight for their rights - the right to work, the right to have a salary, and the right to economic independence.\u201d",
      "At the other end of the political spectrum, the Sweden Democrats party has been positive towards the soft girls trend.",
      "\u201cI think that people should get to decide over their own life,\u201d says Denice Westerberg, national spokesperson for the party\u2019s youth wing. \u201cAnd if you have that economic possibility to do that [live off a partner] then good for you.",
      "\u201cWe still live in a country with all the opportunities to have a career. We still have all the rights, but we have the right to choose to live more traditionally.\u201d",
      "Aside from ideological debates, discussions have focussed on the social and cultural factors that could be influencing young women to quit work - or at least aspire to a softer lifestyle.",
      "Sweden has a reputation for work life balance - most employees get six-weeks holiday a year, and less than 1% work more than 50 hours a week.",
      "Still, Ungdomsbaromatern\u2019s research suggests rising stress levels amongst young people, and Ms G\u00f6ransson believes soft girls trend may be an extension of recent global work trends such as \u201cquiet quitting\u201d, which encourages employees not to overextend themselves.",
      "Meanwhile, the Generation Z age group (the cohort born between 1997 and 2012) are making, and being influenced by, social media content that celebrates leisure time rather than career goals.",
      "Business Daily: Sweden\u2019s #softgirls trend",
      "\u201cWork doesn't really feature that much if you look at lifestyle content on social media today, it's much more about exercise and wellness,\u201d explains Ms G\u00f6ransson. \u201cAnd if that's the picture young people have of what a normal life looks like, then, of course, maybe you're not so excited about spending eight hours in an office a day.\u201d",
      "But perhaps the biggest talking point is whether the trend is a response to the limitations of Sweden\u2019s pioneering gender equality policies.",
      "Alongside Slovenia, Sweden has the highest proportion of working mothers in Europe, yet government statistics suggest women in heterosexual couples still do a larger share of housework and childcare than men.",
      "They also take 70% of state-funded parental leave, and are more likely to go on sick leave for stress. Meanwhile, although the income gap between men and women remains lower than the EU average of 12.7%, it has stalled at around 10%  since 2019.",
      "Ms Larsson \u2013 who wants to have children in the future \u2013 says her decision to become a stay-at-home girlfriend is partly due to watching older women struggle to juggle a career and homelife.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of women feel burned out from their work,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I just think of my mother and her mother, my grandma, and my sister, everyone. They're always so stressed.\u201d",
      "At Sweden\u2019s state-funded Gender Equality Agency, Peter Wickstr\u00f6m, head of the department for policy analysis and monitoring, also believes the soft girl trend can be viewed as a \u201crational reaction\u201d to the perceived \u201cdemands\u201d experienced by young women.",
      "Shoka \u00c5hrman, an economist at one of Sweden\u2019s largest pension funds, SPP, says she does not believe enough Swedish girlfriends or wives will quit work for it to have an impact on the country\u2019s economy.",
      "However, she is working to raise awareness amongst Swedish women that leaving the labour force (as well as going part time) could impact their personal finances, from savings and pensions, to salary levels if they return to work.",
      "Ms \u00c5hrman hopes the current soft girl debates will serve as a wake-up call to both politicians and businesses alike that there is still work to be done to address ongoing structural inequalities in Sweden.",
      "\u201cI think the source of it, which is mental health issues, burnouts and all that, is what's more worrying, because that affects not only the few younger girls today that want to stay home as soft girls,\u201d she says.",

      "\"We've seen a significant increase in the number of young people with mental health concerns, particularly anxiety and stress.",
      "\"That was still an issue pre-pandemic but certainly the pandemic has not helped in any way with that.\"",

      "He also said that children were picking up on the pressures felt by their parents, such as cost of living issues.",
      "Colin Simpson, who runs the Quarriers service, said they had seen huge benefits from offering one-to-one support to families.",

    "title": "Puberty blockers: Can a drug trial solve one of medicine's most controversial debates?",
    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has pledged to determine the evidence - and establish whether the benefits outweigh any potential harms of prescribing puberty blockers to children questioning their gender",
    "story": [
      "It is among the most delicate and controversial challenges in modern medicine - how to determine whether the benefits of puberty blockers (or drugs that delay puberty) outweigh the potential harms.",
      "This question came to the fore in June 2023 when NHS England proposed that in the future, these drugs would only be prescribed to children questioning their gender as part of clinical research.",
      "Since then, a new government has arrived in Westminster and Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he is committed to \"setting up a clinical trial\" to establish the evidence on puberty blockers. The National Institute for Health and Care Research is expected to confirm soon that funding is in place for a trial.",
      "The dilemma that remains is, how will such a trial work?",
      "Eighteen months since the announcement there is still a lack of consensus around how the trial should be conducted. It will also need to be approved by a committee of experts who have to decide, among other things, whether what's being tested might cause undue physical or psychological harm.",
      "But there is a second unanswered question that some, but by no means all, scientists have that is more pressing than the first: is it right to perform this particular trial on children and young people at all?",
      "A rapid rise in referrals",
      "When the Gender and Identity Development Service (GIDS) was established at London's Tavistock Clinic in 1989, it was the only NHS specialist gender clinic for children in England, and those referred there were typically offered psychological and social support.",
      "Over the last 10 years, however, there has been a rapid increase in referrals - with the greatest increase being people registered female at birth. In a separate development, around the same time the approach of typically offering psychological and social support moved to one of onward referrals to services that prescribed hormone drugs, such as puberty blockers.",
      "Known scientifically as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, puberty blockers work on the brain to stop the rise in sex hormones - oestrogen and testosterone - that accompany puberty. For years, they were prescribed to young patients with gender dysphoria (those who feel their gender identity is different from their biological sex). But in March 2024, NHS England stopped the routine prescribing of puberty blockers to under 18s, as part of an overhaul of children's gender identity services.",
      "NHS England said in a policy statement: \"There is not enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness of PSH [puberty suppressing hormones] to make the treatment routinely available at this time.\"",
      "The ban was later tightened to apply to private clinics as well.",
      "In April 2024, a review of gender identity services for children and young people, led by Dr Hilary Cass, a past president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, published its final report, which called out the \"field of gender care\" for not taking a cautious and careful approach.",
      "She also reported that the change in practice at GIDS away from one primarily relying on psychological and social support was largely based on a single study that looked at the effect of medical interventions such as puberty blockers on a very narrowly defined group of children and there was a lack of follow up in the longer term.",
      "Elsewhere, some other countries were re-examining puberty blockers too. Scotland paused the use of them while Finland, Sweden, France, Norway, and Denmark have all re-evaluated their positions on medical intervention for under 18s - including puberty blockers - to differing degrees. In other places there is still support for the use of puberty blockers.",
      "In medicine, when there is genuine uncertainty as to whether the benefits of a treatment outweigh the harms - called equipoise - some ethicists argue there's a moral obligation to scientifically study such treatments. But there are some from across the debate who don't think there is equipoise in this case.",
      "The ethical dilemma at the heart of the trial",
      "The BBC has learned details about the arguments going on around the concept of a trial and how it could look. Some argue that there is already evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health, and that in light of this it would be unethical to perform a trial at all because this would mean some young people experiencing gender distress would not be given them.",
      "The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) has expressed their concern about the trial for this reason. They support the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgery. WPATH, who have faced increasing criticism of their guidelines from some clinicians, say that it is ethically problematic to make participation in a trial the only way to access a type of care that is \"evidence based, widely recognised as medically necessary, and often reported as lifesaving.\"",
      "Meanwhile other clinicians believe there is no good evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health at all. They also point to research that questions the negative impact that the drugs might have on brain development among teenagers, as well as evidence around the negative impact on bone density.",
      "Dr Louise Irvine is a GP and co-chair of the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender which says it is cautious about using medical pathways in gender dysphoric children. She says: \"Given that puberty blockers by definition disrupt a crucial natural phase of human development, the anticipated benefits must be tangible and significant to justify the risk to children.",
      "\"In pushing ahead with a puberty blockers trial, we are concerned that political interests are being prioritised over clinical, ethical and scientific concerns, and over the health and wellbeing of children.\"",
      "The NHS adult gender services holds data that tracks 9,000 young people from the youth service. Some argue that this should be scrutinised before any trial goes ahead as it could provide evidence on, among other things, the potential risks of taking puberty blockers.",
      "But there is a third view held by some others, including Gordon Guyatt, a professor at McMaster University in Canada, who points out that randomised trials are done in \"life-threatening stuff all the time\" where no-one can be sure of the long-term effects of a treatment. In his view it would be \"unethical not to do it\".",
      "\"With only low quality evidence, people's philosophies, their attitudes or their politics, will continue to dominate the discussion,\" he argues. \"If we do not generate better evidence, the destructive, polarised debate will continue.\"",
      "- Dr Cass found the existing research in the field was poor quality and that there was not a reliable enough evidence base to base clinical decisions on. Young people involved in many of the existing studies may have also had interventions including psychological support and other medical treatments and so it was not always possible to disentangle the effect of each different treatment.",
      "- When it comes to suppressing puberty by using drugs, the rationale for doing so \"remains unclear\", Dr Cass said.  One of the original reasons given was to allow time to think by delaying the onset of puberty. But the evidence suggests the vast majority who start on puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones - oestrogen or testosterone. It is not clear why but one theory, the Cass report suggests, is that puberty blockers may, in their own right, change the \"trajectory\" of gender identity development.",
      "- Clinicians \"are unable to determine with any certainty\" which young people \"will go on to have an enduring trans identity\", Dr Cass wrote. In other words, there's a lack of clarity about which young people might benefit in the long term and which may be harmed overall by the process.",
      "How the trial could look",
      "Recruitment for the trial is due to start in 2025, months later than originally anticipated. Young people will likely be referred after a full assessment by specialist clinicians. A lot is still to be determined, including how many participants there will be.",
      "Ultimately the scientists running the trials will need to establish whether people who get an intervention are better off than those who do not. In this case, do the puberty blocking drugs and their effect make the young people better off?",
      "\"Better off\" in this instance includes the extent to which a young person's mental health may be improved if they are happy with their body. Quality of life is determined by various factors including self-confidence and self-esteem. As well as getting the personal views from the young people and parents, the trial could measure actual real life changes, such as time spent in education and time spent with family and friends.",
      "But there are potential harms to study too, such as the possibility of reduced bone density. Some scientists suggest examining the impact on learning using a form of IQ test.",
      "Normal brain development is influenced by both puberty and chronological age, which usually act in tandem during adolescence. It's not clear how this is affected when puberty is suppressed. Brain scans are one way of understanding any effect.",
      "Some scientists believe it may be possible to simply randomly assign trial participants into two groups where one gets puberty blockers, the other gets a placebo and nobody is aware which group they're in.",
      "But others believe a placebo group is impossible. They say the placebo group would go through puberty, realise they weren't on puberty blockers and potentially drop out of the trial or even find other ways to obtain puberty blockers. Either scenario would reduce the validity of the results.",
      "Professor Gordon Guyatt and others have outlined a potential trial where the group of patients not receiving drugs would be made up entirely of children who are keen to socially transition, such as by changing how they dress and altering their name and pronouns. Researchers could then monitor the difference between the groups.",
      "A second possibility is that both trial groups are given puberty blockers but one group gets them after a delay, during which time they receive psychological and emotional support. This would help researchers determine, among other things, whether their gender-related distress subsides during that delay while receiving the support.",
      "Alongside this there would be a \"matched\" control group that doesn't take a placebo or puberty blockers, whether for health reasons or because they don't want to, that get similar tests and scans.",
      "Puberty occurs in stages when different bodily changes occur. A third proposal could involve a second group being given drugs at a later stage in puberty than the first.",
      "This would allow researchers to explore when the right time to give puberty blockers might be. For example, it would enable the researchers to see if starting the drugs early improves wellbeing by reducing gender-specific body changes. They would also be able to see whether starting the drugs earlier has a greater negative impact on bone density and brain development.",
      "Children referred to GIDS also experienced higher rates of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and autism compared to the general child population. Trial participants would continue to receive treatment related to these conditions but - so we know any differences in the results from the groups are down to the drug - they will need to be balanced for the above conditions.",
      "All these considerations demonstrate the complexity of trying to obtain evidence in this area that is reliable and definitive.",
      "What parents say",
      "Many parents are watching closely to see how it will play out. Annabel (not her real name) is one of them. She is part of the Bayswater Group, a collection of parents with children who are questioning their gender who say they are \"wary of medical solutions to gender dysphoria\". She began looking into puberty blockers when her own daughter began questioning her gender in her early teens, an option put on the table by GIDS.",
      "Ultimately her daughter decided not to take them. Annabel was not convinced there was enough evidence to show they were beneficial and she was unsure what it would mean for her daughter's long-term physical and psychological health.",
      "Today, she still has unanswered questions - including some further ones around the trial. \"A big concern for me is will this new trial, if it gets approval, give us the evidence that we want? Or will we end up with more weak data that Dr Cass said undermined decision making in this area?\"",
      "Natacha Kennedy, a lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London who researches transgender issues, has examined the results of a survey of 97 parents of young people with gender-related distress that took place following the puberty blockers ban. She believes that puberty blockers should be an option available for young people questioning their gender and that many will not accept being part of a placebo group in a trial.",
      "\"These parents are desperate and if [they] get to a trial and it turns out their child is not being given the actual puberty blockers, then there is no point in them being there,\" she says.",
      "\"There may be some parents who would\u2026 find another way [to obtain the drugs].\"",
      "Why these Israeli men volunteered to fight - but now refuse to return to Gaza",
      "'I spent 30 years as a therapist to killers - and no-one is born evil'",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Whatever trial format is settled on, more scrutiny will follow. And there will no doubt be fierce debate about the merits of the trial and what it can tell us, as many scientists around the world are watching to see what happens in the UK.",
      "But inevitably, there will be a long wait to fully understand the longer term effects on physical and mental health of those who take puberty blockers - and the long-term effects on those with gender-related distress who don't. Nor do we know how many people detransition, though the Cass report says, \"there is suggestion that numbers are increasing\".",
      "\"We really need to have long-term follow up,\" argues Annabel. \"Can a child possibly understand what that means to their fertility and a loss of sexual function and what that will mean for their future life?\"",
      "For now, she and the scores of parents, carers and young people, can only watch and wait for the trial to begin and for its verdict - and what that means for whether puberty blockers will be prescribed to children once again in the future.",

    "story": [
      "Keir Starmer has outlined a \"plan for change\" in a speech and set targets in key areas.",
      "He said they were \"measurable milestones that will also give the British people the power to hold our feet to the fire\".",
      "BBC Verify looks at whether the government can meet these pledges.",
      "The NHS",
      "The prime minister highlighted an existing target for the NHS in England that 92% of patients waiting for planned treatment should be seen within 18 weeks of being referred.",
      "It was a manifesto pledge and the government has pledged to achieve it by 2029.",
      "The latest NHS data shows that in September 2024 only 58.5% of operations, or other procedures people were waiting for, occurred within 18 weeks.",
      "When Labour took power in July, the share was 58.8%, so it has barely changed.",
      "The last time the 92% target was hit was in November 2015.",
      "In order to meet this goal, the government has said it wants the NHS in England to get through an additional 40,000 appointments and operations each week.",
      "To help fund this, Chancellor Rachel Reeves increased the inflation-adjusted day-to-day cash resources of the health department by 3.8% in both 2024-25 and 2025-26 in her Autumn Budget.",
      "However, Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, has warned that achieving the 40,000 appointments and operations target will not be enough, on its own, to hit the broader 92% waiting list target.",
      "\u201cThe NHS needs reform, not just ever more activity,\u201d Mr Taylor said.",
      "Is Starmer speech a \u2018plan for change\u2019 or \u2018emergency relaunch\u2019?",
      "The economy",
      "Starmer made a new pledge to increase the amount of money that households have.",
      "The government will use two measures to track this.",
      "The first is real household disposable income (RHDI) per person. This is what people have left of their pay and benefits once they have paid tax.",
      "In October, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which does the government's forecasts, predicted that RHDI per person would rise by around 0.5% per year over this Parliament.",
      "According to calculations by the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on living standards, that would be a slightly better performance than the 0.3% average growth in RHDI per person in the previous Parliament.",
      "But it would be worse than just about every other Parliament for decades.",
      "The second measure is GDP (a measure of the size of the economy) divided by the size of the population, which the prime minister says will rise for every region of the UK.",
      "In the last Parliament, overall GDP per capita fell in the UK.",
      "Starmer also mentioned the manifesto pledge to deliver the highest sustained growth in the G7, which would mean having stronger growth than the US, Canada, Italy, France, Japan and Germany.",
      "The latest forecasts from the IMF from October suggest that Canada and the US will have stronger average growth than the UK between 2024 and 2029.",
      "However, it should be stressed that these are only forecasts - and forecasts related to economic growth and incomes are subject to considerable uncertainty.",
      "Crime",
      "The government has re-committed to its manifesto pledge to hire 13,000 additional neighbourhood police officers, volunteer special constables and Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs), who work with officers but do not have all the same powers.",
      "BBC Verify has asked the Home Office for the breakdown of these 13,000 officers - and how many will be new - but they have not yet responded and the government document does not set it out.",
      "Tiff Lynch, the acting national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, the staff association for officers, has welcomed the government\u2019s recruitment drive.",
      "But she also warned that morale in the force is low due to real terms pay cuts in recent years and pointed out that in the federation's last survey 22% of respondents said they were planning to leave within the next two years.",
      "Education",
      "The government pledged to raise the proportion of children in England who are \u201cready for school\u201d at the age of five, to 75%.",
      "Official data from the Department for Education suggests that in 2023-24, 67.7% of children in England had a \u201cgood level of development\u201d.",
      "This is based on teacher assessments of children\u2019s development at age five.",
      "This was up slightly from 67.2% in the previous year.",
      "The government is in the middle of a major expansion of state-funded childcare.",
      "From September 2025, the government is pledging to deliver 30 hours of government funded childcare a week for under-fives in England, taking on the commitment of the previous government.",
      "However, the Early Years Alliance, which represents nurseries in England, estimates that the increase in employer National Insurance Contributions announced in the Budget will result in additional annual costs averaging more than \u00a318,600 per provider. That is based on a survey of its members.",
      "The childcare sector warns that, without extra funding to make up for the tax rise, nurseries might withdraw from the free childcare scheme, or some could go out of business.",
      "Housebuilding",
      "Also in line with Labour\u2019s manifesto, Starmer has recommitted to building 1.5 million net additional dwellings in England over the course of the Parliament.",
      "At a constant annual rate, that would equate to 300,000 per year,",
      "The most recent official data shows that 221,070 net additional dwellings were delivered in 2023-24, a decline of 6% on the previous year.",
      "The government is bringing in new housing targets for local councils in England, which the previous administration dropped and is reforming planning laws to try to accelerate building.",
      "But many housing experts remain sceptical about the feasibility of Labour\u2019s target given the lack of affordability of new housing, which has put off many buyers and deterred private developers from investing.",
      "Official data also shows that the number of housing projects given the go-ahead by councils in England reached a record low in the final months of the last government, mainly because of a decline in applications from builders.",
      "Clean power",
      "In November 2023, a Labour press release talked about \"leading the world with 100% clean power by 2030\".",
      "The party's election manifesto pledged \"zero-carbon electricity by 2030\".",
      "Starmer now says the government will achieve at least 95% clean power by 2030.",
      "The prime minister was questioned repeatedly about whether this represented a change in the target but denied this.",
      "The National Energy System Operator (NESO), the government\u2019s independent system planner and operator for the energy transition, last month defined clean power as including less than 5% of generation from gas in a typical year.",
      "It recently concluded that \u201cit is possible to build, connect and operate a clean power system for Great Britain by 2030, while maintaining security of supply\".",
      "However, it added that achieving this would be \u201cat the limit of what is feasible\u201d.",

      "There are \"too many cultures of silence\", Lisa Nandy has said, following the allegations against MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace.",
      "Speaking to MPs on Tuesday, Nandy said she was \"prepared to take further action\" if the media industry couldn't address claims of misconduct.",
      "Wallace stepped aside from presenting MasterChef two weeks ago, after a BBC News investigation revealed allegations of inappropriate sexual comments and inappropriate behaviour against him.",
      "His lawyers have strongly denied he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature.",
      "Appearing before the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Nandy spoke about recent questions of behaviour, including those around Wallace.",
      "She said: \"Having spoken with the BBC in recent weeks about the Gregg Wallace allegations, I am really clear that we're seeing too many of these cultures of silence and issues being swept under the rug.",
      "\"People who cannot advance through the current complaints system because it would have an impact on their career, potentially ending their career.",
      "\"And I am clear that people need to be heard, action has to be taken and perpetrators have to be held to account.\"",
      "Our investigation heard from 13 people across a range of ages, who worked across five different shows.",
      "They included the broadcaster Kirsty Wark, who appeared on Celebrity MasterChef. Most, however, were production workers. Many were freelancers.",
      "Nandy said that one of her concerns is that the creative industries rely heavily on freelancers: \"It's very casual employment contracts, people are often employed or promoted because of who they know, whether they're liked or trusted, and you do get a lot of younger people coming into those industries, and there is an enormous power imbalance between the people who run those industries and the people who work in them.\"",
      "She added that the Department of Business and Trade and the deputy Prime Minister were pursuing a plan to \"make work pay\".",
      "\"They're looking very closely at the use of things like unpaid internships which they're intending to consult on, self-employed workers, zero-hours contracts, harassment.\"",

      "\"But if they don't, I will be prepared to take further action,\" she said.",
      "Nandy added that she was \"quite astonished\" that when she got the list of organisations that are financially supporting CIISA, Banijay \u2013 the production company that employs Gregg Wallace and makes MasterChef \u2013 was not on the list.",
      "\"I take quite a dim view of company executives that don't take this seriously, and after I've had those discussions with CIISA I will write to the chair to update the committee on the work that we're taking forward with them.\"",
      "Responding to the culture secretary's comments, Banijay UK told BBC News it \"takes behavioural standards across the industry incredibly seriously\".",
      "\"We have been supporting CIISA since its inception with multiple meetings at the highest level and we look forward to agreeing next steps.\"",
      "Last week, Wallace apologised for suggesting allegations against him came from \"a handful of middle-class women of a certain age\".",
      "He concluded: \"It's obvious to me I need to take some time out while this investigation is under way. I hope you understand and I do hope that you will accept this apology.\"",
      "On Friday, BBC bosses said they would not tolerate behaviour that \"falls below the standards we expect\".",
      "In the message sent to staff by the corporation's director-general Tim Davie, and Charlotte Moore, the BBC's chief content officer, they added that they would be supporting Banijay UK with its investigation, and added: \"It is critical that every part of the BBC upholds our values, including where companies are working with us\"."

    "story": [
      "The couple who run PinkNews, the world's largest LGBT news website, have been accused by staff of multiple incidents of sexual misconduct.",
      "Several former staff members told the BBC they saw Anthony James, a director at the UK-based company and husband of its founder, kissing and touching a junior colleague who they say appeared too drunk to consent.",
      "And more than 30 current and former members of staff said a culture of heavy drinking led to instances when founder Benjamin Cohen and his husband behaved inappropriately towards younger male employees.",
      "Representatives for Mr Cohen and Dr James told the BBC they were not able to provide a statement at this time, but that their position is that the allegations are false.",
      "Run by family members of Mr Cohen - his husband and former GP Dr James is chief operating officer, and his father Richard is the chief lawyer - PinkNews says its mission is \"to inform, inspire change and empower people to be themselves\".",
      "It played an influential role in the campaign for marriage equality in the UK and its annual awards ceremony has attracted prime ministers and other politicians.",
      "Away from the cameras and red carpets, however, multiple former staff members have told the BBC they had experienced bullying and sexual misconduct which made some of them feel unsafe to be alone around Mr Cohen and Dr James. Allegations of misogyny have also emerged and several people told us that some young female members of staff had been asked to act as the couple's surrogates.",
      "As well as interviewing 33 people who worked at PinkNews between 2017 and 2024, we have also seen a variety of evidence including official written complaints, private emails and WhatsApp messages sharing staff members\u2019 concerns, plus doctors\u2019 records referring to stress and mental health struggles attributed to the work environment at PinkNews.",
      "Speaking after this story was first published, the Prime Minister's spokesperson called the reports \"very concerning\". While he would not comment on specifics of the case, he said that he believed \"everyone should be free\" from inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.",
      "\"People should always feel confident to come forward in these situations,\" he added.",
      "Asked if Mr Starmer would attend the Pink News Awards again, following a previous appearance in 2022, he said he could not comment on the specifics at this stage.",
      "'They weren\u2019t capable of consenting'",
      "Five former members of staff told the BBC they had witnessed Dr James groping and kissing a junior member of staff, who they said was \"too drunk to stand or talk\" and \"unable to consent\".",
      "The alleged incident happened outside a central London pub, where staff had gathered after a PinkNews event.",
      "A former PinkNews staff member, who we are calling Gary, said Dr James had led the junior colleague behind a tree. \"Anthony was just forcing himself on somebody who wasn\u2019t able to make that decision for themselves because of how intoxicated they were,\" he said.",
      "People at the event said they helped the alleged victim get home in a taxi.",
      "But several former members of staff who said they witnessed the incident told us they were too scared to complain. One person said: \"It\u2019s the CEO\u2019s husband, what are you going to do? Lose your job?\"",
      "A complaint about the incident was made later by a staff member, and was shared with several members of the senior leadership team at PinkNews. The BBC has been shown multiple copies of the complaint but has been unable to establish whether any action was taken as a result.",
      "Many of the former employees said staff socials or awaydays often involved drinking until the early hours of the morning and that \"Prosecco Friday\" - where staff would be given free wine and crisps - was introduced in the office in an effort to boost staff morale.",
      "Another former staff member we are calling Damian said he personally experienced inappropriate behaviour from Mr Cohen during an evening at the pub after work.",
      "\"Ben was extremely drunk to the point he fell off his chair, and then asked me out of earshot of my other colleagues whether I wanted to go back to his [\u2026] because Anthony his husband wasn\u2019t there,\" Damian said.",
      "\"He said something along the lines of 'Anthony is always getting with other men' and the suggestion was we would do something sexually. I was extremely uncomfortable.\"",
      "Damian said after that night, he avoided being alone with Mr Cohen for the rest of his time at PinkNews.",
      "\"I never heard about it again, no apology,\" he said. \"It put me on alert because it made me realise it was a boundary he thought he could cross.\"",
      "Stephan Kyriacou, who worked at PinkNews between 2019 and 2021, said the job had started as a \"dream come true\" where he did not have to \"hide who I was or pretend\", but the dream was soon \"shattered\".",
      "During a Christmas party, Mr Kyriacou said, Mr Cohen had slapped him on the bottom in front of everyone else.",
      "\"I just shut down for a minute. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I was in shock. I remember turning to my friends and saying, 'What the hell just happened?'\"",
      "Mr Kyriacou said he no longer felt comfortable enough to be alone around his boss.",
      "He said: \"That just made me completely avoid him. I don\u2019t remember ever speaking to him one-on-one after that.\"",
      "Other staff also voiced their concerns about Mr Cohen, Mr Kyriacou said, with several messages in a group chat describing him as a \"creep\" and staff saying they did not feel comfortable around him.",
      "\"None of us really felt like we could complain because we didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to us. Ben is very well-known and we didn\u2019t know whether he was going to badmouth us to people,\" Mr Kyriacou said.",
      "'Creepy and sleazy'",
      "Staff have told us they were shouted at and belittled by Mr Cohen, and that there was a \"toxic\" culture at the company.",
      "\"He can be quite brutal in the way he speaks to you,\" said Damian. \"When things go wrong he\u2019d come down on you like a tonne of bricks and so you were just in this constant state of emotional flux.",
      "\"He put extreme pressures on me to the point I would go home and cry. It caused issues in my own personal relationship with my partner, and then [Benjamin] would love-bomb me and I would think everything was alright.\"",
      "Cai Wilshaw, former head of external affairs at PinkNews, said: \"You had this sort of dark cloud in the office sometimes when Ben was there, that made it really difficult to actually enjoy working there.",
      "\"We worked together quite well, but it is clear that he is a very, very difficult character, and sometimes overly so in a way that really impacted people who worked with him.\"",
      "Some staff members also said they had witnessed what they called \"misogynistic\" behaviour.",
      "Several people said that on occasions young, female members of staff had been asked to act as a surrogate for Mr Cohen and Dr James.",
      "They say that often the request was delivered as a joke, but that it had made people feel \"awkward and uncomfortable\".",
      "One anonymous staff member called it \"creepy and sleazy\", while another called it \"part and parcel\" of how \"misogynistic\" PinkNews was.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Union of Journalists said it has reached out to its members following the \"deeply disturbing\" allegations, which they say \"paint a picture of a dysfunctional and wholly unacceptable workplace environment\".",
      "Many of the staff who spoke to the BBC said they hope the culture at PinkNews can change so it can continue to tell stories relevant to the LGBT community.",
      "\"It\u2019s important because the mainstream media doesn\u2019t often report on whatever\u2019s happening to trans or queer people,\" said Stephan Kyriacou. \"I think if it can be overhauled, that will make a massive difference.\"",
      "Gary said there was a need for \"authentic queer-led journalism and queer-led stories\" but said \"unfortunately PinkNews has kind of lost its credibility in that arena\".",
      "Damian told us he believed PinkNews\u2019 future could only be secured if Mr Cohen and Dr James took a step back.",
      "\"The fact you cannot separate the two is extremely problematic,\" he said. \"Ben needs to be held to account. Until the day that happens, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a future for PinkNews.\"",
      "The BBC was informed that Mr Cohen and Dr James were not able to provide a statement at this time, but we understand that their position is that the allegations made against them are false."

      "\"When Elphaba comes into her own and she becomes more confident in who is she when she gets to the Emerald City... she has that confidence and her nails tell that story too. It's more of a daring design and more 'this is me, this is who I am and you will accept me for who I want to be'.\"",

    "story": [
      "You might not expect one of the world's best-known video game actors to suffer from imposter syndrome.",
      "But, as Troy Baker will tell you, no-one's immune.",
      "His most famous role is Joel Miller, the main character of post-apocalyptic adventure The Last of Us - a game regularly praised for its storytelling and performances.",
      "He's also appeared in celebrated series including Bioshock, Uncharted and Batman: Arkham.",
      "But stepping into the lead role of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was a different matter.",
      "Troy says taking on the character made famous by Oscar nominee Harrison Ford was daunting, even for him.",
      "\"I turned it down,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat, thinking back to when he was first offered the job.",
      "\"I was scared. I felt the weight of what this character meant.\"",
      "Troy says the performance capture team at developer MachineGames convinced him to change his mind, but there was one more person he had to win over.",
      "Todd Howard, the boss of publisher Bethesda, had long dreamed of making an Indiana Jones game and oversaw the project.",
      "But, Troy says, he \"rolled his eyes\" when the actor was first put forward.",
      "Howard felt it would ruin the experience for players so used to hearing him.",
      "\"I never thought that my success would actually work against me,\" says Troy.",
      "Rather than walk into the role, Troy says, he had to audition with dozens of others.",
      "It eventually came down to him and and one other actor. The decision was left to a test audience and a \"blind taste test\" where they had to choose the performance they preferred.",
      "\"Todd Howard said they picked you every time,\" Troy says.",
      "\"And I thought that was a compliment.",
      "\"He was like: 'No, it's a challenge. That's the standard'.\"",
      "The weight of expectation isn't only resting on Troy's shoulders - anticipation for Indiana Jones's first video game outing in over 15 years is high.",
      "Bethesda's parent company Zenimax was bought by Microsoft in 2020, before it acquired Activision-Blizzard last year for a record-breaking $69bn.",
      "The games it got hold of in that deal - including Call of Duty and Warcraft - have continued to be successful, but its gaming division hasn't had a new in-house hit this year.",
      "They're hoping Indiana Jones can change that.",
      "Troy says the production for the game's sets was lavish, with crews building accurate representations of boats, airships and other locations on giant motion-capture stages.",
      "That's not unusual for a blockbuster video game in 2024, but it will mean The Great Circle needs to sell well to recover the costs of making it.",
      "The game will initially come out on Xbox and PC, and Microsoft recently announced plans to release it on rival platform PlayStation 5.",
      "This angered Xbox fans, who accused it of going back on promises to keep the game exclusive, but the company has said its main goal is to get its games on as many devices as possible.",
      "Axel Torvenius, creative director at Swedish developer MachineGames, speaks to Newsbeat as the final touches are being worked out prior to The Great Circle's release.",
      "He doesn't get deep into the details of exclusivity but says he's \"happy\" the game will be widely available.",
      "Axel says his bigger concern was figuring out how to use the team's expertise to create an adventure that felt authentic to its inspiration.",
      "The studio is known for its work on the rebooted Wolfenstein series.",
      "Like Indiana Jones, the 3D shooter's hero William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz takes on Nazi enemies, but he does so using a range of increasingly devastating firearms.",
      "That wouldn't sit quite right with the adventurous archaeologist, says Axel.",
      "\"That's not Indiana Jones, that's not the brand we're working with. That's something else,\" he says.",
      "Indiana Jones relies more on stealth than direct confrontation, and the game contains plenty of puzzles.",
      "The game is also played from a first-person perspective, a decision Axel says was made early in the game's development.",
      "\"We've been trying to make you feel like Indiana Jones, like literally stepping into his shoes and seeing the world through his eyes,\" he says.",
      "\"There's an intimacy you can't achieve in third-person.\"",
      "Marios Gavrilis, who plays The Great Circle's villain, Voss, had a slightly less rocky road to landing the part.",
      "Like Troy, he's worked in video games before, mainly re-voicing characters from English into German.",
      "This is one of the first times he's been part of an original cast, and his character's appearance is modelled on his own.",
      "Marios, who's also got TV credits to his name in Germany, says there's potential for more crossover with video games.",

      "The final stop was watched by more than 60,000 fans in Vancouver's BC Place stadium. One fan-hosted live-stream from the venue was followed by another 389,000 people on YouTube.",
      "Swift was in a nostalgic mood throughout, calling the show \"one last grand adventure\" with her fans.",
      "As she played Cardigan, from her pandemic-era album Folklore, the reality of the situation started to sink in.",
      "\"It's just crazy to think I'm going to sing the last song I ever sing in the Folklore cabin,\" she said. \"That's wild. Oh my God!\"",
      "And she paid tribute to her band, dancers and crew, \"who all left their families\" behind and \"performed when they were sick [or] anything was going on in their lives\" to keep the show on the road.",
      "Sentimental acoustic set",
      "For the acoustic set - which showcases songs missing from the standard setlist - the star said she had tried to choose tracks that \"really encapsulate how I feel\" about the final show.",
      "On guitar, she played a mash-up of A Place In This World, from her debut album, and 1989's New Romantics, with the apposite lyric: \"Heartbreak is the national anthem / We sing it proudly.\"",
      "Moving to the piano, she played Long Live, tweaking the words from \"It was the end of a decade\" to \"It was the end of an era\" - prompting a huge cheer from the audience.",
      "Continuing the theme, she added elements of New Year's Day, a song about holding on to memories, and The Manuscript, whose story of heartbreak became a metaphor for the tour coming to an end.",
      "\"Now and then I re-read the manuscript / But the story isn't mine anymore.\"",
      "Fans noted that the selection meant the acoustic sets had kicked off in 2023 with Tim McGraw, the first song in her discography, and ended with The Manuscript, the most recent.",
      "Only six songs from her 11 studio albums were not performed on the tour: That's When, Bye Bye Baby, Girl At Home, Ronan, Forever Winter and Soon You'll Get Better.",
      "Swift was watched from the audience by her mother Andrea - but her boyfriend, American football player Travis Kelce, had to miss the show to play (and win) a home game with his team, the Kansas City Chiefs.",
      "Fans had predicted she would use the last concert to announce her next career move. Top of their wish-list was the reveal of Reputation (Taylor's Version) - the latest in the star's plan to re-record the first six albums in her discography.",
      "In the end, there were no big surprises or special guests.",
      "Instead, the Eras Tour got to bow out on its own terms - celebrating 18 years of music that has united people around the world.",
      "As she cued up the set-closer, Karma, Swift thanked her fans one last time.",
      "\"I want to thank every single one of you for being a part of the most thrilling chapter of my entire life to date - my beloved Eras Tour.\"",
      "She dedicated the song to Kelce, changing the lyrics to \"Karma is the guy on The Chiefs coming straight home to me\", as she has done several times since they started dating last year.",
      "Over the dying notes of the song, Swift shared an emotional hug with her dancers and backing singers. And rather than making her traditional exit of being lowered beneath the stage, she opted to walk out with her team.",
      "It was, quite literally, the end of an era. We're unlikely to see another tour on this scale for a long time."

      "\"Just because Dave's passed it doesn't stop him being my best mate,\" says TV chef Si King. \"That's not how that works. You know, you're mates for life and death.\"",
      "It's been over nine months since Si's best friend and Hairy Bikers co-star, Dave Myers, died at the age of 66 from cancer.",
      "\"I'm always talking to him. I'll go, 'What do you think of that dude?' I mean, people will think I've lost my mind,\" says Si.",
      "Their brotherhood first began over a love of motorcycles, curry, poppadoms, beer, and a game of pool, says Si. They went on to become the nation's favourite hairy cooking duo, dressed in leathers and throwing away the rule book when it came to TV cooking shows. With not one Michelin Star between them, their approach to cooking was refreshingly down-to-earth.",
      "\"It took us two series to work out that we probably should be using Pyrex bowls so people could see what we were putting in them,\" laughs Si.",
      "With 25 years of memories in their back catalogue, he says it is his duty to look after Dave's memory and \"to look after the legacy that he built,\" and \"the legacy of the Hairy Bikers that [they] both built.\"",
      "Si is honouring Dave's life in a special one-off documentary due to air before Christmas on BBC Two.",
      "\"It is about a celebration of my best mate and so it should be, because he was wonderful, and remains to be wonderful, because his energy's still about, that's for sure.\"",
      "In June this year, biking groups from across the UK headed in a procession from London to Dave's hometown in Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria to mark his life and raise money for charity. The idea for the event, dubbed Dave Day, came from a drunken conversation after Dave's funeral with Lili, Dave's widow, says Si.",
      "\"Lil picked up on a social media post that somebody said, 'I'm having a Dave Day, so instead of having a good day, just say have a Dave Day, because Dave was always positive, even right to the very end.\"",
      "There are no superlatives in the English language that can describe the event, says Si. He was overwhelmed by the sense of fellowship and community, but \"there's a frustration in it as well that I just wish he'd been there\", he says.",
      "Si and Dave started their TV careers behind the camera - Si as an assistant director and Dave as a makeup artist. They turned their love of cooking, eating and riding their bikes into a successful cooking travelogue.",
      "\"We were very lucky that the BBC let two\u2026 hippies out on the Great British public,\" says Si.",
      "\"It was a wonderful opportunity for two relatively ordinary blokes to be in extraordinary circumstances, being a conduit of other people's stories from around the world,\" he adds.",
      "But typically with the hairy bikers, not everything always went to plan -  like the time they filmed the pilot episode of their show and were meant to fly off together in a glider - but couldn't get off the ground because they were too heavy. Or the time Si put chips on blue tissue paper to dry and it dyed them blue.",
      "Throughout their travels they wanted to shine a light on different cultures and the foods of that region. In Japan, the duo even tried their hand at sumo wrestling and Si remembers Dave had gone the extra mile to make sure he looked good in his loincloth.",
      "\"This is what he was like, right,\" says Si, \"He'd done his bikini line, I remember, and I went, 'You've done your\u2026 What! A born makeup artist.",
      "\"'No, it's got to look aesthetically pleasing,' Si remembers Dave saying.",
      "Growing up in the north \u2013 Dave in the north-west and Si in the north-east \u2013 they both came from working class backgrounds. Dave's mum was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) when he was young and Dave became a carer for her early on. He was just eight years old when he cooked his first meal for the family of cheese and potato pie.",
      "\"On top of all of that, during his adolescence, he had alopecia and I think the way that Dave approached his life was indicative of his childhood really,\" says Si. \"He wore those scars a little bit, of course he did, as everybody would, but it never stopped his enthusiasm for life though.\"",
      "The bikers' strong bond was even apparent on Dave's wedding day to his wife Lili.",
      "\"I mean [Lili] finds it funny, but I'm sure at the time she found it pretty irritating. Dave would always go, 'Kingy, come on man, get in man, we're having a photograph'. I'm going, 'Dude, it's your wedding day, I'm in every photograph. Lil's going to go mad when she sees them.' He was like, 'No, no, no, come in.'\"",
      "Si says he even spent Valentine's Day with the couple. Right from the very beginning, they were like \"two old slippers\" says Si, albeit that they were very different people. Dave was comedic and Si says he fell into the role of playing off Dave's daftness.",
      "One egg is never an oeuf - was just one of the jokes Si heard Dave repeat - over and over again. The similes were also never-ending, says Si.",
      "\"Oh, look at that, Kingy,\" Dave would say, \"It's lighter than a hummingbird's toenail clippings.\"",
      "Or \"the onion is now more transparent than a bank manager's smile\".",
      "But the Hairy Bikers' main mission was to empower people to get back into the kitchen and cook, says Si, as food is the glue that binds us together - something that has been made even harder today with the stress and time pressures facing working families trying to earn a living.",
      "\"I understood, as did Dave, the importance of actually sitting round a table when we were little, because that's what formed us as adults,\" says Si. \"And it was important, because you could see if your mum wasn't very well, or dad was a bit grumpy.\"",
      "A second Dave Day event has been planned for June 2025. But as for what the future holds for Si, he says if he worked on another cookery programme, it would have to be \"a marked change\" from the shows he created with Dave.",
      "Si says he knows his best mate would want him to continue to work on new projects, however.",
      "\"I think in the spirit of the bikers, Dave would want me to continue to have fun and to educate, to inform, to enlighten, to be slightly edgy,\" he says.",

      "End of an era as 'proud' Taylor Swift finishes tour",
      "Writing in her recently-published tour book, Swift said the 45-song, career-spanning setlist was inspired by the decision to re-record her first six albums, which made her fall \"back in love\" with her past work.",
      "She went on to play concerts in \"the pouring rain, in the blazing heat, in the thickest of humidity, in the wildest of winds and in the bitter cold,\" she wrote, even when she was \"sick or exhausted or injured,\" or working through a \"broken heart\".",
      "But the concerts were about more than the music. Fans swapped friendship bracelets and made lifelong friends with strangers. Outside the stadiums, ticketless Swifties gathered in car parks to sing along.",
      "At one show in Munich, 40,000 people congregated on a nearby hill just to catch a glimpse of the show, almost outnumbering the fans inside the city's former Olympic Stadium.",

      "The conclusion of the tour leaves Swift at a crossroads. This Eras Tour will be the yardstick against which the rest of her career will be measured - and her next move will be watched closely by fans and critics alike.",
      "So what options does she have?",
      "\"Taylor is a very future-minded thinker, so I imagine she has the next few years already completely planned out.\" says Bryan West, a dedicated Taylor Swift reporter for USA Today and The Tennessean, who has seen the Eras tour 89 times.",
      "Noting Swift's tendency to dovetail her projects, he thinks there will be some sort of \"news-making\" announcement at her final show.",
      "Most likely, this will be the reveal of Reputation (Taylor's Version) - the latest instalment of her re-recorded album series, complete with bonus tracks from the vault.",
      "That said, fans have been anticipating that announcement all year and the album is yet to materialise, despite numerous, tantalising hints it's on its way.",
      "West has some other theories, too.",
      "\"We've seen film crews at many of the gigs, so I'd not be shocked if she's been shooting a documentary this entire time.",
      "\"And in her new book, she said, 'See you next era', so there have been reports that she's working on new music.\"",
      "A longer term prospect is that Swift will pivot to film. In December 2022, she signed a deal to direct a film for Searchlight Pictures, based on her own original script.",
      "Making the announcement, Searchlight presidents David Greenbaum and Matthew Greenfield called her \"a once in a generation artist and storyteller\", but the trail has gone cold since then. Perhaps she'll return to the director's chair in 2025?",

      "\"We've heard a lot from Taylor - so it's healthy for us and it's healthy for her to step back and take some time away, so that she can fuel herself for whatever's next.\"",
      "Indeed, Swift has hinted she's tiring of the music industry grind.",
      "Clara Bow, a track from her latest album The Tortured Poets Department, is a barbed commentary on the industry's lust for new blood.",
      "Other songs find her daydreaming about wedding rings and \"pushin' strollers\" - so there's every possibility Swift will take a year off to focus on her romance with American football star Travis Kelce.",
      "\"She probably will take a break,\" says West, \"but she's not one that necessarily sits still. She's always creating. She's always coming up with new projects.\"",
      "If Swift does head back to the studio, singer-songwriter Self Esteem hopes she'll spend the cultural (and financial) capital she's built up over the last two years to do something unexpected.",
      "\"If I was her, I'd indulge myself in making music in all the different genres and styles I hadn't been able to explore because of branding and expectations,\" she says.",
      "\"And it sounds really worthy, but I can't wait until I have enough money to fund working class people who can't get access to music - so if I was her, I'd do that.\"",
      "(It's worth noting that Swift has a history of charitable giving, including donations to local foodbanks on every stop of the Eras tour).",
      "Whatever happens, a left-hand swerve makes sense; in her Eras Tour book, the star says she \"hates to do the same thing twice\".",
      "But for this weekend, Michelle just wants to savour the final moments of a one-off phenomenon.",
      "\"We love concerts in my family. I love the buzz of being in a whole crowd of people excited about the same thing,\" she says, \"but this feels different.",
      "\"I love how the tour has brought people all over the world together.",
      "\"It will certainly be interesting to see what her next move is,\" she adds, \"but I can't bring myself to speculate.",
      "\"I'll just wait and see - because, whatever she does next, Taylor and her team should be very proud of the joy that was brought to so many during the Eras Tour run.\""

    "title": "Puberty blockers: Can a drug trial solve one of medicine's most controversial debates?",
    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has pledged to determine the evidence - and establish whether the benefits outweigh any potential harms of prescribing puberty blockers to children questioning their gender",
    "story": [
      "It is among the most delicate and controversial challenges in modern medicine - how to determine whether the benefits of puberty blockers (or drugs that delay puberty) outweigh the potential harms.",
      "This question came to the fore in June 2023 when NHS England proposed that in the future, these drugs would only be prescribed to children questioning their gender as part of clinical research.",
      "Since then, a new government has arrived in Westminster and Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he is committed to \"setting up a clinical trial\" to establish the evidence on puberty blockers. The National Institute for Health and Care Research is expected to confirm soon that funding is in place for a trial.",
      "The dilemma that remains is, how will such a trial work?",
      "Eighteen months since the announcement there is still a lack of consensus around how the trial should be conducted. It will also need to be approved by a committee of experts who have to decide, among other things, whether what's being tested might cause undue physical or psychological harm.",
      "But there is a second unanswered question that some, but by no means all, scientists have that is more pressing than the first: is it right to perform this particular trial on children and young people at all?",
      "A rapid rise in referrals",
      "When the Gender and Identity Development Service (GIDS) was established at London's Tavistock Clinic in 1989, it was the only NHS specialist gender clinic for children in England, and those referred there were typically offered psychological and social support.",
      "Over the last 10 years, however, there has been a rapid increase in referrals - with the greatest increase being people registered female at birth. In a separate development, around the same time the approach of typically offering psychological and social support moved to one of onward referrals to services that prescribed hormone drugs, such as puberty blockers.",
      "Known scientifically as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, puberty blockers work on the brain to stop the rise in sex hormones - oestrogen and testosterone - that accompany puberty. For years, they were prescribed to young patients with gender dysphoria (those who feel their gender identity is different from their biological sex). But in March 2024, NHS England stopped the routine prescribing of puberty blockers to under 18s, as part of an overhaul of children's gender identity services.",
      "NHS England said in a policy statement: \"There is not enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness of PSH [puberty suppressing hormones] to make the treatment routinely available at this time.\"",
      "The ban was later tightened to apply to private clinics as well.",
      "In April 2024, a review of gender identity services for children and young people, led by Dr Hilary Cass, a past president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, published its final report, which called out the \"field of gender care\" for not taking a cautious and careful approach.",
      "She also reported that the change in practice at GIDS away from one primarily relying on psychological and social support was largely based on a single study that looked at the effect of medical interventions such as puberty blockers on a very narrowly defined group of children and there was a lack of follow up in the longer term.",
      "Elsewhere, some other countries were re-examining puberty blockers too. Scotland paused the use of them while Finland, Sweden, France, Norway, and Denmark have all re-evaluated their positions on medical intervention for under 18s - including puberty blockers - to differing degrees. In other places there is still support for the use of puberty blockers.",
      "In medicine, when there is genuine uncertainty as to whether the benefits of a treatment outweigh the harms - called equipoise - some ethicists argue there's a moral obligation to scientifically study such treatments. But there are some from across the debate who don't think there is equipoise in this case.",
      "The ethical dilemma at the heart of the trial",
      "The BBC has learned details about the arguments going on around the concept of a trial and how it could look. Some argue that there is already evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health, and that in light of this it would be unethical to perform a trial at all because this would mean some young people experiencing gender distress would not be given them.",
      "The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) has expressed their concern about the trial for this reason. They support the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgery. WPATH, who have faced increasing criticism of their guidelines from some clinicians, say that it is ethically problematic to make participation in a trial the only way to access a type of care that is \"evidence based, widely recognised as medically necessary, and often reported as lifesaving.\"",
      "Meanwhile other clinicians believe there is no good evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health at all. They also point to research that questions the negative impact that the drugs might have on brain development among teenagers, as well as evidence around the negative impact on bone density.",
      "Dr Louise Irvine is a GP and co-chair of the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender which says it is cautious about using medical pathways in gender dysphoric children. She says: \"Given that puberty blockers by definition disrupt a crucial natural phase of human development, the anticipated benefits must be tangible and significant to justify the risk to children.",
      "\"In pushing ahead with a puberty blockers trial, we are concerned that political interests are being prioritised over clinical, ethical and scientific concerns, and over the health and wellbeing of children.\"",
      "The NHS adult gender services holds data that tracks 9,000 young people from the youth service. Some argue that this should be scrutinised before any trial goes ahead as it could provide evidence on, among other things, the potential risks of taking puberty blockers.",
      "But there is a third view held by some others, including Gordon Guyatt, a professor at McMaster University in Canada, who points out that randomised trials are done in \"life-threatening stuff all the time\" where no-one can be sure of the long-term effects of a treatment. In his view it would be \"unethical not to do it\".",
      "\"With only low quality evidence, people's philosophies, their attitudes or their politics, will continue to dominate the discussion,\" he argues. \"If we do not generate better evidence, the destructive, polarised debate will continue.\"",
      "- Dr Cass found the existing research in the field was poor quality and that there was not a reliable enough evidence base to base clinical decisions on. Young people involved in many of the existing studies may have also had interventions including psychological support and other medical treatments and so it was not always possible to disentangle the effect of each different treatment.",
      "- When it comes to suppressing puberty by using drugs, the rationale for doing so \"remains unclear\", Dr Cass said.  One of the original reasons given was to allow time to think by delaying the onset of puberty. But the evidence suggests the vast majority who start on puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones - oestrogen or testosterone. It is not clear why but one theory, the Cass report suggests, is that puberty blockers may, in their own right, change the \"trajectory\" of gender identity development.",
      "- Clinicians \"are unable to determine with any certainty\" which young people \"will go on to have an enduring trans identity\", Dr Cass wrote. In other words, there's a lack of clarity about which young people might benefit in the long term and which may be harmed overall by the process.",
      "How the trial could look",
      "Recruitment for the trial is due to start in 2025, months later than originally anticipated. Young people will likely be referred after a full assessment by specialist clinicians. A lot is still to be determined, including how many participants there will be.",
      "Ultimately the scientists running the trials will need to establish whether people who get an intervention are better off than those who do not. In this case, do the puberty blocking drugs and their effect make the young people better off?",
      "\"Better off\" in this instance includes the extent to which a young person's mental health may be improved if they are happy with their body. Quality of life is determined by various factors including self-confidence and self-esteem. As well as getting the personal views from the young people and parents, the trial could measure actual real life changes, such as time spent in education and time spent with family and friends.",
      "But there are potential harms to study too, such as the possibility of reduced bone density. Some scientists suggest examining the impact on learning using a form of IQ test.",
      "Normal brain development is influenced by both puberty and chronological age, which usually act in tandem during adolescence. It's not clear how this is affected when puberty is suppressed. Brain scans are one way of understanding any effect.",
      "Some scientists believe it may be possible to simply randomly assign trial participants into two groups where one gets puberty blockers, the other gets a placebo and nobody is aware which group they're in.",
      "But others believe a placebo group is impossible. They say the placebo group would go through puberty, realise they weren't on puberty blockers and potentially drop out of the trial or even find other ways to obtain puberty blockers. Either scenario would reduce the validity of the results.",
      "Professor Gordon Guyatt and others have outlined a potential trial where the group of patients not receiving drugs would be made up entirely of children who are keen to socially transition, such as by changing how they dress and altering their name and pronouns. Researchers could then monitor the difference between the groups.",
      "A second possibility is that both trial groups are given puberty blockers but one group gets them after a delay, during which time they receive psychological and emotional support. This would help researchers determine, among other things, whether their gender-related distress subsides during that delay while receiving the support.",
      "Alongside this there would be a \"matched\" control group that doesn't take a placebo or puberty blockers, whether for health reasons or because they don't want to, that get similar tests and scans.",
      "Puberty occurs in stages when different bodily changes occur. A third proposal could involve a second group being given drugs at a later stage in puberty than the first.",
      "This would allow researchers to explore when the right time to give puberty blockers might be. For example, it would enable the researchers to see if starting the drugs early improves wellbeing by reducing gender-specific body changes. They would also be able to see whether starting the drugs earlier has a greater negative impact on bone density and brain development.",
      "Children referred to GIDS also experienced higher rates of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and autism compared to the general child population. Trial participants would continue to receive treatment related to these conditions but - so we know any differences in the results from the groups are down to the drug - they will need to be balanced for the above conditions.",
      "All these considerations demonstrate the complexity of trying to obtain evidence in this area that is reliable and definitive.",
      "What parents say",
      "Many parents are watching closely to see how it will play out. Annabel (not her real name) is one of them. She is part of the Bayswater Group, a collection of parents with children who are questioning their gender who say they are \"wary of medical solutions to gender dysphoria\". She began looking into puberty blockers when her own daughter began questioning her gender in her early teens, an option put on the table by GIDS.",
      "Ultimately her daughter decided not to take them. Annabel was not convinced there was enough evidence to show they were beneficial and she was unsure what it would mean for her daughter's long-term physical and psychological health.",
      "Today, she still has unanswered questions - including some further ones around the trial. \"A big concern for me is will this new trial, if it gets approval, give us the evidence that we want? Or will we end up with more weak data that Dr Cass said undermined decision making in this area?\"",
      "Natacha Kennedy, a lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London who researches transgender issues, has examined the results of a survey of 97 parents of young people with gender-related distress that took place following the puberty blockers ban. She believes that puberty blockers should be an option available for young people questioning their gender and that many will not accept being part of a placebo group in a trial.",
      "\"These parents are desperate and if [they] get to a trial and it turns out their child is not being given the actual puberty blockers, then there is no point in them being there,\" she says.",
      "\"There may be some parents who would\u2026 find another way [to obtain the drugs].\"",
      "Why these Israeli men volunteered to fight - but now refuse to return to Gaza",
      "'I spent 30 years as a therapist to killers - and no-one is born evil'",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Whatever trial format is settled on, more scrutiny will follow. And there will no doubt be fierce debate about the merits of the trial and what it can tell us, as many scientists around the world are watching to see what happens in the UK.",
      "But inevitably, there will be a long wait to fully understand the longer term effects on physical and mental health of those who take puberty blockers - and the long-term effects on those with gender-related distress who don't. Nor do we know how many people detransition, though the Cass report says, \"there is suggestion that numbers are increasing\".",
      "\"We really need to have long-term follow up,\" argues Annabel. \"Can a child possibly understand what that means to their fertility and a loss of sexual function and what that will mean for their future life?\"",
      "For now, she and the scores of parents, carers and young people, can only watch and wait for the trial to begin and for its verdict - and what that means for whether puberty blockers will be prescribed to children once again in the future.",

      "NHS experts have warned that services are overstretched trying to deal with unprecedented demand from patients wanting to try weight-loss drugs.",
      "How do Wegovy and Mounjaro work?",

      "People with cardiovascular disease who are classed as overweight, but not quite obese, can also be given the drug.",
      "Patients should follow a diet and physical activity programme, and the drug should be only prescribed for a maximum of two years, according to NHS guidelines.",
      "The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended that Mounjaro should also be offered to NHS patients in England from March 2025. This would be alongside advice on diet and exercise.",
      "As with Wegovy, it will initially only be available to obese patients who have a weight-related health condition and are under the care of a specialist.",

      "\"We've got to turn that around,\" she said. \"I think that the first step in turning things around is dealing with our capacity problems.\"",
      "But Mahmood admitted there could still be another overcrowding crisis despite the extra places, and that building more jails was not the only solution.",

      "Stormont assembly members have voted to continue Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trade arrangements for at least another four years.",
      "The process, known as the democratic consent motion, was first agreed between the UK and EU in the 2020 Withdrawal Agreement to give local politicians a say in the new post-Brexit trading rules.",
      "After a debate lasting six hours in the assembly, the motion passed by 48 to 36 votes.",
      "The arrangement, the Windsor Framework, was agreed between the UK and EU in 2023 and effectively keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods.",
      "The three unionist parties opposed extending the arrangements while Sinn F\u00e9in, Alliance and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) were among those who voted in favour.",
      "Controversially, unlike other votes at Stormont, there was no requirement for cross-community support for the motion. A simple majority was enough.",
      "The motion was tabled jointly by Sinn F\u00e9in, Alliance and the SDLP.",
      "The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and other unionist parties argued the vote created a democratic deficit as the concerns of unionists, who are in the minority at Stormont, could be ignored.",
      "The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Hilary Benn, said the vote at Stormont marked an \"important step forward\" for the Windsor Framework trading arrangements.",
      "\"This democratic safeguard has provided the elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland with a say over the trading arrangements that will apply over the next four years.",
      "\"I will now proceed as required by the law, including to commission an independent review.",
      "\"The government remains committed to implementing the Windsor Framework in good faith and protecting the UK internal market, in a way that offers stability and works for Northern Ireland, for businesses, and for traders.\"",
      "'A rigged vote'",
      "During the debate, Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly, of the DUP, said the vote \"tears asunder\" the cross-community principles of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.",
      "She said the Windsor Framework was \"causing serious issues\" which were \"ideological, constitutional and in relation to the practical trade implications\".",
      "\"What we are dealing with today leads directly from Boris's botched Brexit deal - and it isn't working,\" she added.",
      "Criticising the lack of a cross-community vote, she said: \"This is the first and only key decision that this house will be voting on that absolutely tears asunder the key values and principles that other parties in this chamber championed around the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.\"",
      "She added: \"It's only consensus and inclusion if it is a matter that is important to you, but not if it's a matter that's important to unionism. It is absolutely appalling.",
      "\"This quite frankly is a rigged vote.\"",
      "Sinn F\u00e9in assembly member Philip McGuigan said the Northern Ireland Protocol and subsequent agreements protected businesses from \"Brexit's worst excesses\".",

      "McGuigan, chair of Stormont's Windsor Framework democratic scrutiny committee, said the post-Brexit arrangements offered \"certainty and stability\".",

      "\"A rigged vote, which the European Union already know the outcome of,\" he told the assembly.",
      "Buckley said the NI Protocol had \"destabilised Northern Ireland's political landscape, fuelled division and shattered trust\" and the \"rigged nature of today's vote is evidence of that\".",
      "\"Never has there been a more clear example of a zombie assembly than today,\" he added.",
      "\"Members will vote on giving the authority for the EU parliament to take control of over 300 areas of law, allow them to decide the regulations by which our businesses and consumers will operate by.\"",
      "Assembly member Kellie Armstrong of the Alliance Party, which does not designate as either nationalist or unionist in the assembly, welcomed the vote, which will be decided by a simple majority.",
      "Her party leader Naomi Long said the Windsor Framework was \"the only game in town\".",
      "She told the assembly it was \"simply not possible to entirely square the circle of the challenges and contradictions posed by Brexit\".",
      "But she said that \"if we rebuild trust and apply creativity, I believe we can and must lessen the impact\".",
      "\"While the Windsor Framework is far from perfect, it clearly provides for that softer landing that we need,\" she said.",
      "Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) assembly member Steve Aiken said Northern Ireland's post-Brexit arrangements were not the \"best of both worlds\" which some had argued.",
      "\"We delude ourselves by pretending that we somehow are in a uniquely positive position,\" he said.",
      "Aiken added: \"An accumulation of changes are making us increasingly diverge from our largest market - our own nation.\"",

      "SDLP assembly member Matthew O'Toole, leader of the opposition in the assembly, said Northern Ireland's trade arrangements had offered some protection from the \"disaster\" of Brexit.",
      "He said leaving the European Union had \"fundamentally damaged the UK economy\" but that \"Northern Ireland has had some protections from Brexit\".",
      "O'Toole told the assembly there were \"challenges\" from the Northern Ireland Protocol which \"need to be worked on\".",
      "But he said the deal between the UK government and European Union was \"necessary because of Brexit, because of a hard Brexit chosen by people who did not have the interests of this place at heart\".",

However, there is no indication that is the case at the moment, the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said.",
      "Given the rapidly changing situation in Syria, there is an underlying risk that IS and al-Qaeda could try and profit from the confusion and expand their area of operations in northern Syria, he added.",
      "The Turkish government is opposed to the presence of SDF forces near its border because it considers the biggest militia in the alliance a terrorist organisation. It sees the YPG as an extension of the PKK rebel group fighting in Turkey.",
      "Turkish-backed rebel factions fighting under the banner of the Syrian National Army (SNA) and Turkish troops have seized stretches of territory along the border from the YPG and SDF in several offensives during the civil war.",
      "When the HTS-led rebels launched the lightning offensive that overthrew Assad, the SNA launched a separate assault on SDF-held areas north of the city of Aleppo. So far, they have pushed the SDF out of Tal Rifaat and Manbij, and Syrian Kurds fear that more of the areas they control will now come under attack.",

      "She added that the UK is not planning to deport people back to Syria as the situation in the country is too \"fluid\".",
      "\"Countries have to be safe and judged to be safe by our procedures before we could contemplate return,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Germany will tighten its law to make it easier to prosecute those helping to smuggle migrants to the UK, as part of a new plan agreed between the two countries.",
      "Facilitating people-smuggling is not technically illegal in Germany currently, if it is to a third country outside the EU - which, following Brexit, includes the UK.",
      "Under the new agreement, the Home Office says Germany has pledged to make the activity a clear criminal offence.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the \"ground-breaking\" agreement would help tackle the criminal gangs organising small boat crossings.",
      "The Conservatives said the plan did not \"go far enough\" and would not provide the deterrent necessary to reduce crossings.",
      "Earlier this year, a five-month long BBC investigation exposed the significant German connection to small boat crossings in the Channel, with people-smugglers operating in the west German city of Essen.",
      "The new joint UK-German agreement comes as the Home Office's own Border Security Command warns that Channel crossings \"are the most dangerous they have ever been\".",
      "Charlie Eastaugh, director of international operations at the command, told the BBC: \"We've seen tyre inner tubes being used in place of life jackets, it's extraordinarily dangerous, they are death traps.",
      "How many people cross the Channel in small boats?",
      "Ministers know they have to tackle small boat crossings",
      "\u2018Death trap\u2019 Channel boats traded by smugglers in German city - BBC undercover",
      "\"There are fewer boats and fewer engines in supply, we have seized over 450 boats and engines across Europe - and organised crime gangs are taking greater risks.",
      "\"We're seeing increased numbers in these boats because of the disruptive work we have carried out with our law enforcement partners in Europe.\"",
      "Miguel Berger, the German ambassador to the UK, said it was already effectively illegal to smuggle people towards the UK as they would have to go through an EU country like France or Belgium.",
      "\"If we also cooperate in the countries of transit and origin, I think we can jointly put a lot of pressure on these criminal networks,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday.",
      "More than 33,000 have crossed the English Channel by small boat this year, which is higher than the 29,000 last year, but below the record numbers in 2022.",
      "More than 70 people have died trying to make the crossing this year this year, and the average number of people per boat has risen to 53 compared with 10 back in 2019.",
      "After coming into power in July, the Labour government ditched the previous Conservative government's plan to deter crossings by sending to Rwanda those making the journey.",
      "Instead Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said his government would focus on tackling the criminal gangs arranging the crossings.",
      "As part of that approach, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has signed an agreement with Germany's Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, committing to co-operation on tackling people smuggling.",
      "The Joint Action Plan includes Germany's intention to make clear that activities facilitating migrant-smuggling to the UK will be deemed criminal offences.",
      "It also commits both countries to \"exchanging expertise with a special focus on removing migrant-smuggling content from social media platforms\".",
      "The UK government said: \"Once enacted, this anticipated law change is expected to significantly increase the number of prosecutions made in relation to migrant smuggling.\"",
      "In October, the BBC uncovered the activities of small boat smugglers based in Germany, including how they used multiple secret warehouses to evade the German police.",
      "At the time, one UK Home Office source told the BBC there was \"frustration\" about Germany's legal framework, which did not technically consider the arranging of  people smuggling to countries outside of the EU to be illegal.",
      "Speaking on Monday, Cooper said the partnership would help the UK go after the gangs who had been \"getting away with it for too long\".",
      "Faeser said it would \"help us end the inhumane activities of criminal migrant smuggling organisations\".",
      "\"Many of these crimes are planned in Germany. Together, we are now countering this unscrupulous business with even more resolve.\"",
      "Responding to the announcement, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: \"The British public deserves a serious plan to control our borders and stop criminal gangs.",
      "\"The National Crime Agency has said a deterrent is necessary to reduce the number of crossings, yet Labour scrapped the only deterrent before it even got started.",
      "\"Meanwhile the numbers of illegal immigrants coming here continue to climb, with an 18% increase compared to the same period last year, with more than 20,000 people having made the crossing since the election.\"",
      "The plan was signed ahead of a meeting of the Calais Group in London on Tuesday, a grouping of northern European countries focused on tackling illegal migration.",
      "Cooper was joined by ministers and police from Germany, as well as from France, Belgium and the Netherlands, to discuss migration in Europe.",
      "Sir Keir has said he wants to reduce both regular and irregular migration but has avoided setting a target for cutting numbers, arguing that an \"arbitrary\" cap would not work.",
      "Privately, Labour ministers acknowledged that tackling irregular migration would be key to how they are judged by voters.",

      "After all, Labour figures acknowledge they were nowhere near as ready for government as they needed to be. That was in part the reason for the rapid departure of Sue Gray, Sir Keir\u2019s initial chief of staff, after just three months in post.",
      "Certainly even among those civil servants who are alive to Whitehall\u2019s systemic flaws there is a view that the prime minister himself needs to be much more active in driving the machine if he wants to achieve results.",

      "As well as setting up a child poverty taskforce, Sir Keir has formed a series of \u2018mission boards\u2019 designed to drive through his agenda in each of those five core areas.",
      "Each is chaired by the relevant minister - for example, the health mission board is chaired by Wes Streeting, the health secretary.",

      "Those around Starmer acknowledge that the mission boards are not yet quite at full strength. They will soon become more public-facing entities, holding meetings outside of London and doing more to bring in expertise from outside government.",
      "Stocktaking",
      "But the principal way in which the prime minister will seek to drive his agenda is via \u201cstock takes\u201d. These are meetings where Sir Keir brings those responsible for each mission into Downing Street to hold them accountable for what the data is showing in their area and asking them how they propose to improve. It\u2019s an idea which was pioneered by Sir Tony Blair on the advice of Michael Barber, his delivery adviser, who recently returned to government.",
      "The frequency of these stocktakes will soon increase, a senior government source said, adding: \u201cIf we are saying that this is the mission of the government and this is how people should judge its success and failure then it is clearly something you need the PM driving through.\u201d",
      "In the next few weeks Pat McFadden, the cabinet minister helping the prime minister to coordinate policy across Whitehall, will give a speech with more detail on the government\u2019s plans for civil service reform.",
      "Both he and Sir Keir are said to be seized of the need to bring more outside expertise into government and to make better use of data and artificial intelligence.",
      "The government\u2019s stated aims here are bold. Announcing the appointment of Sir Chris Wormald this week as the new cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, Sir Keir charged him with \u201cnothing less than the complete re-wiring of the British state\u201d.",
      "There was no shortage of people in Whitehall questioning whether the longest-serving head of a government department  - Sir Chris has run the health department for eight years and education for four before that  - is the right person to transform Whitehall. Sir Chris's supporters say that within the current system he is one of those most open to reform.",
      "The appointment was received with open contempt by Cummings, who sarcastically described it as a \u201ctruly beautiful, artistic\u201d decision which should serve as a \u201cwake up call\u201d that \u201cthe Westminster system is totally determined to resist any change\u201d.",

      "The six milestones are ways to measure the five missions he set out in February 2023.",
      "The missions \u2013 like building an NHS fit for the future \u2013 are meant to be the driving purpose for the government. These are what civil servants have been ordered to prioritise.",
      "All of this is built upon three foundations - economic stability, secure borders and national security, according to Sir Keir.",
      "95% clean power by 2030",
      "The prime minister said being \u201con track\u201d for 95% clean power by 2030 was one of his milestones.",
      "But before and during the election, Labour constantly spoke about \u201czero carbon electricity by 2030\u201d - and this was what the party's manifesto promised.",
      "Sir Keir denied he was rowing back on 100% zero carbon, telling reporters that the \"clean energy pledge is today exactly what it was in the election\" and \"there was always going to be a mix [of energy sources]\".",
      "Is he right?",
      "The 95% clean power figure follows advice from the National Energy Systems Operator (NESO), which recently said a clean power system is one where demand is met by \u201cmainly renewables, with gas-fired generation used rarely to ensure security of supply\u201d.",

      "A humpback whale has made one of the longest and most unusual migrations ever recorded, possibly driven by climate change, scientists say.",
      "It was seen in the Pacific Ocean off Colombia in 2017, then popped up several years later near Zanzibar in the Indian Ocean - a distance of at least 13,000 km.",
      "The experts think this epic journey might be down to climate change depleting food  stocks or perhaps an odyssey to find a mate.",
      "Ekaterina Kalashnikova of the Tanzania Cetaceans Program said the feat was \"truly impressive and unusual even for this highly migratory species\".",
      "The photograph below shows the same whale photographed in 2022, off the Zanzibar coast.",
      "Dr Kalashnikova said it was very likely the longest distance a humpback whale had ever been recorded travelling.",
      "Humpback whales live in all oceans around the world. They travel long distances every year and have one of the longest migrations of any mammal, swimming from tropical breeding grounds to feeding grounds in cooler waters.",
      "But this male's journey was even more spectacular, involving two distant breeding grounds.",
      "One theory is that climate change is altering the abundance of the tiny shrimplike krill humpback whales feed on, forcing them to travel further in search of food.",
      "Alternatively, whales may be exploring new breeding grounds as populations rebound through global conservation efforts.",
      "\"While actual reasons are unknown, amongst the drivers there might be global changes in the climate, extreme environmental events (that are more frequent nowadays), and evolutionary mechanisms of the species,\" said Dr Kalashnikova.",
      "The wandering male was among a group of humpbacks photographed from a research vessel on the Pacific coast of Colombia in 2013.",
      "He was then identified in a similar area in 2017 - and off Zanzibar in 2022.",

      "The plan had been to send astronauts around the Moon but not land in September 2025. The date had already slipped once before, from November of this year.",

      "Mr Nelson told a news conference that \"the safety of our astronauts is our North Star\".",
      "\"We do not fly until we are ready. We need to do the next test flight, and we need to do it right. And that's how the Artemis programme proceeds.\"",
      "Mr Nelson said that engineers had got to the root of the problem and believed that it could be fixed by changing the trajectory of the capsule's re-entry \u2013 but it would take time to carry out a thorough assessment.",
      "Nasa is in a race with the Chinese space agency, which has its own plans to send astronauts to the Moon. Mr Nelson said he was confident that the Artemis programme would reach the lunar surface first, but he called on Nasa's commercial and international partners to \"double down to meet and improve this schedule\".",

      "For about two months each year, fisherman Faustino Mauloko da Cunha transforms his home along the South Pacific coast into a whale monitoring station.",
      "From the morning, villagers and student volunteers gather at the house in Subaun,  a village in the north of Timor-Leste. Armed with binoculars and telephoto cameras, they watch the cobalt waters for one of its great treasures - pygmy blue whales.",
      "When there is a sighting, it\u2019s all systems go.",
      "Faustino's son, Zacarias, dispatches a drone. Then the team\u2019s leader, Australian marine ecologist Karen Edyvane, guides him to take the best photographs. When the drone returns, the team reviews the pictures, taking notes on a white board.",
      "It's a small and thrifty operation in Timor-Leste, which is part of an archipelago that lies between South East Asia and the South Pacific. But it has generated a wealth of information about pygmy blue whales - one of the largest animals on earth, whose vast habitats and elusive nature make them challenging to study.",
      "These citizen science researchers, all of them locals, have spotted nearly 3,000 pygmy blue whales over the past 10 years - Prof Edyvane considers that a \u201ctruly extraordinary\u201d number.",
      "Timor-Leste has one of the world\u2019s highest concentrations of marine mammals.",
      "During the migration season - October and November - hundreds of pygmy blue whales pass through the country\u2019s waters as they make the epic journey spanning thousands of kilometres from the Banda Sea, which lies to the north of Timor-Leste, to southern Australia.",
      "But the area has been under-researched, says Prof Edyvane, who started the citizen science monitoring programme in 2014.",
      "During the last two whale seasons, she has based herself in Subaun, about 50km (31 miles) from the capital Dili, working with fishermen, students and dive tour operators to document the cetaceans.",
      "They have documented \"some of the lesser known, intimate reproductive behaviours of blue whales, some for the very first time,\" says Prof Edyvane, a researcher at Charles Darwin University and Australian National University.",
      "In 2022, for instance, tourists with a local tour operator invovlved in the programme captured underwater footage of a mother nursing her calf, offering a glimpse into the species\u2019 reproductive behaviours, which have remained largely unknown.",
      "\"It\u2019s very, very exciting,\u201d she adds.",
      "The programme, which is supported by the Ministry of Tourism and Environment,  started as a Facebook group, inviting local tour operators, fishermen and residents to share sightings of cetaceans.",
      "Prof Edyvane trained them on surveying methods and taught them how to use telephoto cameras and drones so that they could conduct aerial and boat surveys.",
      "\u201cWhen locals see the whales swimming by, they will post pictures on Facebook and WhatsApp. Updates come on a real-time basis and when someone shares something, everyone gets very excited,\u201d Prof Edyvane says.",
      "In 2016, the team worked with a dive tour operator to launch the first whale-watching tour.",
      "It was only last year that they set up a \u201cresearch station\u201d outside the da Cunha\u2019s village home - photos show a simple hut overlooking the bay. Outside are two tables, plastic chairs and white boards mounted on the hut's walls.",
      "During this year's whale season, undergraduates from the National University of East Timor and University Oriental Timor-Leste gathered at the research station to help with the sightings.",
      "Even such a basic structure has made the task easier.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re able to monitor all day and all night,\" Prof Edyvane says. \"We\u2019ve also been able to get the most incredible footage. The whales come in so close sometimes we can actually hear their blows.\"",
      "Citizen researchers like these have become powerful eyes and ears on the ground for marine scientists, says wildlife scientist Vanessa Pirotta.",
      "\u201cThe combination of people having access to tools like drones and social media means we have insights into things that are happening while we may be behind the desk writing grants to fund our work,\u201d she said.",
      "The increase in research activity in Subaun has also led to a rise in tourism.",
      "The demand for whale-watching tours has increased, diving instructor Cassio Schumacher tells the BBC, adding that these tours are \u201cbooked up years in advance\u201d.",
      "Local non-profits have warned of the risks of unregulated whale tourism and the government has said it intends to use Prof Edyvane's research  to \u201cfully protect and conserve\" the marine life that pass through Timor-Leste\u2019s waters.",
      "Prof Edyvane believes that with regulation, whale tourism has the potential to create jobs and grow Timor-Leste\u2019s economy.",
      "The country is one of the poorest in the world, where average annual incomes in cities hover around $1,500, according to the International Monetary Fund. In Subaun, most villagers work as subsistence fishermen and farmers, earning just about $600 to $900 a year.",
      "The da Cunha family has now started preparing meals from local produce and the day\u2019s catch for the students and tourists - an additional source of income.",
      "\u201cWe enjoyed having the guests around and will love to do it again,\" Faustino, 51, tells the BBC on a WhatsApp video call.  \"We will make it a better experience [next season].\"",
      "His son, Zacarias, has also been contracted to provide drone services for the project. Prof Edyvane says she plans to train him to give talks about whales in English.",

      "Google says its new quantum chip, dubbed \"Willow\", incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer.\"",
      "However experts say Willow is, for now, a largely experimental device, meaning a quantum computer powerful enough to solve a wide range of real-world problems is still years - and billions of dollars - away.",
      "The quantum quandary",
      "Quantum computers work in a fundamentally different way to the computer in your phone or laptop.",
      "They harness quantum mechanics - the strange behaviour of ultra-tiny particles - to crack problems far faster than traditional computers.",
      "It's hoped quantum computers might eventually be able to use that ability to vastly speed up complex processes, such as creating new medicines.",
      "There are also fears it could be used for ill -  for example to break some types of encryption used to protect sensitive data.",
      "In February Apple announced that the encryption that protects iMessage chats is being made \"quantum proof\" to stop them being read by powerful future quantum computers.",
      "Hartmut Neven leads Google's Quantum AI lab that created Willow and describes himself as the project's \"chief optimist.\"",
      "He told the BBC that Willow would be used in some practical applications - but declined, for now, to provide more detail.",
      "But a chip able to perform commercial applications would not appear before the end of the decade, he said.",
      "Initially these applications would be the simulation of systems where quantum effects are important",
      "\"For example, relevant when it comes to the design of nuclear fusion reactors to understand the functioning of drugs and pharmaceutical development, it would be relevant for developing better car batteries and another long list of such tasks\".",
      "What is quantum computing?",
      "Apples and oranges",
      "Mr Neven told the BBC Willow's performance meant it was the \"best quantum processor built to date\".",
      "But Professor Alan Woodward, a computing expert at Surrey University, says quantum computers will be better at a range of tasks than current \"classical\" computers, but they will not replace them.",
      "He warns against overstating the importance of Willow's achievement in a single test.",
      "\"One has to be careful not to compare apples and oranges\" he told the BBC.",
      "Google had chosen a problem to use as a benchmark of performance that was, \"tailor-made for a quantum computer\" and this didn't demonstrate \"a universal speeding up when compared to classical computers\".",
      "Nonetheless, he said Willow represented significant progress, in particular in what's known as error correction.",
      "In very simple terms the more useful a quantum computer is, the more qubits it has.",
      "However a major problem with the technology is that it is prone to errors - a tendency that has previously increased the more qubits a chip has.",
      "But Google researchers say they have reversed this and managed to engineer and program the new chip so the error rate fell across the whole system as the number of qubits increased.",
      "It was a major \"breakthrough\" that cracked a key challenge that the field had pursued \"for almost 30 years\", Mr Neven believes.",
      "He told the BBC it was comparable to \"if you had an airplane with just one engine -  that will work, but two engines are safer, four engines is yet safer\".",
      "Errors are a significant obstacle in creating more powerful quantum computers and the development was \"encouraging for everyone striving to build a practical quantum computer\" Prof Woodward said.",
      "But Google itself notes that to develop practically useful quantum computers the error rate will still need to go much lower than that displayed by Willow.",
      "Willow was made in Google's new, purpose-built manufacturing plant in California.",
      "Countries around the world are investing in quantum computing.",
      "The UK recently launched the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC).",
      "Its director, Michael Cuthbert, told the BBC he was wary of language that fuelled the \"hype cycle\" and thought Willow was more a \"milestone rather than a breakthrough\".",
      "Nevertheless, it was \"clearly a highly impressive piece of work\".",
      "Eventually quantum computers would help with a range of tasks including \"logistics problems such as cargo freight distribution on aircraft or routing of telecoms signals or stored energy throughout the national grid\", he said.",
      "And there were already 50 quantum businesses in the UK, attracting \u00a3800m in funding and employing 1300 people.",
      "On Friday, researchers from Oxford University and Osaka University in Japan published a paper showcasing the very low error rate in a trapped-ion qubit.",
      "Theirs is a different approach to making a quantum computer that's capable of working at room temperature - whereas Google's chip has to be stored at ultra low temperatures to be effective.",
      "Scientific findings from Google's development of Willow have been published in the journal Nature",

      "The deadline would see TikTok effectively banned in the US from 19 January 2025.",
      "In Monday's request for an emergency injunction, TikTok's lawyers argued the law would \"inflict extreme and irreparable harm\" on the company - adding it would do so \"on the eve of a presidential inauguration\".",
      "President-elect Donald Trump will take office as the country's 47th president on 20 January.",
      "He has previously claimed he would \"save TikTok\" from a ban.",
      "Ahead of the run-up to the November election, Trump said the law would benefit Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.",
      "But experts have warned that while his promises may offer a lifeline for the company's US future, they are no guarantee of the action he will take once in office.",
      "DOJ officials said in their letter also filed on Monday that the appeals court should reject the injunction request.",

      "A humpback whale has made one of the longest and most unusual migrations ever recorded, possibly driven by climate change, scientists say.",
      "It was seen in the Pacific Ocean off Colombia in 2017, then popped up several years later near Zanzibar in the Indian Ocean - a distance of at least 13,000 km.",
      "The experts think this epic journey might be down to climate change depleting food  stocks or perhaps an odyssey to find a mate.",
      "Ekaterina Kalashnikova of the Tanzania Cetaceans Program said the feat was \"truly impressive and unusual even for this highly migratory species\".",
      "The photograph below shows the same whale photographed in 2022, off the Zanzibar coast.",
      "Dr Kalashnikova said it was very likely the longest distance a humpback whale had ever been recorded travelling.",
      "Humpback whales live in all oceans around the world. They travel long distances every year and have one of the longest migrations of any mammal, swimming from tropical breeding grounds to feeding grounds in cooler waters.",
      "But this male's journey was even more spectacular, involving two distant breeding grounds.",
      "One theory is that climate change is altering the abundance of the tiny shrimplike krill humpback whales feed on, forcing them to travel further in search of food.",
      "Alternatively, whales may be exploring new breeding grounds as populations rebound through global conservation efforts.",
      "\"While actual reasons are unknown, amongst the drivers there might be global changes in the climate, extreme environmental events (that are more frequent nowadays), and evolutionary mechanisms of the species,\" said Dr Kalashnikova.",
      "The wandering male was among a group of humpbacks photographed from a research vessel on the Pacific coast of Colombia in 2013.",
      "He was then identified in a similar area in 2017 - and off Zanzibar in 2022.",
      "The sightings are separated by a 13,046 km great-circle distance - the minimum distance for the route the whale might have taken, the scientists say, though it is likely to be much greater.",
      "Since the earth is a sphere, the shortest path between two points is expressed by the great circle distance, which corresponds to an arc linking two points on a sphere.",

      "\"There are still risks in Syria in terms of both security and daily life. An internationally recognised government must take office in Damascus,\" he told the BBC.",

      "\"It's not easy to tell how the groups that come to power will behave, and Syrians will naturally expect to see that,\" he says.",

      "The United Nations estimates that 90% of the population inside Syria is now living below the poverty line.",
      "\"It may take hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild these devastated cities. Which country will provide the resources?\" Mr Erdogan says. \"The deep poverty and the collapse of infrastructure in Syria are likely to continue for a long time. These are not problems that will be easily fixed in the short term.\"",
      "Metin Corabatir warns also of the risk of unexploded bombs and mines when refugees head home: \"They also need to find out in advance what condition their homes are in the destroyed cities.\"",
      "\"We are talking about millions of people. The fact that they left their homes, reached Syria and settled there; all of this is greatly underestimated.\"",

      "In the end the Assad regime was so hollow, corrupt and decayed that it collapsed in less than a fortnight.",
      "No one I have spoken to has been anything other than astonished by the speed with which the regime turned to dust.",
      "In the spring of 2011, the year of the Arab uprisings, it was different, when Syrians tried to grab some of the revolutionary magic that had swept away the presidents of Tunisia and Egypt and was threatening the veteran strongmen of Libya and Yemen.",
      "By 2011, the regime created by Hafez al-Assad and passed to his son Bashar on his death in 2000 was already corrupt and decadent.",
      "But the system that Hafez built still had much of the brutal, ruthless strength that he believed was necessary to control Syria. Assad senior had seized power in a country that was prone to coups and delivered it to his son and heir without a significant challenge.",
      "Bashar al-Assad went back to his father's playbook in 2011.",
      "It is hard to imagine now, but back then he had more legitimacy among some of Syria's population than the old dictators swept away by crowds chanting the slogan of that year - \"The people want the fall of the regime\".",
      "Bashar al-Assad was a vocal supporter of the Palestinians and of Hezbollah during its successful fight against Israel in the 2006 Lebanon war. He was younger than the ex and soon to be former Arab leaders.",
      "Since his father's death he had been promising reform. Some Syrians still wanted to believe him in 2011, hoping demonstrations were the spur he needed for the change that he had promised, until he ordered his men to shoot peaceful demonstrators dead in the streets.",
      "A British ambassador in Syria once told me that the way to understand the Assad regime was to watch Mafia films like The Godfather. The obedient could be rewarded.",
      "Anyone who went against the head of the family or his closest lieutenants would be eliminated. In Syria's case that could mean the gallows, or a firing squad, or indefinite incarceration in some underground cell.",

      "The weakness of the regime, to the point that it collapsed like a soggy paper bag, was disguised by the fearsome and repressive gulag it still maintained.",
      "The international consensus was that Bashar al-Assad was weak, dependent on Russia and Iran, and presiding over a country he had fractured to preserve his family's rule \u2013 but still strong enough to be regarded as a fact of Middle Eastern life, who could even be useful.",
      "In the last days before rebels burst out of Idlib, it was widely reported that the US, Israel and the United Arab Emirates were trying to detach Assad's Syria from Iran.",
      "Israel had been launching increasingly heavy airstrikes against targets inside Syria it said were part of the supply chain Iran used to get weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon.",
      "Israel's offensive in Lebanon had dealt severe blows to Hezbollah, but the idea was to stop it regenerating. At the same time the UAE and the US were trying to find incentives for him to break the alliance with Tehran, relaxing sanctions and allowing Assad to continue his international rehabilitation.",
      "Both Benjamin Netanyahu and Joe Biden have claimed credit for the fall of the Assad regime. There is something in that.",
      "The damage Israel inflicted on Hezbollah and Iran with US weapons and constant support, and Biden's supply of arms for Ukraine, made it impossible, even undesirable, for Assad's closest allies to save him.",
      "But the fact that they saw Assad as part of their strategy to contain and damage Iran until days before his fall indicates clearly that they did not for a moment believe him to be days away from a midnight flit to Russia.",
      "They did contribute to his end, more by accident than design.",
      "The fall of the regime might have ended Iran's supply chain, if Syria's new rulers decide their deals with others are more useful than the Iranian alliance.",
      "All sides are thinking hard and thinking again about what comes next, and it is too soon to draw definite conclusions. Syrians, their neighbours, and the wider world are now confronted by another geopolitical earthquake, the biggest of the series that has followed the Hamas attacks on Israel in October last year. It might not be the last.",
      "Iran is seeing the final collapse of the main planks of the network it called the axis of resistance. Its most important components have been transformed; Hezbollah badly damaged and the Assad regime gone.",
      "Iran's rulers might want to follow up on hints of talks on a deal with Donald Trump once he takes office. Or its new strategic nakedness might push it into a fateful decision to turn its highly enriched uranium into a nuclear weapon.",
      "Syrians have every reason to rejoice. In the years after 2011, for all the repression and brutality of the regime, Assad and his acolytes could still find men who would fight. Many of the troops I met on front lines told me that Assad was a better option than the jihadist extremists of Islamic State group.",
      "In 2024, faced by a well-organised rebel force that insisted it was nationalist, Islamist but no longer jihadist, the army's reluctant conscripts refused to fight, stripped off their uniforms and went home.",
      "The best scenario is that Syrians, helped by the big players in the region, will find a way to create a postwar mood of national reconciliation, not a wave of looting and revenge that will drag the country into a new war. Abu Mohammad al Joulani, the leader of victorious HTS, has called for his men and all of Syria's sects to respect each other.",
      "His men have removed the regime, and he is the closest Syria has to a de facto leader.",
      "Syria, though, has dozens of armed groups that do not necessarily agree with him and will want to grab power in their own areas. In southern Syria, tribal militias did not recognise the writ of the Assads. They will not follow orders they don't like from the new set up in Damascus.",
      "In the eastern desert, the US saw a big enough threat from remnants of the Islamic State group to launch waves of air strikes. The Israelis, alarmed by the prospect of an Islamist state on their border, are pounding the military infrastructure of Syria's armed forces.",
      "It might be better to find a way to make a reformed Syrian Arab Army part of the solution in a country without much law or order. The reckless decision by the US in 2003 to dissolve the Iraqi armed forces had disastrous consequences.",
      "In Turkey, President Erdogan must be satisfied by what he sees.",
      "Erdogan's Turkey did more than any other power to preserve the autonomy of Idlib province, where HTS was transforming itself into a fighting force when Syria seemed to be in the deep freeze.",
      "Erdogan might see his influence lapping Israel's borders, at a time when Israel-Turkey relations have been poisoned by the war in Gaza.",
      "The worst scenario for Syrians is that their country will follow the example of two Arab dictatorships that spun into violent chaos after the fall of their regimes.",
      "Colonel Gaddafi of Libya and Saddam Hussein of Iraq were removed without a ready-made replacement waiting in the wings. Ill-considered foreign intervention did much to create two catastrophes.",
      "The vacuum left by the dictators was filled by waves of looting, revenge, power grabs and civil war.",
      "Syrians have not been in charge of their own destiny for generations. Individuals were robbed of it by the two Assad presidents and their followers. The country lost it after war left it so weakened that bigger foreign powers used it to increase and preserve their own power.",
      "Syrians still do not have agency over their lives. They might have a chance of creating a new and better country if they did.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 06:01:14 GMT",
    "summary": "The woman at the centre of the mass rape case sees her public trial as a chance to \"stand for all victims\".",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains descriptions of alleged sexual offences.",
      "There was a moment, a few weeks into the trial, when Gis\u00e8le Pelicot decided it was time to remove her sunglasses.",
      "It wasn't just an acknowledgment of the fading autumn sunshine in the medieval southern French city of Avignon. It was also an indication that she'd passed a milestone \u2013 one of many that have marked her slow, painful journey from serene grandmother, to anguished and shame-haunted rape victim, to fearful courtroom witness, to global icon of courage and defiance.",
      "\"She had these sunglasses she used to hide her eyes\u2026 to protect her intimacy,\" said St\u00e9phane Babonneau, the youthful criminal lawyer who for two years has guided Mrs Pelicot through the case against her ex-husband, Dominique, and fifty other men now on trial for allegedly raping her.",
      "\"But there was a point when she felt she no longer needed to protect herself. She didn't need [the glasses],\" Mr Babonneau explained, seizing on that moment as a way to illustrate the slow transformation of a \"sincere\u2026 very humble person\", who had begun the trial \"extremely worried\", shocked by the blaze of publicity, and still feeling \"very ashamed of what had happened to her\".",
      "Over the course of the trial, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, 72, has said almost nothing about her ordeal, beyond the occasional and brief comment to supporters gathered in Avignon's Palais de Justice.",
      "But Mr Babonneau, speaking now with his client's blessing, has begun giving us insights into the way she's handled herself in court, and the way she has slowly and methodically sought to rebuild her life and, to a limited extent, her peace of mind.",
      "Another moment - and milestone - sticks out.",
      "It was earlier this year, in May. Mr Babonneau and his colleague Antoine Camus had been trawling through some of the 20,000 grotesquely explicit videos and photographs that police discovered back in 2020 on Dominique Pelicot's computer hard drive.",
      "A grim task. The videos were \"absolutely disgusting,\" said Mr Babonneau. But it was the audio that was almost more shocking.",
      "\"It's possible to hear Mrs Pelicot snoring\u2026 to hear her breathing. It's even more disturbing to listen to her choking when some of the men are abusing her. The sound was very important [evidence].\"",
      "Mr Babonneau knew that without those videos, \"most likely there would have been no trial, no case\".",
      "Mrs Pelicot understood that too, but could easily and understandably have decided, for her own sanity, to avoid watching any of the footage herself.",
      "Instead, Mr Babonneau remembers, she simply announced one day: \"I'm ready now.\"",
      "So, she sat down beside the two men, in their office, as they introduced a carefully selected portion of each video, explaining who the men were, and what she would be seeing them do to her. Then Mr Babonneau pressed play and images of the Pelicots' bedroom, in their bungalow in the village Mazan, flashed up on the screen.",
      "Gis\u00e8le remained still, watching intently.",
      "\"How could he?\" she eventually asked, in her quiet voice. It was a phrase she would keep repeating over the coming days.",
      "Then a little later, she noted the date on one of the videos.",
      "\"That was my birthday evening.\"",
      "\"That happened in [my] daughter's bed. In her beach house.\"",
      "Mr Babonneau remembers Mrs Pelicot's sustained indignation, but noted too that she never cried, and that with the help of experts, she'd managed \"to put an impressive distance between what she was seeing and her mental health.\"",
      "The lawyers saw this moment as a \"final test\" that showed their client had regained \"some kind of equilibrium\" in the four years since 4 November 2020, when she'd been informed about her husband's actions and \"her world was destroyed.\"",
      "She was now ready to face the rigours of a public trial.",
      "Mrs Pelicot had wanted to watch the footage in order to understand who all these men were, and to help fill in the gaps in her memory, caused by the years of being drugged by her husband.",
      "\"She has entire pieces of her existence that don't exist in her mind,\" explained Mr Babonneau.",
      "The same practical concerns first shaped her decision to opt for a public trial, and to push for the videos to be shown in open court.",
      "She was beyond angry, for sure. But at that stage she wasn't looking to change the world. She was simply nervous about the idea of spending months inside a closed courtroom packed with dozens of her abusers. A public trial would, she thought, feel less intimidating.",
      "The first day of the trial was still traumatic. Sunglasses on, Mrs Pelicot was revealing herself in public for the very first time. And it got worse. Walking beside her up the steps towards the courthouse, Mr Babonneau noticed and recognised some of the accused men, in masks.",
      "But Mrs Pelicot only slowly became aware that she was now surrounded by them, elbows bumping as they jostled to get through the same security barriers.",
      "\"It was stressful for her. She was surprised how casual everything seemed to be,\" recalled Mr Babonneau.",
      "And then came the moment \u2013 the first in four years \u2013 when Gis\u00e8le and Dominique Pelicot's eyes met across the crowded courtroom. Their chairs were arranged as if to make such contact unavoidable.",
      "\"I saw sometimes that they exchanged looks,\" Mr Babonneau noted. Gis\u00e8le had spoken repeatedly to her team of her concern about how she might react in that first encounter.",
      "In stifled sobs and fierce accusations, family falls apart at mass rape trial",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot condemns rape accused and says French society must change",
      "Women moved by defiant Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in France mass rape trial",
      "We know now, of course, that while giving evidence in court Dominique Pelicot confessed to everything and that he begged his family for forgiveness. We also know that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot has not forgiven him.",
      "\"For sure, no. She cannot forgive him,\" said Mr Babonneau.",
      "And yet, the couple were once deeply in love. They were married for fifty years. And in the courtroom, Mr Babonneau could tell, the former couple were not able to ignore their shared past entirely. So, what did the lawyer see in those glances they exchanged?",
      "It was like they were saying \"look at us,\" said Mr Babonneau.",
      "He felt they were communicating to each other a shared sense of disbelief. Almost as if they were, briefly, spectators watching the agonies of two strangers.",
      "\"How did we end up here?\"",
      "During the trial, defence lawyers for various accused men tried to suggest that Gis\u00e8le's composure, her lack of tears, somehow implied that she was complicit in her own abuse. Or that she felt sympathy for Dominique Pelicot.",
      "\"When a victim doesn't cry, or cries too much, there is always something to criticise,\" said Mr Babonneau, with a flicker of contempt.",
      "But while the attacks clearly rattled Mrs Pelicot, she also told her legal team not to worry.",
      "There was a simple reason for that. Nothing that the lawyers could throw at her in court could ever compare with the very worst moment of her life, that day in November 2020, when an officer had sat her down at Carpentras Police Station and showed her the first grim images that investigators had extracted from her husband's hard drive.",
      "\"You know I survived 2 November 2020, so I'm ready for everything now,\" Babonneau remembers her saying.",
      "As the trial went on, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was surprised to find that public and media interest was not drifting away, as she and her team had imagined it would. Instead, she began receiving letters and gifts and applause from cheering crowds.",
      "\"When she started receiving these letters, she felt some kind of responsibility for victims who had suffered similar things,\" said Babonneau.",
      "She came to understand the uniqueness of her case \u2013 that the video evidence meant it was not simply \"the word of the victim against the word of the suspect\", and that she now had a rare opportunity \"to change society\".",
      "\"I'm lucky to have the evidence. I have the proof, which is very rare. So, I have to go through [all this] to stand for all the victims,\" she told Mr Babonneau.",
      "Her lawyer noticed, again, his client's \"simple,\" practical nature. She has no interest in being \"an activist\", but is simply thinking of how her experience of being drugged without realising it, could now help make other women aware of the issue, and look out for possible signs of similar abuse.",
      "Had she known then what all of France knows now, perhaps she could have put an end to her ordeal.",
      "And maybe other women can now do the same.",
      "As for the future, Mrs Pelicot may, perhaps, break her silence with a few interviews in the months ahead. But she's made it clear she wants \"to remain an individual\u2026 she wants to live a very simple life.\"",
      "And while she may never forgive her once \"perfect\" ex-husband, she has found a way to manage her memories of him and to cling on to the \"happy moments\" they once shared.",
      "Some psychiatrists argue that Dominique Pelicot is a relatively typical psychopath \u2013 a high-functioning narcissist with no capacity for empathy who weaved between his sordid hidden life and the self-gratifying role of playing of a family man. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot sees things more simply, embracing the idea, put forward at the trial, of a split personality.",
      "As Mr Babonneau puts it, \"there were two men in Dominique Pelicot and she only knew one of them.\"",

      "Bribery charges by a US court against the Adani Group are unlikely to significantly upset India's clean energy goals, industry leaders have told the BBC.",
      "Delhi has pledged to source half of its energy needs or 500 gigawatts (GW) of electricity from renewable sources by 2032, key to global efforts to combat climate change.",
      "The Adani Group is slated to contribute to a tenth of that capacity.",
      "The legal troubles in the US could temporarily delay the group's expansion plans but will not affect the government's overall targets, analysts say.",
      "India has made impressive strides in building clean energy infrastructure over the last decade.",
      "The country is growing at the \"fastest rate among major economies\" in adding renewables capacity, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Installed clean energy capacity has grown five-fold, with some 45% of the country's power-generation capacity - of nearly 200GW - coming from non-fossil fuel sources.",
      "Charges against the Adani Group - crucial to India's clean energy ambitions - are \"like a passing dark cloud\", and will not meaningfully impact this momentum, a former CEO of a rival firm said, wanting to remain anonymous.",
      "Gautam Adani has vowed to invest $100bn (\u00a378.3bn) in India's energy transition. Its green energy arm is the country's largest renewable energy company, producing nearly 11GW of clean energy through a diverse portfolio of wind and solar projects.",
      "Adani has a target to scale that to 50GW BY 2030, which will make up nearly 10% of the country's own installed capacity.",
      "Over half of that, or 30GW, will be produced at Khavda, in the western Indian state of Gujarat. It is the world's biggest clean energy plant, touted to be five times the size of Paris and the centrepiece in Adani's renewables crown.",
      "But Khavda and Adani's other renewables facilities are now at the very centre of the charges filed by US prosecutors - they allege that the company won contracts to supply power to state distribution companies from these facilities, in exchange for bribes to Indian officials. The group has denied this.",
      "But the fallout at the company level is already visible.",
      "When the indictment became public, Adani Green Energy immediately cancelled a $600m bond offering in the US.",
      "France's TotalEnergies, which owns 20% of Adani Green Energy and has a joint venture to develop several renewables projects with the conglomerate, said it will halt fresh capital infusion into the company.",
      "Major credit ratings agencies - Moody's, Fitch and S&P - have since changed their outlook on Adani group companies, including Adani Green Energy, to negative. This will impact the company's capacity to access funds and make it more expensive to raise capital.",
      "Analysts have also raised concerns about Adani Green Energy's ability to refinance its debt, as international lenders grow weary of adding exposure to the group.",
      "Global lenders like Jeffries and Barclays are already said to be reviewing their ties with Adani even as the group's reliance on global banks and international and local bond issues for long-term debt has grown from barely 14% in financial year 2016 to nearly 60% as of date, according to a note from Bernstein.",
      "Japanese brokerage Nomura says new financing might dry up in the short term but should \"gradually resume in the long term\". Meanwhile, Japanese banks like MUFG, SMBC, Mizuho are likely to continue their relationship with the group.",
      "The \"reputational and sentimental impact\" will fade away in a few months, as Adani is building \"solid, strategic assets and creating long-term value\", the unnamed CEO said.",
      "A spokesperson for the Adani Group told the BBC that it was \"committed to its 2030 targets and confident of delivering 50 GW of renewable energy capacity\".",
      "Adani stocks have recovered sharply from the lows they hit post the US court indictment.",
      "Some analysts told the BBC that a possible slowdown in funding for Adani could in fact end up benefitting its competitors.",
      "While Adani's financial influence has allowed it to rapidly expand in the sector, its competitors such as Tata Power, Goldman Sachs-backed ReNew Power, Greenko and state-run NTPC Ltd are also significantly ramping up manufacturing and generation capacity.",
      "\"It's not that Adani is a green energy champion. It is a big player that has walked both sides of the street, being the biggest private developer of coal plants in the world,\" said Tim Buckley, director at Climate Energy Finance.",
      "A large entity, \"perceived to be corrupt\" possibly slowing its expansion, could mean \"more money will start flowing into other green energy companies\", he said.",
      "According to Vibhuti Garg, South Asia director at Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), market fundamentals also continue to remain strong with demand for renewable energy outpacing supply in India - which is likely to keep the appetite for big investments intact.",
      "What could in fact slow the pace of India's clean energy ambitions is its own bureaucracy.",
      "\"Companies we track are very upbeat. Finance isn't a problem for them. If anything, it is state-level regulations that act as a kind of deterrent,\" says Ms Garg.",
      "Most state-run power distribution companies continue to face financial constraints, opting for cheaper fossil fuels, while dragging their feet on signing purchase agreements.",
      "According to Reuters, the controversial tender won by Adani was the first major contract issued by state-run Solar Energy Corp of India (SECI) without a guaranteed purchase agreement from distributors.",
      "SECI's chairman told Reuters that there are 30GW of operational green energy projects in the market without buyers.",
      "Experts say the 8GW solar contract at the heart of Adani's US indictment also sheds light on the messy tendering process, which required solar power generation companies to manufacture modules as well - limiting the number of bidders and leading to higher power costs.",

      "He also noted that Ghana had \"made history\" by choosing its first female Vice-President, Jane Naana Opoku Agyemang.",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 01:54:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump's expanding business ventures have made it easier than ever for those hoping to influence US policy to steer money his way.",
    "story": [
      "Not long after buying and publicly consuming a $6.2m banana as part of an artworld stunt, Chinese crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun made another eye-catching purchase, investing $30m ($23.5m) into a cryptocurrency firm called World Liberty Financial.",
      "The company had foundered since its October launch, investors seemingly leery of its prospects and its terms.",
      "But it boasted a potentially enticing feature: the chance to do business with a firm partnering with and promoted by none other than Donald Trump.",
      "Mr Sun's investment tipped the company over the threshold that allowed the president-elect to begin profiting from the venture. Trump and his family are now in the position to collect roughly $20m - and potentially far more.",
      "Mr Sun, who is currently fighting fraud charges in the US related to his own crypto business, did not respond to questions about what prompted his interest in the tokens, which cannot be traded.",
      "But the episode set off alarm bells among government ethics experts, who see it as an indication that Trump's expanding business ventures have made it easier than ever for those hoping to influence US policy to steer money his way.",
      "\"The conflicts have grown substantially with the scope of his business empire,\" said Richard Painter, who served as the White House's chief ethics lawyer during the George W Bush administration.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, Trump's team shrugged off the worries.",
      "In his first term, \"President Trump removed himself from his multi-billion-dollar real estate empire to run for office and forewent his government salary,\" Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "\"Unlike most politicians, President Trump didn't get into politics for profit \u2013 he's fighting because he loves the people of this country and wants to make America great again.\"",
      "But Trump has taken little action in response to concerns about the potential for corruption, or appearance of it, as he prepares for a return to the White House.",
      "New opportunities",
      "Trump has faced questions about conflicts of interest before.",
      "During his first term as president, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC became a symbol of the issue, as a go-to place for lobbyists, foreign diplomats, and allies to stay and spend.",
      "Critics argued that the hotel created a way for Trump to profit indirectly from his office. He faced accusations and lawsuits alleging he violated the US Constitution's ban on presidents receiving foreign emoluments \u2013 or profiting from their office.",
      "But experts said the growth of his business empire, which now includes a publicly traded social media company, a cryptocurrency firm, and ties to a Saudi-backed golf league, makes it possible for anyone hoping to curry favour to move money more quietly and in much greater sums.",
      "\"The scale has increased and the ease has increased,\" said Michael Ohlrogge, a law professor at New York University, who has studied Trump Media, which operates Truth Social and currently represents the bulk of Trump's $6bn fortune. \"You can only book so many hotel rooms.\"",
      "On Truth Social, for example, Prof Ohlrogge said a foreign government or business could purchase ads convincing investors the firm was gaining traction, prompting a pop in its share price.",
      "Though Trump Media commands a market value of more than $7bn, there has been little sign of such activity so far. The company reported less than $5m in ad sales this year.",
      "But given the stock market's \"amplifying\" effect, Prof Ohlrogge said it would not require a lot of spending to lead to potentially significant gains for Trump, who owns more than half the shares of the company.",
      "\"His pro-crypto stance\"",
      "Nowhere is the entanglement between Trump's business interests and his public duties as stark as in the crypto industry, where he has deepened his personal involvement, while simultaneously promising to champion it while in the White House.",
      "His plans include regulatory rollback and ideas such as a national Bitcoin reserve, in which the government would stockpile the cryptocurrency.",
      "\"One of the most important issues to be determined over the next couple years is how crypto is regulated,\" said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel at the nonpartisan Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \"Well now, he's an active player in the crypto market. How it could be regulated [could] affect his personal wealth, what kind of position he takes.\"",
      "Nik Bhatia, founder of Bitcoin Layer, a firm that advocates investments in Bitcoin, said it would be a mistake to dismiss Trump's stance on crypto as driven only by his own financial interests.",
      "\"I don't see these moves motivated by self-interest - I see them representing the electorate,\" he said.",
      "But still, he said: \"I think there probably is a conflict of interest in that his pro-crypto stance will benefit his company.\"",
      "This week, Trump said he would nominate Paul Atkins, who has lobbied for the industry, to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).",
      "He is widely expected to dial back enforcement at the agency, which polices publicly traded firms such as Trump Media for issues such as fraud and insider trading. The SEC oversaw a crackdown on the crypto industry under President Joe Biden.",
      "Mr Sun, the World Liberty Financial investor, was caught up in the SEC crackdown last year, after the agency charged him and his company with failing to properly register with the government while selling certain digital assets, among other charges.",
      "Under new leadership, the agency could very well drop the case, said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School and an expert in securities law.",
      "\"The leading characteristic of Mr Atkins is that he does not like enforcement and wants to greatly restrict the range of cases the SEC will bring,\" he said.",
      "In announcing his investment last month, Mr Sun did not mention the SEC complaint - which he has said lacks merit - but did cite Trump's views on crypto.",
      "\"The U.S. is becoming the blockchain hub, and Bitcoin owes it to @realDonaldTrump!\" he wrote on X. \"TRON is committed to making America great again and leading innovation. Let's go!\"",
      "Fewer guardrails",
      "There is little in US law that sets limits on conflict-of-interest - presidents are not bound by the same rules that regulate other government employees and cabinet officials.",
      "Though the US Constitution in theory bars presidents from taking presents from foreign governments while in office, the Supreme Court already has dismissed two previous lawsuits from Trump's first term involving potential conflicts of interests.",
      "Last summer, in a case involving Trump, it also ruled that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution while in office.",
      "In the past, Trump has argued that his business was actually hurt by his time in the White House, as partners worried about controversy cut ties, and he faced investigations and lawsuits.",
      "Now preparing to enter the White House a second time, Trump has yet to unveil an ethics plan, as is customary, and has given little sign he plans to bow to such concerns.",
      "He has vowed to hold onto his Trump Media stake, continues to hawk Trump-branded merchandise and lend his name to ventures like World Liberty Financial. His Mar-a-Lago club remains a place where the wealthy willing to pay for membership can gain access to the president with little to no transparency.",
      "Ethics experts worry that Trump has opened a door that will be difficult to close again.",
      "\"Trump's got the message he can do whatever he wants, because he won,\" Mr Painter said. \"Future presidents are going to look at this and think, 'We can do whatever we want.'\"",

      "Russia announced that Assad had stepped down and left Syria on Sunday, hours after the rebels entered Damascus and crowds gathered on the streets to celebrate. It later emerged that Assad had flown to Moscow and been granted asylum.",
      "HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani meanwhile arrived in Damascus and told Syrians: \"The future is ours.\"",
      "How did the takeover unfold?",
      "For the past four years, it had felt like the civil war was effectively over.",
      "Assad's government had regained control over most of Syria's cities with the help of Russia, Iran and Iranian-backed militias like Hezbollah, and the front lines were largely frozen.",
      "However, large parts of the country were still out of the government's control.",
      "The rebels' last stronghold was in Aleppo and Idlib provinces, which border Turkey and where more than four million people were living, many of them displaced. It was dominated by HTS, but a number of allied rebel groups and jihadist groups were also based there. Turkish-backed rebel factions also controlled territory with the support of Turkish troops.",
      "On 27 November, HTS and its allies launched their surprise offensive.",

The US named Abu Mohammed al-Jolani as a specially designated global terrorist and offered a $10m reward for information that led to his capture.",
      "HTS consolidated its power in Idlib and Aleppo provinces by crushing its rivals, including al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS) group cells. It set up the so-called Syrian Salvation Government to administer the territory according to Islamic law.",
      "Why did the rebels succeed?",
      "For several years, Idlib remained a battleground as Syrian government forces tried to regain control.",
      "But in 2020, Turkey and Russia brokered a ceasefire to halt a push by the government to retake Idlib. The ceasefire largely held despite sporadic fighting.",
      "HTS and its allies said on 27 November that they had launched an offensive to \"deter aggression\", accusing the government and allied Iran-backed militias of escalating attacks on civilians.",

    "story": [
      "Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani has dropped that nom de guerre associated with his jihadist past, and been using his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in official communiques issued since Thursday, ahead of the fall of President Bashar al-Assad.",
      "This move is part of Jolani's effort to bolster his legitimacy in a new context, as his Islamist militant group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), leading other rebel factions, announces the capture of the Syrian capital, Damascus, solidifying its control over much of the country.",
      "Jolani's transformation is not recent, but has been carefully cultivated over the years, evident not only in his public statements and interviews with international outlets but also in his evolving appearance.",
      "Once clad in traditional jihadist militant attire, he has adopted a more Western-style wardrobe in the past years. Now, as he leads the offensive, he has donned military fatigues, symbolising his role as the commander of the operations room.",

      "The IS-Iraq link",
      "A 2021 PBS interview with Jolani revealed that he was born in 1982 in Saudi Arabia, where his father worked as an oil engineer until 1989.",
      "In that year, the Jolani family returned to Syria, where he grew up and lived in the Mezzeh neighbourhood of Damascus.",
      "Jolani's journey as a jihadist began in Iraq, linked to al-Qaeda through the Islamic State (IS) group's precursor - al-Qaeda in Iraq and, later, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI).",
      "After the 2003 US-led invasion, he joined other foreign fighters in Iraq and, in 2005, was imprisoned at Camp Bucca, where he enhanced his jihadist affiliations and later on was introduced to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the quiet scholar who would later go on to lead IS.",
      "In 2011, Baghdadi sent Jolani to Syria with funding to establish al-Nusra Front, a covert faction tied to ISI. By 2012, Nusra had become a prominent Syrian fighting force, hiding its IS and al-Qaeda ties.",
      "Tensions arose in 2013 when Baghdadi's group in Iraq unilaterally declared the merger of the two groups (ISI and Nusra), declaring the creation of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS), and publicly revealing for the first time the links between them.",
      "Jolani resisted, as he wanted to distance his group from ISI's violent tactics, leading to a split.",
      "To get out of that sticky situation, Jolani pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda, making Nusra Front its Syrian branch.",
      "From the start, he prioritised winning Syrian support, distancing himself from IS's brutality and emphasising a more pragmatic approach to jihad.",

      "Syria's Assad falls - follow live updates",
      "Joining al-Qaeda",
      "In April 2013, al-Nusra Front became al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, putting it at odds with IS.",
      "While Jolani's move was partly an attempt to maintain local support and avoid alienating Syrians and rebel factions, the al-Qaeda affiliation ultimately did little to benefit this effort.",
      "It became a pressing challenge in 2015 when Nusra and other factions captured Idlib province, forcing them to co-operate in its administration.",
      "In 2016, Jolani severed ties with al-Qaeda, rebranding the group as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and later as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in 2017.",
      "While initially appearing superficial, the split revealed deeper divisions. Al-Qaeda accused Jolani of betrayal, leading to defections and the formation of Hurras al-Din, a new al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, which HTS later crushed in 2020. Members of Hurras al-Din, however, have remained cautiously present in the region.",
      "HTS also targeted IS operatives and foreign fighters in Idlib, dismantling their networks and forcing some to undergo \"deradicalisation\" programmes.",
      "These moves, justified as efforts to unify militant forces and reduce infighting, signalled Jolani's strategy to position HTS as a dominant and politically viable force in Syria.",
      "Despite the public split from al-Qaeda and name changes, HTS continued to be designated by the UN, US, UK and other countries as a terrorist organisation, and the US maintained a $10m reward for information about Jolani's whereabouts. Western powers considered the break-up to be a fa\u00e7ade.",
      "Forming a 'government' in Idlib",
      "Under Jolani, HTS became the dominant force in Idlib, north-west Syria's largest rebel stronghold and home to about four million people, many of whom were displaced from other Syrian provinces.",
      "To address concerns about a militant group governing the area, HTS established a civilian front, the so-called \"Syrian Salvation Government\" (SG) in 2017 as its political and administrative arm.",
      "The SG functioned like a state, with a prime minister, ministries and local departments overseeing sectors such as education, health and reconstruction, while maintaining a religious council guided by Sharia, or Islamic law.",
      "To reshape his image, Jolani actively engaged with the public, visiting displacement camps, attending events, and overseeing aid efforts, particularly during crises like the 2023 earthquakes.",
      "HTS highlighted achievements in governance and infrastructure to legitimise its rule and demonstrate its ability to provide stability and services.",
      "It has previously praised the Taliban, upon their return to power in 2021, lauding them as an inspiration and a model for effectively balancing jihadist efforts with political aspirations, including making tactical compromises to achieve their goals.",
      "Jolani's efforts in Idlib reflected his broader strategy to demonstrate HTS's ability not only to wage jihad but also to govern effectively.",
      "By prioritising stability, public services and reconstruction, he aimed to showcase Idlib as a model of success under HTS rule, enhancing both his group's legitimacy and his own political aspirations.",
      "But under his leadership, HTS has crushed and marginalised other militant factions, both jihadists and rebel ones, in its effort to consolidate its power and dominate the scene.",
      "Anti-HTS protests",
      "For over a year leading up to the HTS-led rebel offensive on 27 November, Jolani faced protests in Idlib from hardline Islamists as well as Syrian activists.",
      "Critics compared his rule to Assad's, accusing HTS of authoritarianism, suppressing dissent and silencing critics. Protesters labelled HTS's security forces as \"Shabbiha\", a term used to describe Assad's loyalist henchmen.",
      "They further alleged that HTS deliberately avoided meaningful combat against government forces and marginalised jihadists and foreign fighters in Idlib to prevent them from engaging in such actions, all to appease international actors.",
      "Even during the latest offensive, activists have persistently urged HTS to release individuals imprisoned in Idlib allegedly for expressing dissent.",
      "In response to these criticisms, HTS initiated several reforms over the past year. It disbanded or rebranded a controversial security force accused of human rights violations and established a \"Department of Grievances\" to allow citizens to lodge complaints against the group. Its critics said these measures were just a show to contain dissent.",
      "To justify its consolidation of power in Idlib and the suppression of plurality among militant groups, HTS argued that unifying under a single leadership was crucial for making progress and ultimately overthrowing the Syrian government.",
      "HTS and its civilian arm, the SG, walked a tightrope, striving to project a modern, moderate image to win over both the local population and the international community, while simultaneously maintaining their Islamist identity to satisfy hardliners within rebel-held areas and HTS's own ranks.",
      "For instance, in December 2023, HTS and the SG faced a backlash after a \"festival\" held at a glossy new shopping mall was criticised by hardliners as \"immoral\".",
      "And this August, a Paralympic Games-inspired ceremony drew sharp criticism from hardliners, prompting the SG to review the organisation of such events.",
      "These incidents illustrate the challenges HTS faces in reconciling the expectations of its Islamist base with the broader demands of the Syrian population, who are seeking freedom and coexistence after years of authoritarian rule under Assad.",
      "Leading a new path?",
      "As the latest offensive unfolded, global media focused on Jolani's jihadist past, prompting some rebel supporters to call for him to step back, viewing him as a liability.",
      "Although he previously expressed willingness to dissolve his group and step aside, his recent actions and public appearances tell a different story.",
      "HTS's success in uniting rebels and nearly capturing the whole country in under two weeks has strengthened Jolani's position, quieting hardline critics and accusations of opportunism.",
      "Jolani and the SG have since reassured domestic and international audiences.",
      "To Syrians, including minorities, they promised safety; to neighbours and powers like Russia, they pledged peaceful relations. Jolani even assured Russia its Syrian bases would remain unharmed if attacks ceased.",
      "This shift reflects HTS's \"moderate jihad\" strategy since 2017, emphasising pragmatism over rigid ideology.",
      "Jolani's approach could signal the decline of global jihad movements like IS and al-Qaeda, whose inflexibility is increasingly seen as ineffective and unsustainable.",
      "His trajectory might inspire other groups to adapt, marking either a new era of localised, politically flexible \"jihadism\" or just a temporary divergence from the traditional path in order to make political and territorial gains."

    "story": [
      "Is the world's fastest-growing big economy losing steam?",
      "The latest GDP numbers paint a sobering picture. Between July and September, India's economy slumped to a seven-quarter low of 5.4%, well below the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) forecast of 7%.",
      "While it is still robust compared with developed nations, the figure signals a slowdown.",
      "Economists attribute this to several factors. Consumer demand has weakened, private investment has been sluggish for years and government spending - an essential driver in recent years - has been pulled back. India's goods exports have long struggled, with their share standing at a mere 2% in 2023.",
      "Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies report tepid sales, while salary bills at publicly traded firms, a proxy for urban wages, shrank last quarter. Even the previously bullish RBI has revised its growth forecast to 6.6% for the financial year 2024-2025.",
      "\"All hell seems to have broken loose after the latest GDP numbers,\" says economist Rajeshwari Sengupta. \"But this has been building up for a while. There's a clear slowdown and a serious demand problem.\"",
      "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman paints a brighter picture. She said last week that the decline was \"not systemic\" but a result of reducing government spending during an election-focused quarter. She expected third-quarter growth to offset the recent decline. India will probably remain the fastest-growing major economy despite challenges like stagnant wages affecting domestic consumption, slowing global demand and climate disruptions in agriculture, Sitharaman said.",
      "Some \u2013 including a senior minister in the federal government, economists and a former member of RBI's monetary policy group \u2013 argue that the central bank's focus on curbing inflation has led to excessively restrictive interest rates, potentially stifling growth.",
      "High rates make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, and potentially reduce investments and dampen consumption, both key drivers of economic growth. The RBI has kept interest rates unchanged for nearly two years, primarily because of rising inflation.",
      "India's inflation surged to 6.2% in October, breaching the central bank's target ceiling (4%) and reaching a 14-month high, according to official data. It was mainly  driven by food prices, comprising half of the consumer price basket \u2013 vegetable prices, for example, rose to more than 40% in October. There are also growing signs that food price hikes are now influencing other everyday costs, or core inflation.",
      "But high interest rates alone may not fully explain the slowing growth. \"Lowering rates won't spur growth unless consumption demand is strong. Investors borrow and invest only when demand exists, and that's not the case now,\" says Himanshu (he uses only one name), a development economist at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.",
      "However, RBI's outgoing governor, Shaktikanta Das, believes India's \"growth story remains intact\", adding the \"balance between inflation and growth is well poised\".",
      "Economists point out that despite record-high retail credit and rising unsecured loans - indicating people borrowing to finance consumption even amidst high rates - urban demand is weakening. Rural demand is a brighter spot, benefiting from a good monsoon and higher food prices.",
      "Ms Sengupta, an associate professor at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, told the BBC that the ongoing crisis was borne out by the fact that India's economy was operating on a \"two-speed trajectory\", driven by diverging performances in its \"old economy and new economy\".",
      "The old economy comprising the vast informal sector, including medium and small scale industries, agriculture and traditional corporate sector, are still waiting for long-pending reforms.",
      "In contrast, the new economy, defined by the boom in services exports post-Covid, experienced robust growth in 2022-23. Outsourcing 2.0 has been a key driver, with India emerging as the world's largest hub for global capability centres (GCCs), which do high-end offshore services work.",
      "According to Deloitte, a consulting firm, over 50% of the world's GCCs are now based in India. These centres focus on R&D, engineering design and consulting services, generating $46bn (\u00a336bn) in revenue and employing up to 2 million highly skilled workers.",
      "\"This influx of GCCs fuelled urban consumption by supporting demand for luxury goods, real estate and SUVs. For 2-2.5 years post-pandemic, this drove a surge in urban spending. With GCCs largely established and consumption patterns shifting, the urban spending lift is fading,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "So the old economy appears to lack a growth catalyst while the new economy slows. Private investment is crucial, but without strong consumption demand, firms will not invest. Without investment to create jobs and boost incomes, consumption demand cannot recover. \"It's a vicious cycle,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "There are other confusing signals as well. India's average tariffs have risen from 5% in 2013-14 to 17% now, higher than Asian peers trading with the US. In a world of global value chains, where exporters rely on imports from multiple countries, high tariffs make goods more expensive for companies to trade, making it harder for them to compete in global markets.",
      "Then there is what economist Arvind Subramanian calls a \"new twist in the tale\".",
      "Even as calls grow to lower interest rates and boost liquidity, the central bank is propping up a falling rupee by selling dollars, which tightens liquidity. Since October, the RBI has spent $50bn from its forex reserves to shield the rupee.",
      "Buyers must pay in rupees to purchase dollars, which reduces liquidity in the market. Maintaining a strong rupee through interventions reduces competitiveness by making Indian goods more expensive in global markets, leading to lower demand for exports.",
      "\"Why is the central bank shoring up the rupee? The policy is bad for the economy and exports. Possibly they are doing it because of optics. They don't want to show India's currency is weak,\" Mr Subramanian, a former economic adviser to the government, told the BBC.",
      "Critics warn that the \"hyping up the narrative\" of India as the fastest-growing economy is hindering essential reforms to boost investment, exports and job creation. \"We are still a poor country. Our per capita GDP is less than $3,000, while the US is at $86,000. If you say we are growing faster than them, it makes no sense at all,\" says Ms. Sengupta.",
      "In other words, India requires a significantly higher and sustained growth rate to generate more jobs and raise incomes.",
      "Boosting growth and consumption will not be easy in the short term. Lacking private investment, Himanshu suggests raising wages through government-run employment schemes to increase incomes and spur consumption. Others like Ms Sengupta advocate for reducing tariffs and attracting export investments moving away from China to countries like Vietnam.",
      "The government remains upbeat over the India story: banks are strong, forex reserves are robust, finances stable and extreme poverty has declined. Chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran says the latest GDP figure should not be over-interpreted. \"We should not throw the baby out with the bathwater, as the underlying growth story remains intact,\" he said at a recent meeting.",
      "Clearly the pace of growth could do with some picking up. That is why scepticism lingers. \"There's no nation as ambitious for so long without taking [adequate] steps to fulfill that ambition,\" says Ms Sengupta. \"Meanwhile, the headlines talk of India's age and decade - I'm waiting for that to materialise.\""

      "It is what scientists call a polymetallic nodule, created over millennia as minerals accumulate on the seabed.",
      "Packed full of cobalt, nickel and manganese, these ancient formations are now  valuable: the metals go into batteries that power modern life, from electric cars to mobile phones.",
      "They have become a source of friction in the low-lying Pacific Islands, which are among the nations most vulnerable to climate change.",
      "With rising sea levels, the ocean - or Moana, as it's called in M\u0101ori and many other Polynesian languages - remains their greatest threat, but it is also their biggest provider.",
      "They fish in it and they live off the tourists drawn to their turquoise waters, but now the Cook Islands wants to dig deeper, up to 6,000m (19,685 ft), where the nodules lie.",
      "It's a pet project for Prime Minister Mark Brown, who believes it will reshape this country of 15 volcanic islands in the southern Pacific.",
      "The hope is that the income from these metals could lead to more prosperity than the islanders had ever imagined.",
      "Except the promise of deep sea mining may carry an environmental price.",
      "Proponents say that harvesting these nodules for use in renewables will help the world transition from fossil fuels. They also believe that it is less invasive than mining on land.",
      "But critics argue so much is still unknown about the impact of extracting what is one of the last untouched parts of the planet. They say there should be a pause on deep sea mining until there is more research on its effects on marine life and the oceanic ecosystem.",
      "When Jean was growing up, she says, the nodules were only thought to be useful for making knife blades.",
      "\"We had no idea that cell phones were going to come, and wind turbines and electric cars.\"",

      "The Pacific Ocean covers close to a third of the planet. And the nodules buried in it have been known about since the 19th Century.",
      "But in the 1960s, American geologist John L Mero published a book setting out the case that the seabed could provide many of the world's mineral needs.",
      "It's not an easy process \u2013 nor a cheap one. But when prices of metals like nickel soared in 2008, it looked more appealing.",
      "Then Covid hit. Tourists left and the money dried up.",
      "Together with the impact of climate change - rising sea levels and unpredictable weather patterns - the country quickly realised it needed something else to rely on.",
      "The Cook Islands' Seabeds Minerals Authority estimates there are 12 billion wet tonnes of polymetallic nodules in their waters.",
      "Some people argue mining the seabed is not financially viable. With technology moving so fast, these metals may not even be in demand by the time it gets going.",
      "But there are takers. And in 2022, the Cook Islands gave out three licences to companies to start exploring the possibility of deep-sea mining.",
      "They're now working with scientists in researching the environmental impact.",
      "\"Nothing we do in life is risk-free. So, if you want zero risk you need to go and sit in a little room with cotton wool around you,\" says Hans Smit, who runs Moana Minerals, one of the firms that has an exploration licence.",

      "Hans is from South Africa and moved here to be part of the community. To him, the deep-sea metals are an \"incredible resource\" that could benefit the islanders.",
      "While there's a growing call to delay deep-sea mining until regulations by the International Seabed Authority are drawn up, this only applies to international waters.",
      "The Cook Islands still have huge reserves of their own in their national waters - their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) - so, they can crack on regardless.",
      "\"We're known as small-island developing states, but we like to call ourselves large ocean states,\" says Rima Brown, a young Cook Islander with a geography degree who jokingly calls herself the poster child for deep-sea mining.",
      "Rima works for the Seabed Minerals Authority and much of her time is spent mapping the sea bed.",
      "\"While we're only about 200 square kilometers in land mass, we have an exclusive economic zone of almost 2 million square kilometres,\" she says.",

      "\"We're seeing infrastructure being put up here on Rarotonga, accommodation for offshore mining companies to reside here, we've got draft mining regulations already in place. Actions are speaking a lot louder than words at the moment.\"",
      "Prime Minister Mark Brown, who is driving this, also happens to be the tourism minister and the seabed minerals minister. He's made it clear he wants the Cook Islands to be a leader in the industry.",
      "\"It provides the opportunity for our kids to be able to study at any university in the world without having to incur a student loan,\" says Brown, who has a vision of following the lead of Norway in establishing a sovereign wealth fund.",
      "\"It allows us to have the type of health care that our people have to go to New Zealand or Australia for. It allows our young people the opportunity to live fulfilling lives here in our country, without having to go to other countries to ply their trade in an industry that doesn't exist here.\"",
      "To those who say a country threatened by climate change risks becoming part of the problem, he argues he's trying to find solutions.",

      "With winter nights drawing in across North America, Canadian \u201csnowbirds\u201d \u2013 citizens who flee their freezing temperatures for sunnier climes every year \u2013 are planning their annual trips to Florida or the Caribbean.",
      "Traditionally, Cuba has been hugely popular among Canadians, drawn to the pristine white sands of beach resorts like Varadero.",
      "They fill the void left by Americans wary of the travel restrictions imposed on them under the continuing US economic embargo of the largest island in the Caribbean.",
      "Figures show that almost one million Canadian tourists visited Cuba last year, the top country of origin for visitors by some margin.",
      "As such, a recent decision by the Canadian tour operator, Sunwing Vacations Group \u2013 one of Cuba\u2019s leading travel partners \u2013 to remove 26 hotels from its Cuba portfolio is a blow to the island\u2019s struggling tourism industry.",
      "Sunwing took the decision after Cuba endured a four-day nationwide blackout at the end of October, caused by failures with the country's aging energy infrastructure.",
      "This was followed by another national power cut last month, when Hurricane Rafael barrelled its way across the island, worsening an already-acute electricity crisis.",
      "A third countrywide blackout then happened on Wednesday, 4 Dec, after Cuba's largest power plant broke down.",
      "\u201cCuba has had some volatility in the last few weeks and that may shake consumer confidence,\u201d Sunwing\u2019s chief marketing officer, Samantha Taylor told the Pax News travel website last month.",
      "\u201cThere are incredible places to go in Cuba,\u201d she stressed, keen to emphasise that the company isn\u2019t pulling out of Cuba altogether. \u201cBut we also recognise that if clients are a little uncomfortable, we need to give them options.\u201d",
      "Specifically, that involved drawing up a list of what they called \u201chidden gems\u201d \u2013 alternative holiday destinations in the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and Colombia.",
      "The implications for Cuba are clear.",
      "With tourism now the island\u2019s principal economic motor, and the main source of foreign currency earnings after remittances, that an important tour operator is pointing its customers towards other countries\u2019 beaches over crumbling energy infrastructure is a real concern.",
      "\u201cOur message to Canadians is that tourism is one of the economy\u2019s priorities,\u201d said Lessner G\u00f3mez, director of the Cuban Tourism Board in Toronto in a statement. \u201cThe Ministry of Tourism has been preparing for the winter season to deliver better services, uninterrupted supplies, a better airport experience, and more and new car rentals.\u201d",
      "While Cuba\u2019s tourism agency tries to ease fears about the extent of the electricity blackouts, few can deny that these have been extremely difficult months on the island. Hurricane Rafael was only the latest storm to hit Cuba in a frenetic Atlantic hurricane season in which more powerful and more frequent storms are the new normal.",
      "Of course, severe weather is a problem across the Caribbean. But for Cuba, there are other complications in play.",
      "Donald Trump\u2019s re-election to the White House and his choice for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, stand to make life even more complicated for Cubans than it already is.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the Cuban Revolution\u2019s hardest moment,\u201d says former Cuban diplomat, Jes\u00fas Arboleya. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I see nothing on the horizon whatsoever which allows for an optimistic view of the future of US-Cuba relations.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has handed US policy towards Cuba to those sectors of the Cuban American right who have essentially lived off anti-Castro policies since their origins.\u201d",
      "Mr Arboleya adds that Marco Rubio, currently a US Senator for Florida, is the leading voice among them. He is a Cuban American long opposed to the communist government in Havana.",
      "His parents were Cubans who moved to the US in 1956, three years before Fidel Castro seized power, but his grandfather fled the Castro-led turn to communism on the island.",
      "\u201cPeople are horrified by the idea of another Donald Trump presidency. It spells real trouble,\u201d echoes Cuban political commentator and editor of Temas magazine, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Current US policy towards Cuba is \u201csomewhat schizophrenic\u201d, he argues.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, the State Department facilitates support to the private sector, and [pushes for] economic changes in Cuba. But on the other hand, Congress and Senate seem to freeze any advances on those reforms.\u201d",
      "The expectation is, however, that a future Secretary of State Rubio will coalesce the US\u2019s Cuba policy around a single idea - maximum pressure on the island by tightening the already-harsh sanctions.",
      "Cubans fear that could mean the suspension of commercial flights to Cuba, or even the closure of the US Embassy in Havana, which was officially reopened in 2015 after decades of frosty relations.",
      "If implemented, such steps would be deliberately designed to further harm Cuba\u2019s floundering tourism trade, the aim to hit the communist-run nation when it\u2019s down. Tourist numbers to Cuba have almost halved since the high point of nearly five million visitors during the Obama-era d\u00e9tente with Cuba.",
      "Between 2015-2017 US visitors flocked to the island under more relaxed travel restrictions, keen to experience a country that had long been denied them. Around the same time, the Cuban government embarked on a major hotel-building spree, confident that demand would remain strong over the next decade.",
      "However, there followed a double blow to Cuban tourism from which it hasn\u2019t fully recovered. First, the Trump Administration rolled back President Obama\u2019s engagement policies, and then the Covid-19 pandemic sent the industry into freefall.",
      "With many of those hotels now registering much lower occupancy rates than originally predicted, and real difficulties in providing the five-star customer experience as advertised amid the blackouts and shortages, some question the strategy of putting so many eggs in the tourism basket in the first place.",
      "\u201cWhy has Cuba invested 38% [of government funds] on average over the past decade in hotels and infrastructure connected to international tourism, but only 8 to 9% on energy infrastructure?\u201d asks economist Ricardo Torres at the American University in Washington DC. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. The hotels run on electricity.\u201d",
      "Even with all the current challenges, most visitors agree that Cuba remains a unique travel experience. The cliches \u2013 classic cars, cigars and mojitos \u2013 still appeal to many, while others prefer to travel the island absorbing its history, culture and music.",
      "Yet as tour operator Sunwings\u2019 decision to step back shows, some tourists are finding it hard to appreciate Cuba during its energy crisis, especially if it\u2019s about to be exacerbated by a hostile administration \u2013 and Secretary of State \u2013 in Washington."

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 01:56:57 GMT",
    "summary": "France's nuclear giant has lost control of its uranium mining operations in the West African state.",
    "story": [
      "In the latest sign of a dramatic deterioration in relations, Niger's military rulers appear increasingly determined to drive France out of any significant sector in their economy - and particularly uranium mining.",
      "This week the French state nuclear company Orano announced that the junta - which deposed France's ally, President Mohamed Bazoum, in a coup in July 2023 - had taken operational control of its local mining firm, Soma\u00efr.",
      "The company's efforts to resume exports have for months been blocked by the regime and it is being pushed into financial crisis.",
      "And the impact could be felt more widely - although Niger accounts for less than 5% of the uranium produced globally, in 2022 it accounted for a quarter of the supply to nuclear power plants across Europe.",
      "So the timing could hardly be more awkward, as Western countries struggle to meet the challenge of climate change and cut their carbon emissions from electricity generation.",
      "For French President Emmanuel Macron, already wrestling with political crisis at home, the potential departure of Orano from Niger is certainly awkward in image terms.",
      "For it coincides with bruising news from other long-standing African partners - Chad has suddenly announced the ending of a defence agreement with Paris, while Senegal has confirmed its insistence on the eventual closure of the French military base in Dakar.",
      "But in any case, the crisis facing Orano in Niger represents a significant practical challenge for French energy supply.",
      "With 18 nuclear plants, totalling 56 reactors, which generate almost 65% of its electricity, France has been ahead of the game in containing carbon emissions from the power sector.",
      "But the country's own limited production of uranium ended more than 20 years ago.",
      "So, over the past decade or so, it has imported almost 90,000 tonnes - a fifth of which has come from Niger. Only Kazakhstan - which accounts for 45% of global output - was a more important source of supply.",
      "The continuing paralysis, or the definitive shutdown, of Orano's operations in Niger would certainly force France to look elsewhere.",
      "This should be achievable, as alternative supplies can be obtained from countries including Uzbekistan, Australia and Namibia.",
      "Last year, as West African neighbours responded to the coup in Niger by imposing a trade blockade that paralysed uranium exports, other suppliers readily stepped into the breach.",
      "The European Union's imports of the mineral from the country plunged by a third, but these were largely replaced by Canada.",
      "But there was also a politically awkward price to pay. EU imports of uranium from Russia rose by more than 70%, despite the heavy sanctions imposed on Moscow because of its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "And of course, it is Russia which has become the new best friend of the military leaders who have seized power in Niger and its allied neighbours, Burkina Faso and Mali, since 2020.",
      "Russian military contractors fight alongside the Malian army in its campaign against jihadists and ethnic Tuareg separatists, while they also help to protect the senior leadership of the juntas in Niger and Burkina Faso.",
      "So although France, and Europe more generally, would be able to find ways to cope with a definitive loss of Niger's uranium supply, the shift would not be entirely comfortable.",
      "In the short-term at least, EU states would probably become more reliant on Russia and its central Asian neighbours, thus undermining their own effort to maintain economic pressure on President Vladimir Putin during a potentially crucial period in the Ukraine crisis.",
      "Moreover, Niger's regime, whose attitude towards the EU as a whole has become almost as mistrustful as its broken relationship with France, continues to seek alternatives to its old Western partnerships.",
      "And Iran - a potential customer, of course, for uranium - has emerged as an option.",
      "Contacts between the two governments have deepened, with Niger's Prime Minister Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine visiting Tehran in January. Rumours of a possible deal for the supply of uranium \"yellowcake\" (concentrate) briefly circulated a few months ago.",
      "Meanwhile, the outlook for Orano's hopes of restoring normal uranium operations and exports from Niger look dim, given the hostile attitude of the military regime in Niamey.",
      "That antipathy is partly explained by Macron's vocal condemnation of the July 2023 overthrow of Bazoum, who had been one of his closest African political and security partners.",
      "Paris firmly endorsed the tough stance of the West African regional grouping Ecowas, and there were even rumours that it might have been ready to provide tacit support had the bloc ever gone ahead with its short-lived threat to intervene militarily in Niger to reinstate Bazoum.",
      "In this poisonous atmosphere of hostility and mistrust, Orano was an obvious and convenient target for junta retaliation.",
      "The French company's predominant role in the uranium sector had for years fuelled resentment among many Nig\u00e9riens, amidst claims that the French company was buying their uranium on the cheap, despite periodic renegotiations of the export deal. Although the mining operations only started years after independence, they were seen as emblematic of France's ongoing post-colonial influence.",
      "After last year's coup, Orano itself tried to stay out of the diplomatic row, keep a low profile and carry on operating normally.",
      "But the Ecowas trade blockade prevented it from exporting the output from the Soma\u00efr mine, near Arlit, in the Sahara Desert.",
      "And even after the sanctions were lifted in late February, the usual uranium export route, via Benin's port of Cotonou, remained blocked, because the junta kept the border closed in an ongoing political row with Benin.",
      "Orano offered to fly the uranium out, but the regime shunned this suggestion.",
      "In June the junta cancelled the French company's rights to develop a new mine at the large Imouraren deposit, which had been seen as the uranium sector's principal new hope for future growth.",
      "Meanwhile, the export blockage was pushing Soma\u00efr, which by November was sitting on 1,150 tonnes of blockaded stocks of uranium concentrate worth $210m (\u00a3165m), into financial crisis.",
      "And when Orano decided to halt further production and prioritise the payment of workforce salaries, relations with the government deteriorated further into this week's almost total breakdown.",
      "Of course, it is not just the company but also Niger's economy that pays a price for this situation, in lost export earnings and risking hundreds of jobs.",
      "For Arlit and other communities in the desert north, this would be a devastating blow, despite talk of revived activity at a Chinese mining project in the region and some interest in the sector among other potential partners.",
      "But Niger's junta feels no need to make concessions to Orano because it is now buoyed by a sharp rise in oil exports, thanks to a new Chinese-built pipeline.",
      "With that financial cushion, the regime appears prepared to bear the cost of paralysing and probably dismantling the traditional uranium partnership with France - now its main international opponent.",

      "They all said they were fleeing persecution in Sri Lanka and India, some because of links with the former Tamil Tiger rebels who were defeated in the civil war that ended in 2009.",

      "Shanthi's husband later built a writing desk out of wooden pallets so the children could do homework in the tent.",
      "The children soon began to complain of boredom in the evenings so Shanthi - who had trained in Bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance - began giving dance lessons, too, playing music downloaded from her phone.",
      "Three years after the family first arrived in the camp, they were finally sent to the UK this week in what the government described as a \"one off\" case in the interests of their welfare.",
      "\"It's like an open prison - we were not allowed to go outside, we were just living in a fence and in a tent,\" Shanthi, aged in her early 30s, says in an interview on the outskirts of London.",
      "\"Every day our life was the same.\"",
      "It was like living \"in a cage,\" she adds.",
      "While guards watched and military jets occasionally roared overhead, Shanthi and the other Tamils approached British forces on the island with a letter asking to be sent to a safe country. It marked the first time that asylum claims had ever been filed in the territory.",
      "This sparked a lengthy legal battle 6,000 miles away in the UK, and while that took its course, Shanthi and the others stuck there, took matters into her own hands.",
      "While the Tamils were not allowed to cook their own food, the camp was full of coconut trees, and Shanthi and others used the husks to line planters in which they grew their own vegetables - chilli, garlic and cucumber.",
      "\"They would sometimes give us red chilis so we dried them in the sun and collected the seeds and then grew them. In the salad sometimes we'd get cucumber so we collected the seeds and kept them in the sunlight and after they dried they would grow,\" she says.",
      "Every day, they would make sambol - a popular Sri Lankan side dish - by mashing the coconut and chilli.",
      "They struggled to eat the American food served to them from the base, and would put the vegetables in hot water with garlic and chilli to try to make curries.",
      "With limited access to clothing, particularly for the 16 children in the camp, Shanthi and other women stitched dresses from bed sheets. Come Christmas time, they turned paper napkins into flowers, and cut moon and star shapes out of food containers to decorate a tree.",
      "Relations with the guards that watched over them were often tense, but at Diwali, Shanthi says an \"officer with a good heart brought us a biryani\". On another occasion, a guard brought a cake for her son, who had been counting down the days to his birthday.",
      "But as time went on, Shanthi says, the feelings of helplessness grew.",
      "Life in the camp was to exist in a bubble - news of major wars breaking out in Ukraine and the Middle East trickled through from the guards watching over the migrants, but they were kept away from the base and consumed by their own lives.",
      "Access to the island, part of the Chagos Archipelago, is heavily restricted. It has officially had no resident population since the early 1970s when the UK evicted all the people living there so it could develop the strategic base.",
      "\"From day one until we left, every day we were living with rats,\" Shanthi says. \"Sometimes the rats would bite our children - their legs, fingers and hands. They stole our food. At nights sometimes they would crawl over our blankets and our heads.\"",
      "Giant coconut crabs and tropical fire ants would also crawl into the camp.",
      "During storms, rain water would pour in through holes in the tents, which had previously been used for Covid patients in the pandemic.",
      "When United Nations investigators visited the camp late last year, the children told them they dreamed of going for a picnic, riding a bike or eating an ice cream.",
      "At one point earlier this year, a medical official described the camp as being in \"complete crisis\", with mass self-harming and incidents of attempted suicide.",
      "\"My daughter was watching everything that happened. She'd say 'mum they've cut themselves. Should I cut myself?' So I'd say 'no, no. You can't do anything. I'll protect you. Come and listen to some music, come and take some paper and just draw,'\" she recalls through tears.",
      "Both she and her husband sob as they talk about the two times their daughter self-harmed.",
      "\"Both times I felt really bad and couldn't process it. When she did this, she told me she did it because she hoped if she died her parents and her brother would go to a safe third country,\" Shanthi says.",
      "There were also cases and allegations of sexual assault and harassment within the camp by other migrants, including against children.",
      "\"Over three years we suffered so much. I don't know how we survived,\" Shanthi says.",
      "Throughout the Tamils' time on the island, British authorities acknowledged that it was not a suitable place for them, and said they were looking for long-term solutions. The government said the group's wellbeing and safety was the \"top priority\".",
      "Shanthi says the happiest moment in the camp came recently when officials announced that they would be brought to the UK, where they would be given the right to remain for six months. Shanthi says no one in the camp slept that night.",
      "Upon arriving in the UK, Shanthi says she was struck by \"the cold\" - and it felt like waking from a coma. She had forgotten how to download apps, send WhatsApp messages or pay in shops.",
      "Her children talk of starting school, making friends and riding a double-decker bus.",
      "But the family's long-term future remains uncertain. They have now filed asylum claims in the UK in hopes of remaining. If unsuccessful, they will likely be returned to Sri Lanka.",
      "The UK agreed earlier this year to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius in a historic move. Under the deal, which has still to be signed, Diego Garcia would continue to operate as a UK-US military base but Mauritius would take responsibility for any future migrant arrivals.",
      "Shanthi brought a shell with her from Diego Garcia to remember her time there. One day, she plans to put it on a chain and wear it around her neck.",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 01:15:43 GMT",
    "summary": "It has been a steep fall for the 25-year-old batter, once hailed as Indian cricket's 'next big thing'.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player in the history of the Indian Premier League (IPL) as he was signed by Lucknow SuperGiants for 27 crore rupees (\u00a32.54m) at the mega auction in Saudi Arabia.",
      "But it was the news of Prithvi Shaw - Pant's Delhi Capitals teammate - going unsold that grabbed more attention.",
      "Among those seated in the auction in positions to make bids were Sourav Ganguly and Ricky Ponting, who had been closely associated with Shaw in his years with Capitals, as also Rahul Dravid, who was coach when India won the under-19 World Cup under Shaw in 2018.",
      "Their disinterest was telling. Shaw found no takers.",
      "Ironically, just nine months earlier, before the start of the 2024 IPL season, it was Pant whose career looked in jeopardy.",
      "A horrific car crash in December 2022 had left him with multiple life-threatening injuries. But showing iron will, great determination and self-discipline, Pant fought his way back from what seemed a dead-end to his career.",
      "Pant faced the challenges of IPL 2024 head-on and excelled, earning a rapid recall to international cricket. He was part of the T20 World Cup-winning squad. Dominating the domestic season, he impressed in the domestic Duleep Trophy, paving the way for a sensational return to Test cricket. Against Bangladesh, he lit up the field with a scorching century.",
      "Shaw, meanwhile, under pressure after a couple of poor IPL seasons, has lurched from one crisis to another.",
      "His indifferent form in IPL 2024 saw him lose his place in the playing XI mid-season. A spate of low scores in the current domestic season saw him lose his place in the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team too. And an outright rejection in the IPL mega auction has brought his career to the precipice of a premature end.",
      "It's been a mighty tumble for the 25-year-old, who not too long ago, was touted as the 'next big thing\u2019 in Indian cricket.",
      "Shaw hit the headlines in November 2013 as a 14-year-old when he smashed 546 runs for Rizvi Springfield in the Harris Shield, a prestigious school cricket tournament. It was the highest score in the world in minor cricket then.",
      "Sachin Tendulkar, India\u2019s most celebrated cricketer, had retired only a week earlier, and Shaw earned an instant comparison with the maestro.",
      "Tendulkar's spectacular rise to eminence following his world record 664-runs partnership with Vinod Kambli in a school game way back in 1987, had inspired quite a few batting prodigies, especially from Mumbai. Shaw was one of them.",
      "A short and stocky opening batsman, Shaw did not have the technical virtuosity Tendulkar had even as a teenager. But he had a gift of timing, and took the attack to the bowlers with such panache that selectors were instantly enamoured.",
      "He was fast-tracked into first-class cricket, like Tendulkar, scoring a century on debut in the domestic Ranji and Duleep Trophy, which hardened comparisons between the two.",
      "In late 2018, he got a Test call-up against the West Indies. Shaw hit 134 off just 154 deliveries, studded with rifle-shot drives, cuts and pulls. He was barely 19. Only Tendulkar among Indians had scored his maiden Test century at a younger age.",
      "Touted as a worthy successor to Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Shaw had the world at his feet. But he's been on a slippery slope since.",
      "Six years after his sensational debut he played in only four more Tests. Add six ODIs and a solitary T20i, it still makes for a dismal aggregate of international appearances for a batsman whose precocity had promised a long, dazzling career.",
      "An unfortunate foot injury, which saw him being sent back from the tour of Australia in 2020 was the start of Shaw's problems. Later that year, he tested positive for a banned substance and was lucky to get away with a light sentence. Thereafter his batting form started declining steadily, touching excellence agonisingly infrequently to impress selectors.",
      "Meanwhile stories of Shaw getting embroiled in wild parties and brawls started to spread. By the middle of IPL 2024, he was on notice, as it were. After the IPL 2025 mega auction, his career seems engulfed in uncertainty.",
      "Injury, illness, and poor form can derail even the best, but those close to Shaw reveal that misfortune has played only a minor role in his precarious downfall.",
      "Ricky Ponting, who as Delhi Capitals coach worked closely with Shaw, says: \"There's only so much [advice] you can give and only so many times you can try [to sort him out] .\"",
      "Former India batsman Praveen Amre, who was assistant coach with Delhi Capitals was more direct. \"Prithvi\u2019s inability to handle IPL fame and money has been his undoing. I\u2019ve talked to him several times, giving him the example of Vinod Kambli who frittered away his career for the lack of discipline,\u2019\u2019 Amre told a national daily.",
      "The IPL has revolutionised young players\u2019 lives, offering a platform for talent and livelihood. Yet, the challenges of early success, instant fame,and rapid wealth remain pressing. Rahul Dravid, drawing on his experience as U-19 and India A coach, has emphasised the need for stronger junior-level mentoring to keep players on track. Shaw\u2019s struggles underscore the importance of his insight.",
      "What the future holds for Shaw time will tell.",
      "At 25, he still has age on his side. But Indian cricket is overflowing with talent, and competition for places is intense. The path from here is all uphill.",
      "\"Some of the greatest sports stories are comeback stories, If Prithvi Shaw has decent people around him who care about his long term success, they\u2019d sit him down, tell him to get off social media & train his absolute backside off in getting super fit. It\u2019ll get him back into the correct path where past success can return. Too talented to throw it all away,\" Former England captain Kevin Pietersen posted on X.",
      "The message to Shaw is clear. Redemption lies in his own hands.",

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 01:18:02 GMT",
    "summary": "President Yoon Suk-yeol's martial law announcement left many Koreans with one thought: not again.",
    "story": [
      "Koh Jae-hak can still vividly remember when he saw policemen gunning down a group of young women in cold blood.",
      "It was April 1960. Students had launched protests calling for the resignation of the dictatorial president Syngman Rhee. Mr Koh was working in a government building when he looked out of the window and saw protesters clashing with police.",
      "\"There were demonstrations from various universities, and they all gathered in front\u2026 that's when shots were fired,\" the 87-year-old said. Days later, martial law was declared.",
      "South Korea is widely considered a peaceful beacon of democracy in Asia, but that wasn't always the case. This is a country that saw 16 bouts of martial law during its first four decades ruled largely by dictators.",
      "It is why democracy is now deeply treasured by South Koreans as a hard-won right. It is also why President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law this week \u2013 the first to happen in 45 years and during democratic rule - was particularly triggering and prompted such a visceral response.",
      "Almost immediately, lawmakers jumped out of bed and rushed to the national assembly, clambering over fences to reverse martial law.",
      "Hundreds of ordinary citizens gathered to hold back troops who had been ordered to throw out MPs.",
      "Some soldiers, apparently unwilling to carry out their orders, reportedly dragged their feet in clearing the crowd and entering the building.",
      "When Yoon declared martial law on Tuesday night, he said it was necessary to get rid of \"pro-North anti-state\" forces. Initially, it caused confusion with some South Koreans who believed there was a genuine threat from the North.",
      "But as they continued watching Yoon's televised announcement, many grew sceptical. He gave no evidence of such forces at work, nor explained who they were. As Yoon had previously used similar language to describe the opposition that had been stymying his reforms, the public concluded he was actually trying to crush his political foes.",
      "Previous periods of martial law had also been justified by leaders as necessary to stabilise the country, and sometimes stamp out what they alleged were communist subversives planted by North Korea.",
      "They curtailed freedom of press and freedom of movement. Night curfews and arrests were common.",
      "Violent clashes sometimes took place, most indelibly in 1980, when then President Chun Doo-hwan extended martial law to deal with student protesters calling for democracy in the southern city of Gwangju. A brutal military crackdown was launched, and it has since been labelled a massacre \u2013 while the official death toll is 193, some experts believe hundreds more died.",
      "South Korea eventually transitioned to democracy in 1988, when the government held its first free and fair presidential election following mounting public pressure. But the preceding decades had permanently and profoundly shaped the nation's consciousness.",
      "\"Most Koreans have trauma, deep trauma, about martial law,\" said Kelly Kim, 53, an environmental activist. \"We don't want to repeat the same thing over and over.\"",
      "Ms Kim was a young child when martial law was last in place and has little memory of it. Still, she shudders at the thought of it returning.",
      "\"The government would control all the media, our normal activities. I'm working in civil society, so all our activities, like criticising the government, would not be possible under the martial law. So that's really horrible.\"",

      "'We had to stop this': Woman who grabbed South Korean soldier's gun speaks to BBC",
      "Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's scandal-hit president who declared martial law",
      "The freedoms afforded by democracy have not just led to a thriving civil society.",
      "In the more than 35 years since that first democratic election, South Korea's creative industries have flourished, with its dramas, TV shows, music and literature becoming world famous. Those creative industries have turned their own lenses onto the country's past, bringing history to life for those too young to remember.",
      "The country has seen a proliferation of shows about its dictatorship past, immortalising incidents such as the Gwangju uprising in popular culture.",
      "Some were blockbusters featuring South Korea's biggest stars, such as last year's 12.12 The Day, a historical drama starring popular actor Hwang Jung-min. The movie depicts the political chaos that took place in 1979 as martial law was declared following the assassination of then president Park Chung-hee.",
      "\"As soon as I saw the images [of Yoon's declaration of martial law], it reminded me of that movie\u2026 it made me question, are we about to repeat that history now?\" said Marina Kang, a 37-year-old web designer.",
      "\"Korea's got a wealth of visual representational works [of that era] in films and documentaries. Though we only have indirect experience of the horrific past through these works\u2026 that still makes me feel very strongly that such events should not happen again.\"",
      "Among younger citizens, there is a sense of disbelief that it could have returned. Despite never knowing life under martial law, they have been taught by their parents and older relatives to fear it.",
      "\"At first [when I heard Yoon's announcement], I was excited at the thought of getting a day off from school. But that joy was fleeting, and I was overwhelmed by the fear of daily life collapsing. I couldn't sleep,\" said 15-year-old Kwon Hoo.",
      "\"My father was concerned that under martial law, he wouldn't be able to stay out late even though his work required him to\u2026 when he heard the news about the possibility of a curfew being imposed again, he started swearing while watching the news.\"",
      "Not all South Koreans feel this way about their past.",
      "\"The vast majority of Koreans appreciate democracy enormously and regret the authoritarianism of the post-war period,\" said Mason Richey, associate professor of international politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.",
      "But, he added, \"the country remains very divided regarding numerous aspects of the authoritarian past, notably how justified certain repressive measures were in order to prevent communist subversion.\"",
      "There is the view among a significant portion of the population, especially among older folk, that martial law was necessary in the past for stability and democracy.",
      "\"Back then, it was a time defined by ideological warfare between democracy and communist socialism,\" said Kang Hyo-san, 83. He was sitting next to his friend Mr Koh in a cafe at Gwanghwamun, Seoul's main square and focal point for the city's protest rallies.",
      "The competing ideologies would lead to clashes and \"when the military intervened, the situation would stabilise\u2026 it was a process to restore order and properly establish free democracy.",
      "\"Given the circumstances, we couldn't help but view it positively,\" he said, adding that he felt each period of martial law left the country in a more \"favourable\" position. Martial law in South Korea \"fundamentally differed\" from other nations, where it \"wasn't about killing people or senseless violence\", he insisted.",
      "But this time, it's different. Both octogenarians felt that Yoon's declaration of martial law was unacceptable. \"Even though we've experienced martial law many times throughout our lives, this time there's no justification for its declaration,\" said Mr Koh.",
      "Like them, Ms Kim, the environmental activist, was glad Yoon did not succeed and democracy prevailed in the end. \"Because we fought so hard to get it, right? We don't want to lose it again.",

      "Teny Geragos, an attorney representing Combs, said in a statement, \"This amended complaint and the recent extortion lawsuit against Mr. Buzbee exposes his barrage of lawsuits against Mr. Combs for what they are: \u00a0shameless publicity stunts, designed to extract payments from celebrities who fear having lies spread about them, just as lies have been spread about Mr. Combs. \u00a0As his legal team has said before, Mr. Combs has full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process. \u00a0In court, the truth will prevail: \u00a0that Mr. Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone\u2014man or woman, adult or minor.\"",
      "Buzbee was sued last month by an anonymous male celebrity, who alleges the lawyer tried to extort payments by threatening to file allegations of sexual assault, which the celebrity denies. Buzbee, in return, denies the extortion allegations.",
      "Buzbee did not immediately respond to a CBS News request for comment. In a statement posted Sunday night on X, Buzbee alleged that Carter was behind the anonymous lawsuit against him.",
      "\"What he fails to say in his recent statement is my firm sent his lawyer a demand letter on behalf of an alleged victim and that victim never demanded a penny from him. Instead, she only sought a confidential mediation,\" Buzbee wrote. \"Since I sent the letter on her behalf, Mr. Carter has not only sued me, but he has tried to bully and harass me and this plaintiff. His conduct has had the opposite impact. She is emboldened. I'm very proud of her resolve.\"",
      "Buzbee also wrote on Instagram that there has been a \"coordinated and aggressive effort\" against him that has included \"filing frivolous cases against me and my law firm, defaming me with outrageous assertions to anyone who will listen, and having mysterious people follow me and my family.\"",
      "\"People will see through this effort to discredit me and my clients and the truth will be revealed. I also won't allow anyone to scare my clients into silence,\" Buzbee wrote.",
      "Combs is currently in custody in New York as he awaits trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His attempts to secure bail have been denied several times.",
      "Combs was arrested in September and charged with sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution, with prosecutors accusing him of using his business empire to engage in repeated abuses over the years. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 16:58:47 -0500",
    "summary": "The game's design nudged people into racking up unauthorized charges, the FTC said. Here's how customers will be refunded.",
    "story": [
      "Fortnite players and other Epic Games customers tricked by the game maker into making unwanted purchases are set to receive refund payments from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).",
      "As part of a settlement first\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2022, the video game maker has been ordered by the FTC to pay $245 million to resolve allegations that it used unlawful billing practices involving design tricks\u00a0known as dark patterns to get players to unintentionally rack up charges. It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date. About half of the first tranche of payments will be made through PayPal, and the other half will be checks. Collectively, customers will receive $72 million in refunds, according to the agency.",
      "How much money will each customer get?",
      "The average payment is around $114, the FTC said. Epic Games customers who are entitled to refunds selected their payment method when they submitted a claim form. Customers who chose to receive PayPal payments have 30 days to redeem the funds, while check recipients have 90 days to cash them.",
      "What did Epic Games do?",
      "The FTC alleges the Fortnite-maker used dark patterns along with a variety of other tactics to trick customers into making unwanted purchases.",
      "For example, a \"counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration\" led Fortnite players to easily incur unwanted charges with the press of a single button, according to the FTC. Additionally, trying to transition the game from sleep to wake mode often triggered unwanted purchases. Other times, pressing an \"adjacent button\" while trying to preview an item led to a charge.",
      "\"As our complaints note, Epic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children,\" FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in December 2022, when the settlement was first announced. \"Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission, and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices.\"",

      "Gomez, who was already a two-time Golden Globe nominee, earned nods this year in the categories for best actress in a musical or comedy TV series and best supporting actress in a motion picture. Mindy Kaling and Morris Chestnut unveiled the nominees in a televised presentation Monday morning at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles.",
      "The best actress nomination went to Gomez for her role in the Hulu mystery series \"Only Murders in the Building,\" which she reprised for a fourth run in August after previously gleaning acclaim for her work on its earlier seasons. Gomez's last two Globe nominations were in the same category for \"Only Murders.\" Her co-stars, Steve Martin and Martin Short, have received equivalent nods in the best actor category each year since the show became eligible for consideration at the awards ceremony.",
      "For best supporting actress, Gomez was nominated for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez,\" the Spanish-language musical thriller from French director Jacques Audiard about a Mexican cartel boss undergoing gender-affirming surgery. Gomez co-starred in the film alongside Zoe Salda\u00f1a, whose performance also earned a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actress in a motion picture.",
      "Gomez praised Salda\u00f1a in a social media post reacting to the nominations.",
      "\"I don't even know what to write.. I'm so proud of @zoesaldana and I am so grateful and honored @goldenglobes,\" she wrote in a video caption  on her Instagram Stories, which captured the moment Gomez heard her name in the category for best supporting actress in a movie.",

(Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, who plays the titular character, was also nominated.) \"Only Murders\" is also a top competitor, with four nods tying the show in second place among TV contenders. It is tied with \"Sh\u014dgun\" and second only to \"The Bear.\"",
      "Gomez called out Gasc\u00f3n in another Instagram post, along with the French composers Cl\u00e9ment Ducol and Camille, who worked on \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" and received Golden Globe nominations for best original song and score.",
      "\"@karsiagascon mi amor I am so proud and grateful to know you!\" Gomez wrote, before congratulating Audiard, Ducol and Camille.",
      "Nominating an actor in two categories for their work in multiple projects at one awards show is uncommon, but it has happened at the Golden Globes before. Over the last decade, Amy Adams, Regina King and Alicia Vikander are just some of the celebrities who have competed in dual Globes races during a single year. Among the pool of 2025 nominees, Gomez and Sebastian Stan were the only actors recognized in multiple acting categories for multiple roles.",
      "Stan, of \"Pam & Tommy\" fame, was nominated in the best actor categories for musical or comedy film as well as drama. He received the nods for his lead roles in the dark comedy \"A Different Man\" and the controversial biopic \"The Apprentice,\" where he portrayed a young Donald Trump.",

      "The packed house Sunday night danced in the aisles to the bouncy beat after a night of honoring the Dead and other recipients of the lifetime achievement award for artistic accomplishment: director\u00a0Francis Ford Coppola,\u00a0jazz trumpeter\u00a0Arturo Sandoval\u00a0and singer-songwriter\u00a0Bonnie Raitt.\u00a0The venerable Harlem theater\u00a0The Apollo, which has launched generations of Black artists, also was recognized.",
      "Longtime Deadheads, including actors Miles Teller and Chloe Sevigny and talk show host David Letterman, paid tribute to the band's blend of musical experimentation, longevity and community-building. \"Their music fills the universe,\" Letterman proclaimed.",
      "The choice to honor The Apollo was an unusual one: the first time the Kennedy Center has chosen to honor a specific performance venue.",
      "\"The Apollo means so much to so many of us,\" Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said while arriving on the red carpet. Moore pointed to iconic Apollo performances from Lauryn Hill and a young Michael Jackson as treasured memories of his youth.",
      "The tribute to The Apollo highlighted the sheer diversity of art forms showcased at the 90-year-old theater. Savion Glover did a spirited tap dance routine; husband and wife duo The War and Treaty performed a medley of hits by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell; and comedian Dave Chappelle recounted his terrifying first Apollo performance at age 15.",
      "\"Everybody started booing. It was like I was outside my body watching,\" he said. Eventually Chappelle was rushed off the stage by the theater's infamous \"Sandman,\" but he credited the experience with helping him overcome his fear of bombing.",

      "\"I've brought a massive box of Kleenex and my waterproof eyeliner,\" she laughed.",

      "\"What Francis does creatively is jump off cliffs,\" Lucas said. \"When you spend enough time with Francis, you begin to believe you can jump off cliffs, too.\"",
      "Sandoval's tribute featured multiple performances from an all-star band featuring Trombone Shorty and pianist Chucho Valdez from Sandoval's original band, plus a flamenco dance performance by Timo Nunez. It also included a bit of light roast comedy from actor Andy Garcia.",
      "\"Arturo spoke very little English when he first came to America from Cuba all those years ago,\" Garcia said. \"But now his English ... is much worse.\"",
      "The tribute performances are often kept secret from the recipients themselves, most notably in 2018 when Cyndi Lauper flat-out lied to her longtime friend Cher about being unable to attend. Lauper appeared on stage to perform Cher's hit, \"If I Could Turn Back Time.\"",
      "At a ceremony at the White House before attending the awards event itself, President Biden praised each honoree. He also had De Niro, who was in the audience, stand before declaring, \"If I get in trouble, I'm coming to you pal.\"",
      "De Niro grinned and nodded and others in attendance, including the honorees, laughed at what appeared to be a reference to De Niro sometimes playing hardnosed enforcers in movies like \"The Godfather.\" But Biden actually meant he might seek the actor's help for post-presidency career advice.",

      "During Donald Trump's first four years in office, Kennedy Center officials were forced to walk a public tightrope between the tradition of the president attending the ceremony and the open antipathy toward Trump from multiple honorees. In 2017, recipient Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump, who takes office in January, skipped the ceremony for the entirety of his first term.",

It's hard to imagine not seeing him smiling throughout the halls. We will miss him dearly. Our heart goes out to his family as we all send them our prayers.\"",

Steve loved flying, and he loved that plane; he took so much pride in it. Steve Mensch was truly a kind soul and a great leader at the studio. We all adored him and are devastated that he's gone. I'm praying for his family as we all try to make sense of this heartbreak.\"",

Perry hired Mensch to help create and run his namesake studio in 2016. The studio sprawls across 330 acres of a former Army base in southern Atlanta that Perry acquired in 2015.",
      "Mensch died on the same day that Perry released \"The Six Triple Eight,\" a war drama about a mostly Black and all-female World War II battalion. The film was shot at the Atlanta studio.",

    "story": [
      "On Wednesday nights, the Apollo Theater in Harlem is one of the hottest tickets in town. But there's no celebrity headliner. It's Amateur Night! And the audience is there to pick the NEXT breakout star.",
      "\"I know how tough the crowd can be,\" said Kyle Parks, a 23-year-old singer from Yonkers, New York. \"I know that's what makes this place legendary, what goes into it.\"",
      "Parks won the crowd over with his performance of \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" by Sam Cooke. Others ... weren't so lucky. Marion Caffey, longtime producer of the Apollo's iconic Amateur Night, said, \"They're brutally honest. And just sometimes just brutal, not necessarily honest!\"",
      "Caffey says it's the longest-running singing competition in history. \"Well, 'The Voice,' and 'America's Got Talent,' and 'American Idol,' and 'Star Search,' we are the great-grandfather of all of that,\" he said. \"This was the blueprint.\"",
      "The theater's motto is \"Where stars are born and legends are made\"\u2026 and it's launched plenty of them, from James Brown and Ella Fitzgerald, to Stevie Wonder, Lauryn Hill and H.E.R.",
      "And if you're wondering why every performer rubs that tree stump, according to Caffey, \"This stump used to be a full tree. And it stood outside the Lafayette Theater. And they would pull leaves from the tree for good luck. And now everyone comes here and rubs the Tree of Hope for good luck.\"",
      "Does it work? \"Well, I think it's good luck if you win, and it's not such good luck if you lose,\" Caffey said.",
      "But it worked for the award-winning singer Dionne Warwick, whose career skyrocketed since she and her gospel group won Amateur Night back in 1958.",
      "What did winning prove to her? \"Well, that we were good enough, first of all,\" Warwick said. \"And that we won $50!\"",
      "Warwick said going to the 1,500-seat theater was like going to school and getting a crash course in performing: \"The old saying is true, it is so true: 'If you can make it at the Apollo, you can make it anywhere.' They brought out the very best in you. Every single time I played the Apollo, it got better and better and better. And I mean, I felt like I was at home.\"",
      "But it wasn't always welcoming. Before it was the Apollo, it was a whites-only burlesque theater. In 1934, under new ownership and a new name, it opened its doors to everyone. Music historian Guthrie Ramsey said, \"It was one of the first to allow Black and white patrons to enjoy the music together. After all, it's New York City, and the Black community was growing. And so, it was basically a business model decision to allow Black citizens in.\"",
      "Ramsey says the story of the Apollo and the story of America are intertwined. \"It was a representative of anything that was going on in America, you could see the Apollo Theater reflecting that,\" he said. \"It's all of our histories. We all have a stake in it.\"",
      "During the civil rights movement, the Apollo became more than just a performance space. Motown great Smokey Robinson said, \"Sittin' in and marching and doing all this, and going to restaurants and they don't wanna serve us, and all that, we couldn't stay in any hotels \u2013 it was a rough time, you know?\"",
      "But the Apollo was like a beacon. \"It was the beacon,\" Robinson said. \"It was the Black music staple. It was just, you know, where the Black acts came. Couldn't play nowhere else!\"",
      "Robinson says the first time he and The Miracles performed here, he was a nervous wreck. They bombed! \u00a0\"I was frightened to death to be at the Apollo Theater,\" he said. \"Had we not had a record out and supposedly be 'professional' at that point, that the guy with the hook would have came and took us off the stage, because we were terrible!\" he laughed. \"We were just amateurs, we were so terrible, until Mr. Schiffman, the guy who owned the Apollo at that time, called Berry Gordy, who was our manager and stuff at that point, and told him he wanted his money back!\"",
      "In the decades that followed, as more places became integrated, the Apollo struggled financially, and closed its doors more than once. \"We could've lost the Apollo, but we're still here,\" said actress and singer Melba Moore. She says she grew up watching shows at the theater, and then got a chance to perform here \u2013 and later became a guest host on \"It's Showtime at the Apollo,\" the TV version of Amateur Night.",
      "Moore says this theater is something to be treasured.",
      "Tonight, the Apollo Theater is being awarded a prestigious Kennedy Center Honor at a ceremony that we'll see later this month on CBS.",
      "Michelle Ebanks, president and CEO of the theater, says it's the first time an institution (rather than a person) has received such recognition. \"The idea of the Apollo opened up this whole universe, so that everyone could see this is American culture, too,\" Ebanks said. \"This is the magic of art, the power of art.\"",
      "This is also the year the theater begins its 90th season. And to Smokey Robinson, the Apollo is still a force to be reckoned with. \"You know, it's the beginning. It's the proving ground. It's the Apollo!\"",

    "story": [
      "\"Squid Game\" fans know that trumpet wakeup call means someone is going to die. Not our hero, Gi-hun, but one or more of the players hoping to win a fortune competing in childish, but lethal, games. It's at once a thriller and a critique of inequality and greed.",
      "Season 1 was an international blockbuster. With 330 million views, it's Netflix's most-watched series of all time. It won Emmys for its lead actor, Lee Jung-jae, and creator Hwang Dong-hyuk. Both made history as the first Asian winners in their categories.",
      "We first spoke with Hwang in Korea just as he was about to start a global promotional tour for Season 2.",
      "\"So, you are kind of in a sweet spot now?\" I asked.",
      "\"I don't know what you mean by 'sweet spot,'\" Hwang replied.",
      "\"Just that things are going your way?\"",
      "\"But it's not easy. Nothing's easy,\" he said. \"People keep saying to me, 'You are the happiest person in Korea.' But in my mind, I am not that happy. I'm struggling every day and night.\"",
      "That's thanks to a brutal workload: Hwang directed and wrote every episode. Sworn to secrecy, \"Sunday Morning\" was invited to a soundstage outside Seoul where much of Season 2 was shot.",
      "Hwang was at the top of his game, but it wasn't always that way. He was only five when his father died. After that, he says, his family was trapped in poverty. As a struggling filmmaker, and in debt, Hwang said he sought escape in comic books. \"I read a lot in the survival game genre and gambling genre,\" he said. \"And that led me to think, what if I were to combine childhood games with people putting their lives at stake for a huge cash prize? And that was really how the idea was conceived.\"",
      "And a blockbuster was born.",
      "In the show, contestants driven by desperation risk everything for money, exploited by a sinister game master, the powerful Front Man.",
      "Asked if \"Squid Game\" represents how he sees capitalists and capitalism in general - a group of desperate people manipulated by a cruel and wealthy elite - Hwang replied, \"I think fundamentally what continues to drive this system is human selfishness and greed. These days I'm becoming more pessimistic about human nature. I almost think that, for homo sapiens, it's greed that allows them to create a society that they feel most comfortable in.\"",
      "Many of the characters in Season 2 are new (Hwang having killed off so many of them in Season 1), but the guards are back, and so is Gi-hun, now on a doomed mission to stop the game.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Squid Game: Season 2\" click on the video player below:",
      "Hwang said that \"Squid Game\" Seasons 2 and 3 \"will show people the bottom of this world, the bottom of the human being.\"",
      "So, it gets even darker? \"Yeah, it's getting darker, episode by episode,\" Hwang said.",
      "The show is so popular that recently 50,000 people applied for a chance to take part in a real-life (but non-deadly) Squid Game in Paris. The prize: an early look at the new season.",
      "Hwang is amazed, especially by his show's wild success in the U.S., where audiences have not traditionally gone for a subtitled TV series: \"I was always hoping to make something very popular in the States, so I was surprised,\" he said. \"At the same time there was, like, in my dream come true. But that level of success [was] just beyond my expectations.\"",
      "Ironically, this creator of a dystopian parable about desperation and poverty now finds himself a wealthy man \u2013 one of the great winners of capitalism. Has that changed him? \"Not much,\" he said. \"Made my life better, for sure, because I don't have to worry about [making] money anymore. But since then, I don't think I was changed a lot by more success or more money, because it's just a number. It doesn't have any meaning to me at all.\"",
      "What does have meaning is his work. But the success and the pressure of \"Squid Game\" have taken a toll: \"It's more than, like, five years I've been just working on this one project, day and night. I'm so exhausted. I'm so sick of, you know?\" he laughed. \"I need a break, I need a break.\"",
      "A break from non-stop work \u2026 and from his deep dive into the dark depths of human nature.",

    "story": [
      "At the open of a Billie Eilish concert, a giant light box rises in the arena. \"Spoiler alert! I'm in the cube, but you can't see me,\" she said. \"I can literally see everybody so well from inside this box, but they have no idea I can see them. It feels like I'm wearing an invisibility cloak.\"",
      "\"That's a luxury you don't have most of the time,\" I said.",
      "\"That's true!\" she laughed. \"But it also makes me feel a little like I'm not real?\"",
      "Her whole career has been kind of unreal. Eilish, who turns 23 this month, has more than 100 million followers on Spotify, an ardent fan base that filled the United Center in Chicago.",
      "A few hours before showtime, Eilish was scurrying around backstage, introducing us to her backup singers \u2026 her band \u2026 and taking us to a room full of rescue dogs, who offer stress relief. \"Welcome to the puppy room!\" she said. A couple have already been adopted.",
      "She's filled her crew with friends (even the furry kind) because this tour is different. Since Eilish broke out at 14, her older brother, Finneas, has been her producer, songwriting partner and backing band. For the first time, she's on tour without him. \"I've never done a show without my brother in my life,\" she said. \"I mean, I've barely performed and sung without my brother, like, ever.\"",
      "But they agreed it was time for her to go out on her own. Finneas told us, \"I was built into the show for several years in an irreplaceable way. And I always kind of was trying to make myself replaceable.\"",
      "Her mom, Maggie Baird, came to the Chicago show. But Eilish's parents also aren't touring with her anymore. \"It does feel strange, yeah,\" Baird said. \"But it also feels okay. And there's also a lot of jobs I used to do where I'm like, I'm happy I don't have to do that one anymore!\"",
      "\"Honestly, she won't admit it, but I think it's been really nice for her that I've been gone,\" Billie laughed. \"And that then she can come see me and it's not just, like, her whole life. I mean, I've been her whole life for, like, 23 years now.\"",
      "\"Pretty good life, though,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, a lot! But, yeah\u2026\"",
      "Earlier this year, Eilish won her second Oscar for the \"Barbie\" theme, \"What Was I Made For.\" She already has nine Grammys, and now another seven nominations. Among her nominations are record of the year and song of the year, for a song (\"Birds of a Feather\") that she almost didn't put on her album.",
      "Billie and Finneas had struggled with the song. \"We wrote, like, the first half and it was super-good,\" she said. \"And then we overthought it for, like, months and months and months.\"",
      "I asked, \"When you sing it, do you hear all that you went through to create it?\"",
      "\"Sometimes,\" she replied. \"Sometimes when I listen to it, I hear certain parts that I'm like, 'Oh, that was such a nightmare! That was so punishing!'\"",
      "Watch Billie Eilish perform \"Birds of a Feather\":",
      "Eilish admits that, until recently, she didn't think of herself so much as a songwriter. That has changed. \"I did, like, way more writing on this album than anything ever,\" she said. \"But this is the thing I'm trying to say: I've been writing music since I was 11. But because I wasn't as fast at it, or wasn't as good, as my brother, I kind of thought, 'Oh, I'm not a songwriter.'\"",
      "But when they sat down to write Billie's third album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft,\" Finneas felt uninspired.",
      "\"We'd get in the studio to write and I'd be, like, 'Can we go play pickleball?'\" he said. \"I think I just sort of had a little fatigue there.\"",
      "Billie said they were in \"different places,\" and that she felt alone. In the past, Finneas would help pull a lyric out of his sister. This time, she had to coax the words out of herself. \"And then, in just being given that space, I'd come up with it,\" she said.",
      "On the last chorus of \"Birds of a Feather,\" Eilish reached for a note she wasn't sure she could hit.\u00a0 Her vocal bravery came after she started taking singing lessons.",
      "I asked, \"Have you found some part of yourself you didn't even know was there?\"",
      "\"Yeah! Oh, yeah. I mean, my voice!\" she laughed. \"I can't express how gratifying, and satisfying, and fulfilling it has been to, like, learn these things about my own voice \u2013 that's in my body \u2013 that I didn't even know I was capable of. \u2026 It's so liberating.\"",

    "title": "Daniel Craig on \"Queer\" and its depiction of yearning",
    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 09:39:45 -0500",
    "summary": "In the adaptation of William S. Burroughs' novella \"Queer,\" Daniel Craig plays William Lee, an American alcoholic and heroin addict living in 1950s Mexico City, who becomes infatuated with a much younger fellow expatriate.",
    "story": [
      "Daniel Craig is back on the big screen \u2013 not as 007, or the smooth Southern private investigator in the \"Knives Out\" movies, but in the movie \"Queer,\" directed by Luca Guadagnino. Craig plays William Lee, an American living in 1950s Mexico City, who becomes infatuated with Eugene Allerton, another much younger expatriate (played by Drew Starkey).",
      "In one tender and poignant scene, a translucent image of Lee is seen leaning over towards Allerton. \"The sort of invisible hand,\" Craig described it. \"is what you're talking about \u2013 [something] you hope would happen, yes. The yearning \u2013 and hope is a really good word \u2013 that something will become of it. Maybe it's falling in love.\"",
      "Craig's character is an alcoholic and heroin addict, and undeterred by the reticence of Allerton.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think that your character Lee is especially ardent in his overture because the Allerton character is aloof?\"",
      "\"Maybe, maybe,\" Craig replied. \"I also think that he's searching \u2013 clearly from the top of the movie, he's searching for something. And he finds Allerton. And he thinks this is it, this is the one, so therefore he throws everything at it \u2013 probably awkwardly, and embarrasses himself in the process.\"",
      "\"When you walk into the bar and do that bow, that's (as the young people say) 'very cringe.'\"",
      "\"Yes. Is that what they say? Yes, it is very cringe!\" Craig laughed. \"Yeah, yeah. But that sung to me. I've been in situations like that certainly when I was younger, of trying to impress and trying to be kind of that person, and just failing miserably. That really rang out to me.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Queer\" click on the video player below:",
      "The movie is based on the book \"Queer,\" Beat writer William S. Burroughs' semi-autobiographical account of his own time in Latin America.",
      "Craig's latest role harkens back to the grittier parts he was known for in Britain pre-James Bond, such as \"Other Voices,\" \"Sylvia,\" \"Infamous\" and \"Layer Cake.\"",
      "Daniel Craig was born in the north of England, and at 6 years old saw his first stage production. He was introduced to the theater by his mother: \"We lived in Liverpool in the '70s. There was a theater called the Everyman, it's still there. They had cheap tickets so everybody could go. A lot of my mum's friends were designers and costume designers and worked backstage. She was a single mum, and we spent most of our time there.\"",
      "\"Was it magical to you?\"",
      "\"It was, yeah,\" Craig said. \"I think that's the moment I said, 'I wanna be an actor.' I mean, these people would walk off stage, and I'd see them in the bar afterwards. And I'd think they were gods, and they were just drunk!\"",
      "His mother's love for theater, it turned out, ran deeper than her son realized. He found out later that, as a young woman, she had been accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, one of the world's great acting schools. \"Yeah, she was, and she hadn't told me,\" Craig said. \"But they couldn't afford to go, so she had to go home, and went to art college instead up North.\"",
      "He was moved once he found out: \"She's always encouraged me. I mean, she sort of gently kicked me out the door, to say, 'Go, get on with it.' All the drama schools are in London, everything that was happening, and she said, 'You gotta go.' I left and went.\"",
      "He was only 16. \"She realized I was failing so badly at school, there was really no other option, I think!\" Craig laughed.",
      "He hasn't just been successful; he's one of the most recognized actors on the planet, whether he likes that or not.",
      "I asked, \"We interview a lot of big name actors on this show, and a lot of them say they don't like being famous. And it's not that I don't believe it, but I need to understand: what does being famous do to your brain?\"",
      "\"Oh God, well, that's the big question,\" Craig replied. \"It can do all sorts of wonderful things, of course, and as an actor, why did I become an actor? Because I like dressing up and showing off and I want people to like me. I mean, it's like, you want to sort of distill it down to its absolute basics. But what does fame do? I think fame can take you off in all sorts of weird and strange and not very healthy directions.\"",
      "\"It's gotta make acting harder in a way, because you can't, for instance, easily go on the subway and just look at the person across from you and kind of observe life around you?\"",
      "\"People watching, yes. Yeah, I did it a lot when I was younger, so I've got a lot in the bank!\"",
      "Daniel Craig has always been known for his intensity. But at 56, his next chapter might not be quite as physically rigorous, being 20 years older than when he was first cast as 007 in \"Casino Royale.\" \"God, remind me, why don't you?\" he laughed. \"Life is pain! And that's why I wanted to stop, one of the reasons I wanted to stop, because I'd throw myself into those movies, each one. From the very beginning I've been wanting to do as many stunts and as many of the action sequences as I possibly can. And I've injured myself. And I don't wanna do that. I don't want to take that risk anymore. I've got kids and I've got a life. And I want to spend the rest of my life upright if I can.\"",
      "\"Upright, sort of conserving your energy for them?\"",
      "\"Well, standing! Yeah, on my own two feet, as opposed to being wheeled around!\"",

    "summary": "Heritage Auctions had estimated the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in \"The Wizard of Oz\" would fetch $3 million or more.",
    "story": [
      "A pair of iconic ruby slippers that were worn by Judy Garland in \"The Wizard of Oz\" \u2014 and stolen from a museum nearly two decades ago \u2014 fetched $28 million in an auction Saturday.",
      "Robert Wilonsky, a vice president with the Dallas-based auction house, told CBS News in an email that, with the buyer's premium \u2014 a commission that the buyer pays \u2014 the slippers sold for a total of $32.5 million.",
      "Heritage Auctions had estimated that the slippers would fetch $3 million or more. Online bidding opened last month and by Friday had reached $1.55 million, or $1.91 million including the buyer's premium, Wilonsky said. Over 800 people were tracking the slippers, and the company's\u00a0web page for the auction\u00a0had hit nearly 43,000 page views by Thursday, he said.",
      "As Rhys Thomas, author of the book, \"The Ruby Slippers of Oz,\" puts it, the sequined shoes from the beloved 1939 musical have seen \"more twists and turns than the Yellow Brick Road.\"",
      "They were on display at the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 2005 when Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum's door and display case.",
      "Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018. Martin, now 77, who lives near Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota, wasn't publicly exposed as the thief until he was indicted in May 2023. He pleaded guilty in October 2023. Martin admitted he used a small sledgehammer to break into the museum. He then used the tool to crack the case the slippers were in and take them. He said he didn't hear any alarm. He took off in his car and kept them in a trailer adjacent to his home.",
      "He was in a wheelchair and on supplementary oxygen when he was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",
      "His attorney, Dane DeKrey, explained ahead of sentencing that Martin, who had a long history of burglary and receiving stolen property, was attempting to pull off \"one last score\" after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But a fence \u2014 a person who buys stolen goods \u2014 later told him the rubies were just glass, DeKrey said. So Martin got rid of the slippers. The attorney didn't specify how.",
      "The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of the Minneapolis suburb of Crystal, was indicted in March. He was also in a wheelchair and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance. He's scheduled to go on trial in January and hasn't entered a plea, though his attorney has said he's not guilty.",
      "The shoes were returned in February to memorabilia collector Michael Shaw, who had loaned them to the museum. They were one of several pairs that Garland wore during the filming, but only four pairs are known to have survived. In the movie, to return from Oz to Kansas, Dorothy had to click her heels three times and repeat, \"There's no place like home.\"",
      "Among those bidding was the Judy Garland Museum. The city of Grand Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival to supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to help the museum purchase the slippers.",
      "\"The Wizard of Oz\" story has gained new attention in recent weeks with the release of the movie \"Wicked,\" an adaptation of the megahit Broadway musical, a prequel of sorts that reimagines the character of the Wicked Witch of the West.",
      "The auction also included other memorabilia from \"The Wizard of Oz,\" including a hat worn by Margaret Hamilton, who played the original Wicked Witch of the West.",

      "Sick people's samples were collected from Oct. 24, 2021, to Oct. 28, 2024, the agency said.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 10:25:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Consumers are venting frustrations about health insurance in wake of UnitedHealthcare CEO murder. Costs have outpaced inflation for years.",
    "story": [
      "Health insurance costs are far outpacing inflation, leaving more consumers on the hook each year for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time, some insurers are rejecting nearly 1 in 5 claims. That double whammy is leaving Americans paying more for coverage yet sometimes feeling like they're getting less in return, experts say.",
      "Frustration over denials and medical costs has fueled an outpouring of vitriol against health insurance companies in the wake of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also last week, a similar outcry led Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to reverse a\u00a0decision\u00a0to limit anesthesia coverage during surgeries.",
      "The anger may be rooted in fears that unexpected medical costs could prove financially ruinous, as well as concerns that essential care could be denied by an insurer, putting health and well-being at risk even for those who have health insurance.",
      "Some of those anxieties are well-founded: The top\u00a0cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. is health care-related debt, underscoring the financial stresses that can stem from high medical costs.",
      "In fact, most adults say they worry about their ability to pay for health care services or unexpected medical bills, a sentiment shared by people regardless of whether they're financially comfortable or struggling, a KFF survey found earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, the average health insurance premium for families carried a price tag of $25,572 per year, while single workers paid an average of $8,951, representing a 6% and 7% increase from the year earlier, KFF data shows. Since 2000, the rise in health insurance premiums has outpaced inflation for all but a handful of years, the health policy research firm found.",
      "\"Unhappiness with insurers stems from two things: 'I'm sick and I'm getting hassled,' and the second is very much cost \u2014 'I'm paying more than I used to, and I'm paying more than my wages went up',\" said Rob Andrews, CEO of the Health Transformation Alliance, a cooperative representing major companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola that works on improving health insurance for their employees. \"A lot of people think they are getting less\" from their insurers, Andrews said.",
      "And while Americans have unhappily encountered other types of inflation in recent years \u2014\u00a0sky-high grocery prices\u00a0have been credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory last month \u2014 health insurance can take on an even more personal edge, Thomas pointed out.",
      "\"It's not like, 'How much do I have to pay for a lawn chair or a steak,'\" Andrews noted. \"People are sick or having some sort of health problem they are worried about.\"",
      "To be sure, people with employer-sponsored health insurance typically don't pay the full premium, as their employers pick up much of the tab.",
      "Yet KFF data shows that employees' share of their premiums are also on the rise, with a worker with family coverage typically paying premiums of $5,700 per year in 2017, the most recent year for that data, up from about $1,600 in 2000, KFF data shows. The average family deductible \u2014 the amount paid out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \u2014 has increased from $2,500 in 2013 to $3,700 in 2023, according to KFF.",
      "About 81% of Americans last year said they were dissatisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S, a 16-year high, Gallup polling found.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings on Friday.",
      "Health insurance denials",
      "Aside from rising health insurance costs, Americans are also expressing anger at coverage denials, which a KFF analysis of nongroup qualified health plans in 2021 found impacted almost 1 in 5 claims. However, their study found denial rates varied considerably by insurer, with some as low as 2% while others were as high as 49%.",
      "\"When you are paying for something, and then they don't give it to you and they keep raising prices, of course you will be frustrated by that,\" noted Holden Karau, a software engineer who created a free service called\u00a0Fight Health Insurance to help people appeal their denials.",
      "Karau says she came up with the app, which uses AI to craft appeal letters, after her own and her dog's experience with insurance. Her pet insurer initially refused to pay for anesthesia for her dog's root canal, while Karau, who is transgender, said she dealt with many appeals to get her own procedures and surgeries covered by her insurance.",
      "More insurance companies are using AI to review claims and issue denials, which isn't always obvious to consumers. The shift to AI-based reviews has sparked lawsuits against insurers, with UnitedHealthcare sued last year by the families of two now-deceased customers who alleged the insurer knowingly used a faulty algorithm to deny elderly patients coverage for extended care deemed necessary by their doctors.",
      "\"With AI tools on the insurance side, they have very little negative consequences for denying procedures,\" Karau added. \"We are seeing really high denial rates triggered by AI. And on the patient and provider side, they don't have the tools to fight back.\"",
      "Most people may not be aware that they have the right to appeal a denial, Karau noted. The majority of people who are hit with a denial or billing errors don't contest, a study found earlier this year. For those that do, a first appeal will be dealt with by the insurer, but if that in-house appeal is also denied, you have the right to ask for an independent reviewer to look at your claim, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.",
      "\"There are multiple levels of appeal, and in my experience, I would say it's important to appeal until you at least get to an independent reviewer,\" Karau said. \"If you don't appeal, you won't get the care you need.\"",

    "summary": "Even those enrolled in Medicare have a harder time paying for treatment compared with older adults in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.S., having health insurance is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to affordable medical care.",
      "While the U.S. lacks a universal health care system like those that exist in most other wealthy nations, most Americans over 65 are insured through Medicare. Yet many still struggle to afford care, with high out-of-pocket costs putting necessary medications and doctor visits out of reach, according to\u00a0research from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that works to promote an equitable health care system.",
      "These extra costs, for which Medicare beneficiaries are on the hook, make it harder for older Americans to access affordable care relative to their peers in nine other countries, the group found. Researchers compared coverage for older adults in the U.S. to health care systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
      "Nearly one in four older adults in the U.S. spent at least $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year, compared to less than 5% of older adults in France and the Netherlands who spent that much, The Commonwealth Fund found. Only in Switzerland did older adults report spending more on health care than those in the U.S.",
      "\"The reason to focus on this population is because in the U.S. nearly every adult over 65 has Medicare,\" Munira Z. Gunja, senior researcher for international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund told CBS MoneyWatch. While the U.S. stands out as \"the only high-income country without a universal health system,\" when it comes to the over-65 population, \"at least, we are on par with other countries,\" she said.",
      "Does Medicare fall short?",
      "But the study suggests that the kind of coverage Medicare plans provide isn't meeting many Americans' needs. Eight percent of older adults in the U.S., more than any other wealthy country except Austria, reported delaying or forgoing medical care because of costs. And there are repercussions to not getting the care one needs: One-third of older U.S. adults who said they faced cost-related barriers to accessing care reported being either in fair or poor health.",
      "\"We find that while nearly every older adult has Medicare coverage, it is still more expensive than what older adults in other nations face, and because of that, older adults in the U.S. are more likely to skip care,\" Gunja said. \"When they need prescription drugs, they are more likely to skip getting those too.\"",
      "Oftentimes, for example, Medicare Advantage members find themselves seeing out-of-network doctors, which exposes them to \"a ton of health care costs,\" according to Gunja.",
      "One exception",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 13:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Anthem will reverse a policy that would have capped insurance coverage for anesthesia after objections from doctors and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday that the health insurance provider is reversing a policy that was set to go into effect in February that would have limited anesthesia coverage during surgeries and other procedures, a change that had prompted an outcry from some physicians and lawmakers.",
      "The policy, which would have covered Anthem's plans in Connecticut, New York and Missouri, was disclosed in recent weeks, with the company's New York unit posting a\u00a0notice on Dec. 1. The policy would have excluded people under 22 years old and maternity care.",
      "According to the original policy statement, Anthem had said it would pay only for anesthesia treatments for the length of time that a procedure or surgery is estimated to require based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's physician work time values. The insurer noted that claims for anesthesia \"above the established number of minutes will be denied.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News on Thursday, Anthem said it was backing away from the policy, and added there had been \"widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy.\"",
      "\"As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change,\" an Anthem spokesperson wrote in an email. \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\"",
      "Before the announcement of Anthem's reversal, the plan had drawn criticism from medical professionals as well as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, who wrote on social media on Wednesday that the plan is \"appalling.\"",
      "\"Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt.   And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?\" Murphy wrote. \"Reverse this decision immediately.\"",
      "Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon told the Hartford Courant Thursday that the policy would not take place in his state after negotiating with the insurer.",
      "\"After hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I'm pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\" Scanlon told the newspaper.",
      "\"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers\"",
      "In a statement last month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists also called on Anthem to reverse the policy.",
      "\"With this new policy, Anthem will arbitrarily pre-determine the time allowed for anesthesia care during a surgery or procedure,\" the group said. \"If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem's limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist's care.\"",
      "The insurer's new policy could result in denials of coverage to patients who might need more anesthesia because their surgery is difficult or unusual, or if a complication occurs, the group added.",
      "\"This is just the latest in a long line of appalling behavior by commercial health insurers looking to drive their profits up at the expense of patients and physicians providing essential care,\" said Donald E. Arnold, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. \"This egregious policy breaks the trust between Anthem and its policyholders who expect their health insurer to pay physicians for the entirety of the care they need.\"",

      "At least 364 pertussis infections were reported to health authorities last week, according to figures published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, marking the worst Thanksgiving week for whooping cough in recent decades.",
      "This tops the previous Thanksgiving record of 228 cases of pertussis which were reported for the week ending Nov. 27, 2010. That year there were 27,550 cases reported by the end of 2010, below the 28,167 already tallied so far this year.",
      "Thanksgiving usually sees a slowdown in cases reported across most diseases, because of delays in testing and reporting around the holiday as well as changes in people going to the doctor.",

      "Around 63% of their cases have been in schoolchildren and 12% are in daycares, Thomas said. The department often finds out about outbreaks first from school nurses, warning of large numbers of kids calling out sick with whooping cough.",
      "Thomas said doctors have been seeing high pertussis case counts for months, larger than the wave they saw last year.",
      "\"We had an increase in cases last fall, but nothing compared to this fall. And when we first started noticing a really significant increase was about the time that kids went back to school, so about the middle of August,\" said Thomas.",
      "Thomas said that the vast majority of reported cases in the county have said they were vaccinated for pertussis, though it is unclear if everyone was up-to-date on the shots. A third of cases have been in teens, who are recommended to have gotten a booster dose by age 12.",

    "summary": "The 93-year-old media mogul has argued family trust must be changed to allow Lachlan Murdoch to maintain Fox News' conservative bent.",
    "story": [
      "A probate commissioner has ruled against Rupert Murdoch's effort to change his family's trust to give one of his sons control of his media empire and ensure Fox News maintains its conservative editorial slant, according to a sealed document obtained by The New York Times.",
      "In a decision filed on Saturday, a probate commissioner in Nevada concluded that Murdoch, 93, and his son, Lachlan Murdoch, had acted in \"bad faith\" in their endeavor to amend the irrevocable trust, The New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0on Monday.",
      "The trust divides control of the company equally among four of Rupert Murdoch's children \u2014 Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James \u2014 after he dies. Lachlan Murdoch has been the head of Fox News and News Corp since late last year, when his father stepped down.",
      "The elder Murdoch has argued that to preserve his businesses' commercial value for all his heirs, the trust must be changed to allow Lachlan Murdoch to maintain Fox News' conservative bent. James and Elisabeth Murdoch are both known to have less-conservative political views than their father or brother, potentially complicating efforts to ensure that Fox News remains conservative.",
      "In his 96-page opinion, Nevada Probate Commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr. of the Second Judicial District Court characterized the plan to change the trust as a \"carefully crafted charade\" to \"permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch's executive roles\" inside the empire \"regardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries\" of the family trust.",

    "summary": "Consumers are venting frustrations about health insurance in wake of UnitedHealthcare CEO murder. Costs have outpaced inflation for years.",
    "story": [
      "Health insurance costs are far outpacing inflation, leaving more consumers on the hook each year for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time, some insurers are rejecting nearly 1 in 5 claims. That double whammy is leaving Americans paying more for coverage yet sometimes feeling like they're getting less in return, experts say.",
      "Frustration over denials and medical costs has fueled an outpouring of vitriol against health insurance companies in the wake of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also last week, a similar outcry led Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to reverse a\u00a0decision\u00a0to limit anesthesia coverage during surgeries.",
      "The anger may be rooted in fears that unexpected medical costs could prove financially ruinous, as well as concerns that essential care could be denied by an insurer, putting health and well-being at risk even for those who have health insurance.",
      "Some of those anxieties are well-founded: The top\u00a0cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. is health care-related debt, underscoring the financial stresses that can stem from high medical costs.",
      "In fact, most adults say they worry about their ability to pay for health care services or unexpected medical bills, a sentiment shared by people regardless of whether they're financially comfortable or struggling, a KFF survey found earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, the average health insurance premium for families carried a price tag of $25,572 per year, while single workers paid an average of $8,951, representing a 6% and 7% increase from the year earlier, KFF data shows. Since 2000, the rise in health insurance premiums has outpaced inflation for all but a handful of years, the health policy research firm found.",
      "\"Unhappiness with insurers stems from two things: 'I'm sick and I'm getting hassled,' and the second is very much cost \u2014 'I'm paying more than I used to, and I'm paying more than my wages went up',\" said Rob Andrews, CEO of the Health Transformation Alliance, a cooperative representing major companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola that works on improving health insurance for their employees. \"A lot of people think they are getting less\" from their insurers, Andrews said.",
      "And while Americans have unhappily encountered other types of inflation in recent years \u2014\u00a0sky-high grocery prices\u00a0have been credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory last month \u2014 health insurance can take on an even more personal edge, Thomas pointed out.",

      "To be sure, people with employer-sponsored health insurance typically don't pay the full premium, as their employers pick up much of the tab.",
      "Yet KFF data shows that employees' share of their premiums are also on the rise, with a worker with family coverage typically paying premiums of $5,700 per year in 2017, the most recent year for that data, up from about $1,600 in 2000, KFF data shows. The average family deductible \u2014 the amount paid out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \u2014 has increased from $2,500 in 2013 to $3,700 in 2023, according to KFF.",

      "Health insurance denials",
      "Aside from rising health insurance costs, Americans are also expressing anger at coverage denials, which a KFF analysis of nongroup qualified health plans in 2021 found impacted almost 1 in 5 claims. However, their study found denial rates varied considerably by insurer, with some as low as 2% while others were as high as 49%.",
      "\"When you are paying for something, and then they don't give it to you and they keep raising prices, of course you will be frustrated by that,\" noted Holden Karau, a software engineer who created a free service called\u00a0Fight Health Insurance to help people appeal their denials.",
      "Karau says she came up with the app, which uses AI to craft appeal letters, after her own and her dog's experience with insurance. Her pet insurer initially refused to pay for anesthesia for her dog's root canal, while Karau, who is transgender, said she dealt with many appeals to get her own procedures and surgeries covered by her insurance.",
      "More insurance companies are using AI to review claims and issue denials, which isn't always obvious to consumers. The shift to AI-based reviews has sparked lawsuits against insurers, with UnitedHealthcare sued last year by the families of two now-deceased customers who alleged the insurer knowingly used a faulty algorithm to deny elderly patients coverage for extended care deemed necessary by their doctors.",
      "\"With AI tools on the insurance side, they have very little negative consequences for denying procedures,\" Karau added. \"We are seeing really high denial rates triggered by AI. And on the patient and provider side, they don't have the tools to fight back.\"",
      "Most people may not be aware that they have the right to appeal a denial, Karau noted. The majority of people who are hit with a denial or billing errors don't contest, a study found earlier this year. For those that do, a first appeal will be dealt with by the insurer, but if that in-house appeal is also denied, you have the right to ask for an independent reviewer to look at your claim, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.",
      "\"There are multiple levels of appeal, and in my experience, I would say it's important to appeal until you at least get to an independent reviewer,\" Karau said. \"If you don't appeal, you won't get the care you need.\"",

    "summary": "The IIHS says a \"small increase in crash speed can really ramp up the danger to a pedestrian,\" and our penchant for big vehicles \"has intensified that effect.\"",
    "story": [
      "Researchers at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety who looked back at data on more than 200 vehicle-pedestrian crashes in the U.S. say Americans' preference for large, tall vehicles is compounding the risks of serious injury to pedestrians associated with higher-speed crashes. The authors of the IIHS study conclude that the size of many American vehicles means serious pedestrian injuries are more likely in crashes when compared to the expected risks on the roads in Europe, where vehicles are generally smaller.",
      "IIHS researchers analyzed 202 crashes involving a vehicle and at least one pedestrian aged 16 or older between 2015 and 2022 in four states, \"to generate an estimate for the link between injury outcomes and impact speed,\" with information about the front-end height of the vehicles being used additionally \"to examine the moderating effect of\" the vehicle's size on the outcome for the pedestrians.",
      "\"A small increase in crash speed can really ramp up the danger to a pedestrian. Our fondness for tall SUVs and pickups in the U.S. has intensified that effect,\" IIHS President David Harkey was quoted as saying about the study's findings.",
      "While it was already understood that more speed at the point of impact increases risks to pedestrians struck by vehicles, the IIHS said the new study was carried out to provide, \"an updated estimate of pedestrian injury risk at different severity levels\" based on the evolving design of vehicles on U.S. roads today.",
      "\"As expected, impact speed strongly predicted injury risk, and hood leading edge height significantly increased the risk of pedestrian injury overall as well as the potency of impact speed for serious injuries,\" the IIHS said.",
      "While the study found no significant change in risk to pedestrians based on the weight of the vehicles involved, the IIHS said that, \"in general, higher vehicle front ends increased the likelihood of both moderate and serious pedestrian injuries.\"",
      "For example, it said that when a median-height pickup, with a front end about 13 inches higher than most cars, hits a pedestrian at 27 mph, there's a 83% chance of moderate injury and a 62% chance of serious injury, compared to 60% and a 30% respectively if the vehicle involved in the crash is a median-height car.",
      "\"Although SUVs are a growing share of the market in Europe, the passenger vehicle fleet there has long been dominated by cars. In contrast, the majority of passenger vehicles on U.S. roads today are SUVs or pickups,\" IIHS senior statistician Sam Monfort, the lead author of the study, was quoted as saying by the institute. \"These choices have very real consequences for pedestrian safety.\"",
      "\"Speed increases have a more pronounced effect when taller vehicles are involved\" in a crash, the organization said. \"For example, as crash speed increases from 15 mph to 35 mph, the risk of a serious injury goes from 9% to 52% when a median-height car is involved. With a median [height] pickup, the risk shoots up from 11% to 91%.\"",
      "Previous research by the IIHS published in 2022 found that drivers of bigger vehicles were more likely to hit pedestrians while making turns than drivers of cars, and another IIHS study published last year that pickups, SUVs and vans with hoods higher than 40 inches at the front edge were about 45% more likely to cause pedestrian fatalities in crashes than cars and other vehicles with lower, sloping hoods.",
      "Despite the concern over the impact of larger vehicles in U.S. pedestrian crashes, however, data showed 2023 saw the first overall year-on-year decline in pedestrian deaths from vehicle accidents in about four years, since the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of pedestrians killed on U.S. roads in 2023 dropped 5.4% compared to the previous year \u2014 which saw a 40-year high \u2014 but it was still 14.1% higher than the number of deaths recorded in 2019, before the pandemic, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association.",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 09:26:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump wants to impose across-the-board tariffs on imported goods from both allies and adversaries, claiming it's other nations who will pay such taxes to the U.S. Treasury. But it's American consumers who will be opening their wallets.",
    "story": [
      "Incoming President Donald Trump has made his feelings about tariffs very clear: \"The word 'tariff' is the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" he has said. \"I think it's more beautiful than 'love.' \u2026 I love tariffs! \u2026 Music to my ears!\"",
      "And what exactly is a tariff? It is a tax. According to Dartmouth economics professor Doug Irwin, \"In U.S. history, we're basically only talking about import tariffs, taxes on imported goods coming into the U.S.\"",
      "Irwin says governments have all kinds of reasons for introducing tariffs: \"Sometimes it's to reduce the trade deficit. Sometimes it's to bring back jobs. Sometimes it's to punish other countries for their unfair trade practices. Sometimes it's to raise revenue so that we can cut income taxes.\"",
      "At its most fundamental, a tariff works like this:",
      "Suppose we import a product from China. The price is $50. But before you can buy it, our government adds $25 to the price. That's the tariff. Your final price is $75. China gets its $50; the extra $25 winds up going to the U.S. Treasury.",
      "But who pays these tariffs?",
      "According to Trump, it's the other countries. \"Trillions and trillions of dollars pouring into the United States Treasury,\" is his description of what happens. \"China paid hundreds of billions of dollars during my term.\"",
      "But as Irwin points out, that's NOT the way tariffs work!",
      "\"I think economists would say that's very misleading to say that that's what's going on,\" he said. \"Of course, it's the U.S. consumers that are paying those, not China itself. China's not writing checks to the U.S. government.\"",
      "Rather, it is a transfer of money from consumers to the federal government. A tax.",
      "Tariffs have been part of international trade since our country was founded; the first one was imposed by George Washington! And what we've learned from history is that they often have unintended consequences.",
      "We have a tariff on sugar that has doubled the price of sugar. It has helped out our sugar cane farmers in Louisiana and Florida, but it's also driven 34% of American chocolate and candy manufacturing (and jobs) out of the country.",

      "Candy makers turn sweet on Canada to mitigate costly U.S. sugar tariffs (Financial Post)",
      "More confectionery manufacturers move outside U.S. (Confectionery Production)",
      "Then, there was Trump's 25% tariff on imported steel in 2018. Our steelmakers thrived, but companies that make things out of steel (like Ford, GM and Caterpillar) suffered dearly. Just ask Ford's then-CEO Jim Hackett, who in 2018 told Bloomberg, \"The metals tariffs took about a billion dollars of profit from us. If it goes on longer, there will be more damage.\"",
      "Tariffs against one particular country can backfire. Irwin said, \"With the China tariffs, we're importing a lot more from Vietnam, we're importing a lot more from Malaysia. If the idea with the tariff was to bring jobs back home, instead we're just shifting them from China to Vietnam, in some sense.\"",
      "And P.S.: Tariffs don't just raise prices on the imported stuff; they can affect the price of domestic substitutes as well.",
      "So, if there's a tariff on imported steel, and I'm an American steelmaker, I can opportunistically say, \"Well hey, now I can raise my prices, too!\"?\u00a0 Absolutely! says Irwin: \"Consumers don't have the choice anymore. They can buy the really high-priced steel, or they can buy you.\"",
      "Finally, there's the retaliation problem. \"When we imposed the steel tariffs, the European Union and China got very upset with us,\" Irwin said. \"And what did they do? They raised tariffs on American farm goods. So, all of a sudden, American farmers, who had nothing to do with steel per se, found their sales limited overseas.\"",
      "Even Ronald Reagan could have told you that. In fact, he did! In 1987, Reagan said, \"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition.\"",
      "So, exactly what tariffs has Trump proposed? During his campaign, he promised as president he would \"phase in a system of universal baseline tariffs.\" Originally, he outlined tariffs across the board -- every product, in every category, from every country in the world. \"We're going to charge them 10 to 20 percent,\" he said.",

      "Retailers tell consumers that Trump tariffs are a reason to shop now",
      "Why is Trump threatening a 100% tariff on the BRICS nations?",
      "Now, every recent president has favored some tariffs. The Biden administration, for example, maintained some of the tariffs from Trump's first term, and imposed its own 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. But these tariffs have always targeted particular categories of products. \"An across-the-board tariff? That's not targeting a particular commodity or product, that's not targeting a particular country,\" said Irwin. \"It's just saying, 'All imports, all sources get hit with this tax.' That's a very different type of tariff.\"",
      "And wouldn't we then notice prices going up, on everything?\u00a0 \"We would definitely notice,\" Irwin said.",
      "More recently, Trump has proposed double-digit tariffs on everything imported from Mexico, Canada and China. They would raise the price we pay for things like fruit, lumber, electronics, oil, medicine, metal and beef.",

      "But Trump's transition leader Howard Lutnick predicts that his boss won't tax imported goods for which there are no American-made alternatives. Back in September, Lutnick told CNBC, \"Tariffs are an amazing tool by the president to use. They're an amazing tool. But he understands, don't tariff stuff we don't make. If we don't make it, and you want to buy it, I don't want to put the price up.\"",
      "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, according to experts",
      "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, according to experts",
      "But maybe Trump has no intention of imposing the tariffs for real? Maybe he's playing a strategic game -- tariffs as negotiating tactics?",
      "\"Tariffs can be used as a threat and a bargaining chip,\" said Irwin. \"And sometimes, if you're really credible, just making the threat of a tariff is enough to bring another country to change its policy in a way that you desire without your actually having to impose the tariff in the end.\"",
      "In the end, when a government wants to achieve some economic or geopolitical goal, it can use all kinds of different tools: subsidies, tax breaks or penalties, trade agreements, regulations, certifications, investment incentives, diversification.",
      "According to Doug Irwin, tariffs are a powerful tool, too. They're just rarely the best one. \"What economists have concluded is that tariffs usually have a lot of unintended consequences, can lead to blowback where other countries retaliate against you, and so are not a really good policy instrument for achieving goals that we all Americans want to achieve,\" he said.",

    "summary": "An appeals court judge wrote that the law that would force a sale or ban of TikTok \"survive[s] constitutional scrutiny.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court upheld a law that will ban TikTok in the U.S. in the coming months if its Chinese parent company doesn't sell its stake in the app, dealing another setback to the widely popular video-sharing service in its battle with the federal government.",
      "A panel of three judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously sided with the Justice Department in declining to review the petition for relief from TikTok and ByteDance, its Chinese parent company, saying the law is constitutional.",
      "\"We conclude the portions of the Act the petitioners have standing to challenge, that is the provisions concerning TikTok and its related entities, survive constitutional scrutiny,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote in the majority opinion. \"We therefore deny the petitions.\"",
      "Congress approved\u00a0a foreign assistance package in April that included provisions giving TikTok nine months to sever ties with ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, and it is set to take effect on Jan. 19, with the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok during his first term in office, but reversed his position during the presidential campaign and vowed to \"save\" the app. He takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Lawmakers and national security officials have long had suspicions about TikTok's ties to China. Officials from both parties have warned that the Chinese government could use TikTok to spy on and collect data from its roughly 170 million American users or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content. The concern is warranted, they have argued, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering.",
      "The appeals court's decision tees up a fight at the Supreme Court over the law's ultimate fate. The parties asked the judges to make a decision by Friday so there is enough time for the high court to review the case before the law takes effect. The justices could agree to hear the case and pause the law while they consider the legal arguments, or let the appeals court's ruling stand as the final word.",
      "TikTok expects the law will be overturned by the Supreme Court, according to spokesperson Michael Hughes, who argued the law is based on \"inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information.\"",
      "\"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" Hughes said in a statement.",
      "The Justice Department, meanwhile, applauded the decision.",
      "\"Today's decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to collect sensitive information about millions of Americans, to covertly manipulate the content delivered to American audiences, and to undermine our national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"As the D.C. Circuit recognized, this act protects the national security of the United States in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. The Justice Department is committed to defending Americans' sensitive data from authoritarian regimes that seek to exploit companies under their control.\"",
      "The court's decision",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Ginsburg wrote in his opinion. \"Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "The appeals court said that it recognized the decision will have \"significant implications\" for TikTok and its users.",
      "\"Consequently, TikTok's millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication,\" Ginsburg said. \"That burden is attributable to the [People's Republic of China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.\"",
      "The D.C. Circuit found that the government's national-security justifications for banning TikTok \u2014 to counter China's efforts to collect Americans' data and limit its ability to manipulate content covertly on the platform \u2014 are \"wholly consistent\" with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The multi-year efforts of both political branches to investigate the national security risks posed by the TikTok platform, and to consider potential remedies proposed by TikTok, weigh heavily in favor of the Act,\" Ginsburg wrote. \"The government has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.\"",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China committee, praised the decision, calling it \"a loss for the Chinese Community Party,\" while also expressing optimism about the app's future in the U.S.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\" Moolenaar said in a statement.",
      "The House China committee spearheaded the bipartisan effort to pass the law.",
      "The legal arguments",
      "TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge in May that called the legislation \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "\"In reality, there is no choice,\" the petition said, adding that a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\"",
      "The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance said \"such a fundamental rearchitecting is not remotely feasible\" under the restrictions within the legislation.",
      "\"The platform consists of millions of lines of software code that have been painstakingly developed by thousands of engineers over multiple years,\" the petition said.",
      "During oral arguments in September, the appeals panel appeared skeptical of TikTok's argument that free expression outweighs national security concerns, but the three judges were also critical of the government's stance.",
      "TikTok's lawyer Andrew Pincus said the law \"is unprecedented and its effect would be staggering.\"",
      "\"This law imposes extraordinary speech prohibition based on indeterminate future risks,\" Pincus said. \"Notwithstanding the obvious less restrictive alternatives, the government has not come anywhere near satisfying strict scrutiny.\"",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan said, under TikTok's rationale, the U.S. would not be able to ban a foreign country from owning a major media company in the U.S. if the two are at war.",
      "\"Is your submission that Congress can't bar the enemy's ownership of a major media source in the U.S.?\" Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, asked Pincus.",
      "When Pincus noted that news outlets like Politico and Business Insider are owned by foreign entities, Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, quickly chimed in: \"But not foreign adversaries.\"",
      "Rao also pushed back on Pincus' argument that Congress did not include any evidence of its claims that TikTok poses a national security risk in the legislation.",
      "\"I know Congress doesn't legislate all the time, but here they did,\" she said. \"They actually passed a law and many of your arguments want us to treat them as an agency. It's strange. It's a very strange framework for thinking about our first branch of government.\"",
      "Attorney Jeffrey Fisher, who represents TikTok creators, compared the restrictions on TikTok to the U.S. government hypothetically banning bookstores from selling books written by foreign authors in conjunction with a foreign government.",
      "\"We're not talking about banning Tocqueville in the United States,\" Rao countered. \"We're talking about a determination by the political branches that there's a foreign adversary that is potentially exercising covert influence in the United States. Very different.\"",
      "Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee, expressed skepticism over the notion that the law singles out TikTok.",
      "\"It describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity,\" he said, noting that the company and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns. \"That's the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyer Daniel Tenny said the data on Americans that could be collected through the app \"would be quite valuable to a foreign adversary if it were trying to approach an American to try to have them be an intelligence asset.\" Tenny also spoke about the risk of content manipulation by China.",
      "\"What is being targeted is a foreign company that controls this recommendation engine and many aspects of the algorithm that's used to determine what content is shown to Americans on the app,\" Tenny said.",
      "But Srinivasan said it's Americans' choice to use the app, despite what content may appear.",
      "\"The fact that that's being denied subjects this to serious First Amendment scrutiny,\" he said.",
      "He later added, \"What gives arguable force to the other side's First Amendment argument is that it's not just that the government is targeting curation that occurs abroad. It's the reason the curation occurring abroad is being targeted, and the reason is a concern about the content consequences of that curation in the U.S.\"",

      "But, there is still the challenge of why health care costs are rising.",
      "\"You have efforts to extend coverage and make more people have health care be available, but prices are going up,\" Gounder said.",

      "Many different proposals have been made to improve the situation, she said, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to negotiate down the price of drugs.",

      "There have also been mergers and acquisitions in the health care industry, which means less competition.",
      "\"Biden administration has really been trying to pursue antitrust suits to block some of these,\" Gounder said. \"The Trump administration, the prior administration, tried to make health care pricing more transparent.

    "summary": "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is facing calls to schedule vote on bill for which he is cosponsor.",
    "story": [
      "The House-passed Social Security Fairness Act enjoys rare bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, yet the odds of it getting enacted are growing smaller with each passing day.",
      "Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are calling on Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to schedule a vote on the bill that would expand Social Security benefits to roughly 2.8 million retirees. Schumer, a Democrat and cosponsor of the legislation, could invoke a Senate rule that would skip a committee hearing and send the bill directly to a floor vote by the full Senate.",
      "The legislation would eliminate a provision that cuts Social Security payments to some retirees who also collect a pension from jobs not covered by the retirement program. That includes state and federal workers like teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. It would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "\"With just eight legislative days remaining in the 118th Congress, Sen. Schumer, a cosponsor of Senate bill S.597, must now step up and take action. It's time for him to follow through and bring it to the floor for a vote,\" Shannon Benton executive director of The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), told CBS MoneyWatch on Friday.",
      "The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \"penalize families across the country who worked a public service job for part of their career with a separate pension,\" Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy told colleagues earlier in the week. When those workers \"have second jobs, second careers or get married, they receive less from Social Security than if they had never worked in public service at all. That's not right.\"",
      "In an impassioned speech, Cassidy called on Schumer to schedule a vote, saying lawmakers would approve the legislation.",
      "\"If Schumer brings it up, it'll pass,\" Cassidy stated of the bill, which has 62 sponsors.",
      "A similar plea was also made by New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who late last month held a press\u00a0conference\u00a0to urge passage of the measure. \"Retired teachers &firefighters deserve access to the Social Security benefits they've earned. That's why I'm working to repeal provisions that unfairly reduce Social Security benefits for public servants. Let's get it done!\" Gillibrand also\u00a0posted\u00a0on social media.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 17:05:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Even those enrolled in Medicare have a harder time paying for treatment compared with older adults in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.S., having health insurance is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to affordable medical care.",
      "While the U.S. lacks a universal health care system like those that exist in most other wealthy nations, most Americans over 65 are insured through Medicare. Yet many still struggle to afford care, with high out-of-pocket costs putting necessary medications and doctor visits out of reach, according to\u00a0research from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that works to promote an equitable health care system.",
      "These extra costs, for which Medicare beneficiaries are on the hook, make it harder for older Americans to access affordable care relative to their peers in nine other countries, the group found. Researchers compared coverage for older adults in the U.S. to health care systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
      "Nearly one in four older adults in the U.S. spent at least $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year, compared to less than 5% of older adults in France and the Netherlands who spent that much, The Commonwealth Fund found. Only in Switzerland did older adults report spending more on health care than those in the U.S.",
      "\"The reason to focus on this population is because in the U.S. nearly every adult over 65 has Medicare,\" Munira Z. Gunja, senior researcher for international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund told CBS MoneyWatch. While the U.S. stands out as \"the only high-income country without a universal health system,\" when it comes to the over-65 population, \"at least, we are on par with other countries,\" she said.",
      "Does Medicare fall short?",
      "But the study suggests that the kind of coverage Medicare plans provide isn't meeting many Americans' needs. Eight percent of older adults in the U.S., more than any other wealthy country except Austria, reported delaying or forgoing medical care because of costs. And there are repercussions to not getting the care one needs: One-third of older U.S. adults who said they faced cost-related barriers to accessing care reported being either in fair or poor health.",
      "\"We find that while nearly every older adult has Medicare coverage, it is still more expensive than what older adults in other nations face, and because of that, older adults in the U.S. are more likely to skip care,\" Gunja said. \"When they need prescription drugs, they are more likely to skip getting those too.\"",
      "Oftentimes, for example, Medicare Advantage members find themselves seeing out-of-network doctors, which exposes them to \"a ton of health care costs,\" according to Gunja.",
      "One exception",
      "There's one area in which Medicare beneficiaries faced few out-of-pocket costs and, as a result, were less likely to skip care \u2014 mental health treatment. Less than 5% of residents in all nations skipped mental health care over affordability concerns. The stat illustrates that when treatment is affordable, patients are more inclined to seek out the care they need, according to Gunja.",
      "\"It's a benefit that's offered on all health plans, and we see what happens when people don't need to spend as much on a service,\" she said.",
      "Solutions?",
      "When older people skip or delay care, their health can worsen, leading to sicker patients, who tend to require more costly care. That in turn drives up federal Medicare spending, according to The Commonwealth Fund.",
      "Gunja suggests that the U.S. can look to other countries for solutions that make health care more affordable for older adults. Some examples include capping out-of-pocket expenses and fully covering hospital and physician services.",
      "\"Across the board, the U.S. generally comes out last for most measures when it comes to affordability measures,\" Gunja said. \"Getting health insurance is absolutely necessary. But it's only the first step. We need to make sure coverage is not just comprehensive, but also affordable.\"",

    "story": [
      "In the wake of\u00a0UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing in New York City Wednesday morning, some companies are taking additional precautionary measures to protect their executives while corporate security firms are reporting an uptick in interest in their services.",
      "The shooting of Thompson, who did not appear to have a security detail with him when he was attacked outside a Manhattan hotel, is shining a light on the business of protecting prominent corporate executives, whose security costs can reach millions of dollars per year.",
      "It's common for the top brass at public companies to be protected by guards around the clock, according to security experts. Social media's amplification of everyday individuals' dissatisfaction with a particular person, product or service has only heightened the need for protection, they say. That's particularly true in an industry like health care insurance, when many Americans say they are dissatisfied with the services they receive.",
      "Indeed, in the wake of Thompson's killing, many on social media expressed vitriol for some health insurers' practices.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings about the public voicing its frustrations.",
      "To be sure, some of the biggest U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector, were spending heavily on personal and residential security for their top executives prior to Thompson's killing. Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, reported the highest spending on personal security for top executives last year, at more than $24 million, filings culled by research firm Equilar show.",
      "While Thompson had an in-house security detail during his New York City visit, it wasn't with him at the time of the shooting, according to CNN, which cited a source familiar with UnitedHealthcare's security.",
      "In the wake of the attack, corporate security experts said companies should take time to evaluate their corporate security protocols and beef up protective measures, if necessary, to protect against a variety of threats.",
      "\"My phone has been ringing off hook, with calls in particular coming from health care leaders who are reevaluating their security,\" said Paul Sarnese, a safety and security consultant and former president of the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety (IAHSS).",
      "He said the deadly incident will likely prompt more executives to seek more robust protection. \"This incident will definitely change those executives' minds that might have been reluctant to initiate security protocols. I think they'll be more receptive to executive protection,\" he said.",
      "Too much information",
      "In the wake of Thompson's death, some companies are taking steps to limit publicly available information about their executives. For example, a page on UnitedHealthcare's website about the company's leadership \u2014 where Thompson and other executives' bios were listed \u2014\u00a0no longer exists, and instead redirects to the company's home page.",
      "Medica, a Minnesota-based nonprofit health care firm, as well as other insurers have taken similar actions, their websites show.",
      "Medica told the Associated Press Friday that it is temporarily closing its six offices for security reasons, in addition to removing executives bios' from its website.",
      "\"Although we have received no specific threats related to our campuses, our office buildings will be temporarily closed out of an abundance of caution,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Experts say these types of moves are wise.",
      "\"I think we share too much. I don't need to know where you live and that you're married and have three wonderful kids,\" Sarnese said. \"We don't need to advertise to the public where the president and CEO are sitting.\"",
      "While executives across all industries should be evaluating their security postures, healthcare industry professionals have received more threats in recent years as a result of divisiveness that arose around safety protocols, including mask mandates, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sarnese said.",
      "\"Every industry has challenges because there is always going to be somebody who is upset with a service or product or philosophy. But COVID changed everything. We never saw the level of threats we saw during COVID toward healthcare workers and leaders, because of some of the mistrust and misinformation that was out there in the community,\" he said.",
      "\"All the ways things can go wrong\"",
      "Security industry veteran Brittney Blair of K2 Integrity said that online threat monitoring is as essential as physical protection.",
      "More companies are becoming more active in tracking cyber threats, including monitoring the web and dark web.",
      "\"I think people want to take a more proactive approach to making sure they are not in a situation where they're caught off guard or not prepared for that bad thing,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You cannot predict crime, and you can't prevent all of it, but you should be doing as much as you can to make sure you're getting ahead of any possible threat that could be coming your way.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 13:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Anthem will reverse a policy that would have capped insurance coverage for anesthesia after objections from doctors and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday that the health insurance provider is reversing a policy that was set to go into effect in February that would have limited anesthesia coverage during surgeries and other procedures, a change that had prompted an outcry from some physicians and lawmakers.",
      "The policy, which would have covered Anthem's plans in Connecticut, New York and Missouri, was disclosed in recent weeks, with the company's New York unit posting a\u00a0notice on Dec. 1. The policy would have excluded people under 22 years old and maternity care.",
      "According to the original policy statement, Anthem had said it would pay only for anesthesia treatments for the length of time that a procedure or surgery is estimated to require based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's physician work time values. The insurer noted that claims for anesthesia \"above the established number of minutes will be denied.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News on Thursday, Anthem said it was backing away from the policy, and added there had been \"widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy.\"",
      "\"As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change,\" an Anthem spokesperson wrote in an email. \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\"",
      "Before the announcement of Anthem's reversal, the plan had drawn criticism from medical professionals as well as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, who wrote on social media on Wednesday that the plan is \"appalling.\"",
      "\"Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt.   And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?\" Murphy wrote. \"Reverse this decision immediately.\"",
      "Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon told the Hartford Courant Thursday that the policy would not take place in his state after negotiating with the insurer.",
      "\"After hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I'm pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\" Scanlon told the newspaper.",
      "\"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers\"",
      "In a statement last month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists also called on Anthem to reverse the policy.",
      "\"With this new policy, Anthem will arbitrarily pre-determine the time allowed for anesthesia care during a surgery or procedure,\" the group said. \"If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem's limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist's care.\"",
      "The insurer's new policy could result in denials of coverage to patients who might need more anesthesia because their surgery is difficult or unusual, or if a complication occurs, the group added.",
      "\"This is just the latest in a long line of appalling behavior by commercial health insurers looking to drive their profits up at the expense of patients and physicians providing essential care,\" said Donald E. Arnold, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. \"This egregious policy breaks the trust between Anthem and its policyholders who expect their health insurer to pay physicians for the entirety of the care they need.\"",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump wants former lawmaker and auctioneer Billy Long to replace IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he wants ex-congressman Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri and a former auctioneer, to run the IRS. As a lawmaker, Long co-sponsored legislation that aimed to wipe out much of the tax code.",
      "In making the announcement, Trump praised Long's \"32 years of experience running his own businesses in Real Estate and, as one of the premier Auctioneers in the Country.\" He also noted that since leaving Congress in 2023, Long has worked as a business and tax adviser.",
      "While Trump didn't mention the current IRS Commissioner, Danny Werfel, in his announcement, the decision signals the president-elect is likely to replace him with Long after taking office in January, Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Naming Long as the next IRS chief drew both support from conservatives as well as criticism from the left, with Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Tax subcommittee calling it a \"terrible mistake,\" while Idaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo issued a statement saying he's looking forward to hearing Long's ideas for the tax agency. The fiscally conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation praised Trump's choice, saying Long could help reform the IRS.",
      "Long has recently served as a tax adviser to businesses seeking to employ a controversial tax credit, but, unlike prior IRS commissioners, his background is largely outside of the tax industry, experts noted.",
      "\"This guy is an auctioneer \u2014 that's his expertise,\" Owens noted. \"This is an incredibly unserious choice.\"",
      "Werfel, who was appointed by President Biden, stepped into the role in 2023, with his term set to expire in 2027. Typically, presidents allow IRS commissioners to serve out their term, as Mr. Biden allowed Trump's former IRS appointee, Charles Rettig, to do before naming Werfel to the role.",
      "If the Senate approves his appointment to the IRS, Long would oversee an agency with 85,000 employees and an annual budget exceeding $12 billion.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump campaign declined to comment.",
      "Here's what to know about Long and the IRS.",
      "Who is Billy Long?",
      "Long, who attended the University of Missouri but didn't graduate, described himself on a\u00a0website\u00a0for his congressional run as a \"fourth-generation native of Southwest Missouri.\" He touted his skills as an auctioneer, noting that he had been named the \"best auctioneer in the Ozarks for seven years in a row.\"",
      "Long also worked in real estate and in talk radio, hosting a show on a Missouri AM radio station.",
      "He shuttered his auction firm, Billy Long Auctions, before he was sworn into Congress in 2011, according to a local publication.",
      "What professional experience does Long have with taxes?",
      "As a congressman, Long co-sponsored some tax-related bills, including several efforts to eliminate the estate tax as well as a measure called the Tax Code Termination Act.",
      "That legislation would have wiped out much of the current tax code, replacing it with what the bill called a \"simple and fair system\" that would have applied \"a low rate to all Americans.\" Such flat taxes are considered regressive by many experts because low- and middle-income taxpayers would end up paying a larger share of their incomes than would wealthy Americans.",
      "\"As a business owner, Billy knows first-hand how government regulation and heavy taxes can affect the small businesses that serve as the economic engine of our country,\" his campaign site noted.",
      "While Long isn't an accountant or CPA, he has been involved in tax advising since leaving Congress. In a 2023 podcast, for example, he touted his work helping businesses use the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a credit that the IRS has\u00a0flagged for its high rate of fraud.",
      "In the podcast, Long also said that when he served as a congressman, he helped make the ERTC easier for businesses to claim, noting that the credit was difficult to qualify for during its first iteration.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "The IRS says the ERTC is aimed at employers who paid wages to workers between March 12, 2020, and January 1, 2022, and that were either suspended by government order during the pandemic or experienced a \"required decline in gross receipts during 2020 or the first three calendar quarters of 2021.\" The credit is also available to startups that began at the end of 2021 and had less than $1 million in revenue.",
      "How does Long's experience compare with prior IRS commissioners?",
      "Long's lack of tax industry experience sets him apart from other recent IRS commissioners.",
      "Werfel, the current IRS chief, has an undergraduate degree from Cornell University and a master's degree in public policy from Duke University as well as a law degree from the University of North Carolina. He's also held a number of government jobs involved in operations and the IRS, including serving as acting commissioner of the IRS from May to December 2013, according to his biography.",
      "Werfel's predecessor, Charles Rettig, who was appointed by President-elect Trump, also held several degrees, including a master's in taxation. Before joining the IRS, Rettig worked as a tax attorney for more than three decades and served as the chairman of the IRS Advisory Council.",
      "What is happening with the IRS now?",
      "Under Werfel, the IRS has expanded audits of wealthy taxpayers and big corporations, clawing back billions in unpaid taxes, efforts that were funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The tax agency has also reduced the time it takes consumers to connect with an IRS employee, while also rolling out a free tax filing system called Direct File.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the expanded IRS funding, claiming\u00a0the agency would use the money to hire thousands of new agents to increase audits on middle-class taxpayers.",
      "The Treasury had said that funding could help the IRS add nearly 87,000 full-time workers over 10 years, but the agency didn't specify whether those new workers would be auditors, customer service workers or other types of employees. That figure also represented the total number of employees that could be hired, without calculating the impact of the number of IRS workers who are expected to retire or leave the department over the next several years.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers are expressing concern that, if appointed, Long could disrupt the progress that the IRS has made under Werfel.",
      "Werfel \"has done an excellent job rebuilding the IRS, boosting customer service and enhancing enforcement aimed at wealthy tax evaders,\" Rep. Beyer said in a statement. \"Removing him will clearly signal Trump's intention to make the agency less responsive to the American people, while giving a green light to wealthy tax cheats to evade their fair share of the tax burden.\"",
      "Still, Republican lawmakers expressed support for the pick, such as Senator Crapo, who highlighted \"privacy and security\" issues at the IRS and \"inefficient use of resources.\" He added, \"I look forward to learning more about Mr. Long's vision for the agency.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 18:09:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Payments to victims of Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com are the largest yet by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "More than 4 million Americans gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com will soon collectively receive $1.8 billion in refund checks, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced Thursday.",
      "The payments make up the biggest distribution yet from the CFPB's victims relief fund, financed by civil penalties paid by companies that violate consumer protection laws, the agency said.",
      "Checks will be mailed in coming weeks to 4.3 million consumers who were charged illegal advance fees or subjected to allegedly deceptive bait-and-switch advertising by Lexington Law, CreditRepair.com and their parent companies, according to the federal agency.",
      "The CFPB in August 2023 obtained a legal judgment against the credit repair businesses, with a district court ruling the companies had violated a law that prohibits such companies from collecting fees until at least six months after their promised results.",
      "The companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the court ruling, shutting about 80% of their business operations, including telemarketing call centers.",
      "\"Exploited vulnerable consumers\"",
      "\"Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com exploited vulnerable consumers who were trying to rebuild their credit, charging them illegal junk fees for results they hadn't delivered,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra stated in a news release. \"This historic distribution of $1.8 billion demonstrates the CFPB's commitment to making consumers whole, even when the companies that harm them shut down or declare bankruptcy.\"",
      "Since its launch in 2011, the CFPB has distributed more than $3.3 billion to consumers harmed by a range of illegal practices, such as student loan and mortgage relief scams and predatory lending. The victims relief fund allows the CFPB to provide financial relief in cases where direction compensation from the violating company is not possible.",
      "The brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, the CFPB was established after the 2008 financial crisis. Funded by the Federal Reserve, the agency has weathered several legal challenges from opponents. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "Still, the agency's efforts could prove short-lived amid calls from some Republicans to weaken the agency or get rid of it entirely. On Wednesday, billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 among those designated by President-elect Donald Trump to\u00a0front an effort\u00a0to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash regulations and cut government spending \u2014 called for deleting the CFPB, arguing in a\u00a0post\u00a0on social media that there are \"too many duplicative regulatory agencies.\"",
      "When will the refund checks be sent?",
      "Payments will be sent between December and January to eligible consumers harmed by the companies, and those eligible do not need to take any action to receive a check.",
      "Those who think they are eligible but have not received a payment by mid-January can then contact JND Legal Administration at www.cfpb-lexlaw.org. Details about the distribution can be found here.",
      "How big will the payments be?",
      "The CFPB said the payments are based on a pro-rata share of fees paid by consumers to CreditRepair.com and Lexington Law, but that the payments might not cover all the fees they incurred.",
      "If the payments were divided evenly, each person would receive about $419.",
      "\"If funds remain after the distribution is complete, additional checks may be sent to consumers who cashed their initial check. You don't need to take any additional action,\" the agency said.",
      "Can I file a claim?",
      "No, according to the agency. \"There won't be opportunities to file claims for this redress case,\" it said.",
      "Is the refund check taxable?",
      "It's unlikely, because the checks are considered refunds for payments that consumers made to the credit repair companies, rather than taxable income, the CFPB said. \"If you have tax-related questions, however, please contact a tax advisor,\" it added.",

    "story": [
      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and urban and rural governments alike are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",
      "But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties and butt up against wooded bike trails winding through the suburbs. But one of the latest proposals in the area, Plaza 500, would see a 466,000-square-foot facility and adjacent electrical substation built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised jobs and a significant property tax boost. But data center critics say the incentives aren't enough to counteract the consequences of building the facilities so close to homes.",
      "Tyler Ray, a leader in the fight against the Virginia project, worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "Ray and his neighbors tried to stop the development, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project was exempt.",
      "\"I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue, has any chance to go up against the data center industry,\" Ray said the night the supervisors voted.",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia's current data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2013 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its investment in nearby Loudoun County, which included two data centers, created around 150 direct jobs, a figure that data center opponents say isn't worth the hassle. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\"I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\" Smith said. \"Data centers are not going away.\"",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. Those payments, in addition to $1.7 in charitable donations from the company in 2023, have been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services. These funds have gone toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer and $5,000 grants for homebuyers so far totaling at least $2.8 million.",
      "\"This road right here? Wouldn't happen if it wasn't for AWS,\" said Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Police Chief Rick Stokoe's cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.",
      "AWS has cultivated relationships with local officials including Keefer and Stokoe, who have both been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks with the company. Some former county commissioners and residents worry that those relationships are too cozy.",
      "Kevin Miller, AWS's vice president of global data centers, said in an interview with the Associated Press that \"our interest is in being a model corporate citizen, to really be partners with those communities.\"",
      "Skepticism of the deals started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while also owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But the latest data center deal struck between Morrow County officials and AWS, which gives the company an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers, again raised eyebrows.",
      "Two former Morrow County Commissioners, Jim Doherty and Melissa Lindsay, pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 14:39:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas rejected a proposed plea agreement between the Justice Department and Boeing that would have settled the U.S. government's claims against the company, after crashes of two 737 Max jetliners that killed 346 people, according to a court order issued Thursday.",
      "In his ruling, Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process and ordered the parties to provide the court with a plan for possible ways forward early next month.",
      "The federal government's proposed agreement with airplane manufacturing giant over the deadly crashes included various provisions, including an admission of guilt to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and a $243.6 million fine \u2014 much less than the billions the families of the victims had requested. The deal would also have required Boeing to spend $455 million on safety programs and to work with an independent monitor who would oversee the company's progress.",
      "Investigators alleged in court records that leading up to the crashes, Boeing deceived federal officials who regulated the planes. In 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, which meant the criminal charge would have been dropped if Boeing had complied with the terms of the deal. But earlier this year, federal prosecutors informed the court that Boeing had not followed through on all of the requirements and intended to move forward with the case.",
      "By July, after weeks of negotiations, Boeing and the Justice Department settled on the proposed plea agreement, prompting an outcry from families of those who died in the crashes. At the time, CBS News reported the deal only covered wrongdoing by Boeing tied to the crashes and did not give the company immunity for other incidents, including a door panel that blew off a Max jetliner during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. According to a Justice Department official, the proposed agreement also did not cover any current or former Boeing officials, only the corporation.",
      "Attorneys for some of the victims' families opposed the deal, arguing the \"rotten\" agreement with the government did not justly remedy the families' claims against Boeing. In court filings, they accused Boeing of more criminality and urged stricter penalties, harsher monitoring and recognition of the lives lost.",
      "In rejecting the plea agreement, the judge took aim at diversity, equity and inclusion considerations that the parties said they would take when hiring an independent monitor. He wrote that he was \"concerned with the Government's shifting and contradictory explanations of how the plea agreement's diversity-and-inclusion provision will practically operate in this case.\"",
      "Judge O'Connor had previously raised this issue and in responsive court filings, the Justice Department defended the language, arguing it predated the Boeing agreement. \"This new language reflected not a change in policy but rather a principle that has always governed the process: that selection of a monitor must be based solely on merit, from the broadest possible pool of qualified candidates,\" they said.",
      "O'Connor ruled Thursday that the language was inappropriate: \"In a case of this magnitude, it is in the utmost interest of justice that the public is confident this monitor selection is done based solely on competency. The parties' DEI efforts only serve to undermine this confidence in the Government and Boeing's ethics and anti-fraud efforts.\"",
      "The judge also wrote that the Justice Department's previous efforts to oversee Boeing's conduct \"failed\" and said the independent monitor provision in the proposed deal did not go far enough to include the court in the process.",
      "\"At this point, the public interest requires the Court to step in. Marginalizing the Court in the selection and monitoring of the independent monitor as the plea agreement does undermines public confidence in Boeing's probation, fails to promote respect for the law, and is therefore not in the public interest,\" O'Connor wrote, \"Accordingly, the Court cannot accept the plea agreement.\"",
      "The Justice Department said it's reviewing the decision. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a statement, Paul Cassell, an attorney for some of the victims' families, told CBS News, \"Judge O'Connor has recognized that this was a cozy deal between the Government and Boeing that failed to focus on the overriding concerns \u2013 holding Boeing accountable for its deadly crime and ensuring that nothing like this happens again in the future.\"",

      "The task force, made up of seven Republicans and six Democrats, also looked into a second assassination attempt on Sept. 15 in West Palm Beach, Florida, which was foiled. Trump was golfing when a Secret Service agent discovered a man with a rifle who was waiting along the tree line of the course.",
      "What the report says",
      "Over the course of the investigation, the task force said it conducted 46 interviews, reviewed 18,000 pages of documents and visited the incident sites in Butler and West Palm Beach.",
      "The panel found that the \"failures\" that led to the July 13 incident were \"not isolated to the campaign event itself.\" The lawmakers noted that \"preexisting issues in leadership and training created an environment\" in which the failures could occur, like giving significant responsibilities to Secret Service personnel with little to no experience in advanced planning roles.",
      "\"The events of July 13, 2024, were tragic and preventable, and the litany of related security failures are unacceptable,\" the report says, acknowledging that the Secret Service's mission \"allows no margin for error.\"",
      "The task force made three dozen recommendations, including reducing the number of individuals it protects. The lawmakers also said Congress should examine whether the Secret Service should still be involved in investigating fraud and financial crimes.",
      "\"Congress must consider whether the Secret Service's investigative obligations can effectively coexist with its primary protective mission, and whether the agency's investigative functions should remain within the Department of Homeland Security,\" the report said.",
      "\"The number of individuals being protected has greatly expanded, a resource demand which becomes further taxed during the longer and more intensive modern presidential campaign seasons,\" it said, noting that the Secret Service also protects foreign dignitaries during the U.N. General Assembly in New York City in September, which comes at the height of the campaign season. \"As a result, Congress, DHS, and the USSS should jointly consider the protective role the USSS plays for foreign leaders and consider whether such duties can be transferred or abrogated in order to focus on the USSS's primary duty: to protect the President and other critical U.S. leaders.\"",
      "It also recommended that Secret Service consolidate the plans of all law enforcement entities working an event; fill gaps with its own personnel when local counterparts are unable to provide adequate security; identify all potential lines of sight vulnerabilities; require counter-surveillance assets for all large outdoor events; and address inadequate training. Other recommendations included reviewing protocols for identifying security breaches during golf outings and using a specific type of vehicle, which was redacted in the report, on the golf course.",
      "The panel also called on Congress to review the agency's financial and personnel resources, recommending that it take a look at \"reducing the pace of travel, ensuring overtime is properly compensated, and giving incentives for veteran agents to stay with the USSS beyond minimum retirement ages.\"",
      "While the panel's investigation has wrapped, the task force encouraged relevant committees in Congress to work to address \"important questions\" that it was unable to examine fully. On the top of that list, the panel said, are the motivations of the shooter and would-be shooter, which the panel said \"remain largely unknown.\"",
      "Before wrapping its investigation, the task force held its final hearing last week with testimony from Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe, who acknowledged the agency's \"abject failure\" in the July shooting. Rowe outlined a series of changes he had implemented at the agency since the assassination attempt.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 14:14:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Manhattan prosecutors say Donald Trump's election in November shouldn't mean his conviction in May needs to be vacated.",
    "story": [
      "New York prosecutors say President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House should not undermine the decision of 12 jurors who found him guilty of dozens of felonies in May, telling the judge overseeing the case that the conviction should stand.",
      "\"This Court should reject [Trump's] motion to 'immediately' dismiss the indictment and vacate the jury's guilty verdict based on the outcome of the recent presidential election,\" prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg wrote in their filing, which was made public Tuesday. \"There are no grounds for such relief now, prior to defendant's inauguration, because President-elect immunity does not exist.\"",
      "Soon after Trump's election in November, his defense lawyers promised to urge Justice Juan Merchan to toss his indictment in the \"hush money\" case and set aside the verdict. They made their motion on Dec. 2, hinging their push to discard the will of 12 jurors who sat for the seven-week trial on an unlikely subject: President Biden's son, Hunter. Trump's attorneys said the announcement of Hunter Biden's controversial pardon echoed Trump's complaints about his prosecution, claiming it was politically driven.",
      "Prosecutors did not mention either Biden or the pardon in their response filing.",
      "They hit back against the core of Trump's effort to set aside his conviction. Trump's lawyers \u2014 two of whom are slated to take on senior roles in the Justice Department after Trump's inauguration \u2014 have argued that it would be unconstitutional for an incoming president to carry the burden of a guilty verdict reached before his election.",
      "\"[Trump's] suggestion that his subsequent election 'superseded' the jury's verdict is deeply misguided,\" prosecutors wrote. \"As this Court carefully and correctly instructed the jury, it was the empaneled jurors who were 'deciding whether the Defendant is guilty or not guilty' because only these jurors \u2014 not the general electorate \u2014 heard all the evidence in this trial.\"",
      "Prosecutors argued Trump's lawyers are trying to \"effectively extend the period of [Trump's] immunity to a time before his presidency, by wiping out the effects of an indictment and jury verdict that took place before he was even reelected President.\"",
      "Trump's sentencing has been postponed three times since his conviction in May. It was initially scheduled for July 11, but Merchan pushed that date back so Trump's attorneys could file a separate motion to dismiss following a landmark Supreme Court ruling. The nation's highest court concluded in early July that former presidents could not be charged for official acts, and evidence related to their official work as president could not be used as evidence against them.",
      "Merchan has not ruled on that motion. He postponed the second sentencing date, Sept. 18, after Trump's lawyers argued it was too close to the election. After Trump's election victory on Nov. 5, they demanded a Nov. 26 sentencing date be postponed so they could file the new motion to dismiss the case, revolving around his return to the White House.",
      "Bragg's office said in its filing it would be open to postponing sentencing and other proceedings until after Trump's term in office, which ends in 2029.",
      "\"If [Trump] is not sentenced before his inauguration, there is also no legal barrier to deferring that sentencing until after the end of his presidency,\" they wrote.",
      "Prosecutors also floated terminating the case \"with a notation that the jury verdict has not been vacated and the indictment has not been dismissed,\" an option they acknowledged is typically used when defendants die before case proceedings conclude.",
      "\"Especially given the novelty of defendant's own immunity claims, it would hardly be improper for this Court to exercise its inherent authority to consider novel remedies such as adopting a version of the Alabama rule in the context of this unique case,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "The judge's decision will be the latest moment in the case to set a historical precedent. Trump was the first person to be elected president after being convicted of crimes. When the unanimous jury concluded in May he was guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, he became the first former president ever convicted of crimes. In March 2023, Trump became the first former president ever indicted when a grand jury concluded he should be charged.",
      "The case focused on a coverup of a \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star. Trump authorized a scheme to conceal reimbursements to a lawyer who made the payment days before Trump's first election.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty in the case and has promised to appeal his conviction.",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department failed to follow department policy and ignored some established protections when seeking records from members of Congress, dozens of congressional staffers and members of the media during the first Trump administration, an internal watchdog found.",
      "A report by the department's Office of Inspector General released on Tuesday focused on numerous leak investigations launched by the Justice Department and the FBI between 2017 and 2020 to determine how eight journalists from the Washington Post, the New York Times and CNN obtained classified information that appeared in reports. The data mostly included metadata about emails and phone calls, and did not contain the content of the communications.",
      "In 2017, FBI investigators honed in on members of Congress and their staff as possible sources of various news reports, eventually obtaining data from two Democratic lawmakers and 43 congressional staffers from both parties. Inspector General Michael Horowitz criticized the large number of congressional employees whose information was obtained, and urged the department to implement stronger policies to protect the data of members of Congress and their staff.",
      "\"[D]ozens of congressional staffers became part of the subject pool in a federal criminal investigation for doing nothing more than performing constitutionally authorized oversight of the executive branch,\" the report said. In a 2023 lawsuit against the Justice Department, Kash Patel, Trump's pick to serve as FBI director in the upcoming administration, said he was one of those staffers while working for the House Intelligence Committee. Patel alleged the collection was \"in complete contravention of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\"",
      "The inspector general also revealed the two lawmakers were targeted because a Democratic staffer \"identified them to investigators as potential leakers but without providing any evidentiary support for the claim.\"",
      "CBS News reported in 2021 that Justice Department prosecutors had subpoenaed Apple for data from the accounts of Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell of California while investigating leaks of classified information related to contacts between aides to President-Elect Donald Trump and Russia in the early days of the Trump administration. Both men criticized the investigative steps at the time. Schiff was sworn in this week as the next senator from California, and Swalwell remains in the House.",
      "There were four secret investigations in total, all of which were closed without criminal charges. The probes emerged into public view in 2021, when the Biden administration informed the three news organizations that their records had been swept up in the Trump-era probes. The Post, the Times and CNN each announced and condemned the revelations at the time.",
      "Notably, the inspector general's review said there was no evidence that the investigations were influenced by politics or other improper considerations. The report also said that certain processes and approvals that are now required were not in place at the time.",
      "However, the report said the decision to go after the communications of congressional staffers and members \"implicated the constitutional rights and authorities or a co-equal branch of government.\"",
      "Such conduct, the report argued, \"risks chilling Congress' ability to conduct oversight of the executive branch.\" The inspector general said there was no definitive department policy on the matter and much of the decision-making was left up to line prosecutors on the cases. As a result, the report called for further safeguards and policy changes, some of which have been implemented.",
      "Unlike investigations into members of Congress, Justice Department policy stipulates that prosecutors must first prove to have \"exhausted\" other avenues before seeking to secretly obtain records from members of the media. But Horowitz found investigators in 2020 \"did not fully adhere\" to other policies when they turned their attention to the news media organizations that published the classified information.",
      "According to the report, then-Attorney General William Barr authorized the collection of the journalists' communication data because policy required senior approval for investigations into journalists, but prosecutors working on the cases did not follow other procedures. Horowitz found that in all of the investigations, the Justice Department's New Media Review Committee \u2014 a group of officials within the department tasked with reviewing such investigative steps \u2014 was not established. The report also said prosecutors failed to obtain necessary sign-off from the intelligence community before collecting communications data in at least one instance.",
      "Unsealed court records showed the requests were made in the final weeks of Trump's first term. Barr did not agree to be interviewed for the inspector general's report. The former head of the Justice Department's national security division told the inspector general Barr and his predecessor had \"made it very clear leak investigations were a priority of the Department.\"",
      "\"In our judgment, the Department's deviation from its own requirements indicates a troubling disparity between, on the one hand, the regard expressed in Department policy for the roles of the news media in American democracy and, on the other hand, the Department's commitment to complying with the limits and requirements that it intended to safeguard that very role,\" Horowitz wrote.",
      "Following the revelations that the reporters were subjects of the Trump-era Justice Department investigations, the Garland Justice Department changed department policies governing news media organizations.",

      "Trump said in an interview with NBC News\u00a0that he told Trudeau Canada needs to \"close\" its borders to prevent migrants and drugs from \"pouring in.\" And if he doesn't close the Canadian border, Trump said he would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada. He leveled the same threats against Mexico.",
      "Trump has complained about fentanyl coming into the U.S. from Mexico and Canada, even though there have been fewer seizures from across the Canadian border than from the Mexican border.

      "Washington \u2014 A group of Senate Democrats is pressing President Biden to work to \"protect immigrant families\" in the final weeks of his presidency, with President-elect Donald Trump set to take office next month.",
      "\"As Senators who represent diverse states across our nation and who collectively represent millions of immigrant families, we write to express our deep concern about the threat the incoming administration poses to immigrants in our communities,\" the group of senators, led by Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, wrote in a letter to the president Monday.",
      "The senators cited Trump's threat of mass deportations that they say will \"jeopardize the safety and security\" of millions of families, \"sow deep distrust and fear\" in the communities and \"destabilize the U.S. economy.\" And they urged Mr. Biden to take a number of actions in advance of Trump's inauguration, stressing that the \"window to secure and finalize your administration's policies is closing rapidly.\"",
      "\"We urge you to act decisively between now and the inauguration of the President-elect to complete the important work of the past four years and protect immigrant families,\" Durbin said in the letter, which was also signed by Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico and Alex Padilla of California.",
      "Among the requests, the group asked the president to prioritize redesignating and extending Temporary Protected Status for all eligible countries, which allows migrants from countries experiencing unsafe conditions to legally reside in the U.S. The group also asked the president to expedite the processing of benefit requests for recipients of DACA, the program for hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children and have been granted protection from deportation.",
      "The push comes as Trump has made clear his intention to pursue a radical shift on immigration policy, which became a key part of his campaign as he promised to target both unauthorized and legal immigrants with unprecedented measures.",
      "In an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that aired Sunday, reiterated a number of the pledges, including that he's \"absolutely\" still planning to end birthright citizenship on Day One of his presidency. He also made clear that he plans to carry out his mass deportations pledge, beginning with criminals.",
      "When asked by host Kristen Welker whether it's possible to deport everyone who's in the U.S. illegally, Trump responded that \"you have no choice.\" He said his administration would be \"starting with the criminals\" before others, noting that \"we're going to see how it goes.\"",
      "On DACA recipients, known as Dreamers, Trump said he would work with Democrats on a plan, claiming that \"Republicans are very open to the Dreamers.\"",
      "\"I want to be able to work something out,\" Trump said, while indicating that he wants the DACA recipients to be able to stay. Legislative efforts to codify the DACA program have failed for more than a decade, and Republican-led states have filed numerous lawsuits over the years arguing the program is unconstitutional. The president-elect tried to end the program during his first administration.",

      "Beverly Hills, California \u2014 Democrats, who are about to be locked out of power in Washington as Republicans take control of all three branches of government in January, see the state capitals run by Democratic governors as the clearest path of resistance to President-elect Donald Trump's second term.",
      "The 16 governors and three governors-elect who gathered for their annual conference in Los Angeles this past weekend welcomed areas of compromise they can find with a\u00a0Trump White House, but they're already planning which fights to pick and are considering how they'll proceed.",
      "Many of the governors at the conference were elected during the blue wave in 2018 and have experience working with a Trump White House, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We were able to find ways,\" said Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, who was one of these governors and serves as the chair of the Democratic Governors Association. \"We really took a positive approach to it, and this time around, I think we'll end up doing the same thing, because really, we have no idea what's coming down. So, we'll evaluate it as it comes to us.\"",
      "Politically, Democratic governors are also primed to fill a leadership vacuum in the party in the coming years. Some potential 2028 presidential candidates have already been taking action.",
      "In early December, California Gov. Gavin Newsom launched a special session to \"safeguard California values\" and bolster funds for legal defenses against potential federal actions on abortion, climate and immigration. A week after the election, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker partnered with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis to start the \"Governors Safeguarding Democracy\" group, a think tank to create a \"toolbox\" of policies and responses to Trump's presidency.",

Folks are always angry at D.C., and yet, states have to make things work every day.\"",
      "No \"perfect answer\" for 2024 losses",

North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein's victory in the governor's race\u00a0was an electoral bright spot for Democrats in the battleground state, where Vice President Kamala Harris lost by 3 points.",

Several of those states, such as Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire, could be targeted pickups for the party. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear will be taking over as DGA Chair in 2026.",
      "\"Lifting up as many people as we can that are running on these common sense, common ground areas that people care about the most, will also create that critical mass for people to say the Democratic Party is for working people,\" said Beshear, the rare Democratic governor who has won in a Republican state.",
      "Platt, a former DGA political director, agreed that the 2026 gubernatorial races can help find \"the good surrogate for Democratic policy and Democratic ideas that has empathy, that folks can understand.\" He added that while a large number of governors are going to be \"in that conversation\" as the party recalibrates, it won't just be them.",

      "She noted her control over the state police force, said she wouldn't grant licenses for physical detentions, and said providing the federal government private information about undocumented residents would endanger transgender residents or women who travel from states with abortion bans.",
      "\"I don't doubt that he will make every effort,\" Lujan Grisham said about Trump and his mass deportation plan. \"He's going to have trouble executing that. But I also am not Pollyanna about how serious [he is].... I take him at his word, which is why I know what I must do and will do. And let's see if my strategy works the way that I think it will across the country.\"",

      "\"It is something I would seriously consider,\" she told The Associated Press in an interview. \"If I'm being completely transparent, I don't know exactly what that would look like. And I certainly want to get all of the information possible if that is something that's real for me. But yeah, I would 100% consider it.\"",
      "Elected as RNC co-chair in March, Lara Trump was a key player in the Republicans retaking the White House and control of the Senate while maintaining a narrow House majority. What she does next could shape Republican politics, given her elevated political profile and her ties to the incoming president.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 14:29:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll end birthright citizenship, after years of criticizing the constitutional right.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump says he'll end birthright citizenship, after years of criticizing the constitutional right.",
      "In an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that aired Sunday, Trump said he's \"absolutely\" still planning to end birthright citizenship on Day One of his presidency. \"We have to end it,\" Trump told host Kristen Welker. In a video post in\u00a02023, Trump had said he'd sign an executive action to do so on the first day in office.",
      "What is birthright citizenship, and is it in the U.S. Constitution?",
      "Birthright citizenship automatically grants citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of the parents' citizenship status.",
      "The Citizen Clause, under the 14th Amendment\u00a0to the Constitution, states that \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",
      "Congress passed the 14th Amendment in 1866, during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. In 1868, the amendment was ratified to extend citizenship to people born on U.S. soil, invalidating the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision, which barred slaves and descendants of slaves from becoming citizens.",
      "Why does Trump want to end birthright citizenship?",
      "Trump has been talking about ending birthright citizenship since his presidential campaign in 2015. In a policy paper at the time, he called birthright citizenship \"the biggest magnet for illegal immigration.\" In the 2023 video, Trump blamed birthright citizenship for \"birth tourism,\" in which he said migrants spend the final weeks of their pregnancies in hotels in order to give birth in the U.S. and then use the child's citizenship status to bring relatives into the U.S. through \"chain migration,\" also known as family-based migration.",
      "During his first term, Trump pledged to end birthright citizenship but did not do so. He told \"Meet the Press\" that he had planned to sign an executive action on birthright citizenship before his focus turned to fighting COVID-19.",
      "Trump called the guarantee of citizenship by birth \"ridiculous,\" telling Welker that the U.S. is the only country with birthright citizenship. In fact, dozens of other countries have birthright citizenship.",
      "\"If somebody sets a foot \u2014 just a foot, one foot, you don't need two \u2014 on our land, congratulations, you are now a citizen of the United States of America,\" Trump complained. \"We're going to end that because it's ridiculous.\"",
      "Opponents of birthright citizenship say it was never intended to cover undocumented immigrants' children or so-called \"birth tourism.\" They contend the amendment was ratified to eliminate barriers to birthright citizenship based on race.",
      "More broadly, the pledge is part of what Trump has billed as a radical shift on immigration that he campaigned on, part of a promise to target both unauthorized and legal immigrants using unprecedented measures likely to test the limits on his authority.",
      "Can Trump end birthright citizenship?",
      "When asked whether he could get around the 14th Amendment through executive action, Trump acknowledged \"it would maybe have to go back to the people, but we have to end it,\" which seemed to indicate he might try to initiate a constitutional amendment to end the right, if necessary. He clarified that he would pursue an end to birthright citizenship through executive action \"if we can.\"",
      "Could Trump repeal birthright citizenship through executive action?",
      "\"The answer is no,\" said Michael LeRoy, professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign School of Labor and Employment Relations and College of Law. That's because the president lacks the authority to unilaterally change the Constitution.",
      "Eliminating birthright citizenship through a constitutional amendment would be nearly impossible as well, because of the widespread approval needed not only from Congress but also from the states.",
      "What's enshrined in the Constitution can't be altered\u00a0by a regular congressional vote, either. Amendments not only have to be approved by a two-thirds vote in both chambers of Congress, but ratified by three-fourths of state legislatures, or three-fourths of conventions called in each state for ratification. It's an extensive process with a high bar.",
      "The only time in U.S. history a constitutional amendment has been repealed was when the 18th Amendment prohibiting the manufacture, sale and transportation of intoxication liquors, better known as prohibition, was repealed in 1933 through the addition of the 21st Amendment, LeRoy noted.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina says he's working on drafting a constitutional amendment to end the practice.",
      "Do other countries besides the U.S. have birthright citizenship?",
      "The U.S. is far from the only country with birthright citizenship, although birthright citizenship without conditions is more common in North and South America than it is in the rest of the world.",
      "Unlike some countries, the U.S. does not require a parent to be a citizen for a child born on U.S. soil to become a citizen. It's automatic.",

However, he wrote that the court should hear an \"appropriate case\" to \"make clear that Americans are always free to invoke the Second Amendment as a defense against unconstitutional firearms-licensing schemes.\"",
      "The court laid out the so-called \"history and tradition\" standard in a landmark Second Amendment decision in June 2022. The test requires the government to show that a gun law is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.",
      "The Supreme Court provided some clarity about its new standard this past June, when it upheld a federal firearms prohibition for alleged domestic abusers, but lower courts have still struggled to apply the framework when assessing the constitutionality of firearm restrictions. That decision involved whether certain categories of people \u2014 namely those found to pose a credible threat to others \u2014 can be temporarily disarmed.",
      "The case from Hawaii involved the state's rules for licenses to carry handguns in public. Under the state's scheme, residents must obtain a permit to legally own a firearm. Those who want to carry a gun publicly also must obtain a carry license, which can be acquired by demonstrating an \"urgency or need,\" good moral character and that they are \"engaged in the protection of life and property.\"",
      "Applicants also have to be at least 21 years old and a U.S. citizen. Police departments had the discretion to deny licenses.",
      "In December 2017, Christopher Wilson was arrested after he and a group of hikers were found on a trail running through private property into the West Maui Mountains. Wilson and his fellow hikers told police they didn't see \"no trespassing\" signs on the property and were headed into the mountains to look at the moon and planets. Wilson also told police he had a weapon, and a loaded pistol was seized from his waistband.",
      "Wilson didn't have a permit to acquire a gun or a license to carry it and was charged with violating Hawaii laws for carrying or possessing a handgun.",
      "Wilson sought to dismiss the charges on the grounds that they violated his Second Amendment rights under two recent Supreme Court decisions, one of which said the Constitution guarantees the right to keep a handgun in the home for self-defense.",
      "Wilson's bid to toss out the charges was denied, but soon after, the Supreme Court handed down its June 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights and laid out its history-and-tradition test for evaluating the constitutionality of firearms rules.",
      "On the heels of that decision, Wilson again sought to have the charges against him dismissed, arguing that under the Supreme Court's standard, he was legally allowed to carry a firearm for self-defense, and the state had to justify its licensing scheme.",
      "A trial court sided with Wilson and dismissed the charges against him. But the Hawaii Supreme Court reversed that decision and concluded that prosecuting Wilson for carrying a handgun didn't violate the Constitution. The Hawaii court also lambasted the nation's highest court for its Second Amendment rulings.",
      "The state supreme court claimed that the Supreme Court \"distorts and cherry-picks historical evidence\" in its Second Amendment cases and accused the high court of ad-libbing a new standard for evaluating gun laws.",
      "Referencing the Supreme Court's latest decision, the Hawaii Supreme Court said its new test is a \"backward-looking approach\" that \"ignores today's realities.\"",
      "\"The spirit of Aloha clashes with a federally-mandated lifestyle that lets citizens walk around with deadly weapons during day-to-day activities,\" Hawaii's highest court wrote.",
      "Wilson, represented by public defenders, appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Hawaii court showed \"open hostility to the individual rights protected by the Second Amendment.\"",
      "They warned in a filing that refusing to apply the court's history-and-tradition test \"upends the constitutional order between the States and the national government. When constitutional rights are incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment, the states must recognize them.\"",
      "Writing on Monday, Thomas said the decision by the Hawaii Supreme Court \"failed to give the Second Amendment its due regard.\"",
      "\"Had the Hawaii Supreme Court followed its duty to consider the merits of Wilson's defense, the licensing scheme's unconstitutionality should have been apparent,\" he wrote.",
      "But Thomas noted that \"correction of the Hawaii Supreme Court's error must await another day,\" since Wilson sought to dismiss only some of the charges and asked the court to review an \"interlocutory order over which we may not have jurisdiction.\" Thomas said that Wilson could ask the court to review the case again after trial.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch echoed that sentiment in a statement of his own, writing that \"Mr. Wilson remains free to seek this Court's review after final judgment.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday turned away a challenge to race-neutral admissions criteria at three prestigious Boston high schools that aimed to increase the racial and economic diversity of their student bodies.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch noted that the schools have since changed the admissions policy, which \"greatly diminish[es] the need for our review.\" Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, disagreed with the decision not to hear the case.",
      "The challenge came on the heels of the Supreme Court's June 2023 decision that struck down affirmative action at higher-education institutions and said race can no longer be used as a factor in admissions decisions.",
      "Schools nationwide are now weighing how to better diversify their student bodies without running afoul of the Supreme Court's ruling, and are looking to other factors like zip codes and socioeconomics that can be taken into consideration to achieve that objective.",
      "In Boston, admission to the three so-called \"Exam Schools,\" Boston Latin Schools, Boston Latin Academy and the John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, was based on a combination of a student's score on a standardized test, grade point average and preference. But the COVID-19 pandemic roiled the admissions process, as it became difficult to administer its exam-based process.",
      "Under admissions criteria revised in light of the impact of the pandemic, 20% of seats were awarded based on students' GPA and the rest of the seats went to students with the highest GPAs from each of Boston's zip codes.",
      "The admissions process launched in November 2020 and closed in January 2021. Under the revised criteria, 43% of incoming students were economically disadvantaged, an increase from the prior year. Of those admitted to the exam schools, 31% were White, 23% Black, 23% Hispanic, and 18% Asian, according to court filings.",
      "Under the old plan, 39% of invited students were White, 21% Asian, 21% Hispanic and 14% Black.",
      "The criteria was only in effect for one year, and beginning with the 2022-2023 school year, the school system put in place a new plan that relies on grades, census tracts and performance on a standardized test.",
      "In February 2021, the Boston Parent Coalition for Academic Excellence sued the Boston School Committee, which oversees the city's public school system, and superintendent on behalf of 14 anonymous White and Asian students who claimed they applied for admission to the exam schools that fall. They sought to bar the committee from implementing the plan.",
      "A federal district court sided with the school system, finding that the revised admissions criteria did not violate the Constitution and was racially race neutral. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit upheld that decision, finding in part that the Boston School Committee's use of neutral selection criteria to increase racial diversity was allowed by the Supreme Court.",
      "The coalition appealed to the high court, arguing that the admissions criteria was designed to reduce the number of Asian American and White students who were allowed to attend the three exam schools. The parents argued that under the 1st Circuit's decision, a school district could \"openly target\" students based on their race.",
      "\"Should the court turn away this case, it will only embolden government officials to continue targeting disfavored racial groups \u2014 particularly, Asian Americans,\" they argued in a filing.",
      "But the Boston School Committee argued that there is no longer a controversy for the Supreme Court to decide. The admissions criteria at the center of the challenge was adopted for one year when the COVID-19 pandemic made it impossible to administer its existing exam-based process, it said.",
      "Lawyers for the school district also said the temporary admissions plan was developed and ended before the Supreme Court's affirmative action decision.",
      "\"Nothing in this Court's precedent mandates that a public body be blind to whether its race-neutral policies will have a disparate impact on historically disadvantaged groups, or even help reduce past disparate impacts,\" they said.",
      "Alito wrote that the Supreme Court, through its decision not to hear the case, has \"now twice refused to correct a glaring constitutional error that threatens to perpetuate race-based affirmative action in defiance of Students for Fair Admissions,\" referring to the 2023 case.",
      "The Supreme Court already has been asked to step into two recent disputes over admissions policies at a prestigious Virginia high school and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.",
      "In February, the justices turned away a challenge to the admissions criteria at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. Administrators said the policy is designed to mitigate socioeconomic and geographic barriers for prospective students.",
      "The high court also said it would not stop West Point from considering race in its admissions process while a legal fight over its policies plays out before a federal appellate court.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump plans to act on the \"first day\" of his presidency on the cases of some Jan. 6 defendants and said he believes the House members on the select Jan. 6 committee who investigated the 2021 Capitol riot, including Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson and former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, \"should go to jail.\"",
      "In an interview that aired Sunday on NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" Trump told host Kristen Welker he would not direct the FBI director or attorney general to do so, but said \"I think they'll have to look at that.\"",
      "The president-elect was also pressed on whether he would pardon some or all of the Capitol riot defendants. He indicated he would not issue a universal blanket pardon: \"We're going to look at independent cases.\" Last week, one of Trump's Senate allies, GOP Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri, told CBS News he thinks Trump and the next attorney general should be going through the riot defendants on a \"case-by-case\" basis.",
      "Trump said of the Jan. 6 defendants and convicts, \"I'm going to be acting very quickly,\" adding that he planned to act as soon as he's inaugurated in January. \"First day,\" he said.",
      "CBS News' review of Justice Department filings shows there have been approximately 1,560 Jan. 6 defendants, and approximately 590 of them are charged with assaulting police. More than 900 defendants have pleaded guilty.",
      "Several of the defendants have openly predicted pardons from Trump are imminent \u2014 including for those accused of violent acts.",
      "Over the weekend, Joseph Hutchinson, who is accused of beating police during the Capitol riot and was a fugitive from justice for three years as he eluded authorities, said in a filing that he wants to be released immediately, arguing, \"No one is going to flee from a trial that isn't coming.\u00a0 I will await my pardon like any responsible person.\"",
      "Trump has not yet said if he'll allow new Capitol riot prosecutions, investigations or pending prosecutions to continue. Hundreds more arrests have been expected.",

      "\"No, I'm not doing that unless I find something that I think is reasonable,\" Trump said. \"But that's not going to be my decision.\" He said he would leave it up to Pam Bondi, who he intends to name attorney general and Kash Patel, his pick for FBI director.",
      "He said he would leave it to Bondi to determine whether to investigate special counsel Jack Smith, who brought both federal criminal cases against Trump, one on election interference in 2020 and another on documents he allegedly took after his first term from the White House to his Florida residence.",
      "\"I want her to do what she wants to do,\" he said of investigating Smith, whom he referred to as \"corrupt.\" \"I'm not going to instruct her to do it.\"",
      "Cheney on Sunday night said in a statement that Trump's suggestion she and others on the Jan. 6 committee should be jailed is \"a continuation of his assault on the rule of law and the foundations of our republic.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump knows his claims about the select committee are ridiculous and false, as has been detailed extensively, including by Chairman Thompson in this July 2023 letter,\" she said. \"There is no conceivably appropriate factual or constitutional basis for what Donald Trump is suggesting \u2013 a Justice Department investigation of the work of a congressional committee \u2013 and any lawyer who attempts to pursue that course would quickly find themselves engaged in sanctionable conduct.\"",

      "Mr. Biden says the administration is \"clear eyed\" about the possibility that ISIS may try to gain control amid a power vacuum, but he said that \"we will not let that happen.\" He noted that the U.S. conducted precision airstrikes within Syria targeting ISIS camps and operatives.",

      "The president credited his administration's work in other foreign conflicts with contributing to the collapse of Assad's government, arguing support for Assad from Iran, Hezbollah and Russia fell apart \"because all three of them are far weaker today than they were when I took office.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For some analysis on the events unfolding in the Middle East, we're joined now by Andrew Boyd, a CBS News contributor who previously held leadership positions at the CIA and once served in Damascus as a Foreign Service Officer, and Mouaz Moustafa, the Executive Director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force. Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" Mouaz, I want to start with you. You've been involved with the Syrian opposition for well over a decade. Help us understand what it means to see the regime fall.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE SYRIAN EMERGENCY TASK FORCE: It's an indescribable feeling of- of happiness that- that this regime, this dictator who has made the worst crimes of the 21st century, alongside Russia, and Iran, and ISIS, all of these horrible people have been defeated by a coalition of rebel forces that did not need any support from any outside country, not Turkey, not Qatar, not anyone. This time around, Syria was liberated by its people, for its people. And it's truly inspiring. And it's not just good reverberations for Syria, for the Middle East and Europe as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot of uncertainty as to what this all means. Andy, you've watched this region very closely for some time. At this hour, none of the officials that I have spoken with in regional governments, in the U.S. government, seem to know where Bashar al-Assad even went. Does it matter where he went?",
      "ANDREW BOYD, FMR. CIA CENTER FOR CYBER INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR: Mouaz may differ on this one. I don't think it does, now that the government has fallen. I do think what unfolds over the next couple of weeks, and- and if the opposition actually treats all of the factions in Syria with dignity and respect and- and ensures their safety, we will have more understanding, because you know, there's a lot of atrocities that were carried out by the Assad regime. Those people are probably still in Syria, and so we'll see how that goes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A fair point, the people who worked within the regime are still there.",
      "BOYD: Syrian military intelligence, the mil- the other intelligence services, Syrian General Intelligence Directorate, I mean, have- have a lot of blood on their hands.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, and I know that you personally, Mouaz, were involved in smuggling out documented evidence of some of the torture, of the mass atrocities, the systematic, institutionalized violence that happened from some of those prisons. You brought it to Congress. You made it public. What do you think we can learn now, as those billing- buildings are being seized by rebels?",
      "MOUSTAFA: Well, the first thing that we are working really hard, and I can tell you all the rebel factions are working really hard to do, is find Austin Tice and hopefully bring him home, God willing, alive, to his family\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: An American journalist who once worked at CBS News for some time, a Marine veteran.",
      "MOUSTAFA: And he's a hero. He went to cover the plight of the Syrian people from what Assad, Iran, and Russia have been doing to them, and God willing, we bring him home alive, but we need to find him and bring him to his mom no- no matter what. And the Syrians owe him a debt forever. Also, other Americans that are undeclared. And freeing Syrians from- from prisons is something that's really important, but the collection of that intelligence as well as the Hezbollah, Iranian, Russian, Assad regime, any officials that have been arrested by the Syrian people, again, without any support of the international community or regional countries, who actually worked to try to save Assad, that is valuable, that's valuable to the United States. That's why we need to engage with this new, emerging government that God willing, is the path to democracy. The only Arab country in the world with the hope of being a democracy is Syria. That's incredible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That- that's a big promise to make.",
      "MOUSTAFA: It's not a promise, it's hope, that's realistic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Hope. Andy- but right now, the person we're seeing emerge\u2014we showed him, in Umayyad Mosque, hugely symbolic place to come and make a speech, in Damascus\u2014is this leader of a terrorist group, designated by the United States as a terrorist, $10 million bounty on his head.",
      "BOYD: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that signify to you?",
      "BOYD: Well, as Congressman Turner said, it's not going to be an easy process to un-designate Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which means the U.S. can't talk to him.",
      "BOYD: The U.S. can't talk to him. I mean, you know, we can accommodate some sort of flexibility there, but he's not going to instantly come off the designation list. So, I mean, we'll see. I mean, you have said that- that he's going to respect all the factions, the Druze, the Christian, even the Shia and Alawi, who were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of 1000s of Syrians\u2014",
      "MOUSTAFA: I'm speaking by his actions, not by his words. Aleppo, et cetera. You could talk to the Bishop of Aleppo, but, yeah, absolutely.",
      "BOYD: Right, but, you know, time will tell. I mean, I'm a born skeptic, as a lot of my colleagues at the agency are. We will see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead, Mouaz. Tell us who is in this- you talked about it as a coalition, not just HTS. Who are these people who now seem to be in control of Syria?",
      "MOUSTAFA: Sure. First of all, since the whole world is boiling down the whole Syrian revolution to one faction of a coalition, or let's say, even one person within a faction of that coalition, let's discuss that. Why was HTS put on the terrorist list? It was put on a terrorist list over an older version called Jabhat al-Nusra that had a loose affiliation with al-Qaeda, not the transnational or regional terrorist thing, but an inter-Islamist, whatever. I don't agree with any\u2014",
      "BOYD: But- but Mouaz, I think Margaret's talking also as a person Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani. I mean, he was in al-Qaeda in Iraq. He worked for Abu Musab Zarqawi. He spent several years in Bucca prison as a detainee, you know, so, we're also, we're talking HTS, Jabhat al-Nusra, but also him as a person. He's designated\u2014",
      "MOUSTAFA: Sure, let's talk about him as a person. But what's hilarious about this is, right now, as millions of Syrians come back from Europe and are ready to come back home, as people have not been displaced, and there has been zero reports of violations, and I was on the phone with the Bishop of Aleppo. The reason I was on the phone is that President Trump, and people in President Trump's camp were concerned about the Christians in Syria. Of course, there's so much focus on, you know, any time there's something- terrorists, terrorists. And- and what ended up happening is the Bishop of Aleppo said, Sir, first, it's the coalition of groups, including HTS, and we have had electricity more now than we have under the regime, and our only fear is Russian air strikes. So I'm glad that President Trump still- told Russia what it should do: get out of Syria, and it has done so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will be watching to see whether that continues to be the case and what transpires. And what it means for the\u2014",
      "MOUSTAFA: One- one last thing, Margaret, it's really important\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mouaz, I have to go. I'm so sorry.",
      "MOUSTAFA: But al-Qaeda in Syria [UNINTEL], it's the affiliate, and HTS has defeated it and defeated ISIS. The old designation is kind of irrelevant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will be watching this developing story, and we'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Kelly, on that point, I mean, some of this sounds like management 101, that this is not specific to the Secret Service. A lot of organizations have problems like what you just highlighted there.",
      "Acting Director Rowe testified Thursday he thinks the Secret Service needs to identify leaders earlier on and promote them based on ability, not just hours logged on the clock.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: But isn't that true of everything in life?",
      "When you look at this, when people talk about, we need better leadership than that, I was on those grounds the night before. They weren't set up at that point. They were going to work through the night to get it ready. And then you find out afterwards that there was no coordination, there was no team meeting, there was no, well, this is going to be your responsibility to know where you're supposed to be and what time you're supposed to be there.",
      "You bring local law enforcement in, but you don't \u2013 you don't include them in the planning. Or, when you do the \u2013 the interviews afterwards, well, I thought he was going to do it. No, we thought somebody else was going to do it.",
      "When you knew there was a suspicious person on the grounds \u2013 and this is a common \u2013 going back and forth now. This is where they said they weren't communicating with each other. You can't tell me that you didn't know until 10 minutes after 6:00 that you couldn't communicate. At 11 minutes after 6:00, the shooter took action.",
      "They knew an hour-and-a-half ahead of time. Out of all the thousands of the people walking around on that ter \u2013 on that property, there was a suspicious person, and they kept losing sight of him.",
      "I would have said \u2013 and I have no background in law enforcement \u2013 keep the president back until we clear the area. That's the part that doesn't make sense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Because they failed from the first thing, from the picking of the site, preparing the site, to the coordination of the site, to the ability to communicate.",
      "At every step of the way, they failed. And the question is, why didn't you just say, hold up, just hold up, don't let him come out?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when the acting director says on Thursday of this week, we need to pick better leaders, that would suggest that the agency today does not necessarily have the leaders it needs to fix\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Oh.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 all the things you just laid out.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes.",
      "And I think, by saying what he said, that's what he meant. They don't have the leadership they need. When they morphed them into Homeland Security back in 2001, 2 \u2013 whenever it was, they took away their identity and their exclusivity. When you're the best of the best, when you're the elite of the elites\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: \u2026 if you lose that, then all of a sudden you just become part of a team.",
      "There was a huge mistake back when Homeland came into existence. That's not a criticism, because they did what they had to do back then. But I'm telling you, on July 13, there was a lack of professionalism, there was a lack of concern, there was a lack of coordination.",
      "And the ability to communicate is the one thing I will never understand. You knew you couldn't talk to each other. Why did you go forward?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I want to be really clear that there are plenty of extraordinary agents and officers in the Secret Service, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: And when we talk about a failure of mission, you know, in Butler or any place else, that doesn't mean that, you know, 80, 90 percent of the \u2013 of the Secret Service agents aren't phenomenal and dedicated professionals.",
      "But there is a systematic problem here. The structure, the personnel, the staffing of the Secret Service, hasn't changed in years, at the same time as we are now asking them to do things that they didn't do a decade ago.",
      "And they are \u2013 they are fulfilling an operational tempo that requires them to be deployed\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 three weeks out of a month, constantly doing events, skipping firearms training, skipping leadership development training. We are not developing their skills and their training. And I think you see the results of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you made three dozen recommendations in this report on what to change, including to reduce the number of protectees.",
      "Right now, Secret Service protects not only presidential leadership, their immediate families, their spouses, their children, candidates, and anyone really the president designates. Should all of that continue?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: We've increased the size of protectees that are out there, including foreign assets that come here and people that bring \u2013 bring their families and things. So that's gotten so big.",
      "But, if you look at Homeland, I think \u2013 I think, when you look at Secret Service, it's about 3 percent of their overall spend. The biggest spend is on FEMA. And, now, we don't want to change anything like that.",
      "But you can't have an exclusive without funding them to the level that they need to be funded, not only in manpower and in training, but in the assets that they have to have available to them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You always have to ask yourself, what are your missions and what is the thing that only you can do? Like, what is that no- fail mission?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: In this case, with the Secret Service, that no- fail mission is to protect our highest-level candidates and our highest- level elected officials, period.",
      "All the other things, investigation of financial crimes, training and support, these are all secondary missions. So, if you're not actually adequately performing any of those missions to standard, and if you have reached a breaking point, then it's time to assess, what are those missions that need to fall off and to be transitioned elsewhere?",
      "That's my view.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You, Congressman Crow, seemed very frustrated, based on the report and hearing that you have\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Do I seem frustrated?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: No, no, you're very\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, with the fact that you couldn't find out more about the shooter, both in Butler and in \u2013 the potential shooter in Mar-a- Lago.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes.",
      "That's actually a really important element to the story. And people have rightful questions about it. I have questions about it. And that is, why did the shooter do this?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: What drove him to do it? Was he a lone wolf shooter? Did he have associates or affiliates? What was his motivation? How was he radicalized?",
      "We endeavored to get answers to those questions. We submitted numerous requests to the Department of Justice and FBI. Their response is, this is an ongoing criminal investigation, and we can't give that information to Congress.",
      "That, in my view, is an unacceptable position. And here's why.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For both Butler and Mar-a-Lago, that was the answer?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Correct. That's right.",
      "And here's why that's unacceptable. I sit on the Intelligence Committee. I have sat on the Armed Services Committee. And Congress all the time gets access to our nation's most sensitive secrets, ongoing operations, intelligence operations, military operations.",
      "So you can't tell me that there isn't a way to put us into a secure facility and get us information about an ongoing criminal investigation, when I regularly am receiving briefs on what our \u2013 our spies and our military special operators are doing regularly around the world.",
      "So, none of this stands to reason. And we have dedicated ourselves to continue to get those answers. And if the FBI and DOJ thinks that they can wait us out and stonewall us, they are wrong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think they're intentionally withholding information?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I don't know what their intention is. I mean, I'm not a mind reader. But, you know, I have been around Congress long enough to know what \u2013 what\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: When you get stonewalled. Yes. Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: When you get stonewalled.",
      "I mean, listen, this is \u2013 this is not uncommon\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: No.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 when you're dealing with agencies and departments. It's a pretty regular method. And it's something that, you know, we encounter all the time in our oversight responsibilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we don't know, or tell me if perhaps you know answer to this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, we're \u2013 we're in\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was there a foreign nexus? Do we know, yes or no?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Americans are deluged with misinformation and disinformation that's coming from a variety of sources.",
      "And conspiracy theories sometimes take root when there's a lack of information or there's conflicting information. So our job is to try to get information out there, to be transparent, to be accessible, to tell the real story.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: And that's why this is important. This element of that story is important, because there's a lot of conspiracies around\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Absolutely.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 these shootings, right? And we take that seriously.",
      "And we want to \u2013 we want to, you know, rebuff those. But, you know, in this case \u2013 and I sit on a lot of other committees with access to information \u2013 I have seen no evidence that a state actor, an adversary was responsible for either of these attempted assassination attempts. I have seen no evidence.",
      "But, you know, when you're in a position where, you know, the government says, well, it's not this, but we won't tell you what it is, right, and \u2013 and we can't tell you \u2013 we can't tell you definitively, well, you know, people respond and have questions about that.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: And I understand that mentality. So, even though we don't have evidence of one thing, people still want to know what else it is. And I still want to know what else it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he act alone? Do we know that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We don't know that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or Congress doesn't know that.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes.",
      "And, you know, it's one thing to say \u2013 and I'm going to be really clear about this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Because this is very, very sensitive territory\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Because we want to make sure we're not\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 getting people spun up unnecessarily.",
      "There is no evidence of \u2013 from other sources, you know, internal government sources, from our investigation, that others were involved, that he acted with others, and that a foreign state or adversary was involved in this.",
      "But that still raises the question of, why did he do this?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Was just \u2013 was he just a disturbed young man who decided to take action alone? Probably. I mean, that's probably the answer.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: That's what it looks like now, yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Right?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's what it looks like. But we need to know, right? And let's get the information out there that the government has to make sure that we can settle this. And that's \u2013 that's our obligation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the agency today able to do its job, if they weren't able to do it in July?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: We were tasked with trying to find out what happened that day, why it happened that day, and to \u2013 and to the best of our ability make sure that the Secret Service, that doesn't happen again to them.",
      "We can't guarantee that these things won't happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Because it's a crazy world right now. But there was too much ahead of time that we did know that we didn't share.",
      "I would never let my child play near a road. And when you do, you put people in jeopardy of that and you know there's a danger there. Don't let it happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there anything that you feel important to raise that we didn't talk about?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: We never identified as Republicans and Democrats. We \u2013 we defined as a task force to find out what happened that day.",
      "And the whole \u2013 the whole goal from day one is to restore the faith and trust and confidence that the American people must have in this agency. At this point, it's probably at the lowest ebb it's ever been.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: And the other thing is, I think we realize that threats are 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. You can't take a day off. You can't take a play off. You've got to be ready every single moment for anything that could possibly happen.",
      "Is that a difficult task? Yes. Is it almost impossible? Yes, there's a lot of bad actors out there. But you know what's not impossible? Our dedication to the fact that we're going to do the best we can do every single day to ensure that the American people have the faith and trust and confidence they must have in us.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This is a tough place to work.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Oh.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: And there are \u2013 frankly, there are some people here that don't belong here, that I think are just here to get attention, to get, you know, clicks on social media, that aren't here to legislate.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: But this has been one of the best experiences of my time in Congress. And I couldn't have asked for a better partner than Mike Kelly.",
      "You know, and he's a very conservative Republican, and I'm a Democrat. We're both proud of that.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We're proud of our politics. And\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: We are.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: And we represent our districts, right?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes. Yes. We do. We do.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's actually \u2013 that's actually the job, right?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We represent the culture and the politics and the hopes and dreams of our districts. And that's what's so \u2013 so beautiful about this place when it works well.",
      "But this process \u2013 and I think this is really important for Americans to understand \u2013 this process was serious. It was bipartisan. It was \u2013 it was deep. And we did the job that we were asked to do.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You can watch our full interview on our Web site and our YouTube page.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A panel of federal judges in D.C. last week upheld a new law that could effectively ban the popular social media app TikTok by mid- January if its Chinese owners do not sell it to a new buyer.",
      "Frank McCourt, the executive chairman of McCourt Global and founder of Project Liberty, is one of the potential buyers, and he joins us now.",
      "Good to see you here.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT (Executive Chairman, McCourt Global): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, TikTok says, well, they might go to the Supreme Court on this one. If they don't, their parent company, ByteDance, has said they're not interested in selling.",
      "Do you have any indication that they will and that the incoming Trump administration would support someone like you buying it?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Well, yes, I think where we are now, Margaret, is, there's three options.",
      "You know, one is an appeal. Our lawyers tell us there's very little chance of a successful appeal by ByteDance, strong bipartisan legislation, a 3-0 by the three \u2013 you know, by the appellate court.",
      "So now that leaves us with two, a ban or a sale. We don't want to see it banned. I would add that President \u2013 president-elect Trump has also said he doesn't want to see it banned. So now let's talk about the sale.",
      "So we've been working for the last eight months on the assumption that the legislation would be upheld and that there would be a sale.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: So, that's where we are right now. And we're working very, very hard to be in a position to buy the U.S. portion of TikTok\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: \u2026 so it's not shut down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what is that worth to you? There are estimates it could be as high as $200 billion in worth.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Two hundred billion dollars would be more \u2013 more in the range of what the entirety of the platform is worth, not just the U.S. piece.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: And let's be clear. The Chinese government has said they're not selling the algorithm. They view that as I.P. of the country.",
      "So, Tik \u2013 U.S. TikTok is a piece of ByteDance. If it's sold, it will be sold without an algorithm. So the value will be far, far less than 200 \u2013 $200 billion. We have circled over $20 billion to be in a position, and we're very serious about raising whatever capital is required to buy the platform.",
      "And \u2013 and, to be clear\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: \u2026 we're looking to move the 170 million users over to a new protocol, where the individuals will own and control their identity and their data. We're not looking to replicate the existing version.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, let's talk about that.",
      "As you said, 170 million Americans use TikTok, especially young people. U.S. law prohibits foreign control of mass media, but this social media space is kind of a loophole here. There aren't a lot of governing rules in this space.",
      "Do you think Congress needs to write new rules of the role \u2013 of the road to ban foreign ownership and to put restrictions on even owners like you?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: I think we need to upgrade our regulations and our policies. There's no doubt about that.",
      "But, far more importantly, we need to fix the technology. The Internet is broken, fundamentally broken. We heard your guest earlier Representative Turner talk about the threat from China on our telecom hack, massive hack, massive threat to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they're still in the telecom system, according to U.S. intelligence.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Absolutely.",
      "And we heard your recent guests, Representatives Kelly and Crow, talk about the deluge of misinformation and disinformation, the fact that it's a very dangerous world right now.",
      "The reason why the Congress moved so quickly with TikTok to pass the legislation is because it is a national security threat to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: And the reason why the judges upheld it is for that same reason.",
      "So let's turn a problem into a solution by taking advantage of this moment, move the 170 million users over to a new protocol where individuals are respected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an indication from president-elect Trump that he wants to see an American entity buy this? Because he would also have some influence in the outcome.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Of course, as president-elect, he'll have massive influence. But\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you spoken to him?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: But \u2013 but President \u2013 President Trump is a dealmaker. We know that. I'm a dealmaker, OK? I have been doing business deals my entire \u2013 my entire life.",
      "Let's make a deal where everybody wins, where China's able to sell the U.S. portion of TikTok, where American citizens are protected, and where there's \u2013 and 170 million users continue to enjoy the platform. So he has said he doesn't want it banned, which means a sale.",
      "And the legislation and the \u2013 the appellate decision require that this platform be \u2013 be owned by Americans. We have built a clean, bottom-up American stack to move this user base over, where there will be no Chinese backdoors and no ability to \u2013 to take advantage of American citizens.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 you're indicating you've built out some technology, you think, that will not allow for government surveillance?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But can you, if you are \u2013 whoever owns this is going to be powerful, if you get 170 million Americans on a platform, particularly young people, to consume the information on this system.",
      "So what guarantees do you make? Because Facebook and Twitter, they also harvest information about consumers. Would you?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Yes, well, that's exactly what we don't want to do.",
      "So the reason why we want to move people to a new stack where you can't harvest without permission, so individuals will own and control their identity and their data, permission its use, will actually have an Internet that respects people, as opposed to exploits them.",
      "Imagine empowering people. And, to be clear, Margaret, I'm not looking to be the CEO of TikTok. We call it the people's bid, because we want this to empower people and to stop this nonsense where we're exploiting people by scraping their data and taking advantage of them, and, in the case of TikTok, actually creating a national security threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Elon Musk, who owns X, formerly known as Twitter, now has raised concerns about content moderation restricting free speech. Do you share that concern, and what restrictions would you put on paid political advertising?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: I mentioned earlier that we need better policies, for sure, but we need better tech.",
      "Right now, we have a tech stack that's built, and these giant apps scrape our data and exploit it. Why not flip the power? Why not actually give people their data back?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Our data is our personhood in this age. Let us decide how to use it. Let us each decide what moderation we're comfortable with, what censorship we're comfortable with, what privacy we're comfortable with.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should \u2013 OK, so the surgeon general says you need a warning label because this is damaging the mental health of young people in this country.",
      "Should people under the age of 16 have access?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Under the current tech stack, I agree with the surgeon general. Under a new technology \u2013 listen, I'm a builder. My family has been building for five generations.",
      "This is an engineering problem that can be fixed. Let's take this ban of TikTok\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: \u2026 this massive national security problem, and turn it into a solution for Americans. Let's make it a win, a win-win.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Well, mid-January, we will see what happens in this case. And we will watch your potential bid here. Thank you for joining us.",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 15:21:06 -0500",
    "summary": "The task force is wrapping up its work probing security failures surrounding the July 13 and Sept. 15 assassination attempts.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, the top Democrat on the bipartisan House task force investigating the assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump, said he's concerned that \"there's a culture of silence\" at the Secret Service that prevents agents from speaking out when they should.",
      "\"I was struck by the stories in the recount of the specific actions of officers and agents on the ground that day,\" Crow said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"There were some heroic ones, but there were also a lot of examples of people that knew that something was wrong and they didn't say anything.\"",
      "The task force, which the House voted to establish earlier this year, in recent days wrapped up its work probing security failures surrounding the July 13 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the Sept. 15 foiled attempt in West Palm Beach, Florida. In the wake of the initial attack, the Secret Service came under intense scrutiny, leading to the resignation of its director.",
      "Last week, Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe testified before the panel in its final hearing, where he acknowledged the Secret Service's failure to adequately secure the area in Butler, noted \"critical gaps\" within the agency's operations and said \"we did not meet the expectations of the American public, Congress, and our protectees.\" He noted that it has been his \"singular focus to bring much-needed reform to the Secret Service.",
      "He added that the agency is \"operating in a heightened threat environment, with expanding protection requirements.\"",
      "\"The responsibilities of the Secret Service are critical to the national security of the United States,\" Rowe said, adding that \"our agency is not defined by one failure, but by our ability to learn from mistakes.\"",
      "Task force chairman Rep. Mike Kelly, a Pennsylvania Republican whose district includes Butler, said the agency lacks the leadership it needs. And he argued that when the Secret Service was brought under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security, \"they took away their identity \u2014 their exclusivity.\"",
      "\"When you're the best of the best, when you're the elite of the elites, if you lose that, then all of a sudden you just become part of a team,\" Kelly said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"That was a huge mistake.\"",
      "On the July 13 attack, Kelly said the Secret Service failed \"at every step of the way.\"",
      "\"They failed from the first thing, from the picking of the site, the preparing the site to the coordination of the site, the ability to communicate,\" Kelly said, adding that there was no team meeting before the event, and local law enforcement wasn't included in the planning.",
      "\"On July 13, there was a lack of professionalism, there was a lack of concern, there was a lack of coordination, and the ability to communicate is the one thing I'll never understand,\" Kelly said. \"You knew you couldn't talk to each other. Why did you go forward?\"",
      "Crow said important questions remain about the shooter in Butler and would-be shooter in West Palm Beach, saying that the task force submitted numerous requests to the Justice Department and FBI about their motivations. Crow claimed that the requests have been denied because the criminal investigations are ongoing, calling it an \"unacceptable position\" and accused the agencies of trying to \"stonewall\" Congress on the issue.",
      "The Colorado Democrat argued that when it comes to the Secret Service, there is a \"systematic problem here.\" He noted that although there are \"plenty of extraordinary agents and officers\" in the Secret Service, there was a \"failure of mission\" in Butler.",
      "\"The structure, the personnel, the staffing of the Secret Service hasn't changed in years, at the same time as we are now asking them to do things that they didn't do a decade ago,\" Crow said, saying the tempo of the job leaves agents without time for adequate training. \"We are not developing their skills and their training, and I think you see the results of that.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Kelly said the task force has been working since Day One to try to help restore trust and confidence in the Secret Service, which he said was likely at \"the lowest ebb\" in its history. And he acknowledged the relentless pressure on the Secret Service.",
      "\"You've got to be ready every single moment for anything that could possibly happen. Is that a difficult task? Yes, is it almost impossible?\" Kelly said. \"But you know what's not impossible, our dedication to the fact that we're going to do the best we can do every single day to ensure that the American people have the faith and trust and confidence they must have in us.\"",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with business executive Frank McCourt on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 8, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A panel of federal judges in DC last week upheld a new law that could effectively ban the popular social media app TikTok by mid-January if its Chinese owners do not sell it to a new buyer. Frank McCourt, the Executive Chairman of McCourt Global, and founder of Project Liberty, is one of the potential buyers, and he joins us now. Good to see you here.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So TikTok says, well, they might go to the Supreme Court on this one. If they don't, their parent company, ByteDance, has said they're not interested in selling. Do you have any indication that they will and that the incoming Trump administration would support someone like you buying it?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Well yeah, I think where we are now, Margaret, is, there's three options. You know, one is an appeal. Our lawyers tell us there's very little chance of a successful appeal by Bytedance, strong bipartisan legislation, a three to zero vote by the three by the appellate court. So now that leaves us with two, a ban or a sale. We don't want to see it banned. I'd add that President- President-elect Trump, has also said he doesn't want to see it banned. So now let's talk about the sale. So we've been working for the last eight months on the assumption that the legislation would be upheld and that there would be a sale. So that's where we are right now, and we're working very, very hard to be in a position to buy the US portion of TikTok so it's not shut down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what is that worth to you? There are estimates it could be as high as $200 billion in worth.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT:\u00a0 $200 billion would be more more in the range of what the entirety of the platform is worth, not just the US piece. And let's be clear, the Chinese government has said they're not selling the algorithm. They view that as IP of the country. So US Tiktok is a piece of bytedance. If it's sold, it will be sold without an algorithm. So the value will be far, far less than 200- $200 billion. We have circled over $20 billion to be in a position, and we're very serious about raising whatever capital is required to buy the platform and and to be clear, yeah, we're looking to move the 170 million users over to a new protocol where the individuals will own and control their identity and their data. We're not looking to replicate the existing version.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So let's talk about that. As you said, 170 million Americans use TikTok, especially young people. US law prohibits foreign control of mass media, but this social media space is kind of a loophole here. There aren't a lot of governing rules in this space. Do you think Congress needs to write new rules of the role- of the road to ban foreign ownership and to put restrictions on even owners like you?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: I think we need to upgrade our regulations and our policies. There's no doubt about that. But far more importantly, we need to fix the technology. The internet is broken, fundamentally broken. We heard your guest earlier, Representative Turner, talk about the threat from China on our telecom hack, massive hack, massive threat to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they're still in the telecom system.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Absolutely. And we heard your recent guests, Representatives Kelly and Crow, talk about the deluge of misinformation and disinformation, the fact that it's a very dangerous world right now. The reason why the Congress moves so quickly with TikTok to pass the legislation is because it is a national security threat to Americans, and the reason why the judges upheld it is for that same reason. So let's turn a problem into a solution by taking advantage of this moment, move the 100 and 70 million users over to a new protocol where individuals are respected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an indication from President elect Trump that he wants to see an American entity buy this? Because he would also have some influence in the outcome.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Of course, as president elect he'll have massive influence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you spoken to him?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: But President Trump is a deal maker. We know that. I'm a deal-maker. Okay? I've been doing business deals my entire- my entire life. Let's make a deal where everybody wins, where China's able to sell the US portion of TikTok, where American citizens are protected, and where there's- and 170 million users continue to enjoy the platform. So he has said he doesn't want it banned, which means a sale. And the legislation and the- the appellate decision require that this platform be- be owned by Americans. We have built a clean, bottom-up American stack to move this user base over, where there'll be no Chinese back doors and no ability to to take advantage of American citizens.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're indicating you've built out some technology you think that will not allow for government surveillance.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But can you, if you are- whoever owns this is going to be powerful if you get 170 million Americans on a platform, particularly young people, to consume the information on this. System. So what guarantees do you make? Because Facebook and Twitter, they also harvest information about consumers. Would you?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Yeah, well, that's exactly what we don't want to do. So the reason why we want to move people to a new stack where you can't harvest without permission, so individuals will own and control their identity and their data permission its use, will actually have an internet that respects people as opposed to exploits them. Imagine empowering people. And to be clear, Margaret, I'm not looking to be the CEO of TikTok. We call it the people's bid, because we want this to empower people and to stop this nonsense where we're exploiting people by scraping their data and taking advantage of them, and in the case of Tiktok, actually creating a national security threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Elon Musk, who owns X, formerly known as Twitter, now has raised concerns about content moderation, restricting free speech. Do you share that concern, and what restrictions would you put on paid political ads?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: I mentioned earlier that we need better policies, for sure, but we need better tech right now. We have a tech stack that's built and these giant apps scrape our data and exploit it. Why not flip the power? Why not actually give people their data back. Our data is our personhood in this age, let us decide how to use it. Let us each decide what moderation we're comfortable with, what censorship we're comfortable with, what privacy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so the Surgeon General says you need a warning label, because this is damaging the mental health of young people in this country. Should people under the age of 16 have access?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Under the current tech stack, I agree with the Surgeon General, under a new technology. Listen, I'm a builder. My family has been building for five generations. This is an engineering problem that can be fixed. Let's take this ban of TikTok, this massive national security problem and turn it into a solution for Americans. Let's make it a win, a win, win.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, mid-January, we will see what happens in this case, and we will watch your potential bid here. Thank you for joining us. We'll be back in a moment."

    "summary": "Wisdom the Laysan albatross was first tagged by researchers in 1956. Since then, she's believed to have raised as many as 30 chicks.",
    "story": [
      "The oldest known wild bird in the world has laid an egg at the ripe age of about 74, her first in four years, U.S. wildlife officials said.",
      "The long-winged seabird named Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, returned to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at the northwestern edge of the Hawaiian Archipelago and laid what experts estimate may be her 60th egg, the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said in a Facebook post this week.",
      "Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, had returned to the atoll in the Pacific Ocean to lay and hatch eggs since 2006. Laysan albatrosses mate for life and lay one egg per year, but according to the USFWS, Akeakamai hadn't been seen for several years, prompting \"Wisdom to begin courtship dances with other males\" as soon as she returned to the island last week.",
      "\"We are optimistic that the egg will hatch,\" Jonathan Plissner, supervisory wildlife biologist at Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge said in a statement. Every year, millions of seabirds return to the refuge to nest and raise their young.",
      "Albatross parents take turns incubating an egg for about seven months. Chicks fly out to sea about five to six months after hatching. They spend most of their lives flying over the ocean and feeding on squid and fish eggs.",
      "Wisdom was first banded as an adult in 1956 and has raised as many as 30 chicks, Plissner said.",
      "The typical lifespan of a Laysan albatross is 68 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "As 60 Minutes reported in 2018, Wisdom's advanced years have seen her defy not only the general longevity odds for her species, but also the odds crated by the grim condition of her natural habitat. The islands of the Midway Atoll were she nests are awash with plastic pollution. The 60 Minutes team found that many of Wisdom's fellow albatrosses have died around her with bellies full of plastic, making her a source of some optimism for researchers.",
      "The USFWS called Wisdom\u00a0\"a world-renowned symbol of hope for all species that depend upon the health of the ocean to survive.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Geminid meteor shower peak is a week away, but this year it might be a good idea to keep an eye out early, according to NASA. Dedicated skywatchers might want to check the sky not only in the days ahead of the peak, however \u2014 but also early in the morning.",
      "The shower will peak from Friday Dec. 13 into early Saturday Dec. 14 \u2014 when the moon is nearly full, according to NASA. Illumination from the moon could make spotting the cosmic show a challenge during the peak, but bright meteors can be spotted the week before the peak.",
      "Here's what you should know about the Geminids meteor shower, including how to watch:",
      "Where you can see the Geminids",
      "Meteors from the Geminids will be visible throughout the sky and across the globe, according to NASA. They're best viewed in an area far away from city and street lights.",
      "Viewers \u2014 who should prepare for frigid temperatures \u2014 should lie flat on their backs with their feet facing south. Give your eyes a half hour to adjust to the dark.",
      "The shower usually starts around 9 or 10 p.m. local time, with the meteors best viewed at night or in the pre-dawn hours.",
      "EarthSky, an astronomy website published by experts in the field, suggests finding a way to block out the moon when watching for the Geminids.",
      "\"So with moonlit skies in 2024, you might only catch the brightest meteors,\" according to EarthSky. \"Luckily, many of the Geminids are bright meteors. Try blocking out the moon when watching for meteors.\"",
      "Are any nights this year good for Geminid viewing?",
      "Casual observers won't be able to pick up any noticeable activity from the Geminids until the night of Dec. 11, according to Bill Cooke, lead of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. More than half of the moon's surface will already be illuminated by the sun at that point of the month, so it will still cause some problems with meteor viewing.",
      "Astronomy fans determined to see the Geminids without interference from the moon's light may have some luck if they're willing to get up after moon-set around 3:30 a.m. local time, Cooke said. Even then though, it will be a challenge to spot many Geminids an hour.",
      "\"In short, 2024 is a bad year for Geminid watching \u2013 December 2025 will be much better,\" Cooke said.",
      "What are the Geminids?",
      "Most meteor showers originate from comets, but the Geminids come from 3200 Phaethon, an asteroid. The Geminids first appeared in the mid-1800s. At the time, there were 10 to 20 meteors an hour, but the shower has grown bigger and meteors are now visible at a rate of 120 meteors an hour under perfect conditions.",
      "While most meteors appear to be colorless or white, NASA scientists say the Geminids are bright, fast and usually yellow in color. They streak through the sky at a speed of 22 miles per second.",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere and heat up as they fall toward Earth, according to NASA. The streak of light is actually glowing, hot air.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 21:07:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Heat shield damage seen during the first Artemis test flight is now understood, NASA says, but more time is needed to implement fixes.",
    "story": [
      "Less than a year after announcing major delays for the next two Artemis moon missions, NASA managers said Thursday the projected flight dates are slipping once again, with the first piloted voyage around the moon now expected in the April 2026 timeframe, and the first lunar landing in mid 2027.",
      "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the delays are needed to revise the Orion crew capsule's re-entry trajectory to reduce stress and prevent the sort of unexpected heat shield damage seen after an unpiloted 2022 test flight \u2014 and to complete extensive testing of the capsule's environmental control and life support systems.",
      "\"Based on the data, we have decided, unanimously, to move forward with the current Artemis 2/Orion capsule and heat shield with a modified entry trajectory...to lessen the heat coming back into the Earth's atmosphere,\" Nelson said.",
      "\"Additionally, we need to complete our updates to the Orion environmental controls and the life support systems that were identified earlier this year.\"",
      "Future heat shields for the Artemis 3 moon landing mission and subsequent flights will use essentially the same materials but with modifications to improve their performance during re-entry.",
      "In the meantime, Nelson said, \"We are planning for Artemis 2 to launch in April of '26 and we're going to do all in our power, with our commercial partners, to launch earlier.\"",
      "The Artemis program aims to send astronauts to the moon's south polar region where ice deposits may allow crews to one day extract oxygen and hydrogen to produce air, water and rocket propellants that would not have to be carried up, at great expense, from Earth.",
      "Following the launch of Artemis 2, Nelson said NASA is going \"to make (any) adjustments that are necessary, and we plan to launch Artemis 3, the first landing on the moon in over a half century. Assuming the SpaceX lander is ready, we plan to launch Artemis 3 in mid-2027. That will be well ahead of the Chinese government's announced intention (of sending taikonauts to the moon in) 2030...We need to get this Artemis 2 test flight right to ensure the success of our return to the moon.\"",
      "NASA launched the Artemis program's first test flight, Artemis 1, in November 2022, using the agency's new Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket to send an unpiloted Lockheed Martin-built Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back.",
      "NASA had planned to launch the Artemis 2 mission at the end of this year to carry a three-man one-woman crew around the moon to thoroughly test the spacecraft's life support, propulsion and other systems.",
      "But after the Artemis 1 flight, engineers discovered the Orion capsule's 16-foot-wide heat shield suffered unexpected damage during it's high-speed return from the moon using a technique called a \"skip entry.\"",
      "In a skip entry, the capsule dips into the atmosphere, slows and rises back up before dropping back into the atmosphere for the final descent. The idea is similar to how a flat rock can skip across a still pond. Skip entries provide a number of benefits, including a wider range of splashdown targets.",
      "The Orion heat shield is designed to ablate, or char, during re-entry when the spacecraft enters Earth's atmosphere at more than 25,000 mph. But the charred material is intended to stay in place, providing a layer of insulation. During the Artemis 1 re-entry, more charred material separated from the heat shield than computer models predicted.",
      "While the unexpected \"liberation\" had no impact on the spacecraft \u2014 NASA said astronauts would not have even noticed had any been on board \u2014 engineers wanted to make sure they understood the underlying cause so they could update computer models to accurately predict re-entry effects across multiple trajectories.",
      "After hundreds of tests and an exhaustive engineering analysis, NASA has \"since determined that while the capsule was dipping in and out of the atmosphere as part of that planned skip entry, heat accumulated inside the heat shield's outer layer,\" said Pam Melroy, a former shuttle commander and now deputy administrator of NASA.",
      "That heat build up led to \"gases forming and becoming trapped inside the heat shield,\" she said. \"This caused internal pressure to build up and led to cracking and uneven shedding of that outer layer.\"",
      "While the same type of heat shield will be used for the Artemis 2 mission in April 2026, the crew will use a modified re-entry trajectory to reduce the sort of heating that damaged the Artemis 1 heat shield.",
      "As for the Artemis 3 lunar landing flight, the new mid-2027 target launch date assumes SpaceX's lunar lander, a variant of the upper stage used by the company's new Super Heavy-Starship rocket, completes multiple test flights in Earth orbit, along with at least one unpiloted lunar landing.",
      "On Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he was selecting billionaire Jared Isaacman, a space veteran with strong ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, to serve as NASA's next administrator.",
      "During the news conference Thursday, Nelson was asked whether he was concerned that the next administration might make major changes to the Artemis program given SpaceX's development of the new Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "\"First of all, there is one human-rated spacecraft that is flying and that has already flown beyond the moon, and that's the SLS (Space Launch System) combined with Orion,\" Nelson said. \"Secondly, this is a partnership. It's a commercial partnership. It's an international partnership.",
      "\"I think what is going to happen over time is you're going to have a number of years that we're going to have the partners flying with NASA, and then whatever the technologies that are developed later on will dictate what is going to be the system that's flying.\"",
      "He concluded by saying, \"I don't see the concern that your question raises, although it's a legitimate question, that you're suddenly going to have Starship take over everything.\"",

    "story": [
      "General Motors says it will move away from the robotaxi business and cease funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle division.",
      "According to a press release issued Tuesday and subsequent conference call that included GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra, the Detroit automaker will instead focus on development of partially automated driver-assist systems like its Super Cruise, which allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel.",
      "GM said it would get out of robotaxis \"given the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.\"",
      "The company said it will combine Cruise's technical team with its own to work on advanced systems to assist drivers.",
      "\"The Cruise Board of Directors and the Cruise leadership team are collaborating closely with GM on next steps,\" Cruise CEO  Marc Whitten told CBS News.",
      "GM bought then San Francisco-based start-up Cruise Automation in 2016 for at least $1 billion with high hopes of developing a profitable fleet of robotaxis. At the time, Cruise Automation, along with Google, was among the few companies with permits from the state of California to test the cars.",
      "Over the years GM invested billions in the subsidiary and eventually bought 90% of the company from investors.",
      "GM even announced plans for Cruise to generate $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, but it scaled back spending on the company after one of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts\u00a0dragged a pedestrian on a San Francisco street who was hit by another vehicle in 2023.",
      "The California Public Utilities Commission alleged the company covered up details of the crash and suspended Cruise's driverless testing permit. Soon afterwards, Cruise\u00a0pulled all its driverless cars off the road nationwide.",
      "The incident\u00a0sparked widespread criticism of the company\u00a0and its autonomous vehicles. Cruise had already been under fire for a number of collisions that led the company to\u00a0cut its operating robotaxi fleet in during the summer of 2023.",
      "The problems triggered a purge of its leadership \u2014 in addition to layoffs that jettisoned about a quarter of its workforce.",
      "In January of this year, the company offered to pay $75,000 to settle the investigation by California state regulators into Cruise's\u00a0failure to disclose details regarding the collision.",
      "Despite its troubles, Cruise was still attempting to return to viability. In June, General Motors named Marc Whitten -- one of the key engineers behind the Xbox video game console --\u00a0as the division's new chief executive. In August, Cruise announced its robotaxis\u00a0would join Uber's ride-hailing service in 2025 as part of a multiyear partnership\u00a0bringing together two companies that once appeared poised to compete for passengers.",
      "However, more recent Cruise developments have been costly for GM. In September, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials announced the division would pay a $1.5 million penalty as part of a consent order. Last month, Cruise agreed to an additional $500,000 fine after admitting to filing a false report following the San Francisco pedestrian crash.",
      "According to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's office of the Northern District of California, the San Francisco-based company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement in which Cruise admits and accepts responsibility.",
      "\"Companies with self-driving cars that seek to share our roads and crosswalks must be fully truthful in their reports to their regulators,\" said Martha Boersch, Chief of the Office of the U.S. Attorney's Criminal Division, said in a statement.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 16:58:47 -0500",
    "summary": "The game's design nudged people into racking up unauthorized charges, the FTC said. Here's how customers will be refunded.",
    "story": [
      "Fortnite players and other Epic Games customers tricked by the game maker into making unwanted purchases are set to receive refund payments from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).",
      "As part of a settlement first\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2022, the video game maker has been ordered by the FTC to pay $245 million to resolve allegations that it used unlawful billing practices involving design tricks\u00a0known as dark patterns to get players to unintentionally rack up charges. It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date. About half of the first tranche of payments will be made through PayPal, and the other half will be checks. Collectively, customers will receive $72 million in refunds, according to the agency.",
      "How much money will each customer get?",
      "The average payment is around $114, the FTC said. Epic Games customers who are entitled to refunds selected their payment method when they submitted a claim form. Customers who chose to receive PayPal payments have 30 days to redeem the funds, while check recipients have 90 days to cash them.",
      "What did Epic Games do?",
      "The FTC alleges the Fortnite-maker used dark patterns along with a variety of other tactics to trick customers into making unwanted purchases.",
      "For example, a \"counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration\" led Fortnite players to easily incur unwanted charges with the press of a single button, according to the FTC. Additionally, trying to transition the game from sleep to wake mode often triggered unwanted purchases. Other times, pressing an \"adjacent button\" while trying to preview an item led to a charge.",
      "\"As our complaints note, Epic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children,\" FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in December 2022, when the settlement was first announced. \"Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission, and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices.\"",

    "summary": "Abutting homes, schools an parks, the sprawling warehouses are a huge drain on local resources and major pollutant.",
    "story": [
      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and urban and rural governments alike are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",
      "But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties and butt up against wooded bike trails winding through the suburbs. But one of the latest proposals in the area, Plaza 500, would see a 466,000-square-foot facility and adjacent electrical substation built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised jobs and a significant property tax boost. But data center critics say the incentives aren't enough to counteract the consequences of building the facilities so close to homes.",
      "Tyler Ray, a leader in the fight against the Virginia project, worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "Ray and his neighbors tried to stop the development, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project was exempt.",
      "\"I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue, has any chance to go up against the data center industry,\" Ray said the night the supervisors voted.",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia's current data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2013 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its investment in nearby Loudoun County, which included two data centers, created around 150 direct jobs, a figure that data center opponents say isn't worth the hassle. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\"I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\" Smith said. \"Data centers are not going away.\"",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. Those payments, in addition to $1.7 in charitable donations from the company in 2023, have been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services. These funds have gone toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer and $5,000 grants for homebuyers so far totaling at least $2.8 million.",
      "\"This road right here? Wouldn't happen if it wasn't for AWS,\" said Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Police Chief Rick Stokoe's cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.",
      "AWS has cultivated relationships with local officials including Keefer and Stokoe, who have both been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks with the company. Some former county commissioners and residents worry that those relationships are too cozy.",
      "Kevin Miller, AWS's vice president of global data centers, said in an interview with the Associated Press that \"our interest is in being a model corporate citizen, to really be partners with those communities.\"",
      "Skepticism of the deals started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while also owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But the latest data center deal struck between Morrow County officials and AWS, which gives the company an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers, again raised eyebrows.",
      "Two former Morrow County Commissioners, Jim Doherty and Melissa Lindsay, pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations.",
      "\"We didn't want to blow it up. We didn't want to run them off,\" said Lindsay. \"But there were better deals to be made.\"",

      "The preliminary injunctions issued by an Oregon court found in favor of the Federal Trade Commission, which had argued the deal would violate antitrust law.",
      "The judge's ruling \"effectively ends the likelihood of a deal taking place,\" according to Neil Saunders, managing director, GlobalData. \"Of all the cases the FTC has litigated over the past few years, this one was the most sensitive as it involved two huge firms supplying essential goods,\" the retail analyst added.",

      "\"This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries\u2014from milk, to bread, to eggs \u2014 ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets,\" Henry Liu, Director of the agency's Bureau of Competition, said in a statement. \"This victory has a direct, tangible impact on the lives of millions of Americans who shop at Kroger or Albertsons-owned grocery stores for their everyday needs, whether that's a Fry's in Arizona, a Von's in Southern California or a Jewel-Osco in Illinois.\"",

      "Kroger, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, operates 2,750 stores in 35 states and the District of Columbia, including brands like Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons, based in Boise, Idaho, operates roughly 2,300 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's. Together the companies employ around 700,000 people.",
      "The retailers agreed to join forces in October 2022, arguing the union would help them compete with Amazon, Costco, Walmart and other larger rivals.",
      "Albertsons expressed disappointment with the judge's ruling on Tuesday pausing the deal and said the company is exploring its legal and strategic options.",
      "\"We believe we clearly outlined during the proceedings how the proposed merger would expand competition, lower prices, increase associate wages, protect union jobs and enhance customers' shopping experience,\" the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Kroger also said the merger would boost grocery industry competition as well as benefit consumers and employees. Said the company in a statement:",
      "\"Kroger is disappointed in the opinions issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon and the Washington State Court, which overlook the substantial evidence presented at trial showing that a merger between Kroger and Albertsons would advance the company's decades-long commitment to lowering prices, respecting collective bargaining agreements, and is in the best interests of customers, associates and the broader competitive environment in a rapidly evolving grocery landscape.\"",
      "Kroger has promised to invest $500 million to lower prices as soon as the deal closes. It said it also invested in price reductions when it merged with Harris Teeter in 2014 and Roundy's in 2016. Kroger also pledged to invest $1.3 billion in store improvements at Albertsons as part of the deal.",
      "The FTC, which said the proposed deal would be the largest grocery merger in U.S. history, said it would also erase competition for workers, threatening their ability to win higher wages, better benefits and improved working conditions.",
      "The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), which represents grocery and other food industry workers, applauded the court's decision.",
      "\"We are pleased that the court heard the concerns voiced by our hard-working members and rejected the proposed megamerger between Kroger and Albertsons,\" UFCW International President Marc Perrone said in a statement. \"The issues we raised were echoed throughout this process by lawmakers, economists, attorneys general, consumers and the FTC.\"",

      "Mangione was denied bail but contested extradition to New York. Pennsylvania now has 30 days to get a warrant from Gov. Kathy Hochul for extradition. Mangione was remanded to State Correctional Institution Huntingdon in Huntingdon County.",
      "\"We're in the process now of securing a governor's warrant from the state of New York and, you know, we'll be prepared when the judge schedules the hearing to do what's necessary to get him back to New York,\" Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks said.",
      "Authorities say the extradition process to New York could now take as many as 30 days.",
      "Mangione's newly retained defense attorney, Thomas Dickie, spoke to reporters outside the courthouse.",

      "Mangione did not seem to be nervous in the courtroom. As he waited for the judge, he looked around at the rows of reporters, seeming to count the number of people in the room. At times he smiled and at one point even interrupted his own defense attorney, who quickly hushed him.",
      "Right before entering the courthouse, however, Mangione was seen on video pulling away from members of the Blair County Sheriff's Department and screaming, \"\"This is completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people and their lived experience!\" before he was pinned against a wall and forced inside. It's unclear what he was responding to.",
      "\"He had a mask and hood and a backpack\"",
      "Investigators are pouring through what they call a mountain of evidence, trying to fill in the gaps of his journey and determine if he acted alone.",
      "The 26-year-old was caught five days after the shooting after a\u00a0customer spotted him at a McDonald's in Altoona, which is about 300 miles away from the shooting scene in Midtown Manhattan.",
      "A witness named Larry said he and friends saw Mangione sitting alone.",
      "\"He had a mask and hood and a backpack,\" said Larry, a regular at the fast-food restaurant. \"The one guy said, 'It looks like the shooter from New York.' Well, then we laughed and I guess he placed his order and we went on about our business, but we were kidding, like, wouldn't that be something?\"",
      "Another customer recognized Mangione from the wanted photos and told an employee, who called police. Officers responded and began asking Mangione if he had recently   been in New York City.",
      "\"He became visibly nervous, kind of shaking at that question, and he didn't really answer it directly,\" Altoona Police Deputy Chief Derick Swope told reporters Monday.",
      "When prompted for his ID, police said he gave a fake New Jersey drivers license, which investigators believe was the same one used to check into a Manhattan hostel 10 days before the shooting.",
      "According to court documents, officers asked why he would lie to them about the ID.",
      "\"I clearly shouldn't have,\" Mangione said.",
      "\"We didn't think twice about it, we knew it was our guy,\" Altoona Police Officer Tyler Frye said.",
      "Police arrested Mangione on a forgery charge, and, once in custody, they searched his backpack, where they found a U.S. passport, clothes that matched the gunman's description, a\u00a03D-printed pistol with a suppressor\u00a0that was consistent with the murder weapon, and a three-page handwritten note.",
      "Police sources say investigators are referring to the note as a claim of responsibility. Intelligence officers with the NYPD believe that the suspect's grievances about UnitedHealthcare and other health insurance companies are what motivated the murder.",
      "\"We don't think there's any specific threats to others mentioned in that document, but it does seem he has some ill will toward corporate America,\" NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said.",
      "The McDonald's has since hired private security because employees told police they're worried for their safety, and the Altoona Police Department, itself, has been receiving multiple emails and calls, including death threats since Monday's arrest.",
      "Piecing together Mangione's time on the run",
      "Police also said Mangione was carrying various electronic devices, which they believe he was using to evade detection.",
      "\"He was very careful with trying to stay low profile, avoid cameras,\" said Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens.",
      "Investigators said the most crucial clue in the investigation was a photo from the hostel where the suspect pulled down his mask.",
      "The NYPD has been working around the clock to track his movements -- from his arrival by bus to New York City, to his escape from the crime scene by bicycle to Central Park, and his taxi ride to an uptown bus terminal, where they believe he fled.",
      "Police believe he left New York City and had been traveling around Pennsylvania in the days after. They believe he took a Greyhound bus to Philadelphia and spent some time there before going to Pittsburgh and eventually Altoona.",
      "\"If you have any information regarding this suspect or his travels throughout Pennsylvania, please share those tips with us immediately,\" Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said.",
      "Who is Luigi Mangione?",
      "CBS News has learned Mangione is from a prominent Maryland family that owns country clubs, health care facilities and real estate companies. He graduated valedictorian from the private, all boys Gilman School, got his Masters in Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania, and also has ties to Stanford.",

      "\"I can tell you that this is one of the last people you think would do something like this. You know, he was one of the nicest kids, most friendly kids, that I had known at Gilman,\" Leatherbury said.",
      "\"There was nothing [that] came off weird about him. He had great friends,\" Leatherbury added. \"He was down to earth, he was smart, well-adjusted socially. He was at least a two-sport athlete, from what I can remember, and he really had everything going for him.\"",
      "Leatherbury said he hasn't been in contact with Mangione in years.",
      "\"Hope that they can heal as a family, and certainly the family, of course, of Brian Thompson, of course, is in everybody's forefront, thoughts and prayers as well. That's just terrible for them, too,\" Leatherbury said.",
      "The Mangione family released a statement overnight saying they are devastated and shocked by the news.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we cannot comment on news reports regarding Luigi Mangione. We only know what we have read in the media. Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi's arrest,\" the statement read. \"We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved. We are devastated by this news.\"",
      "According to his LinkedIn account, Mangione last worked as a data engineer at a vehicle-buying website called True Car in 2023. In recent months, posts tagging him on social media imply he lost touch with friends, with some asking where he was and what he was doing, and wishing him the best and hoping that he was OK.",
      "CBS News has also learned Mangione had been living at a co-working, co-living space called Surfbreak in Honolulu up until 2022, when a spokesperson for that community says he left due to a lifelong back injury that was exacerbated by surfing and hiking.",
      "Sources tell CBS News\u00a0back pain was a major factor in his life\u00a0and appeared to be a source of pain and frustration for him.",
      "\"I was roommates with him, friends. Hiked, went to yoga. He did his best to be athletic,\" said R.J. Martin, a former acquaintance from Surfbreak. \"Unfathomable knowing the kind of person that I saw and knew. Personally, I can make zero sense of it. There is never a justification for violence.\"",
      "The spokesperson said they believe Mangione returned to Hawaii in 2023 and started a book club, which they said several members left due to \"discomfort in book choices.\"",

      "General Motors says it will move away from the robotaxi business and cease funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle division.",
      "According to a press release issued Tuesday and subsequent conference call that included GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra, the Detroit automaker will instead focus on development of partially automated driver-assist systems like its Super Cruise, which allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel.",
      "GM said it would get out of robotaxis \"given the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.\"",
      "The company said it will combine Cruise's technical team with its own to work on advanced systems to assist drivers.",
      "\"The Cruise Board of Directors and the Cruise leadership team are collaborating closely with GM on next steps,\" Cruise CEO  Marc Whitten told CBS News.",
      "GM bought then San Francisco-based start-up Cruise Automation in 2016 for at least $1 billion with high hopes of developing a profitable fleet of robotaxis. At the time, Cruise Automation, along with Google, was among the few companies with permits from the state of California to test the cars.",
      "Over the years GM invested billions in the subsidiary and eventually bought 90% of the company from investors.",
      "GM even announced plans for Cruise to generate $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, but it scaled back spending on the company after one of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts\u00a0dragged a pedestrian on a San Francisco street who was hit by another vehicle in 2023.",
      "The California Public Utilities Commission alleged the company covered up details of the crash and suspended Cruise's driverless testing permit. Soon afterwards, Cruise\u00a0pulled all its driverless cars off the road nationwide.",
      "The incident\u00a0sparked widespread criticism of the company\u00a0and its autonomous vehicles. Cruise had already been under fire for a number of collisions that led the company to\u00a0cut its operating robotaxi fleet in during the summer of 2023.",
      "The problems triggered a purge of its leadership \u2014 in addition to layoffs that jettisoned about a quarter of its workforce.",
      "In January of this year, the company offered to pay $75,000 to settle the investigation by California state regulators into Cruise's\u00a0failure to disclose details regarding the collision.",
      "Despite its troubles, Cruise was still attempting to return to viability. In June, General Motors named Marc Whitten -- one of the key engineers behind the Xbox video game console --\u00a0as the division's new chief executive. In August, Cruise announced its robotaxis\u00a0would join Uber's ride-hailing service in 2025 as part of a multiyear partnership\u00a0bringing together two companies that once appeared poised to compete for passengers.",
      "However, more recent Cruise developments have been costly for GM. In September, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials announced the division would pay a $1.5 million penalty as part of a consent order.

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 15:58:42 -0500",
    "summary": "\"The Task Force found that the tragic and shocking events in Butler, Pennsylvania were preventable and should not have happened,\" a House task force found.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House task force investigating the assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump released a final report on its probe on Tuesday, presenting a series of recommendations to combat future security failures, including reducing the number of officials it protects during campaign season.",
      "\"The Task Force found that the tragic and shocking events in Butler, Pennsylvania were preventable and should not have happened. There was not, however, a singular moment or decision that allowed Thomas Matthew Crooks to nearly assassinate the former President,\" the 180-page report said, noting that \"various failures \u2026 coalesced to create an environment in which the former President \u2014 and everyone at the campaign event \u2014 were exposed to grave danger.\"",
      "The House voted to establish the panel following the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, where a gunman opened fire during a rally and a bullet grazed the former president's ear. Secret Service snipers shot and killed the gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. The Secret Service came under intense scrutiny following the incident, and its director soon resigned.",
      "The task force, made up of seven Republicans and six Democrats, also looked into a second assassination attempt on Sept. 15 in West Palm Beach, Florida, which was foiled. Trump was golfing when a Secret Service agent discovered a man with a rifle who was waiting along the tree line of the course.",
      "What the report says",
      "Over the course of the investigation, the task force said it conducted 46 interviews, reviewed 18,000 pages of documents and visited the incident sites in Butler and West Palm Beach.",
      "The panel found that the \"failures\" that led to the July 13 incident were \"not isolated to the campaign event itself.\" The lawmakers noted that \"preexisting issues in leadership and training created an environment\" in which the failures could occur, like giving significant responsibilities to Secret Service personnel with little to no experience in advanced planning roles.",
      "\"The events of July 13, 2024, were tragic and preventable, and the litany of related security failures are unacceptable,\" the report says, acknowledging that the Secret Service's mission \"allows no margin for error.\"",
      "The task force made three dozen recommendations, including reducing the number of individuals it protects. The lawmakers also said Congress should examine whether the Secret Service should still be involved in investigating fraud and financial crimes.",
      "\"Congress must consider whether the Secret Service's investigative obligations can effectively coexist with its primary protective mission, and whether the agency's investigative functions should remain within the Department of Homeland Security,\" the report said.",
      "\"The number of individuals being protected has greatly expanded, a resource demand which becomes further taxed during the longer and more intensive modern presidential campaign seasons,\" it said, noting that the Secret Service also protects foreign dignitaries during the U.N. General Assembly in New York City in September, which comes at the height of the campaign season. \"As a result, Congress, DHS, and the USSS should jointly consider the protective role the USSS plays for foreign leaders and consider whether such duties can be transferred or abrogated in order to focus on the USSS's primary duty: to protect the President and other critical U.S. leaders.\"",
      "It also recommended that Secret Service consolidate the plans of all law enforcement entities working an event; fill gaps with its own personnel when local counterparts are unable to provide adequate security; identify all potential lines of sight vulnerabilities; require counter-surveillance assets for all large outdoor events; and address inadequate training. Other recommendations included reviewing protocols for identifying security breaches during golf outings and using a specific type of vehicle, which was redacted in the report, on the golf course.",
      "The panel also called on Congress to review the agency's financial and personnel resources, recommending that it take a look at \"reducing the pace of travel, ensuring overtime is properly compensated, and giving incentives for veteran agents to stay with the USSS beyond minimum retirement ages.\"",
      "While the panel's investigation has wrapped, the task force encouraged relevant committees in Congress to work to address \"important questions\" that it was unable to examine fully. On the top of that list, the panel said, are the motivations of the shooter and would-be shooter, which the panel said \"remain largely unknown.\"",
      "Before wrapping its investigation, the task force held its final hearing last week with testimony from Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe, who acknowledged the agency's \"abject failure\" in the July shooting. Rowe outlined a series of changes he had implemented at the agency since the assassination attempt.",

    "summary": "Manhattan prosecutors say Donald Trump's election in November shouldn't mean his conviction in May needs to be vacated.",
    "story": [
      "New York prosecutors say President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House should not undermine the decision of 12 jurors who found him guilty of dozens of felonies in May, telling the judge overseeing the case that the conviction should stand.",
      "\"This Court should reject [Trump's] motion to 'immediately' dismiss the indictment and vacate the jury's guilty verdict based on the outcome of the recent presidential election,\" prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg wrote in their filing, which was made public Tuesday. \"There are no grounds for such relief now, prior to defendant's inauguration, because President-elect immunity does not exist.\"",
      "Soon after Trump's election in November, his defense lawyers promised to urge Justice Juan Merchan to toss his indictment in the \"hush money\" case and set aside the verdict. They made their motion on Dec. 2, hinging their push to discard the will of 12 jurors who sat for the seven-week trial on an unlikely subject: President Biden's son, Hunter. Trump's attorneys said the announcement of Hunter Biden's controversial pardon echoed Trump's complaints about his prosecution, claiming it was politically driven.",
      "Prosecutors did not mention either Biden or the pardon in their response filing.",
      "They hit back against the core of Trump's effort to set aside his conviction. Trump's lawyers \u2014 two of whom are slated to take on senior roles in the Justice Department after Trump's inauguration \u2014 have argued that it would be unconstitutional for an incoming president to carry the burden of a guilty verdict reached before his election.",
      "\"[Trump's] suggestion that his subsequent election 'superseded' the jury's verdict is deeply misguided,\" prosecutors wrote. \"As this Court carefully and correctly instructed the jury, it was the empaneled jurors who were 'deciding whether the Defendant is guilty or not guilty' because only these jurors \u2014 not the general electorate \u2014 heard all the evidence in this trial.\"",
      "Prosecutors argued Trump's lawyers are trying to \"effectively extend the period of [Trump's] immunity to a time before his presidency, by wiping out the effects of an indictment and jury verdict that took place before he was even reelected President.\"",
      "Trump's sentencing has been postponed three times since his conviction in May. It was initially scheduled for July 11, but Merchan pushed that date back so Trump's attorneys could file a separate motion to dismiss following a landmark Supreme Court ruling. The nation's highest court concluded in early July that former presidents could not be charged for official acts, and evidence related to their official work as president could not be used as evidence against them.",
      "Merchan has not ruled on that motion. He postponed the second sentencing date, Sept. 18, after Trump's lawyers argued it was too close to the election. After Trump's election victory on Nov. 5, they demanded a Nov. 26 sentencing date be postponed so they could file the new motion to dismiss the case, revolving around his return to the White House.",
      "Bragg's office said in its filing it would be open to postponing sentencing and other proceedings until after Trump's term in office, which ends in 2029.",
      "\"If [Trump] is not sentenced before his inauguration, there is also no legal barrier to deferring that sentencing until after the end of his presidency,\" they wrote.",
      "Prosecutors also floated terminating the case \"with a notation that the jury verdict has not been vacated and the indictment has not been dismissed,\" an option they acknowledged is typically used when defendants die before case proceedings conclude.",
      "\"Especially given the novelty of defendant's own immunity claims, it would hardly be improper for this Court to exercise its inherent authority to consider novel remedies such as adopting a version of the Alabama rule in the context of this unique case,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "The judge's decision will be the latest moment in the case to set a historical precedent. Trump was the first person to be elected president after being convicted of crimes. When the unanimous jury concluded in May he was guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, he became the first former president ever convicted of crimes. In March 2023, Trump became the first former president ever indicted when a grand jury concluded he should be charged.",
      "The case focused on a coverup of a \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star. Trump authorized a scheme to conceal reimbursements to a lawyer who made the payment days before Trump's first election.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty in the case and has promised to appeal his conviction.",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department failed to follow department policy and ignored some established protections when seeking records from members of Congress, dozens of congressional staffers and members of the media during the first Trump administration, an internal watchdog found.",
      "A report by the department's Office of Inspector General released on Tuesday focused on numerous leak investigations launched by the Justice Department and the FBI between 2017 and 2020 to determine how eight journalists from the Washington Post, the New York Times and CNN obtained classified information that appeared in reports. The data mostly included metadata about emails and phone calls, and did not contain the content of the communications.",
      "In 2017, FBI investigators honed in on members of Congress and their staff as possible sources of various news reports, eventually obtaining data from two Democratic lawmakers and 43 congressional staffers from both parties. Inspector General Michael Horowitz criticized the large number of congressional employees whose information was obtained, and urged the department to implement stronger policies to protect the data of members of Congress and their staff.",
      "\"[D]ozens of congressional staffers became part of the subject pool in a federal criminal investigation for doing nothing more than performing constitutionally authorized oversight of the executive branch,\" the report said. In a 2023 lawsuit against the Justice Department, Kash Patel, Trump's pick to serve as FBI director in the upcoming administration, said he was one of those staffers while working for the House Intelligence Committee. Patel alleged the collection was \"in complete contravention of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\"",
      "The inspector general also revealed the two lawmakers were targeted because a Democratic staffer \"identified them to investigators as potential leakers but without providing any evidentiary support for the claim.\"",
      "CBS News reported in 2021 that Justice Department prosecutors had subpoenaed Apple for data from the accounts of Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell of California while investigating leaks of classified information related to contacts between aides to President-Elect Donald Trump and Russia in the early days of the Trump administration. Both men criticized the investigative steps at the time. Schiff was sworn in this week as the next senator from California, and Swalwell remains in the House.",
      "There were four secret investigations in total, all of which were closed without criminal charges. The probes emerged into public view in 2021, when the Biden administration informed the three news organizations that their records had been swept up in the Trump-era probes. The Post, the Times and CNN each announced and condemned the revelations at the time.",
      "Notably, the inspector general's review said there was no evidence that the investigations were influenced by politics or other improper considerations. The report also said that certain processes and approvals that are now required were not in place at the time.",
      "However, the report said the decision to go after the communications of congressional staffers and members \"implicated the constitutional rights and authorities or a co-equal branch of government.\"",
      "Such conduct, the report argued, \"risks chilling Congress' ability to conduct oversight of the executive branch.\" The inspector general said there was no definitive department policy on the matter and much of the decision-making was left up to line prosecutors on the cases. As a result, the report called for further safeguards and policy changes, some of which have been implemented.",
      "Unlike investigations into members of Congress, Justice Department policy stipulates that prosecutors must first prove to have \"exhausted\" other avenues before seeking to secretly obtain records from members of the media. But Horowitz found investigators in 2020 \"did not fully adhere\" to other policies when they turned their attention to the news media organizations that published the classified information.",
      "According to the report, then-Attorney General William Barr authorized the collection of the journalists' communication data because policy required senior approval for investigations into journalists, but prosecutors working on the cases did not follow other procedures. Horowitz found that in all of the investigations, the Justice Department's New Media Review Committee \u2014 a group of officials within the department tasked with reviewing such investigative steps \u2014 was not established. The report also said prosecutors failed to obtain necessary sign-off from the intelligence community before collecting communications data in at least one instance.",
      "Unsealed court records showed the requests were made in the final weeks of Trump's first term. Barr did not agree to be interviewed for the inspector general's report. The former head of the Justice Department's national security division told the inspector general Barr and his predecessor had \"made it very clear leak investigations were a priority of the Department.\"",
      "\"In our judgment, the Department's deviation from its own requirements indicates a troubling disparity between, on the one hand, the regard expressed in Department policy for the roles of the news media in American democracy and, on the other hand, the Department's commitment to complying with the limits and requirements that it intended to safeguard that very role,\" Horowitz wrote.",
      "Following the revelations that the reporters were subjects of the Trump-era Justice Department investigations, the Garland Justice Department changed department policies governing news media organizations.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A group of Senate Democrats is pressing President Biden to work to \"protect immigrant families\" in the final weeks of his presidency, with President-elect Donald Trump set to take office next month.",
      "\"As Senators who represent diverse states across our nation and who collectively represent millions of immigrant families, we write to express our deep concern about the threat the incoming administration poses to immigrants in our communities,\" the group of senators, led by Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, wrote in a letter to the president Monday.",
      "The senators cited Trump's threat of mass deportations that they say will \"jeopardize the safety and security\" of millions of families, \"sow deep distrust and fear\" in the communities and \"destabilize the U.S. economy.\" And they urged Mr. Biden to take a number of actions in advance of Trump's inauguration, stressing that the \"window to secure and finalize your administration's policies is closing rapidly.\"",
      "\"We urge you to act decisively between now and the inauguration of the President-elect to complete the important work of the past four years and protect immigrant families,\" Durbin said in the letter, which was also signed by Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico and Alex Padilla of California.",
      "Among the requests, the group asked the president to prioritize redesignating and extending Temporary Protected Status for all eligible countries, which allows migrants from countries experiencing unsafe conditions to legally reside in the U.S. The group also asked the president to expedite the processing of benefit requests for recipients of DACA, the program for hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children and have been granted protection from deportation.",
      "The push comes as Trump has made clear his intention to pursue a radical shift on immigration policy, which became a key part of his campaign as he promised to target both unauthorized and legal immigrants with unprecedented measures.",
      "In an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that aired Sunday, reiterated a number of the pledges, including that he's \"absolutely\" still planning to end birthright citizenship on Day One of his presidency. He also made clear that he plans to carry out his mass deportations pledge, beginning with criminals.",
      "When asked by host Kristen Welker whether it's possible to deport everyone who's in the U.S. illegally, Trump responded that \"you have no choice.\" He said his administration would be \"starting with the criminals\" before others, noting that \"we're going to see how it goes.\"",
      "On DACA recipients, known as Dreamers, Trump said he would work with Democrats on a plan, claiming that \"Republicans are very open to the Dreamers.\"",
      "\"I want to be able to work something out,\" Trump said, while indicating that he wants the DACA recipients to be able to stay. Legislative efforts to codify the DACA program have failed for more than a decade, and Republican-led states have filed numerous lawsuits over the years arguing the program is unconstitutional. The president-elect tried to end the program during his first administration.",
      "On immigrant families more broadly, Trump emphasized that he doesn't \"want to be breaking up families,\" saying that \"the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.\"",
      "In their letter, the senators noted that while they support \"commonsense\" border security measures, they \"will continue to oppose any policies that contradict our nation's core values.\"",

    "story": [
      "A probate commissioner has ruled against Rupert Murdoch's effort to change his family's trust to give one of his sons control of his media empire and ensure Fox News maintains its conservative editorial slant, according to a sealed document obtained by The New York Times.",
      "In a decision filed on Saturday, a probate commissioner in Nevada concluded that Murdoch, 93, and his son, Lachlan Murdoch, had acted in \"bad faith\" in their endeavor to amend the irrevocable trust, The New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0on Monday.",
      "The trust divides control of the company equally among four of Rupert Murdoch's children \u2014 Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James \u2014 after he dies. Lachlan Murdoch has been the head of Fox News and News Corp since late last year, when his father stepped down.",
      "The elder Murdoch has argued that to preserve his businesses' commercial value for all his heirs, the trust must be changed to allow Lachlan Murdoch to maintain Fox News' conservative bent. James and Elisabeth Murdoch are both known to have less-conservative political views than their father or brother, potentially complicating efforts to ensure that Fox News remains conservative.",
      "In his 96-page opinion, Nevada Probate Commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr. of the Second Judicial District Court characterized the plan to change the trust as a \"carefully crafted charade\" to \"permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch's executive roles\" inside the empire \"regardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries\" of the family trust.",

The play might have worked; but an evidentiary hearing, like a showdown in a game of poker, is where gamesmanship collides with the facts and at its conclusion, all the bluffs are called and the cards lie face up.\"",

      "The author of more than 25 books, Giovanni was a born confessor and performer whom fans came to know well from her work, readings and other live appearances and her years on the faculty of Virginia Tech, among other schools. Poetry collections such as \"Black Judgement\" and \"Black Feeling Black Talk\" sold thousands of copies, led to invitations from \"The Tonight Show\" and other television programs and made her popular enough to fill a 3,000-seat concert hall at Lincoln Center for a celebration of her 30th birthday.",
      "In poetry, prose and the spoken word, she told her story. She looked back on her childhood in Tennessee and Ohio, championed the Black Power movement, addressed her battles with lung cancer, paid tribute to heroes from Nina Simone to Angela Davis and reflected on such personal passions as food, romance, family and rocketing into space \u2014 a journey she believed Black women uniquely qualified for, if only because of how much they had already survived. She also edited a groundbreaking anthology of Black women poets, \"Night Comes Softly,\" and helped found a publishing cooperative that promoted works by Gwendolyn Brooks and Margaret Walker among others.",
      "For a time, she was called \"The Princess of Black Poetry.\"",
      "\"All I know is the she is the most cowardly, bravest, least understanding, most sensitive, slowest to anger, most quixotic, lyingest, most honest woman I know,\" her friend Barbara Crosby wrote in the introduction to \"The Prosaic Soul of Nikki Giovanni,\" an anthology of nonfiction prose published in 2003. \"To love her is to love contradiction and conflict. To know her is to never understand but to be sure that all is life.\"",
      "Giovanni's admirers ranged from James Baldwin to Teena Marie, who name-checked her on the dance hit \"Square Biz,\" to Oprah Winfrey, who invited the poet to her \"Living Legends\" summit in 2005, when other guests of honor included Rosa Parks and Toni Morrison. Giovanni was a National Book Award finalist in 1973 for a prose work about her life, \"Gemini.\" She also received a Grammy nomination for the spoken word album \"The Nikki Giovanni Poetry Collection.\"",

      "Giovanni had a son, Thomas Watson Giovanni, in 1969. She never married the father, because, she told Ebony magazine, \"I didn't want to get married, and I could afford not to get married.\" Over the latter part of her life she lived with her partner, Fowler, a fellow faculty member at Virginia Tech.",
      "She was born Yolande Cornelia Giovanni Jr. in Knoxville, Tennessee, and was soon called \"Nikki\" by her older sister. She was 4 when her family moved to Ohio and eventually settled in the Black community of Lincoln Heights, outside Cincinnati. She would travel often between Tennessee and Ohio, bound to her parents and to her maternal grandparents in her \"spiritual home\" in Knoxville.",
      "As a girl, she read everything from history books to Ayn Rand and was accepted to Fisk University, the historically Black school in Nashville, after her junior year of high school. College was a time for achievement, and for trouble. Her grades were strong, she edited the Fisk literary magazine and helped start the campus branch of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee. But she rebelled against school curfews and other rules and was kicked out for a time because her \"attitudes did not fit those of a Fisk woman,\" she later wrote. After the school changed the dean of women, Giovanni returned and graduated with honors in history in 1967.",
      "Giovanni relied on support from friends to publish her debut collection, \"Black Poetry Black Talk,\" which came out in 1968, and in the same year she self-published \"Black Judgement.\" The radical Black Arts Movement was at its height and early Giovanni poems such as \"A Short Essay of Affirmation Explaining Why,\" \"Of Liberation\" and \"A Litany for Peppe\" were militant calls to overthrow white power. (\"The worst junkie or black businessman is more humane/than the best honkie\").",
      "\"I have been considered a writer who writes from rage and it confuses me. What else do writers write from?\" she wrote in a biographical sketch for Contemporary Writers. \"A poem has to say something. It has to make some sort of sense; be lyrical; to the point; and still able to be read by whatever reader is kind enough to pick up the book.\"",
      "Her opposition to the political system moderated over time, although she never stopped advocating for change and self-empowerment, or remembering martyrs of the past. In 2020, she was featured in an ad for presidential candidate Joe Biden, in which she urged young people to \"vote because someone died for you to have the right to vote.\"",
      "Her best known work came early in her career; the 1968 poem \"Nikki-Rosa.\" It was a declaration of her right to define herself, a warning to others (including obituary writers) against telling her story and a brief meditation on her poverty as a girl and the blessings, from holiday gatherings to bathing in \"one of those big tubs that folk in chicago barbecue in,\" which transcended it.",

      "While it was already understood that more speed at the point of impact increases risks to pedestrians struck by vehicles, the IIHS said the new study was carried out to provide, \"an updated estimate of pedestrian injury risk at different severity levels\" based on the evolving design of vehicles on U.S. roads today.",
      "\"As expected, impact speed strongly predicted injury risk, and hood leading edge height significantly increased the risk of pedestrian injury overall as well as the potency of impact speed for serious injuries,\" the IIHS said.",
      "While the study found no significant change in risk to pedestrians based on the weight of the vehicles involved, the IIHS said that, \"in general, higher vehicle front ends increased the likelihood of both moderate and serious pedestrian injuries.\"",
      "For example, it said that when a median-height pickup, with a front end about 13 inches higher than most cars, hits a pedestrian at 27 mph, there's a 83% chance of moderate injury and a 62% chance of serious injury, compared to 60% and a 30% respectively if the vehicle involved in the crash is a median-height car.",
      "\"Although SUVs are a growing share of the market in Europe, the passenger vehicle fleet there has long been dominated by cars. In contrast, the majority of passenger vehicles on U.S. roads today are SUVs or pickups,\" IIHS senior statistician Sam Monfort, the lead author of the study, was quoted as saying by the institute. \"These choices have very real consequences for pedestrian safety.\"",
      "\"Speed increases have a more pronounced effect when taller vehicles are involved\" in a crash, the organization said. \"For example, as crash speed increases from 15 mph to 35 mph, the risk of a serious injury goes from 9% to 52% when a median-height car is involved. With a median [height] pickup, the risk shoots up from 11% to 91%.\"",
      "Previous research by the IIHS published in 2022 found that drivers of bigger vehicles were more likely to hit pedestrians while making turns than drivers of cars, and another IIHS study published last year that pickups, SUVs and vans with hoods higher than 40 inches at the front edge were about 45% more likely to cause pedestrian fatalities in crashes than cars and other vehicles with lower, sloping hoods.",
      "Despite the concern over the impact of larger vehicles in U.S. pedestrian crashes, however, data showed 2023 saw the first overall year-on-year decline in pedestrian deaths from vehicle accidents in about four years, since the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of pedestrians killed on U.S. roads in 2023 dropped 5.4% compared to the previous year \u2014 which saw a 40-year high \u2014 but it was still 14.1% higher than the number of deaths recorded in 2019, before the pandemic, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 17:36:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Arctic tundra has historically helped reduce global emissions. But rising temperatures and wildfires in the region are changing that, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Foreboding environmental milestones abounded again this year in the Arctic, where experts say dramatic climate shifts are fundamentally altering the ecosystem and how it operates. One recent turning point for the region involves its carbon footprint: Where conditions in the Arctic historically worked to reduce global emissions, they're now actively contributing to them.",
      "That's a major transition that could reap consequences on human, plant and animal life far beyond Earth's northernmost arena, warned a cohort of scientists whose research appears in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 2024 Arctic Report Card, published Tuesday. The report is an annual assessment of the polar environment, which in recent years has become a stark alert signal marked by unprecedented and ominous observations all linked to rising temperatures from human-caused climate change.",
      "A focus of the latest Arctic evaluation was the effects of warmer weather and wildfires on the tundra, a far-northern biome that's typically known for extreme cold, little precipitation and a layer of permanently frozen soil, called permafrost, covering the land. Those traits collectively made the Arctic an important carbon sink for millennia, meaning the region essentially helped reduce carbon dioxide emissions worldwide by absorbing more carbon than it emitted into the atmosphere.",
      "That has mainly been due to carbon uptake from plants, which regulate atmospheric levels of the molecule through photosynthesis, and a storage process in the permafrost, which traps carbon dioxide in the ground. But warming air temperatures in the Arctic are breaking down permafrost across the tundra, in some cases, severely. The Arctic report, for example, showed Alaskan permafrost temperatures in 2024 were the second-warmest ever recorded. That causes the soil to heat up and thaw, its carbon repositories decompose along with it.",
      "Research included in NOAA's Arctic report shows carbon once stored in the tundra's permafrost is actually being released into the atmosphere. In parts of the region, it's happening at a rate that outweighs the carbon sink and instead creates a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 something of particular concern to climate scientists at a time when pollution from fossil fuel production has already reached a record high.",
      "The same fossil fuels overwhelming the atmosphere and prompting ongoing admonition from top weather and climate officials\u00a0at the United Nations are fueling the emissions in the Arctic, said Rich Spinrad, the administrator of NOAA, in a statement on the new report's findings.",
      "\"Our observations now show that the Arctic tundra, which is experiencing warming and increased wildfire, is now emitting more carbon than it stores, which will worsen climate change impacts,\" Spinrad said. \"This is yet one more sign, predicted by scientists, of the consequences of inadequately reducing fossil fuel pollution.\"",
      "Wildfires in the Arctic have been raging at rates never seen before, and that alone drives up carbon emissions. Researchers suggest 2024 had the second-highest annual volume of wildfire emissions north of the Arctic Circle on record. Coupled with the release of carbon dioxide and methane gas from permafrost stores, they say net emissions could continue to increase in the place that climate change is heating up faster than anywhere else on the planet.",

      "Ahmed \u2013 like all of the other rebel fighters \u2013  is waiting for new orders. There remains a huge question mark over HTS's efforts to gain political legitimacy, tarnished by a questioned human rights records in the areas of Syria in which it has governed, and lingering doubts about the faction's ability to heal the country's religious divides.",
      "Parts of the country also remains ravaged by war as Turkey-backed opposition fighters battle U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in the north, and the Islamic State group and its extremist ideology remains active in pockets of the country.",

Duda had fled Ukraine to avoid being drafted into his country's armed forces fighting Russia.",
      "\"The cat was warm and was warming him \u2026 so he saved his life,\" Dan Benga, the director of the Maramures mountain rescue service, told The Associated Press. \"The only thing we saw he is caring about is the cat. He doesn't care about himself.\"",
      "When the rescue team located and found the Ukrainian, they unzipped his jacket and discovered Peach snuggled up inside. Benga recalls asking Duda if he was OK, to which he replied: \"I'm happy because my cat is alive. I got a chance from God for a new life. The happiest moment is because the cat is here with me,\" Benga recalled Duda saying.",
      "The auburn-colored kitten, a tomcat named \"Peach\" in Ukrainian, was experiencing the effects of malnutrition after they ran out of food four days earlier and melted snow helped to keep him alive.",
      "\"It's like a dream, after all I have been through, I only hoped to be found and to survive,\" Duda, who worked as a journalist in Ukraine, told the AP. \"Peach kept my heart warm and he kept my faith alive.\"",

      "Close to getting frostbite, Duda is now receiving anti-inflammatory medication and blood circulation treatment, said Izabella Kiskasza, who runs a community center for Ukrainian refugees in Maramures and is assisting the duo.

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 06:33:50 -0500",
    "summary": "Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu is now juggling his own trial on corruption charges along with the war in Gaza and a new security challenge in neighboring Syria.",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv, Israel\u00a0\u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the stand Tuesday in his long-running trial for alleged corruption, setting off what's expected to be a weekslong spectacle that will draw unwelcome attention to his legal woes as he faces an international arrest warrant for war crimes and the fighting in Gaza continues. It is the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister takes the stand as a criminal defendant, an embarrassing milestone for a leader who has tried to cultivate an image as a sophisticated and respected statesman.",
      "Upon starting his testimony, Netanyahu said \"hello\" to the judges. One judge told him he had the same privileges as other witnesses and could sit or stand as he chose.",
      "\"I waited eight years for this moment, to say the truth,\" Netanyahu said, standing at a podium in a packed Tel Aviv courtroom. He called the charges against him \"an ocean of absurdness\" and promised his version would cut through the prosecution's case.",
      "Netanyahu appeared at ease as he began telling his version of events and shared personal details about his life that he might hope would shape the judges' perception of him. He said he used to lose sleep over media coverage but learned it had no meaningful bearing \u2014 in contrast to the prosecution's attempts to paint him as image-obsessed.",
      "He said he smoked cigars but could hardly finish them because of his workload, but hated champagne. One case revolves around him receiving a \"supply line\" of cigars and champagne from billionaire associates.",
      "His lawyer asked that he be allowed to receive notes while testifying to help ensure he can continue running the country.",
      "Netanyahu will answer during his court appearances to charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases.",
      "He is accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars' worth of cigars and champagne from a billionaire Hollywood producer in exchange for assisting him with personal and business interests. He is also accused of promoting advantageous regulation for media moguls in exchange for favorable coverage of himself and his family.",
      "Netanyahu, 75, denies wrongdoing, saying the charges are a witch hunt orchestrated by a hostile media and a biased legal system out to topple his lengthy rule. His testimony caps years of scandals that have swirled around him and his family.",
      "The testimony, set to take place six hours a day, three days a week for several weeks, will take up a significant chunk of Netanyahu's working hours, prompting critics to ask if he can capably manage a country embroiled in a war on one front, containing the fallout from a second, and keeping tabs on other potential regional threats, including from Iran or the recent fall of longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad in neighboring Syria.",
      "Netanyahu, in his testimony, said he could \"find a balance\" between both commitments.",
      "Dozens of people gathered outside of the court in Tel Aviv, some protesting against Netanyahu, including family members of hostages held in Gaza, and also a group of his supporters. A banner draped in front of the court read: \"Crime Minister.\"",
      "Under Israeli law, indicted prime ministers are not required to step down. But the charges against Netanyahu cleaved deep divisions in Israel, with protesters demanding he resign and former political allies refusing to serve in government with the Israeli leader, triggering a political crisis that led to five elections in less than four years beginning in 2019. He overcame the political tumult only two years ago by striking an agreement with smaller right-wing parties that had long languished on the edges of Israeli politics, to form the country's most far-right government ever.",
      "Netanyahu's supporters view the charges as the result of the justice system's bias and overreach, while his opponents have accused him of prolonging the raging war in Gaza in a bid to distract from, if not delay his own court proceedings. Netanyahu launched the war on Gaza's Hamas rulers immediately after they carried out their brutal Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage.",
      "Despite the pressure, the polarizing Netanyahu has rejected calls to step down and has used his position as prime minister to lash out at law enforcement, media and courts.",
      "An Israeli court rejected a request by Netanyahu's lawyers to reduce the expected testimony hours, as well as several other requests to delay its start, which they said were necessary because of the prime minister's busy schedule and the country's significant challenges. A verdict isn't expected until 2026 at the earliest and Netanyahu will have the option to appeal at the Supreme Court.",
      "The court has spent months hearing prosecution witnesses in the three cases, including some of Netanyahu's once closest aides who turned state witnesses. The prosecution has tried to portray the prime minister as an image-obsessed leader who broke the law to improve his public perception.",
      "The most damaging case against Netanyahu involves an influence-peddling scandal in which two of his formerly closest aides have testified against him on suspicions of promoting regulation worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israel's Bezeq telecom company. In return, Bezeq's popular news site, Walla, allegedly provided favorable coverage of Netanyahu and his family.",
      "Netanyahu is also alleged to have offered a newspaper publisher legislation that would weaken his paper's main rival in return for more favorable coverage.",
      "Moreover, the prime minister is accused of accepting nearly $200,000 in champagne and cigars from Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and in exchange, he allegedly operated on Milchan's behalf on U.S. visa matters, tried to legislate a generous tax break for him and sought to promote his interests in the Israeli media market.",
      "Netanyahu's testimony could further tarnish his image at a complicated time for Israel's longest-serving leader. His popular support dropped after the Hamas attack in October 2023, with the public blaming his leadership for failing to prevent the assault, and if elections were held today polls suggest he would struggle to form another new government.",
      "Israel is still fighting Hamas in Gaza with no end in sight, despite heavy international pressure to wind down the war, as well as pressure from the families of hostages still held in Gaza and their supporters to bring their loved ones home.",
      "The Israeli leader, along with his former defense minister, also faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for war crimes charges related to the war in Gaza, which his office has dismissed as \"absurd and false actions and charges.\"",

      "Manila \u2014 A volcano briefly erupted in the central Philippines on Monday, sending a huge ash column high into the sky as the government ordered the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from surrounding villages. Rising more than 8,000 feet above sea level on the central island of Negros, Kanlaon is one of 24 active volcanoes in the Philippines.",
      "A nearly four-minute eruption Monday afternoon sending a 2.5-mile ash column above the crater and a deadly spurt of hot ash, gases and fragmented volcanic rock about 2 miles down the mountain's southeast flank, officials told a news conference. The nation's volcano alert level was raised, indicating more explosive eruptions could still follow.",
      "There were no reported casualties from Monday's eruption, but volcanic ash fell across a wide area, including in Antique province, some 120 miles across the sea to the west of the volcano. The ash cloud obscured visibility and created a potential health risk, officials warned.",
      "\"Getting hit by these pyroclastic density currents is like being run over by a high-speed vehicle,\" said Maria Antonia Bornas, volcano monitoring chief of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.",
      "\"If the ash enters your lungs it would cause asphyxiation,\" she said, urging local officials to evacuate 15 villages within six kilometres of the crater.",
      "She said ash from the eruption rained down on several nearby towns and cities around the volcano and warned heavy rain could dislodge the fresh volcanic sediment from the latest eruption, which could bury communities below.",
      "About half of a dozen domestic flights and one bound for Singapore were canceled Monday and Tuesday due to the eruption, according to the Philippine Civil Aviation Authority.",
      "\"Evacuations are ongoing\" in four upland villages of La Castellana town, on the volcano's southwest slope, municipal police officer Staff Sergeant Ronel Arevalo told AFP, adding he did not have the total number of residents to be evacuated.

      "\"These past few days we've seen black smoke coming out of (the) volcano. We were expecting that it would erupt anytime this week,\" she told AFP by phone.",
      "Abendan said people rushed home to await evacuation orders, but added that the volcanic activity appeared to ease slightly about an hour later.",
      "Authorities said flights to and from the Bacolod-Silay international airport, nearest the volcano, remained normal, but carriers were warned from flying below 10,000 feet near the volcano.",

      "Last year, nearly 70% of all U.S. overdose deaths were attributed to illegally manufactured fentanyls (IMFs). One of those was carfentanil, an altered version of fentanyl that is said to be 100 times more potent, the CDC warned in a Dec. 5 alert.",
      "Deaths from carfentanil rose by more than 700% in the past year, according to the same source \u2014 there were 29 deadly overdoses between January and June 2023, and 238 in that same time frame in 2024.",

      "How is the drug administered?",
      "Carfentanil can be injected and is frequently mixed with other opioids or heroin, Tuell said. In a powder form, it can be inhaled.",

      "Now that we've discussed the threat, let\u2019s take a look at the solutions. Here are 10 ways you can keep your personal information safe.",
      "1) Use end-to-end encrypted platforms:\u00a0For private communications, prioritize platforms that offer end-to-end encryption. This ensures that only you and the intended recipient can access your messages or calls, preventing unauthorized access by hackers or other third parties.",
      "\"Anyone can take control of their own data and protect themselves from security threats by using applications that provide end-to-end encryption. Whether you\u2019re emailing, sending messages and files or video chatting, the only way to truly ensure your data is safe from bad actors is to encrypt it as it travels,\" Ackerly said. \"Choose an app or tool that is easy to use, so that you will actually use it.\"",
      "For texting, consider apps like\u00a0Signal or WhatsApp. For email services, look for ones that offer easy-to-use end-to-end encryption. These platforms ensure that your private communications remain secure from unauthorized access.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",
      "2) Keep your device's operating system updated:\u00a0Make sure your cellphone and other devices automatically receive timely operating system updates. These updates often include important security patches that protect against new vulnerabilities exploited by hackers. For reference, see my guide on\u00a0how to keep all your devices updated.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Set up phishing-resistant\u00a02FA on your email, social media and collaboration tool accounts. This adds an extra layer of protection, requiring more than just a password to access your accounts, making it harder for cybercriminals to steal your information.",
      "4) Use strong antivirus software: Be aware of phishing techniques and remain skeptical of suspicious links, emails or phone calls asking for personal information. Cybercriminals often use these methods to gain access to your sensitive data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Encrypt sensitive data:\u00a0Encrypt data on USB drives, SIM cards and laptops to protect information if devices are lost or stolen. Also, be sure to password-protect your sensitive files or folders by following\u00a0these steps.",
      "6) Implement strong password practices: Use unique, complex passwords for each account and consider using a\u00a0password manager.",
      "7) Regularly backup your data: Backing up your data helps protect against data loss from ransomware or device failure. You'll want to back up your\u00a0mobile device,\u00a0Mac and\u00a0Windows computers.",
      "8) Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Use a\u00a0VPN (virtual private network) when connecting to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks to encrypt your internet traffic. This makes it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "9) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider services that scrub your personal information from public databases. This reduces the chances of your data being exploited in phishing or other cyberattacks after a breach.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "10) Use identity theft protection: Identity theft protection services monitor your accounts for unusual activity, alert you to potential threats and can even assist in resolving issues if your data is compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "There\u2019s no denying that the U.S. is facing a serious cyberattack that puts millions at risk. What\u2019s even more concerning is that hackers continue to exploit telecom providers even after the issue has been made public. The government and the affected companies must prioritize addressing this threat and patching the back doors these cybercriminals are using.

It\u2019s important to note that Microsoft will never proactively reach out to you to provide unsolicited PC or technical support.\u00a0These criminals have evolved their tactics to easily convince you that your computer has a critical problem needing immediate attention.",

      "Urgency and scare tactics: Scammers often create a sense of panic, claiming hackers could access your devices and data imminently.",

      "2) Disconnect from the internet: This can prevent potential remote access by scammers.",
      "3) Do not provide remote access: Never give control of your device to unsolicited callers.",
      "4) Run a security scan using strong antivirus software: Use reputable, up-to-date, strong antivirus software to check your system. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Change critical passwords: Update passwords for important accounts, especially if you've shared any information.\u00a0Make sure to create strong, unique passwords. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication: Where possible, enable multifactor authentication.\u00a0This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "7) Monitor your accounts: Keep an eye on your financial accounts, email accounts and social media for any unusual activity. If you think scammers have stolen your identity, consider identity theft protection here.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8) Invest in personal data removal services: Using a data removal service can be an effective additional step to protect your personal information after a potential tech support scam. These services locate and remove your personal information from various online platforms, databases and data brokers. By eliminating unnecessary or outdated information, data removal services minimize your online presence, making it harder for scammers to find and exploit your data.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "9) Contact professionals: If you\u2019re unsure about any steps or if the situation seems severe, consider reaching out to a professional IT service.",
      "10) Report the incident: Report the scam to your local authorities and the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. You can also report the scam to\u00a0Microsoft directly.",

      "A VPN could be your secret weapon to protect your identity and finances.",
      "VPNs (virtual private networks) are a powerful tool for securing your internet connection. They protect your data by encrypting it, making it harder for hackers or even your internet service provider (ISP) to see what you're doing online. But how should you set up a VPN? Should you install it on each device or run it on your home network through a router? We will break down the pros and cons of both methods to help you make the right decision.",

      "Woman using a VPN on her cellphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms: IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from their server network, effectively preventing websites and cyber criminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",
      "VPN on devices vs. router: What's the difference?",
      "Understanding the difference between using a VPN on individual devices vs. setting it up on your router is crucial for maximizing your online security and privacy.",
      "Most people are familiar with using a VPN app on their phone, laptop or tablet. In this setup, the device connects directly to the internet through the VPN, keeping that device's internet activity secure.",
      "With a VPN router, instead of installing a VPN on each device, the router connects to the VPN. This means every device connected to your Wi-Fi \u2013 whether a smartphone, laptop, gaming console or even a smart TV \u2013 automatically uses the VPN, even if that device doesn\u2019t support VPN apps.",

      "Why use a VPN router?",
      "There are several advantages to running a VPN directly on your router.",
      "A VPN router ensures that every device on your network is protected, even those that don\u2019t support VPNs, like smart home devices or certain game consoles. Once the router is set up with a VPN, it encrypts the internet traffic of all connected devices.",
      "Installing or managing VPN software on every device is unnecessary with a VPN router. Once the router is configured, you can sit back and enjoy a protected internet connection across your entire home network. However, it\u2019s a good idea to occasionally check that the connection is working properly using tools like DNS leak tests.",
      "Using a VPN prevents your ISP from seeing which websites or services you\u2019re using. This is particularly useful if you\u2019re concerned about privacy or want to access geo-restricted content, such as streaming services like Netflix or gaming platforms.",
      "A home router (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Are there any downsides to VPN routers?",
      "While VPN routers are convenient, they do come with a few potential drawbacks.",
      "Most basic routers provided by your ISP don\u2019t support VPN connections. You\u2019ll likely need to purchase a more advanced, VPN-compatible router, which can be pricier, starting at around $50 and going much higher for premium models.",
      "Encrypting all the traffic in your home network requires processing power. If you have a lot of devices connected at once, a primary router might struggle to keep up. In this case, a higher-end router with more processing power is recommended.",
      "When you use a VPN app on a device, switching server locations, adjusting security settings or choosing different VPN protocols is easy. Making these changes on a VPN router requires logging into the router\u2019s settings, which can be more time-consuming and complicated.",
      "DON'T TOSS YOUR OLD INTERNET ROUTER UNTIL YOU DO THIS",
      "How to set up a VPN on a router",
      "Setting up a VPN on your\u00a0router may seem complex, but it significantly enhances your digital security, especially when paired with a robust router. Here\u2019s how to approach this process.",
      "Choose a compatible VPN service: Select a VPN provider that supports\u00a0router installations. Look for services that offer comprehensive guides and customer support to assist you through the setup.",
      "Select the right router: Ensure your router is VPN compatible and has strong security features. Opt for\u00a0routers that support the latest Wi-Fi encryption standards, such as WPA3, and have built-in firewalls to protect against external threats. This will provide a solid foundation for your VPN connection.",
      "Install the VPN: Follow your VPN provider's step-by-step instructions to configure the service on your\u00a0router. This typically involves entering your login credentials, installing necessary certificates and selecting a server location.",
      "Test your connection: Once configured, verify that your VPN is functioning correctly by testing the connection. Ensure that all devices connected to the router are protected by the VPN.",
      "Leverage additional security features: Take advantage of your router\u2019s features such as guest networks and parental controls to enhance security further. A separate guest network prevents unauthorized access to your main network, while regular firmware updates from the manufacturer help mitigate vulnerabilities.",
      "By integrating these steps, you not only set up a VPN but also fortify your home network against potential cyber threats.",

      "Both VPN routers and VPN apps have their own strengths, and the right choice depends on your specific needs. A VPN router might be the way to go if you\u2019re looking for convenience and whole-home protection. But if you prefer flexibility and more control over individual devices, sticking with a VPN app might suit you better.

      "While it might sound obvious, the first step to troubleshooting a computer that constantly crashes is ensuring everything is firmly plugged in. It's often the most overlooked step, so if you're using a desktop, you'll want to look behind your PC and ensure everything is plugged in.

      "Computer overheating is a common cause of intermittent shutdowns and crashes. If your CPU (central processing unit), essentially the brain of your computer, or graphics card gets too hot, your computer might shut down to ensure the components aren't damaged. If you notice that your laptop or desktop is giving off a lot of heat, or in the case of a laptop, it is hot to the touch, or if you notice your fans running louder than usual, these are all signs of overheating.",
      "If your computer is overheating, the first step is to clean it thoroughly. I recommend blowing dust out of the interior fans with compressed air and keeping your PC in an area where it can receive proper airflow. If you have a desktop PC, try not to keep it under your desk. Keeping a PC under a desk can cause issues with dust build-up and lack of airflow. It's best to keep your desktop in a part of your home or office where it can receive a decent amount of airflow.",

      "Hearing loss and other complications are prevalent among U.S. military veterans. Audiologist Dr. Tom Tedeschi shares why it's such a big issue and how vets should properly care for their ears.",
      "Have you ever found yourself needing to constantly turn the volume up on your TV because it sounds like the actors onscreen are speaking in whispers, but then whenever action is onscreen, your TV feels deafening? It's not just you.",
      "This is one of the most common issues people have with their TV audio, but, fortunately, you can change a few settings on your TV to make the dialogue sound clearer.",
      "Read on for three easy fixes to help your TV audio sound better.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER \u2014 THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "1. Check out your TV's audio settings",
      "A viewer adjusting TV audio settings with a remote control. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Most modern TVs feature preset audio settings that you can adjust on the fly to make things sound better, depending on whether you're gaming, watching a live concert or watching a slow-burn drama. Too much bass will often obscure spoken dialogue in TV shows and movies, and I suggest going through your TV's preset audio settings to see if you can make the audio clearer. Most TVs feature a movie, music and standard mode for TV audio. You can find your TV's audio presets by navigating to the settings from your remote and selecting \"sound.\"",
      "Some TVs will also feature audio presets explicitly designed for dialogue. Check to see if you have a setting for \"Dialogue,\" \"News,\" \"Speech\" or even \"Speech Boost\" in your TV audio settings. Any three of these should help your TV dialogue come through more clearly. You might also want to consider disabling settings for surround sound or bass boost, as these can cover up the sound of dialogue by increasing the bass too much.",
      "Increasing the treble might be worth it if you have access to EQ settings on your TV and are struggling to hear TV dialogue. It's an easy fix that can improve audio quality without taking too much away from non-dialogue sound in a movie or TV show.",
      "HOW TO EASILY CONNECT HEADPHONES TO YOUR TV FOR GREAT SOUND",
      "2. Adjust dynamic range compression",
      "A floor-standing speaker. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Dynamic range compression, or \"volume leveling,\" is useful for tailoring audio sound to personal needs. Volume leveling reduces the gulf between the loudest and quietest sounds onscreen, making it easier to hear and understand onscreen dialogue, especially in action movies, where the dialogue is often much quieter than the preceding action sequence. You'll find the settings for volume leveling or dynamic range compression in your TV audio settings, which, on most TVs, you can access directly from the remote.",
      "My TV features volume leveling, and I love to use it when I watch TV late at night at a low volume. It helps me to understand everything easily without having the speakers loud enough to wake anyone else up. It's also a great way to keep the audio level when commercials come on if you watch cable.",
      "BEST WAYS TO STREAM ANY CONTENT FROM YOUR PHONE TO A TV",
      "3. Look into speakers or a soundbar",
      "A speaker. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The default speakers built into TVs aren't the best. While a few high-level TVs come with a built-in soundbar, you'll still have the best experience with your own independent speakers or a soundbar. If you followed the two tips above but are still having trouble hearing movie or TV dialogue, it might be time to look into and invest in a set of speakers or, if you want a single unit,\u00a0a soundbar.",
      "I prefer using a soundbar with a TV over speakers for a cleaner setup because they often come with built-in subwoofers that enhance the bass, making action scenes and music sound more immersive. Additionally, modern soundbars are sleek and can easily blend with your home decor. Many of them also support advanced audio technologies like Dolby Atmos, which provides a surround sound experience without the need for multiple speakers scattered around the room.",

      "Check for a 3.5mm jack: Most TVs, especially older models, have a headphone jack located on the back or side panel. If your TV has this port, simply plug in your wired headphones for instant audio.",
      "Using adapters: If your TV lacks a headphone jack but has RCA outputs (the red and white ports), you can use an RCA-to-3.5mm adapter to connect your headphones.",
      "Bluetooth connection: Many modern TVs support Bluetooth. To connect:",
      "Put your headphones in pairing mode (usually by holding down a button until a light blinks).Navigate to the TV's settings menu, find the Bluetooth option, and activate it.Select your headphones from the list of available devices to pair them.",

      "Select your headphones from the list of available devices to pair them.",
      "Bluetooth transmitter: If your TV doesn\u2019t have Bluetooth, consider using a Bluetooth transmitter. This device plugs into the TV\u2019s audio output (like the headphone jack or RCA ports) and sends audio wirelessly to your Bluetooth headphones.",
      "Media streamers: If you use devices like Roku or Apple TV, they often support Bluetooth connections for headphones, allowing you to listen privately through those devices instead.",
      "By connecting headphones, you can enjoy clearer dialogue without disturbing others, making it easier to follow along with your favorite shows and movies.",
      "BEST NOISE-CANCELING HEADPHONES TO BOOST YOUR LISTENING",
      "5. Explore Professional-Grade Hearing solutions",
      "If you're consistently struggling to hear dialogue on your TV, it might be time to consider professional-grade hearing solutions. For those with mild to moderate hearing loss, products like the\u00a0AirPods Pro 2 can double as hearing aids with customizable sound settings designed to enhance speech clarity. These devices are particularly useful when paired with your TV\u2019s Bluetooth, allowing for a clear and immersive listening experience.",

This device uses cutting-edge dual-processing to separate speech from background noise, delivering exceptional clarity. Designed for comfort and discretion, these nearly invisible hearing aids fit snugly behind or inside the ear, ensuring a seamless and natural listening experience.",
      "The best hearing aids today feature\u00a0Bluetooth accessibility and user-friendly smartphone apps, allowing you to adjust settings, switch modes and even take calls directly through the device. Along with innovative technology, many options also come with access to expert support from licensed specialists, either in person or virtually, ensuring a personalized experience and ongoing assistance.",

Many people struggle with audio clarity, but by implementing these simple fixes, you can significantly enhance your TV viewing experience.

      "Why scambaiting matters",
      "So, why should we care about scambaiting? This creative strategy offers several compelling benefits. First and foremost, it effectively wastes scammers' time. Every minute they spend on the phone with Daisy is a minute they can't use to target real victims. By keeping them occupied, we can potentially prevent them from scamming someone else.",
      "In addition to wasting time, scambaiting raises awareness about common scams. It serves as an educational tool, helping others recognize and avoid falling prey to similar tactics. The more people understand how these scams operate, the less likely they are to become victims. Moreover, watching scammers get flustered sheds light on the lengths these criminals will go to and highlights the importance of staying vigilant against their schemes.",

      "While scambaiting can be a fun way to fight back against scams, the best defense is simply not picking up and answering scam calls in the first place. One effective strategy is to consider investing in personal data removal services that wipe your information from public databases on the internet. By reducing your digital footprint, you can make it more difficult for scammers to contact you in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

This email is particularly deceptive because it appears to come from a reputable retailer, Kohl's, but there are several red flags to watch out for. The email falsely claims to be from \"Kohl's Department\" instead of the official \"Kohl's.\" This slight alteration is a common tactic used by scammers to trick recipients into believing the email is legitimate.",
      "The email's reply-to address is tech@student.lvusd.org, which is clearly unrelated to Kohl's. Official emails from Kohl's would not use a student email address.

      "Fake Kohl\u2019s email. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Additional red flags to spot phishing emails",
      "As you can see, phishing emails can be hard to distinguish from genuine ones, especially during the busy holiday season when you may receive many emails from various sources. However, there are some additional red flags beyond the ones we've already mentioned that can help you identify a fake email. Here are some of them:",
      "Check the sender\u2019s address and domain name. Fake emails often use spoofed or similar-looking addresses and domain names to deceive you. For example, an email from support@amaz0n.com or info@fedex.delivery.com is likely a phishing attempt. You'll notice in the Apple phishing email below the email address has just a bunch of letters and numbers. Always verify the sender\u2019s address and domain name before opening or responding to an email.",
      "Check the spelling and grammar. Phishing emails often contain spelling and grammar errors or use poor or unnatural language. For example, an email that says, \"Dear Customer, Your order has been shipped. Please confirm your delivery address by clicking here.\" It is suspicious because it does not address you by name, uses a generic greeting and asks you to click on a link. Always read the email carefully and look for any mistakes or inconsistencies.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Check the links and attachments. Fake emails often contain links and attachments that lead to malicious websites or download malware to your device. For example, an email that says, \"You have won a $100 gift card from Walmart. Click here to claim your prize.\" It is likely a scam. On a laptop or desktop, always carefully hover your mouse over the links and check the URL before clicking on them, and never open or download any attachments from unknown or suspicious sources.",
      "How to handle spam emails",
      "Use strong antivirus software: The first and most crucial step to protect yourself from accidentally clicking on fake links in spam emails is to have strong antivirus software installed on your device. This software can detect and block malicious emails and links, providing an extra layer of security.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "Do not open or reply to spam emails.\u00a0This can confirm your email address to the sender and encourage them to send you more spam. It can also expose you to malicious links or attachments that can harm your device or data.",
      "Mark spam email as junk or spam. Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources.\u00a0This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable or\u00a0email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "Use a personal data removal service: Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "YOUR EMAIL DIDN'T EXPIRE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM",
      "What to do if you accidentally click on a link or open an attachment from a fake email",
      "If you realize that you have clicked on a link or opened an attachment from a fake email, don\u2019t panic. Here are some steps that you can take to minimize the damage and protect yourself:",
      "1. Disconnect your device from the internet.\u00a0This will prevent any further communication or data transfer between your device and the malicious website or\u00a0malware. You can do this by turning off your Wi-Fi or unplugging your ethernet cable.",
      "2. Scan your device for malware. Use a reputable\u00a0antivirus software to scan your device and remove any potential threats. Having good antivirus software actively running on your devices will alert you of any malware in your system, warn you against clicking on any malicious links in phishing emails, and ultimately protect you from being hacked.\u00a0 Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "3. Change your passwords. If you have entered or provided any passwords or personal information on the malicious website, you should change them as soon as possible. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. You should also\u00a0enable\u00a0two-factor authentication for your online accounts, which adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code or a device confirmation in addition to your password.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts and credit reports.\u00a0If you have entered or provided any financial information on the malicious website or link you clicked on, you should monitor your bank accounts, credit cards and credit reports for any suspicious or unauthorized activity.",
      "6. You should also\u00a0contact your bank or credit card company and inform them of the incident. You may need to cancel or freeze your cards or accounts to prevent any further fraud.",
      "7. Report the phishing email.\u00a0You should also report the phishing email to the sender\u2019s legitimate organization, such as your bank, retailer or delivery service, and to the authorities, such as the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the\u00a0Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG). This will help them to take action and prevent others from falling for the same scam.",
      "8. Use identity theft protection services\u00a0if you entered your personal information on any links you clicked on or websites that you were directed to. Identity theft protection companies can monitor your personal information (home title, Social Security number, phone number, email address) and alert you in the event they become breached. It can also alert you if any of these are being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Unfortunately, as the holiday season unfolds, cybercriminals are also getting into the \"holiday spirit\" by increasing their efforts to exploit your trust and distractions. By staying alert and applying the tips we\u2019ve discussed, you can enjoy the season without falling victim to their schemes. Remember, phishing emails are designed to play on your emotions \u2014 whether it's excitement, urgency or curiosity. Always take a moment to verify the authenticity of any message before clicking on links or sharing personal information. When in doubt, reach out directly to the company or service in question through its official website or app.",

    "title": "New Jersey drone sightings: Military analysts break down national security concerns, doubt hobbyists at play",
    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 13:35:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Military drone experts tell Fox News that SUV-size drones over New Jersey are not likely hobbyists and a foreign adversary could be responsible.",
    "story": [
      "Ken Gray, a former FBI agent and military analyst, told Fox News Digital he does not believe the New Jersey drone sightings are hobbyists, though it's unclear at this stage if they are a threat or not.",
      "New Jersey authorities have insisted that sightings of SUV-size drones for the past several weeks do not present a threat to public safety, but military analysts say the lack of clear answers from the government points to a larger problem.",
      "These large drones have been spotted over the skies of the Garden State with smaller, more rapidly maneuverable drones, resembling what\u2019s referred to as \"drone motherships\" that have been deployed in Ukraine, Russia and China, Fox News contributor Brett Velicovich said. The motherships launch smaller drones, which do not have the necessary range-antennas to carry them a further distance. That suggests, according to Velicovich, that a foreign adversary could be at play in New Jersey.",
      "The Jersey sightings resemble SPV drones, which Ukraine uses to conduct about 70 to 80% of the strikes on the front lines, Velicovich said. RPG weapons, such as mortars or grenades, are attached to the fast-moving SPV drones.",
      "\"It doesn't matter if the drone doesn't have a bomb on it to explode. The damage that these things can cause from a collection standpoint can set countries back years,\" Velicovich, a former special operations intel analyst and drone expert, told Fox News Digital. He explained that drones can be outfitted with various sensors to detect cellphone coverage, pick up IP addresses and different frequencies in the air and nuclear radiation.",
      "MYSTERIOUS DRONE SIGHTINGS CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED IN NEW JERSEY WITHOUT ANSWERS",
      "New Jersey drone sighting map (Fox & Friends/Screengrab)",
      "\"All\u00a0the drones have to do is fly over that sensitive site, and they could be collecting intelligence that can go back to a foreign adversary immediately,\" Velicovich said. \"I mean, it's getting sent over satellite communications. It's getting passed back very quickly. And the damage, frankly, is already done.\"",
      "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who has held briefings with Homeland Security, FBI, Secret Service, and state police officials in recent days, told Fox News on Monday that he\u2019s seen no evidence of any concern for public safety.",
      "Murphy has described the drones spotted in New Jersey as \"very sophisticated\" in nature, telling reporters that \"the minute you get eyes on them, they go dark.\" The governor on Monday acknowledged concern over sensitive targets and critical infrastructure. One of President-elect Trump\u2019s homes, as well as military and utility assets, are in the state.",
      "Murphy said there had been 49 sightings reported on Sunday night alone, and though that might be overstated, \"it's really frustrating that we don\u2019t have more answers as to where they\u2019re coming from and why they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re doing.\"",
      "\"It's a non-zero number. I was on with the White House and Homeland Security leadership literally at the very top yesterday, pretty much all day, I'm hoping we'll get answers sooner than later,\" Murphy said. \"I would just ask folks to continue to let the FBI or their local law enforcement know when they see something, and we'll continue to do everything we can with our federal partners to get clearer answers.\"",
      "Velicovich argued that officials, including at the DHS, the FBI and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), \"have zero clue what it takes to actually defend against real drone threats against the United States.\"",
      "\"If they've already flown over these sensitive sites and are able to collect this information, we've got a larger problem. And I think there's a lack of awareness with government officials on exactly what drone technology is capable of,\" he said. \"And so if this is a foreign adversary, I kind of liken it to the Chinese spy balloon where you've got this stuff sitting up there for a long time, just listening, collecting data, collecting information. And the reality is we're not going to really know what it's collecting probably until it's too late.\"",
      "NEW JERSEY GOV. PHIL MURPHY CALLS FOR FEDERAL HELP AMID 'VERY SOPHISTICATED' DRONE SIGHTINGS: 'WE NEED MORE'",
      "Though the origin of the drone sightings has not been determined, and the work of foreign adversaries remains a possibility, Ken Gray, a former FBI agent and military drone expert, told Fox News Digital they could also be a result of a utility company using drones to check their power lines for fraying, the Forest Service potentially checking trees for nighttime infestation or potentially agricultural activities.",
      "The drone was seen over North Jersey on Tuesday. (Nicholas Lordi)",
      "More investigation is needed, but Gray argued that the size of the aircraft spotted in New Jersey skies indicates it is not likely to be hobbyists behind them.",
      "\"You cannot just shoot down a drone because you don't know the origin of it. And so the fact that nobody has shot one of these down is a good thing,\" Gray said. \"That's something that would be a pretty, pretty risky step to take at this point. Instead, you need to identify where it's originating from and where it's being recovered from and find out who is operating that.\"",
      "New Jersey sits along the eastern seaboard, as does Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, where 17 unmanned vehicles traipsed into restricted airspace last December. The Pentagon this week announced a new counter-drone strategy following the spate of drone incursions near U.S. bases, including in the United Kingdom, but did not cite the ongoing investigation spearheaded by the FBI into what is happening in New Jersey.",
      "Velicovich and Gray both stated that drone production outsourced to China poses a national security risk.",
      "As most drones are manufactured by the Chinese technology company DJI, Gray said there is concern that the data or images collected could be transmitted back to China as surveillance.",
      "Noting the Ukrainian army\u2019s successful use of what once were \"hobbyist level\" drones as weapons platforms to fly up to and essentially blow up Russian armed vehicles, Gray said there\u2019s also a real danger of this technology expanding domestically.\u00a0\"As far as local law enforcement goes, local law enforcement does not have the capabilities of handling the threat of a drone if it were being used as a weapon system at this point,\" Gray said. \"Most police departments would rather rely upon a shotgun to try to take it down as opposed to any other weapon system.\"",
      "The U.S. Secret Service does have anti-drone capabilities, as does the U.S. Navy, but most local law enforcement does not, Gray said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Despite having the technology, the Secret Service did not have their counter-drone systems up and running ahead of the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump, Velicovich said, arguing that authorities have major catching up to do.",
      "\"The writing on the wall is that drone technology can be used in the wrong way, can be very damaging to us, and we have yet to put the proper funding and bring in the real experts that are dealing with this every single day that, you know, at our government level,\" Velicovich said. \"We're years behind China. We're years behind Russia. A lot of other countries see how valuable that tech is.\"",

Now that Assad, one of Putin\u2019s key allies, has lost Syria, the balance of power shifts dramatically. With this loss, Trump may have newfound leverage over Putin, as losing Syria undermines Russia\u2019s influence in the region and strains its already overstretched resources.

      "Former Israeli Ambassador to Jordan Jacob Rosen, who has expertise in Syria\u2019s complex demographics, told Fox News Digital that Iran and Turkey \"are the big players who are ex-empires who want to go back to the glory\" of their rule over large swathes of the Mideast.\"",
      "\"If Turkey controls Syria, it can encircle the Kurds,\" said Rosen, a fluent Arabic speaker. Turkey has launched attacks over the\u00a0years\u00a0against pro-U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish forces in northern Syria.",
      "Rosen views Erdogan\u2019s embrace of the HTS offensive on Friday as a warning from Turkey to Iran\u2019s regime. \"Don\u2019t do stupid things,\" is the message Erdogan is sending Tehran, noted Rosen.",
      "The big question for the U.S., the European Union and Israel is, \"Who is going to save Assad?\", Rosen asked.",
      "Russia, the Lebanese terrorist movement, Hezbollah and Iran previously rescued Assad from defeat. However, Russia is consumed with a protracted war in Ukraine.",
      "Rosen said the re-kindled Syrian revolt against Assad has spread to the southern Syrian province of\u00a0Daraa\u2014the birthplace of the 2011 revolt. He termed the fast-moving events in Darra as \"mini-rebellions\" and said some Syrian regime forces defected.",

      "The stakes are high in Syria and for the heartland of the Mideast. Rosen referenced the late British journalist, Patrick\u00a0Seale, who authored books on Syria.\u00a0\"The hegemony of the Middle East depends on who will rule Syria,\" said Rosen with respect to Seale\u2019s core idea about the importance of Syria for the region.",

      "Rosen summarized al-Golani\u2019s interview as \"He wants to appeal to the West. The former ambassador added al-Golani \"knows everyone in Syria is not Islamist. For the time being, he is playing it very moderate.\"",
      "Bouzo said the media's focus \"on the idea that the opposition fighting the regime are Islamic does not change the fact that the other side is also Islamic militias, but Shiite ones supported by both Iran under\u00a0[Ali] Khamenei and Russia under\u00a0[Vladimir] Putin.

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 19:58:09 GMT",
    "summary": "The brother of Ted Kaczynski sayd he hopes the man accused in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson didn't view his sibling as a \"key model.\"",
    "story": [
      "The brother of Ted Kaczynski, the domestic terrorist known as the \"Unabomber,\" said Tuesday that he hopes the\u00a0man accused in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson\u00a0didn't view his brother as a \"key model\"\u00a0and is distressed that his brother's actions decades ago may motivate violence today.",
      "For two decades, Ted Kaczynski waged a\u00a0deadly bombing spree\u00a0that killed three people and injured 23 others until his capture in the Montana wilderness in 1996. Kaczynski had taunted officials with a rambling manifesto and was apprehended following one of the longest FBI manhunts in history.",
      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "The suspect in Thompson's killing, Luigi Mangione, an Ivy League tech graduate, had reviewed Kaczynski's \"Industrial Society and Its Future,\" also known as \"The Unabomber Manifesto,\" in January, writing on the book review site Goodreads: \"It's easy to quickly and thoughtless write this off as the manifesto of a lunatic, in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies. But it's simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out.\"",
      "But David Kaczynski said that his brother, who died by suicide in federal custody in 2023, should not be someone to aspire to.",
      "\"His actions are like a virus,\" David Kaczynski said in a phone interview. \"They could be like a virus unless they understand he was a very angry and disturbed man. It doesn't mean his ideas are ideas of a lunatic, but his behavior, I believe, is the behavior of a lunatic.\"",
      "\"To the extent that he may have attributed at all to sort of normalizing or recasting the violent acts as beneficial to humanity is a terrible mistake,\" David Kaczynski added.",
      "Ted Kaczynski, a Harvard-educated mathematician, railed against technology in his writings and planted homemade pipe bombs \u2014 targeting universities, an American Airlines flight and others \u2014 from 1978 to 1995, federal prosecutors said. He wrote a 35,000-word manifesto against the \"industrial-technological system\" that he hoped would create a revolution in modern society.",
      "Mangione, 26, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2020 with an undergraduate degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics, while simultaneously earning a graduate degree in computer and information science, the school said.",
      "He was arrested Monday at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, following a dayslong manhunt after Thompson's death last Wednesday. The 50-year-old CEO was gunned down in front of a New York City hotel in what the NYPD say was a \"premeditated, preplanned targeted attack.\"",
      "At a hearing Tuesday afternoon in Pennsylvania, Mangione chose to fight extradition to New York, where he would face second-degree murder and other charges. Bail was denied.",
      "Before he entered the courthouse, Mangione shouted toward reporters, \"It's completely out of touch and an insult to the intelligence of the American people and their lived experience!\"",
      "NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch told reporters Monday that investigators found a handwritten document that \"speaks to both his motivation and mindset.\" Further details were not made public, but NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny\u00a0said Mangione appeared to hold \"ill will toward corporate America.\"",
      "In an NYPD preliminary analysis of the shooting, investigators said they are looking at whether the attack was the culmination of the suspect's apparent troubles and list of grievances, including the possibility that the murder was a \"symbolic takedown\" in a fight against corporate \"power games.\"",
      "Investigators also indicated he may have admired Kaczynski\u2019s attacks and allegedly echoed his own concerns about technological advancement.",
      "Mangione's Goodreads account said he had read 65 titles on topics ranging from Elon Musk to dieting.\u00a0He rated Kaczynski's book four out of five stars. He also quoted \"a take\" he found online that he said was \"interesting.\"",
      "The online comment about Kaczynski read, in part: \"When all other forms of communication fail, violence is necessary to survive. You may not like his methods, but to see things from his perspective, it\u2019s not terrorism, it's war and revolution.\"",
      "David Kaczynski was instrumental in helping to capture his brother. After The Washington Post printed \"The Unabomber Manifesto\" in 1995, David Kaczynski realized his sibling could be one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives and worked with the agency in his capture.",
      "David Kaczynski said he understands that people, to this day, still may look at his brother's writings and find connection with his belief that rapid technological advancement is eroding human freedom. But violence, he added, cannot accompany change.",
      "\"I think we always have to remember that human motivation is extremely complicated,\" David Kaczynski said. \"Many factors go into a person's motivation that they drastically act like this, and I hope my brother wasn't in a way a key model for him.\"",
      "David Kaczynski declined to comment about his brother's death in prison in June 2023. Ted Kaczynski was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole and had been diagnosed with rectal cancer when he died by suicide at age 81 alone in his cell at the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina. His autopsy, obtained by NBC News in April, noted he had been \"depressed and sent for psychiatric evaluation\" a month prior to killing himself.",
      "\"Just like acts of love can send out waves of benefit to other people, to humanity at-large in ways we can see and ways we can't see,\" David Kaczynski said, \"acts of violence do the same thing, albeit in a very negative manner. It really gives me a great deal of personal pain to think my brother's actions have in any way contributed to influencing a man like this to kill an innocent human being.\""

      "On e-commerce platforms like Etsy, TikTok Shop, eBay and Redbubble, sellers are hawking merchandise featuring designs inspired by the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "NBC News reviewed over 100 item listings for T-shirts, hoodies, stickers, mugs and even fake bullets and Christmas ornaments that bear the words \u201cDeny,\u201d \u201cDefend\u201d and \u201cDepose\u201d after bullet shell casings were found with those words on them at the scene of the crime (the word \u201cDefend\u201d was later clarified by the police to be \u201cDelay\u201d).",
      "Some of the merchandise features drawings or images of the shooter taken from the initial video of the shooting. A suspect, Luigi Mangione, was charged with murder Monday. There has been significant online fanfare surrounding the shooting, with many people making light of the killing or outright celebrating it. The targeting of Thompson and the shooter\u2019s message have been widely interpreted as a commentary on the state of the health insurance industry, with many people sharing stories of coverage denial, mistreatment and financial hardship they\u2019ve faced within the system.",
      "Thompson was a father to two sons. In a statement, his family called him an \u201cincredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives\u201d and said he \u201cwill be greatly missed.\u201d",
      "Follow here for live coverage",
      "The T-shirts and other merchandise join the swell of sentiment around the shooting. Many of the designs appear to be sold through print on demand, a business model that produces items only after orders are received, so sellers don\u2019t have to keep inventory on hand. The freewheeling print-on-demand industry has continued to boom despite issues like rampant copyright infringement.",
      "While many of the products just feature the messages left on the bullet shell casings, other designs more explicitly glorify or encourage violence. Some of the designs feature guillotines, guns and target symbols.",
      "Etsy, Redbubble, TikTok Shop and eBay all prohibit selling items that glorify violence. In a statement, an eBay representative said that \u201ceBay policies do not prohibit the sale of items with the phrase \u2018Deny. Defend. Depose,\u2019 however, items that glorify or incite violence, including those that celebrate the recent murder of UHC CEO Brian Thompson, are prohibited.\u201d Etsy, Redbubble and TikTok didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "While the expanding market for merchandise related to the shooting appears to largely be for-profit, with prices ranging from $2.99 to over $70 for a blanket, one seller told NBC News he plans to donate any proceeds he makes to a charity that assists people with paying their medical bills.",
      "The graphic designer behind one version of the merch, Michael, spoke on the condition that his last name be withheld because he feared professional repercussions. In a TikTok video with almost 2 million views, Michael referred to a nickname some people online have started to use to refer to the shooter, \u201cThe Adjuster.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re going to give him a badass superhero name, I think he needs a badass superhero logo to go with it,\u201d Michael said in the video. He flipped and repurposed the UnitedHealthcare logo to feature an \u201cA\u201d and the words \u201cDeny,\u201d \u201cDefend\u201d and \u201cDepose.\u201d Michael is selling the design on two different T-shirts and two hoodies on Etsy, and he said he got more than two dozen orders in less than 24 hours, making it his fastest-selling design.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t personally believe in violence, but I have a problem with their entire business making money off people suffering and dying,\u201d Michael said about the health insurance industry and his reasons for making the design. \u201cI think health care should be free; I think a lot of people feel that way. Even though it\u2019s not the way we\u2019d go about it, we\u2019re tired about not seeing anything get done.\u201d",
      "Michael said that it didn\u2019t surprise him that the print-on-demand industry was capitalizing on what he considers an anti-capitalist movement but that he didn\u2019t want to personally profit from someone\u2019s death. He said he was inspired to create the design after he saw a flood of content on TikTok over the weekend that framed the shooter as a hero and an outlaw, including original folk songs about the shooting. Pictures of stickers and other artwork that said \u201cDeny,\u201d \u201cDefend\u201d and \u201cDepose\u201d at craft fairs over the weekend have also gained traction online.",
      "\u201cI always wondered why people root for guys robbing trains, and then you realize how corrupt banks are, and then you\u2019re like, \u2018I kind of get it,\u2019\u201d Michael said. \u201cIt says something about society that we can relate to the killer more than the billionaire and his family.\u201d"

    "summary": "The allegation is that banks, under pressure from the Biden administration, have unfairly \u201cdebanked\u201d people who work with cryptocurrency.",
    "story": [
      "Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were conceived as a way to challenge traditional banks. Now, with the help of the tech billionaires Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen, the crypto industry is fighting for something else entirely: the right to have a checking account.",
      "Musk and Andreessen are some of the prominent and powerful voices trying to make a case that crypto industry players are being wrongly discriminated against when they try to work with big corporate banks. The allegation is that banks, under pressure from the Biden administration, have unfairly \u201cdebanked\u201d people who work with cryptocurrency by terminating their bank accounts.",
      "The concept of \u201cdebanking,\u201d a previously obscure term, has received fresh attention in the past month after Andreessen, an investor and co-founder of Netscape, said in an interview with podcast host Joe Rogan that he knows 30 tech company founders who had been \u201cdebanked in the past four years\u201d \u2014 a claim that set off a flood of anecdotes from social media users complaining that they, too, had lost access to their bank accounts.",
      "Musk said on X that debanking is an example of \u201chow evil the government has been\u201d and that it should be a federal crime if it\u2019s politically motivated.",
      "It\u2019s an allegation that various federal regulatory agencies reject as untrue. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which charters and supervises all national banks, said that it expects banks to assess the risks of their customers on a case-by-case basis.",
      "\u201cThe OCC does not direct banks to open, close, or maintain individual accounts. Nor does the OCC recommend or encourage banks to engage in the wholesale termination of categories of customer accounts,\u201d the office said in a statement.",
      "The White House referred questions about the Musk and Andreessen statements to the Treasury Department, which declined to comment.",
      "There is no guaranteed right to banking services, and Andreessen and Musk both have a history of making inflammatory political statements. But their comments about debanking appear to have tapped into a well of discontent among crypto enthusiasts, right-wing activists and even bank lobbyists about how traditional banks are operated in the U.S.",
      "Many crypto firms must navigate a maze of government regulations designed to ensure their services aren\u2019t used for money-laundering by criminals, terrorist organizations or rogue governments such as North Korea. It\u2019s an area with so many compliance requirements that some banks decide it\u2019s not worth the trouble, especially if the customer is a tiny startup.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets, said that regulators do expect banks to close accounts quickly when there\u2019s a risk of financial crime, or else face potential billion-dollar fines.",
      "\u201cThe complexity of managing such compliance is often simply too high for some businesses where there are challenges in monitoring for risk,\u201d the bank said in a statement. \u201cWe welcome the opportunity to work with the new Administration and Congress on ways to remove regulatory ambiguity while maintaining our country\u2019s ability to address financial crime.\u201d",
      "Now, Musk and Andreessen are pushing for massive changes in the banking sector, using their newfound political influence with President-elect Donald Trump to help the cryptocurrency industry and others who they say have been unfairly cut off from traditional banks.",
      "Andreessen\u2019s investment firm, Andreessen Horowitz, argued in a blog post last month that \u201ceveryone has the right to a bank account \u2014 even crypto companies,\u201d and in a follow-up last week it denounced \u201ccompliance headaches\u201d in general.",
      "Musk, in response to an X post last month about debanking, called for \u201cdeleting\u201d the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, saying there are \u201ctoo many duplicative regulatory agencies\u201d \u2014 even though the CFPB has denounced the practice of debanking and vowed to help fight it.",
      "The CFPB, whose director, Rohit Chopra, was appointed by President Joe Biden, is currently fighting in a federal appeals court for the authority to investigate debanking allegations. Last month, the CFPB finalized a rule to oversee payment wallet apps, saying it wants to stop them from unfairly debanking customers. The rule means the CFPB could one day regulate Musk\u2019s X if Musk follows through on adding a payments service to the social media app.",
      "Last week, in a victory for the crypto industry, Trump said he would appoint the venture capitalist David Sacks, an industry ally, as his \u201cWhite House A.I. & Crypto Czar.\u201d Sacks has for years argued against debanking, including telling The Free Press in 2022 that his former company, PayPal, is wrong to ban extremists. Trump has also said he\u2019ll nominate Paul Atkins, a longtime crypto advocate, to be chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Trump during the campaign wooed crypto industry support in part by talking about debanking.",
      "\u201cThey target your banks. They choke off your financial services,\u201d he told the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, in July. A month later, he said he wanted to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet.\u201d",
      "The Trump family says they\u2019ve been debanked. Melania Trump said in her memoir, \u201cMelania,\u201d that her long-time bank \u201cdecided to terminate my account\u201d after she left the White House in 2021 and wouldn\u2019t let her son, Barron Trump, open an account. Donald Trump Jr. has said he lost access to banking services.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment on the president-elect\u2019s plans.",
      "But the concern about debanking crosses party lines. Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., posted on X this month that debanking is \u201can insidious threat to civil liberties in America,\u201d mentioning Andreessen\u2019s comments but not any specific sector or incident.",
      "The anecdotes about debanking may have a note of irony, given that cryptocurrency has been based on an anarchist ideology and outlaw image since its beginnings. Cryptocurrency developers have long said they want to replace traditional financial institutions, not rely on them.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how widespread debanking actually is. The Blockchain Association, an industry trade group, last year started a tip line for people who believed they\u2019d been debanked, and now the group says it has identified a pattern of \u201cmore than 30 concrete cases of denied applications or debanking\u201d due to banking customers\u2019 \u201cinvolvement in the digital asset industry.\u201d It declined to release details of those cases, saying that it is still investigating the claims.",
      "\u201cAs we continue to wait for responses to our FOIA requests, we\u2019re exploring additional options to ensure the unlawful debanking of our industry ends,\u201d Marisa Coppel, the Blockchain Association\u2019s head of legal, said in a statement.",
      "Last month, the association sent a letter to Trump asking him to end the practice of debanking, possibly via an executive order.",
      "In the interview with Rogan, Andreessen didn\u2019t provide examples or evidence of crypto-related debanking. Still, his comment prompted others to share personal stories about losing access to banking services with no explanation and despite having good credit. This situation could cripple a business or someone\u2019s personal life.",
      "Sid Kalla, the co-founder of the crypto startup company Roll Labs in New York, was among those who spoke up. His company, also known as Turing Holdings, helps online creators mint digital tokens, which people can then trade online. After Andreessen\u2019s interview, he posted a photo on X of a cancellation notice he said he received from Chase in May. The notice was about a business account, and Kalla said that it had been a seven-year banking relationship.",
      "\u201cWe tried to find out what happened,\u201d Kalla said in an interview. \u201cWe tried to email and call our banker in the Brooklyn Heights branch, and no one had access to look behind the curtain. The employees were all very nice, but they honestly didn\u2019t seem to know the reason.\u201d",
      "Kalla said the startup was without a checking account for three to four weeks, forcing a delay in paychecks for its 12 employees and contractors. Kalla\u2019s post on X has received 2.9 million views.",
      "Chase, a unit of JPMorgan Chase, declined to comment on Roll Labs\u2019 situation, citing a policy of not speaking about individual accounts.",
      "At least one bank industry trade group says debanking is a real issue \u2014 and one that\u2019s caused by government regulators\u2019 pressure. Piggybacking off the comments by Andreessen, the Bank Policy Institute, whose chairman is JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, accused bank regulators of running a \u201csecret enforcement regime\u201d through government-appointed examiners who closely monitor bank operations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a regime where an examiner\u2019s mandate that a bank designate a client as \u2018high risk\u2019 generally forces the bank to close the account,\u201d the institute said in a post on X, linking to a statement from last month calling for major deregulation.",
      "While much of the crypto industry remains legal, cryptocurrency has had a scandal-filled few years, with the founders of trading platforms Binance and FTX going to prison, and the government has been slowly chipping away at areas it views as outside the law, such as digital tokens that some regulators argue are indistinguishable from traditional securities. The FBI says it received more than 69,000 complaints last year related to alleged cryptocurrency fraud, and the Treasury Department says various cryptocurrency firms have been used by Russian gangs and the North Korean government.",
      "The stakes in the debanking debate are potentially high. Some crypto investors and lawmakers have proposed what would be, in effect, a federal right to banking services, and for some lobbying groups, the topic has become an opportunity to criticize other banking regulations, such as anti-money laundering compliance.",
      "Several Republicans in Congress including Sen. Kevin Cramer, of North Dakota, have sponsored a bill, the Fair Access to Banking Act, which if passed would force banks, payment card networks and other financial services companies to do business with \u201cany person who is in compliance with the law.\u201d",
      "Cramer told NBC News that he will reintroduce the bill next year and also seek changes via administrative rulemaking.",
      "\u201cMy first intention is to reintroduce it, build the coalition to support it, and begin working with the Trump administration as soon as possible on a rulemaking,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe coalition is growing as more industries and individuals get debanked.\u201d",
      "The issue has been bubbling since last year, and it\u2019s not only the crypto industry that is complaining about getting cut off from banking services. Pawn shops, firearms manufacturers and mining companies have joined a growing chorus of industries that say banks are discriminating against them, while Muslim charities and Jan. 6 rioters say they\u2019ve also been targeted for political reasons.",
      "The allegations have echoes of an Obama-era program at the Justice Department named \u201cOperation Choke Point.\u201d Designed to put pressure on payday lenders, the program involved bringing cases against banks that had allegedly looked the other way in processing unlawful payments. Some crypto investors call the latest wave of debanking examples \u201cOperation Choke Point 2.0.\u201d",
      "People in the crypto industry say the pressure on banks by regulators has been mostly informal, with no explicit directive to stop doing business with their industry, but there has been some guidance in writing. In January 2023, weeks after federal prosecutors charged FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, three federal regulatory agencies \u2014 the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \u2014 called on banks to limit their exposure to crypto activities and risks.",
      "\u201cIt is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system,\u201d the agencies said in a joint statement. The debanking allegations appeared to begin shortly after, popping up in an article by a venture capitalist in Pirate Wires, a publication started by a venture capital marketing employee.",
      "The FDIC and Federal Reserve declined to comment.",
      "On Friday, the crypto exchange Coinbase released a slew of letters it received after suing the FDIC last year, and in the letters the FDIC asks banks to \u201cpause\u201d or \u201crefrain from providing\u201d various services the banks had intended to launch.",
      "Paul Grewal, chief legal officer for Coinbase, said he believes the FDIC may be acting unlawfully.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no statutory authority for the FDIC to say, \u2018We don\u2019t like a particular industry,\u2019\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cToday, it\u2019s crypto. Tomorrow, it might be alcohol.\u201d",
      "The agency in a report this year denied it was targeting crypto startups or any other class of customer. Banks \u201care neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type,\u201d the FDIC said in its 2024 Risk Review.",
      "The FDIC has also complained about the conduct of some crypto firms, some of which have falsely represented to their customers that their products are eligible for FDIC deposit insurance coverage, according to an agency advisory in 2022."

    "title": "Arctic tundra transformed from a carbon sink into a source of emissions, NOAA report finds",
    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 16:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The Arctic experienced its second-hottest year on record, according to a NOAA report. The Arctic tundra has become a source of emissions, rather than a carbon sink.",
    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "This was the Arctic\u2019s second-hottest year on record, according to a new NOAA report.The tundra has become a source of emissions, rather than a carbon sink, the authors said.The Arctic is heating up far faster than places at lower altitudes as melting ice reflects less radiation back to space.",
      "This was the Arctic\u2019s second-hottest year on record, according to a new NOAA report.",
      "The tundra has become a source of emissions, rather than a carbon sink, the authors said.",
      "The Arctic is heating up far faster than places at lower altitudes as melting ice reflects less radiation back to space.",
      "The Arctic just experienced its second-hottest year on record. And concerningly, the region\u2019s tundra has transitioned from being a sink for carbon to a source of emissions as permafrost melts to release methane.",
      "That will only amplify the amount of heat-trapping gases that enter the atmosphere, paving the way for further warming.",
      "The findings, shared Tuesday in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Arctic report card, show how climate change is scrambling ecosystems and shape-shifting the landscape in the part of the planet where global warming is most intense.",
      "Considered a bellwether region for the effects of climate change, the Arctic is heating up far faster than places at lower altitudes \u2014 two to four times as quickly, depending on the baselines scientists use for comparison and which geography they include in assessments. The last nine years in the Arctic have all had the highest average temperatures recorded since 1900.",
      "That dynamic is the result of a phenomenon called Arctic amplification. As the Arctic loses snow cover and sea ice, more dark-colored ocean water and rock emerge. Those dark surfaces reflect less radiation back to space, absorbing heat, instead. In addition, patterns of circulation in the oceans and the atmosphere are increasingly transporting heat toward the Earth\u2019s poles.",
      "Together, that means the Arctic is a fundamentally different place from what it was just 10 years ago, said the lead editor of the new NOAA report, Twila Moon, deputy lead scientist and science communication liaison at the National Snow and Ice Data Center.",
      "\u201cThe Arctic is in sort of a new regime, not a new normal, of course, but it\u2019s decidedly different than it was even just a couple of decades ago,\u201d she said.",
      "Overall, the Arctic is becoming a greener landscape with more extreme precipitation and less snow and ice, according to the report. The effects of that transformation are increasingly apparent closer to American homes, as fires in the Arctic send smoke to populated areas and as melting ice raises sea levels, scientists said.",
      "\u201cThese issues are not not just staying in the Arctic, right \u2014 they\u2019re impacting all of us,\u201d said Brendan Rogers, an associate scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center, in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, who studies permafrost and contributed to the report.",
      "This year\u2019s report includes a detailed accounting of how the carbon cycle is changing in the Arctic. Scientists have been closely watching what happens when permafrost melts, releasing potent greenhouse gases as it thaws and decomposes.",
      "\u201cThe permafrost region contains about twice as much carbon as is in the atmosphere now and about three times as much carbon as in the aboveground biomass of all the world\u2019s forests, so it\u2019s a lot of carbon that\u2019s at stake here,\u201d Rogers said.",
      "He added that permafrost regions have \u201cbeen carbon sinks for millennia, on average, largely because of cold temperatures and frozen soils.\u201d A carbon sink, by definition, absorbs and captures more carbon dioxide than it releases. But now, Rogers said, such regions have instead become a source of greenhouse gas emissions as they thaw and release that carbon and methane into the atmosphere.",
      "Wildfires are also contributing to Arctic emissions. Last year, wildfires burned more than twice as much area in the region as in any previous year \u2014 exceeding the emissions from Canada\u2019s economic activity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s roughly three times the amount from all other Canadian sectors,\u201d Rogers said of Canada\u2019s total wildfire emissions. \u201cIt\u2019s higher than in any other country\u2019s annual emissions except for China, the U.S., India and Russia.\u201d",
      "Wildfire forced the evacuation of Yellowknife, the capital of Canada\u2019s Northwest Territories, last year. About 19,000 people had to flee the city, which is in an area with discontinuous permafrost.",
      "Temperature records are organized by Arctic water year, so the most recent one ran from October 2023 through September 2024. Every September, scientists measure the extent of Arctic sea ice at its seasonal minimum.",
      "This year, sea ice was the sixth-lowest in the 45 years since satellites began measuring; sea ice extents have decreased about 50% since the 1980s. Meanwhile, the Arctic tundra was the second-greenest since records began in 2000, indicating that more shrubs had taken root and expanded into new terrain.",
      "Measurements of Arctic permafrost, which are taken from boreholes drilled below the surface, had higher average temperatures than in all but one previous year.",
      "\u201cThere are many metrics in which we\u2019re just seeing this consistently extreme and near extreme,\u201d Moon said."

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 17:28:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Many servers are relying less on tips and more on rising wages as diners\u2019 gratuities trail inflation \u2014 despite all the complaints about \"tipflation.\"",
    "story": [
      "Diners are pulling back on tipping, but waiters and table bussers are still coming out narrowly ahead.",
      "From January 2020 to September this year, base wages \u2014 what staffers get paid directly by their bosses, before any tips \u2014 jumped 66%, according to findings released Tuesday by private-sector payroll processor ADP. Gratuities rose only 23%. The study analyzed the paychecks of nearly 100,000 tip earners at full-service restaurants nationwide.",
      "Restaurant workers earned a median hourly pay of $23.88 from wages and tips combined as of September, up 28% since January 2020. Because consumer prices rose 22% during that same period, the data shows these workers\u2019 overall income growth beat inflation by 6 percentage points \u2014 while their tips outpaced it by just 1.",
      "A separate report released Tuesday by the payments processor Toast found tips at full-service restaurants have been roughly flat since June. They averaged $21.48 per hour as of September, only 58 cents more than the same time a year earlier \u2014 but about 7 cents less when adjusted for inflation.",
      "Like many recent economic trends, restaurant workers\u2019 pay gains are closely linked to the pandemic: Operators hiked wages to coax workers back as they reopened and found they generally couldn\u2019t lower wages once they\u2019d raised them, said Nela Richardson, ADP\u2019s chief economist.",
      "Many industry staffers \u201cwere able to aggressively see base salaries increase,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lot more negotiation power for these workers over time.\u201d",
      "Today, more than 57% of the median-earning restaurant worker\u2019s income comes from tips \u2014 still a big chunk but down from nearly 65% in January 2020, ADP found. That falling share could matter for debates around whether to cut taxes on tips, an idea that drew bipartisan support on the campaign trail even as broader minimum wage battles heat up.",
      "In the meantime, the findings are a corrective to widespread complaints about so-called tipflation, with consumers increasingly being asked \u2014 often by automated prompts on the screens of payment processors \u2014\u00a0to tip when they may or may not feel it\u2019s warranted. But despite an early, modest uptick in tipping during the pandemic recovery, many people have consistently shown no difficulty declining requests to add gratuities.",
      "In fact, consumers have said at least since this summer that they\u2019re pulling back on how often they tip workers like waiters, hairstylists and drivers. A new Wells Fargo survey finds only half of Americans plan to give holiday tips or gifts to service workers this season.",
      "The tipping slowdown comes even as restaurants ease up on hiking menu prices and lean into discounts to keep luring guests to tables and drive-thrus. Inflation overall has settled just above 2% as 2024 winds down, far below its peak north of 9% in June 2022. But as consumers\u2019 tipping habits have evolved in recent years, so have restaurant owners\u2019 pay offers and lawmakers\u2019 rules governing them.",
      "\u201cWorkers have been winning in the marketplace,\u201d said Saru Jayaraman, president of One Fair Wage, an advocacy group that campaigns for higher base pay. \u201cWinning in the marketplace has resulted in us being able to win in policy.\u201d",
      "Jayaraman cited Michigan, where the state Supreme Court last summer cleared the way for a minimum wage hike, from $10.33 to $12.48 to take effect in February 2025. At least 26 states and Washington, D.C., have implemented minimum wage hikes over roughly the last year, according to the Economic Policy Institute, while 20 have raised their tipped wage.",
      "The tipped wage, also known as a \u201csubminimum\u201d wage, allows tip earners to be paid a lower hourly rate but requires employers to cover any shortfalls whenever gratuities don\u2019t add up to either the $7.25 federal pay floor or a higher statewide one. Michigan\u2019s new law gradually raises the state subminimum until it\u2019s phased out in 2029.",
      "\u201cMichigan was the biggest win this year,\u201d Jayaraman said. \u201cI would say we\u2019re on a roll.\u201d Advocates have notched similar victories recently in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago, and Jayaraman said her group\u2019s next big target is Illinois, where a bill to eliminate the state\u2019s subminimum wage has been working its way through the legislature.",
      "To be sure, most full-service restaurant workers still rely heavily on tips for their income, and industry operators largely want to keep it that way. Many argue that their labor costs have already surged unsustainably \u2014 a reality the ADP findings appear to back up \u2014 especially squeezing small restaurants that run on thin margins. Still, Arizona voters last month soundly defeated an industry-backed ballot measure that would have slashed the minimum wage as long as tips hit a designated new threshold.",
      "ADP found subminimum pay rules have indeed kept workers afloat at times when gratuities collapsed, just as the system is designed. In the first half of 2020, \u201cwhen tips dried up during pandemic lockdown, base wages rose, thanks to laws that require employers to make up for the loss of tipped wages,\u201d the researchers wrote. But \u201cas tips recovered, base wages fell quickly to pre-recession levels. A year later, base wages spiked again, just not enough to overtake tips.\u201d",
      "It remains to be seen how the decline in gratuities\u2019 share of industry workers\u2019 income might affect any move to eliminate taxes on tips, as President-elect Donald Trump has promised. Richardson said the impact of the proposal \u2014 which service workers and labor groups didn\u2019t rank too highly during the campaign season \u2014 would depend on the details.",
      "\u201cWhat we can say is that the base has now become a more impactful part of overall compensation for restaurant workers,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be really meaningful for a whole host of reasons.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (Dec. 10, 2024, 2:15 p.m. ET):\u00a0A previous version of this article misstated the time period for restaurant workers\u2019 66% wage growth. The increase occurred from January 2020 to this September, not from January 2019."

    "summary": "Small-business owners say their Covid disaster loans were wrongly deemed delinquent or in default as a result of errors by the Small Business Administration.",
    "story": [
      "When the Covid pandemic shut down his entertainment booking agency, Sleeping Giant Music, in 2020, Freddie Harb faced financial ruin. With concerts and live events largely on hold, the San Diego businessman said, he turned to the U.S. Small Business Administration in case he needed help making payroll. Like nearly 4 million other small-business owners, he received what\u2019s called an \u201ceconomic injury disaster loan.\u201d",
      "But when Harb repeatedly tried to repay the loan, records show, his payments were never taken by the agency. Three years later, he learned he was in default and his business was in collections.",
      "\u201cI wish I never got that loan,\u201d Harb said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s been a total nightmare.\u201d",
      "Navigating the SBA\u2019s Covid disaster loan program has become similarly agonizing for several other small-business owners who, like Harb, say their loans were wrongly deemed delinquent or in default as a result of the agency\u2019s own internal accounting and processing errors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a complete s--- show,\u201d said Trevor Curran, who co-runs Aurora Consulting, a Connecticut-based firm that has helped dozens of small-business owners manage and obtain SBA loans. \u201cDysfunctional internal systems, incompetent processing, bad communications.\u201d",
      "Along with the added stress and wasted time trying to fix mistakes, several business owners accused of default have faced real financial consequences due to the agency\u2019s alleged blunders, including garnished or withheld Social Security checks and tax refunds, intercepted Medicaid payments, and files sent to private collectors who\u2019ve flagged delinquencies on credit reports, Curran said.",
      "An official for the Treasury Department, the agency charged with collecting on defaulted loans for the federal government, did not answer questions about specific collection methods but said they are used as a last resort.",
      "In an emailed statement, the SBA said it couldn\u2019t comment on individual loans for privacy reasons. But a spokesperson said the agency made a number of improvements to its payment system last year. It had also undertaken \u201csignificant outreach to every borrower as their loan payments begin and as loans become delinquent,\u201d the spokesperson said. To date, that has meant more than 115 million phone calls, over 16 million emails and nearly 1.7 million USPS letters, the statement added."

      "In a statement, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung called the filing \"a pathetic attempt to salvage the remains of an unconstitutional and politically motivated hoax.\"",
      "Trump's attorneys have argued he already has immunity because there \u201cis no material difference between President Trump\u2019s current status after his overwhelming victory in the national election and that of a sitting President following inauguration.\u201d They say the indictment against him on felony criminal charges and his subsequent jury conviction should be thrown out on immunity grounds.",
      "Judge Juan Merchan indefinitely postponed Trump's sentencing last month so both sides could present their arguments on the issue.",
      "In Tuesday's filing, the district attorney's office said, \"At most, defendant should receive temporary accommodations during his presidency to prevent this criminal case from meaningfully interfering with his official decision-making.\"",
      "Prosecutors presented a number of possible ways forward, including staying Trump's sentencing until after he's out of office.",
      "\"To be sure, the People do not dispute that presidential immunity requires accommodation during a President\u2019s time in office. But the extreme remedy of dismissing the indictment and vacating the jury verdict is not warranted in light of multiple alternative accommodations that would fully address the concerns raised by presidential immunity,\" their filing said.",
      "A stay, they said, would exempt Trump \"from any immediate obligations in this case during his time in office, while at the same time respecting the public interest in upholding the rule of law and preserving the meaningful aspects of the criminal process that have already taken place.\"",
      "The DA's office also noted that Trump has already said he'd appeal any sentence, and that in New York, \"it is routine for appeals to be decided years after sentencing even without a formal stay of proceedings.\"",
      "Prosecutors also noted that Trump has already gotten the sentencing postponed for several months.",
      "\"Here, defendant can hardly complain about a delay in sentencing when he has affirmatively sought such delay \u2014 both before and after his reelection,\" the filing said.",
      "The judge could also alleviate some of Trump's worries by deciding he won't sentence him to any time behind bars, prosecutors said.",
      "The filing said \"many of defendant\u2019s concerns stem from the possibility that he will face 'potential incarceration,'\" the filing said. \"Here, however, because defendant has no prior criminal convictions and was convicted of Class E felonies, this Court is not required to impose a sentence of incarceration at all, and could even impose an unconditional discharge.\"",
      "That type of \"limitation on the range of available sentences would further diminish any impact on defendant\u2019s presidential decision making without going so far as to discard the indictment and jury verdict altogether,\" the filing said.",
      "The DA also presented a novel alternative, suggesting Merchan could use a mechanism known as abatement that is practiced in Alabama and some other states when a defendant dies before sentencing.",
      "Under the so-called 'Alabama' rule, \"when a defendant dies after he is found guilty, but before the conviction becomes final through the appellate process, the court places in the record of the case a notation to the effect that the conviction removed the presumption of innocence but was neither affirmed nor reversed on appeal because the defendant died,\" the DA's office explained, saying it essentially \"abates the criminal proceedings without vacating the underlying conviction or dismissing the indictment.\"",
      "Although abatement is not currently used in New York, prosecutors argued it presents a solution where, as here, there are concerns about finality and punishment.",
      "It's unclear when the judge will rule on the motions to dismiss.",
      "Trump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment his then-lawyer Michael Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the closing days of the 2016 election.",
      "Daniels claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, which he denies.",
      "In their court filings, Trump's attorneys said the DA should follow the lead of special counsel Jack Smith, who moved to dismiss his two federal criminal cases against Trump following his election win.",
      "The DA's filing noted there are significant differences between their case and Smith's cases, including that Smith's cases had not gone to trial.",
      "Cheung said, \"This lawless case should have never been brought, and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed, as President Trump must be allowed to continue the Presidential Transition process, and execute the vital duties of the presidency, unobstructed by the remains of this, or any other, Witch Hunt.\""

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 16:50:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The Trump-era investigations into leaks of  classified information were far broader than previously known, according to a report by the DOJ's internal watchdog.",
    "story": [
      "Seeking to investigate leaks of classified information, the Trump Justice Department in 2017 and 2018 secretly obtained phone and text message logs of 43 congressional staffers and two members of Congress in a far broader probe than previously known, according to a new report by the department\u2019s internal watchdog.",
      "The report by Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that the DOJ didn\u2019t act with political motives, but failed to take sufficient account of constitutional separation of powers by seizing communications records of staffers and lawmakers \u2014 and making them subjects of a criminal investigation \u2014 only because they had lawful access to state secrets through their jobs.",
      "Prosecutors obtained the records using subpoenas and other legal processes to third-party providers, including Apple, and attached gag orders to prevent the companies from notifying the customers. The fact of the seizures had\u00a0previously been reported, but the IG revealed new details about the broad scope of the effort.",
      "Separately, the IG report released Tuesday found that the Justice Department violated its own policies in the way it secretly obtained phone and text records from reporters in the same leak investigations, which related to the FBI\u2019s probe of suspected Trump campaign coordination with Russia.",
      "The seizures of the records from reporters from The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN had previously been\u00a0reported, and the Biden Justice Department stiffened its guidelines on the issue, which previously had been updated in 2014 and 2015 after earlier revelations of secret seizures of news media records.",
      "Although then-Attorney General Bill Barr personally approved the news media subpoenas in 2020, a committee that had been set up to review any such moves was not consulted, as policy required, the report said. Barr did not cooperate with the IG inquiry, the report added.",
      "\u201cWe were troubled that these failures occurred only a few years after this overhaul,\u201d the inspector general\u2019s summary said.",
      "The records obtained included phone and message logs showing who was communicating with whom, but not the content of the communications.",
      "Two California Democrats \u2014 Sen. Adam Schiff, who was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Eric Swalwell, who was a member of that committee \u2014 previously acknowledged having been targeted by the records seizures.",
      "The IG report comes as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office amid calls by some of his advisers to bypass the Justice Department\u2019s traditional separation from the president.",
      "The leak investigations did not result in criminal charges. Given the 10-year statute of limitations for some of the alleged crimes, they could be reopened by the new administration.",
      "The person Trump says he wants to make FBI director, Kash Patel, has specifically\u00a0vowed\u00a0to go after reporters. Patel was among the congressional staffers whose records were seized in the leak investigation, according to a lawsuit he filed.",
      "The Justice Department\u2019s new policy requiring officials to notify a news organization if they decide to subpoena reporter phone records except in emergency circumstances could easily be repealed by the new administration.",
      "\u201cThe decision by the Department to seek the non-content communications records of Members of Congress and congressional staffers in media leak investigations implicated the constitutional rights and authorities of a co-equal branch of government,\u201d the IG report said, adding that it \u201crisks chilling Congress\u2019 ability to conduct oversight of the executive branch.\u201d",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., described the revelations in the report as \"beyond disturbing.\"",
      "\"As these abuses demonstrate, there are few guardrails preventing a lone prosecutor or the Attorney General, the Department of Justice or even state or local law enforcement from spying on Congress and threatening our constitutional system of checks and balances,\" Wyden said in a statement.\u00a0\"It is particularly concerning that the Department of Justice hoodwinked a judge into signing off on secret surveillance on both Democrats and Republicans in Congress.\""

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 21:35:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The House task force investigating the assassination attempts against Donald Trump recommended that the Secret Service scale back the president and other top U.S. officials.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The House task force that investigated the assassination attempts against Donald Trump published its final report on Tuesday, making dozens of recommendations including that the Secret Service should record all radio transmissions and scale back protection of foreign leaders to focus on protecting the president and other top U.S. officials.",
      "The 180-page report includes 25 recommendations specifically related to the July 13 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, where a gunman\u2019s bullet grazed Trump\u2019s ear during a campaign rally. It also includes 11 general recommendations for the Secret Service.",
      "\u201cThe Task Force found that the tragic and shocking events in Butler, Pennsylvania were preventable and should not have happened. There was not, however, a singular moment or decision that allowed Thomas Matthew Crooks to nearly assassinate the former President,\u201d the 13-member committee wrote in the report. \u201cThe various failures in planning, execution, and leadership on and before July 13, 2024, and the preexisting conditions that undermined the effectiveness of the human and material assets deployed that day, coalesced to create an environment in which the former President \u2014 and everyone at the campaign event \u2014 were exposed to grave danger.\"",
      "The task force, led by Chairman Mike Kelly, R-Pa., and Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., praised how the Secret Service prevented a second attack on Trump later in the year in Florida: \u201cConversely, the events that transpired on September 15, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Florida, demonstrated how properly executed protective measures can foil an attempted assassination.\u201d",
      "Among the recommendations, the bipartisan panel said the Secret Service should record all radio transmissions, which did not happen on July 13 in Butler. \u201cThe absence of radio logs or recordings significantly limits the ability to reconstruct events for either investigative or evaluative purposes,\u201d the report stated.",
      "And the panel recommended that Congress, the Homeland Security Department and the U.S. Secret Service should \u201cconsider the protective role the USSS plays for foreign leaders and consider whether such duties can be transferred or abrogated in order to focus on the USSS\u2019s primary duty: to protect the President and other critical U.S. leaders.\u201d",
      "The assassination task force also said the Secret Service should consider additional staffing or flexible posts \u201cfor high pressure moments\u201d to allow the agency to adapt to evolving situations; provide more \u201crobust\u201d training for non-Secret Service personnel who are on site assisting the USSS; and develop and formalize a process to deal with USSS conflicts with the staff of protectees.",
      "\u201cOver the course of our investigation, several members of the Secret Service expressed frustrations in negotiating with staff, regardless of political party or protectee,\u201d the report stated.",
      "The task force said it was provided access to 18,000 documents and interviewed dozens of witnesses but added that the FBI provided the group with access to only 81 out of more than 1,000 witness interview summaries.",
      "The task force said it identified multiple \u201cdecision points\u201d that, if handled differently, could have prevented gunman Thomas Crooks from firing eight shots at the Butler rally.",
      "Failing to secure a high-risk area next to the Butler rally venue \u2014 the American Glass Research (AGR) grounds and building complex \u2014 allowed Crooks to evade law enforcement, climb on the roof of the complex and open fire, the task force said.",
      "The Secret Service also did not give clear guidance to state and local partners about which entity was responsible for securing the area, the task force said. Concerns about a lack of manpower were raised but not properly addressed, the group said, and local sniper teams stationed on the AGR property believed they were responsible for watching the rally venue and crowd and not the area outside the secured perimeter.",
      "\u201cThe failures that led to the tragic events of July 13 were not entirely isolated to the campaign event itself, or the days preceding it. Preexisting issues in leadership and training created an environment in which the specific failures identified above could occur,\u201d the task force wrote.",
      "\u201cSecret Service personnel with little to no experience in advance planning roles were given significant responsibility, despite the July 13 event being held at a higher-risk outdoor venue with many line of sight issues, in addition to specific intelligence about a long-range threat,\u201d the task force said.",
      "\u201cFurther, some of the Secret Service agents in significant advance planning roles did not clearly understand the delineation of their responsibilities.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Welcome to the online version of\u00a0From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, national political correspondent Steve Kornacki breaks down how New Jersey could provide an early test for Donald Trump's coalition. Plus, senior national political reporter Sahil Kapur finds that senators from both parties are skeptical of Trump's recent call for a deal on Dreamers.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "A blue state could provide an early test for the Trump coalition",
      "One of the biggest gains Donald Trump notched this year came in what has been one of the bluest states in the country: New Jersey. The incoming president lost the Garden State to Kamala Harris by 6 points, a double-digit improvement from his 16-point margin of defeat against Joe Biden in 2020.",
      "Key to Trump\u2019s expanded support were sizable gains with Hispanic voters, part of a national trend that was even more pronounced in New Jersey, where just over 1 in 5 residents are Hispanic. He also made notable strides with Asian American voters and with Muslim and Arab American voters in a few pockets of the state, while boosting his already strong standing in Orthodox Jewish areas \u2014 again, all consistent patterns seen throughout the country.",
      "A major question that emerges from the 2024 election is whether Republicans can maintain this new demographic coalition \u2014 and build on it \u2014 without Trump himself being on the ballot. This positions New Jersey\u2019s upcoming 2025 gubernatorial contest as a potential early test.",
      "The magnitude of some of the shifts within New Jersey this year is staggering. In all six of the major cities or towns where Hispanics account for more than 70% of the population, the margin moved at least 20 points in Trump\u2019s direction compared to 2020. And it\u2019s even more dramatic compared to 2016.",
      "Increased Hispanic support for Trump has also made the state\u2019s largest city, Newark, somewhat less of a vote bank for Democrats. Nearly half of the city\u2019s 305,000 residents are Black, but the Hispanic population has been growing and now accounts for nearly 40% of Newark\u2019s population. Trump was still crushed in the city this year, losing it to Kamala Harris by 58 points, but that\u2019s actually a significant improvement from the 85-point loss he suffered when he first ran in 2016.",
      "A similar story is unfolding in the town of Palisades Park in North Jersey, home to one of the highest concentrations of Korean Americans in the country. Trump lost Palisades Park, which is 63% Asian American, by just 5 points in November, compared to 22 points in 2020 and 32 points in 2016.",
      "And then there\u2019s Lakewood, home to one of the largest Orthodox Jewish communities outside Israel. The township\u2019s population has more than doubled, from 60,000 in 2000 to nearly 140,000 in last year\u2019s census estimate, with no slowdown in sight. It\u2019s become a major source of GOP support statewide, one that Trump has taken to new heights. When he first ran in 2016, Trump carried Lakewood by 50 points. This November, he drove that number up to 75 points.",
      "In New Jersey\u2019s 2025 gubernatorial race, Democrats will obviously be hoping that the demographic inroads Trump made are Trump-specific. And they do have at least some reason for optimism: In the state\u2019s race for an open U.S. Senate this year, Democrat Andy Kim overperformed Harris in all of these places. In Passaic, for example, he defeated his Republican opponent by 6 points \u2014 a net 13-point improvement over Harris.",
      "But Republicans can also take heart that, even as Kim ran ahead of Harris, his support level in these communities still tended to be significantly lower than how Democrats fared pre-Trump.",
      "It will make all of these places worth keeping a close eye on as the governor\u2019s race unfolds.",
      "Senators are skeptical of Trump\u2019s call for a bipartisan deal on Dreamers",
      "When President-elect Donald Trump told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he\u2019s interested in cutting a deal with Democrats to protect Dreamers brought to the U.S. at a young age, some senators felt a tinge of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.",
      "\u201cWe have to do something about the Dreamers because these are people that have been brought here at a very young age. And many of these are middle-aged people now. They don\u2019t even speak the language of their country,\u201d Trump told moderator Kristen Welker. \u201cI will work with the Democrats on a plan.\u201d",
      "When asked about Trump\u2019s remarks, leading Senate Republicans didn\u2019t close the door to a deal \u2014 but they did sound a note of skepticism about the prospects.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see. The sweet spot on immigration reform has eluded us a number of times. But obviously if there is a bipartisan willingness to take on that issue, then I\u2019m certainly open to what we can do,\u201d said incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. \u201cIt\u2019d be better long term if we could come up with some legislative solutions, but in the last few administrations, everything\u2019s been done by executive action. So it\u2019s going to take something to break that logjam.\u201d",
      "Trump used similar rhetoric during his first term, but his actions told a different story. As president in 2017, he sought to end the DACA program that protected undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children from deportation. And in 2018, when Sens. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., and Angus King, I-Maine, cut a bipartisan deal to give Dreamers legal status while giving Trump money for his border wall, Trump\u2019s White House successfully fought to kill the deal because it didn\u2019t also curtail family-based immigration.",
      "Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who sponsored the original Dream Act in 2001, said he was \u201clistening closely\u201d to Trump\u2019s comments on the matter Sunday and welcomed talks.",
      "\u201cMy ears perked up. After 23 years, I\u2019m ready,\u201d he said. \u201cAnytime, anywhere \u2014 let\u2019s sit down.\u201d",

    "summary": "Democratic senators pressed Dr. Mehmet Oz on his past \"advocacy for Medicare privatization\" after Donald Trump picked him to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Key Democratic senators are demanding answers from Mehmet Oz on his \"previous advocacy for Medicare privatization,\" referring to his call in 2020 for putting all seniors into private insurance plans under Medicare Advantage.",
      "They're seeking clarity from the physician and TV personality known as \"Dr. Oz\" in a letter Tuesday, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., after President-elect Donald Trump picked him to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).",
      "\"In the wake of that nomination, we write regarding our concerns about your advocacy for the elimination of Traditional Medicare and your deep financial ties to private health insurers,\" reads the letter, which was first obtained by NBC News.",
      "The letter was co-signed by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who is set to become the ranking member of the Finance Committee, and five other Democrats in Congress.",
      "The Finance Committee oversees the CMS nomination and its members, which include Warren, will get to question Oz. The letter serves as a preview of what Oz will face during the confirmation process, at least from Democrats. Republicans will hold a 53-47 seat majority and need 50 senators to confirm a nomination, meaning Democrats couldn't derail the pick without persuading at least four Republicans to vote against him.",
      "The Democrats referred to a 2020 opinion piece that Oz co-wrote calling for putting all Americans into Medicare Advantage, effectively replacing the traditional Medicare program in which the government directly insures Americans 65 and older in tandem with private insurance plans.",
      "\"Indeed, private insurers that run the Medicare Advantage program drastically overcharge for care,\" the senators wrote, citing analysis from the nonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Committee.",
      "In 2022, when Oz unsuccessfully ran for Senate in Pennsylvania, he offered a more modest platform that didn\u2019t call for ending traditional Medicare, although he maintained his support for boosting Medicare Advantage. \u201cWe can expand Medicare Advantage plans,\" he wrote in an AARP questionnaire, calling the plans \"popular among seniors\" and arguing they \"provide quality care\" with the right cost incentives.",
      "The lawmakers in the letter sounded skeptical.",
      "\"Your advocacy for eliminating the Traditional Medicare program and replacing it with Medicare Advantage also raises questions about your own financial conflicts of interest,\" the Democrats wrote in the letter. \"In your financial disclosures from your 2022 Senate run, you reported owning over $550,000 of stock in UnitedHealth, the largest private insurer in Medicare Advantage and largest employer of physicians in the nation.\"",
      "\"The company is currently under a sprawling antitrust investigation by the Department of Justice \u2014 including for its role in aggressively upcoding Medicare Advantage enrollees to secure higher payments from CMS \u2014 and has been sued on multiple occasions for Medicare fraud. Under your plan, UnitedHealth\u2019s revenue from Medicare Advantage would roughly double to $274 billion annually.\"",
      "UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was killed last week in a shooting that has captured the nation's attention.",
      "The Democratic lawmakers asked Oz a series of questions, including whether he'll \"continue to support policies that would eliminate Traditional Medicare\" if confirmed to lead CMS and whether he'll \"commit to opposing any and all efforts to privatize or cut Medicare.\"",
      "They also asked if he'll \"commit to fully divesting of any and all financial holdings related to the insurance industry if you are confirmed as Administrator.\"",
      "Trump's transition team didn't immediately return a request for comment."

      "President-elect Donald Trump mocked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau overnight as the \"governor\" of the \"Great State of Canada\" after recently warning of potential tariffs on the country.",
      "\"It was a pleasure to have dinner the other night with Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada,\" Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social account at just after midnight Tuesday. \"I look forward to seeing the Governor again soon so that we may continue our in depth talks on Tariffs and Trade, the results of which will be truly spectacular for all!\"",
      "Reached for comment on the president-elect's quip, Trump spokesman Steven Cheung only said, \"It's so good.\"",
      "Trudeau\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump has recently joked that Canada should become the 51st state, even suggesting it directly to Trudeau during their dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Fox News reported, citing two people at the table who heard the discussion.",
      "Speaking to NBC's \"Meet the Press\" host Kristen Welker last week, Trump made a similar suggestion while discussing how his plan to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico would make the U.S. \"rich,\" characterizing the U.S.-Canada trade deficit a form of subsidy.",
      "\"We\u2019re subsidizing Canada to the tune over $100 billion a year. We\u2019re subsidizing Mexico for almost $300 billion. We shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 why are we subsidizing these countries? If we\u2019re going to subsidize them, let them become a state,\" he said in the interview which aired on Sunday.",
      "Trudeau said Monday that Canada would, \u201cas we did eight years ago, respond to unfair tariffs,\u201d according to the Associated Press.",
      "Trump hosted Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago on Nov. 30, with the president-elect saying on Truth Social that they had a \"very productive meeting\" where they discussed addressing the fentanyl and drug crisis, illegal immigration and \"fair trade deals.\"",
      "Trudeau told reporters afterward in West Palm Beach, Florida, that he had an \u201cexcellent\u201d conversation with Trump, but did not take any further questions.",
      "Last week, the Premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, was asked on Fox News about Trump's reported joke about Canada joining the U.S.",
      "Ford complimented Trump\u2019s sense of humor. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny comment. I guess he\u2019s still upset that, you know, in 1812, we burnt down your White House, and he\u2019s holding a grudge after 212 years,\u201d said Ford.",
      "Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., joked earlier this month that he would be supportive of Canada becoming part of America.",
      "\"Trump has suggested that Canada become the 51st state in our union,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"Does that mean that we can adopt the Canadian health care system and guarantee health care to all, lower the cost of prescription drugs, and spend 50% less per capita on health care?\""

    "story": [
      "The New Zealand government said Tuesday that it would ban greyhound racing starting in 2026, citing concerns over the rate of injuries and fatalities among racing dogs.",
      "\u201cDespite significant progress made by the greyhound racing industry in recent years, the percentage of dogs being injured remains persistently high and the time has come to make a call in the best interest of the animals,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister and Racing Minister Winston Peters told reporters.",
      "Commercial greyhound racing remains legal in only a few countries around the world, including the United States, Australia, Britain and Ireland.",
      "The industry has come under growing scrutiny in recent years over the treatment of the racing dogs. While Peters acknowledged the efforts the industry had made to improve, he said canine injuries and fatalities remained \u201cunacceptably high.\u201d",
      "Sean Hannan, chairman of Greyhound Racing New Zealand (GRNZ), said the decision was a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d to an industry that had made significant investments in reform.",
      "\u201cWe are extremely disappointed that the government has not recognized the work the industry has done to address areas of concern \u2014 to the extent that it now leads the wider racing industry with its commitment to animal welfare,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis decision is not just about the sport; it affects families, businesses, and communities who have dedicated their lives to caring for and racing greyhounds,\u201d Hannan continued, adding that the industry employs more than 1,000 people.",
      "The government proposed a bill on Tuesday to prevent the unnecessary killing of racing dogs, while legislation to outlaw greyhound racing altogether will be introduced next year, allowing it to be phased out over the next 20 months. Peters said the greyhound racing industry would be able to make submissions on the legislation.",
      "He also said the government would work with animal welfare groups to rehome about 2,900 racing dogs.",
      "Animal welfare groups cheered the government\u2019s decision.",

Thank you for paving the way for these dogs to live a good life,\u201d Dr. Arnja Dale, SPCA\u2019s chief scientific officer, said in a statement. \u201cWe are relieved, and absolutely thrilled, that after years of being given many \u2018last chances,\u2019 GRNZ has been directed to shut this business down.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 00:07:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Top Republicans are divided over the best strategy to advance border, tax, energy and other core components of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s agenda through reconciliation next year.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Top Republicans are divided over the best strategy to advance core components of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s agenda when the party gains a slim majority in Congress next year.",
      "The new Congress will give Trump and Republicans the opportunity to pass major legislation without the need for any Democratic support under a process called \"reconciliation.\" But whether the GOP will try to link all of its top priorities together in a single package early next year or split major issues across two, smaller bills is a major subject of debate among top Republican leaders.",
      "The House\u2019s top tax writer, Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo., is warning fellow Republicans against breaking the agenda up into two bills, in which border security and energy policy would come in the first and an extension of Trump's 2017 tax cut law could come in the second.",
      "Delaying the tax legislation risks jeopardizing it, Smith and his allies warn, so they want one sweeping package.",
      "\u201cMy goal is to make sure we\u2019re successful on making sure Trump\u2019s tax cuts are made permanent and extended. That is my No. 1 focus. And I believe the best strategy to get that is to do one large bill,\u201d Smith told reporters just off the House floor Tuesday.",
      "\u201cPeople above me will make the decision, but I\u2019m telling you: I know how to get votes. I\u2019ve been very successful getting votes. I know the House on tax policy better than anyone else,\u201d Smith continued. \u201cIf they want to give me the best opportunity to pass the president\u2019s tax plan, make it all in one bill.\u201d",
      "Smith spoke just hours after incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who has been pushing for the two-bill strategy, publicly made his case for it.",
      "\u201cIn my view, it makes sense to move quickly on things we know we can do quickly \u2014 border, defense, energy,\u201d Thune told reporters. \u201cAnd then come back with another package that would address some of the savings that can be achieved through reductions in cost in various agencies and bureaucracies and government programs and then also deal with the expiring Trump tax cuts in a package later this year.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut I think we can do both,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an opportunity to have a couple of different chances at a reconciliation package that would achieve all those objectives.\u201d",
      "Asked by NBC News on Tuesday whether it would be wiser to do tax cuts in the first package, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said that Republicans are still deciding the \u201csequence\u201d and that he plans to discuss reconciliation when he sees Trump this weekend at the Army-Navy football game.",
      "Reconciliation allows Congress to pass party-line policies involving taxes and spending with majority votes, bypassing the Senate's 60-vote requirement for legislation. But with just 53 seats in the Senate and 220 in the House next year, nearly every Republican will need to agree for it to succeed.",
      "Johnson said he didn\u2019t need to be reminded of the political debacle in 2017 when Republicans spent seven months of Trump's first year in office trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act through reconciliation and came up empty.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re having lots of thoughtful discussions about the best play call. ... What we\u2019re deciding right now is the sequence of how we run those plays,\" Johnson said.",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s really important. The House and the Senate have different calculations on how that\u2019s done, but we all have exactly the same priorities,\u201d he said, emphasizing securing the border and staving off tax hikes when some of the Trump tax cuts expire at the end of next year.",
      "Trump indicated Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that there would be two bills. \u201cWe have a lot of other things. I have tax cuts. You know, we\u2019ll be submitting in either the first or second package to Congress the extension of the tax cuts,\u201d he told moderator Kristen Welker. \u201cSo that might very well be in there. Or, or it\u2019ll come sometime after that.\u201d",
      "But Trump has communicated to lawmakers through his two point people on reconciliation \u2014 incoming White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller and Trump's pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought \u2014 that he wants to tackle border security within his first 30 days and leave tax cuts until later, according to a Republican source familiar with the discussions.",
      "Underneath the division are multiple obstacles for Republicans.",
      "First, Senate rules restrict reconciliation bills to matters of taxes and spending. That means regulatory provisions or tougher asylum laws could be stripped out.",
      "Second, Republicans have a paper-thin House majority of 220-215, with no realistic hope of winning Democratic votes. That is likely to shrink further in the early part of Trump\u2019s presidency with the resignation of Matt Gaetz, of Florida, and the expected resignations of Elise Stefanik, of New York, and Mike Waltz, of Florida, who are expected to leave for jobs in the Trump administration.",
      "Corralling nearly every Republican vote will be a daunting task under any circumstance. If one or both packages are projected to add substantially to the debt, it could create a vote-count problem for House GOP leaders.",
      "Conversely, if the GOP breaks up the bills and uses its most valuable \u201cpay-fors\u201d on the first package of border and energy items, it could leave fewer options to limit the deficit impact of the second bill, creating problems securing the votes for it.",
      "Rank-and-file Republicans are also divided over the best approach. Conservative Rep. Warren Davidson, of Ohio, said he wants one package for fiscal year 2025 and another for 2026. But former House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs, of Arizona, is pushing for one sweeping reconciliation package, saying he\u2019s worried Republicans might not even get a crack at a second one later in the year because of unforeseen circumstances.",
      "\u201cWe should be doing the biggest reconciliation package you possibly can conceive of the first time around. I\u2019m not sure you even get the second reconciliation package,\u201d Biggs told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "Asked what would prevent the GOP from getting to a second bite at the apple, Biggs said: \u201cWell, for one thing, you had 30 extra votes in 2017 that you don\u2019t have today.\u201d",
      "Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., said, \u201cOne bill is better than two,\u201d adding that he, Biggs and Johnson were all freshman lawmakers in 2017.",
      "And Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said he\u2019s \u201cstanding with Jason,\" meaning Smith, the Ways and Means chair, and prefers a single package.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t fear doing one package at all, but I think we ought to do it immediately,\u201d Walberg said in an interview. \"I think the American people voted that way: They wanted border control, and they want tax cuts.\u201d",
      "Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., a Ways and Means Committee member, said he doesn\u2019t feel strongly about either approach, predicting that Republicans will find enough savings by cutting \u201cwaste and reckless spending over the last four years\u201d during the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cTwo versus one? I can understand the rationale behind that. You want to get a win upfront,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI can see both sides. I don\u2019t have a particular preference at this point.\u201d"

      "For some Spotify users, the changes to this year\u2019s Wrapped stirred controversy and dampened their excitement. Here\u2019s why.",
      "\u2018What\u2019s the truth?\u2019 Some users say their Wrapped highlighted the wrong songs",
      "The main function of Spotify Wrapped \u2014 independent of the new features that Spotify adds to Wrapped every year \u2014 is to show users their top artists and songs.",

      "TikTok content creator and small business social media manager Jessica Hong, @smallboba on TikTok, tells TODAY.com that although Spotify recognized artists she had on repeat, she did not feel like they plucked her true favorites.",
      "\u201c(Wrapped) didn\u2019t really connect me to the community that it did in past years. And it just felt like it was definitely missing something,\u201d Hong says.",
      "For another perspective on her year in listening, Hong took to stats.fm, a third party platform offering insights into users\u2019 Spotify stats. This app, which has stats available year-round, showed her an entirely different set of songs and artists than her Wrapped did.",
      "\u201cI know my top artist \u2014 in my heart \u2014 is always BTS. Spotify Wrapped said (it was) Still Woozy, but when I used stats.fm, it said BTS, so I\u2019m like, \u2018What\u2019s the truth?\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "Content creator Jo\u00ebl Edelmann on TikTok offered up a theory when reflecting on his own list. \u201cI think Spotify prioritizes big names, because I listen to a lot of smaller ones, and they don\u2019t show up here,\u201d he said in a video.",
      "Spotify has not shared how it tracks listening statistics or the metrics it uses to lead to Wrapped. TODAY.com has reached out to Spotify for comment. An article on the website says the creation of its annual roundup is \u201ctruly art and science working side by side.\u201d",
      "A new AI-centric approach to Wrapped",

      "Content creator Sandra Sanchez, @lavenderxhive on TikTok, tells TODAY.com she felt this year\u2019s Wrapped fell short of doing what she says Spotify Wrapped normally does so well, in part because of the AI feature.",
      "\u201cThe reason Spotify Wrapped has always been so exciting is we get to learn about ourselves and our music taste,\u201d Sanchez says. \u201cThis year, I felt like I didn\u2019t learn anything. With the use of AI, it felt like a lack of personality and joy. It just felt like word salad.\u201d",
      "Ren\u00e9 Sultan, a machine learning engineer who worked on Spotify\u2019s AI for Content Safety initiative throughout summer 2024, shares insight into the creation of the podcast.",

      "Despite criticism of the execution, Sultan thinks Spotify\u2019s use of AI remains consistent with the goal of Wrapped and sets Spotify apart.",
      "\u201cThey are working within their ethos to use AI to connect more with the user. A lot of the time, AI gets used to automate some human processes, but they\u2019re kind of doing the opposite: using AI to connect their users,\u201d he says."

    "summary": "Kelly Clarkson's weight loss is a topic of speculation. The singer said she made diet and exercise changes and has shared previously body and weight struggles.",
    "story": [
      "When it comes to Kelly Clarkson's weight loss journey, the singer has been open with fans about how she's changed her lifestyle in recent years. Some of the ways she's lost weight include walking, eating more protein, and medication to help with how her body processes food.",
      "Clarkson started some of these changes to her diet and exercise routines when she moved to New York City, where she hosts \"The Kelly Clarkson Show.\" She shared in an interview that she has a much more active day-to-day living in the city, which has helped with her weight loss. Around the same time, she also started trying out a high-protein diet, which can help with weight loss by keeping you feeling more full and satisfied.",
      "And the original \"American Idol\" made headlines in May this year when she revealed that she was taking a medication to assist in her weight loss. She explained that she'd had concerns about using such a drug due to problems with her thyroid but eventually decided to try it. She broke the news on her talk show.",
      "RELATED: 18 celebrities who\u2019ve opened up about taking Ozempic or weight-loss drugs",
      "Every time Clarkson makes big appearances, such as at the 2024 Rockefeller Tree Lighting and on the TODAY show in mid-December, fans seem to remark on how the star looks different.",
      "Here's what to know about Kelly Clarkson's weight loss journey based on what she's shared publicly.",
      "What drug is Kelly Clarkson taking to lose weight?",
      "Clarkson did not specify what weight-loss medication she is taking beyond that it is not Ozempic.",
      "She confirmed the rumors during a May episode of \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" when chatting with Whoopi Goldberg, who\u2019s also been open about using Mounjaro, another weight-loss drug.",
      "While the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d winner was initially unsure about trying medication to lose weight, she said she decided to \u201cbecause my blood work got so bad.\"",
      "\u201cMy doctor chased me for like two years, and I was like, \u2018No I\u2019m afraid of it, I already have thyroid problems,\u2019\u201d she explained.",
      "\u201cEveryone thinks it\u2019s Ozempic \u2014 it\u2019s not. It\u2019s something else,\u201d she told Goldberg. \u201cBut it\u2019s something that aids in helping break down the sugar. Obviously my body doesn\u2019t do it right.\u201d",
      "She added that she didn\u2019t notice how much weight she\u2019d gained prior to starting the medication. But catching a glimpse of herself on camera one day prompted her to pause and ask herself \u201cWho the f--k is that?\u201d she recalled.",
      "\"My heaviest, I was like 203, and I\u2019m 5 foot 3 and a half,\" Clarkson continued. \"It\u2019s funny because people assume, \u2018Oh she must\u2019ve been miserable, depressed, whatever,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018No I was not.'\"",
      "\u201cI was never insecure about it, I was happy,\u201d she added.",
      "How did Kelly Clarkson lose weight?",
      "In addition to taking a weight-loss drug, Clarkson has made lifestyle changes for her long-term health.",
      "In January 2024, she credited her move to New York City for helping her get active. In an exclusive interview with People, she revealed that she's lost weight because she's now taking her wellness seriously and walking more.",
      "She did not address her gym routine but said, \u201cWalking in the city is quite the workout.\"",
      "Clarkson chose to relocate her talk show to New York from Los Angeles in 2023. \u201cI was very unhappy in L.A. and had been for several years. I needed a fresh start,\u201d Clarkson told People. California, she said, wasn't good for her mental health.",
      "In New York, she adopted a few other wellness trends, too. \"I\u2019m really into infrared saunas right now. And I just got a cold plunge because everybody wore me down,\" the \"Piece By Piece\" singer added.",
      "As for her diet, Clarkson isn't doing anything extreme.",
      "\u201cI eat a healthy mix,\u201d she told People. \u201cI dropped weight because I\u2019ve been listening to my doctor \u2014\u00a0a couple (of) years I didn\u2019t. And 90% of the time I\u2019m really good at it because a protein diet is good for me anyway. I\u2019m a Texas girl, so I like meat \u2014\u00a0sorry, vegetarians in the world!\"",
      "\u201cBut I still splurge. The other night I had a frozen yogurt with my daughter, and it was magical,\" added the Grammy winner, who shares daughter River Rose, 10, and son Remington, 8, with ex-husband Brandon Blackstock.",
      "Kelly Clarkson's thyroid and other health issues",
      "Clarkson has spoken before about her thyroid and autoimmune issues and trying to lose weight to address them.",
      "For example, she changed her diet and ended up losing about 37 pounds,\u00a0she told TODAY\u2019s Hoda Kotb in 2018.",
      "\u201cI know the industry loves the weight gone, but for me, it wasn\u2019t really the weight,\u201d Clarkson said at the time.",
      "Back then, to lose the weight, Clarkson focused on a lectin-free diet, she told Extra. Lectins are the proteins that bind carbohydrates. (Talk to a health professional before making any major changes to your diet, such as removing carbs.)",
      "Clarkson read a book about lectins and cut them out of her diet which meant no legumes, beans, whole grains, dairy and certain veggies.",
      "\"I literally read this book, and I did it for this autoimmune disease that I had and I had a thyroid issue, and now all my levels are back up,\" she said during the interview. \"Literally, I haven\u2019t worked out at all.\"",
      "During a January 2024 episode of her talk show, she revealed\u00a0she was prediabetic.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t shocked,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cI was a tiny bit overweight. ... They were like, \u2018You\u2019re prediabetic. You\u2019re right on the borderline.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018But I\u2019m not there yet.\u2019\u201d",
      "Two years after finding out, she decided to change her lifestyle habits.",
      "Having\u00a0prediabetes\u00a0means your blood sugar levels are higher than normal but still lower than the range for Type 2 diabetes, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. Exercise and a healthy diet can help reduce the risk of it progressing.",
      "Kelly Clarkson's weight struggles",
      "Throughout her years in Hollywood, the \"American Idol\" star has had to deal with a lot of commentary about her size.",
      "She told Glamour UK in 2020 that being thin doesn't always give her more confidence, adding that she got her coaching role on \"The Voice\" after gaining some weight.",
      "\u201cI got on the No. 1 television show at my heaviest point, because it was right after I had kids, and it was like they didn\u2019t care,\u201d Clarkson said.",
      "\u201cPaul (Telegdy, chairman of NBC Entertainment) hired me from NBC because he loved my personality, he loved that I connect with people and I\u2019m really raw and real. It had nothing to do with my sex appeal or my look aesthetically. It had to do with me as a person. I think it\u2019s really up to artists to force people to have that mentality.\u201d",
      "Clarkson and TODAY's Jenna Bush Hager bonded over weight struggles when Jenna and her twin sister, Barbara Pierce Bush, appeared on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" in November 2023.",
      "During the conversation, Clarkson showed a photo of Jenna and Barbara dressed identically as kids.",
      "\u201cThose drop waist things were popular,\u201d Jenna said of the dresses she and her sister were wearing in the pic. Clarkson interjected, \u201cWhich is not good for girls with curves later on.\u201d",
      "After Jenna remarked that she and Barbara \u201cwere chubby\u201d as children, Barbara agreed: \u201cWell, there was a stage.\"",
      "Clarkson then gave Jenna a high-five, joking, \u201cI\u2019ve had many stages.\u201d"

      "This is when Taylor Swift sits down with just a guitar and a piano to play acoustic versions of two songs \u2014 sometimes mashups, sometimes not \u2014 that change between each show. And fans don\u2019t know what songs she\u2019s chosen that night until the surprise-song set starts.",
      "Swift kicked off the European leg of her \u201cEras Tour\u201d May 9 in Paris, fresh on the heels of releasing her 11th album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d on April 29. While the setlist saw some significant changes \u2014 including the addition of a new era \u2014 Swift upheld her tradition of performing surprise songs.",
      "After returning to the U.S. Oct. 18 for a run of shows in three more cities, Swift closed out the \"Eras Tour\" in Canada on Dec. 8.",
      "Intrepid Swifties keeping record of all the songs Swift has performed noted that, while there are several songs that were played multiple times, there are some tracks from across her 11 albums that the singer did not sing at all during the \"Eras Tour.\" Those include:",
      "\"That's When\"\"Bye Bye Baby\"\"Girl At Home\" \"Ronan\"\"Forever Winter\" \"Soon You'll Get Better\"",

    "summary": "In Syria's capital Damascus the hope of a country freed from its longtime dictator Bashar al Assad was starting to fade at the city's Saydnaya military prison.",
    "story": [
      "DAMASCUS, Syria \u2014 In the outskirts of Syria\u2019s capital Tuesday, the hope of a country freed from its longtime dictator was muddled with the emerging horrors of the Assad regime.",
      "Thousands of people were rushing to labyrinthine prisons, searching for any trace of loved ones they feared had disappeared into their unseen depths.",
      "The most notorious gulag lies in the barren, rocky hills outside the capital, Damascus. Saydnaya\u00a0military prison is a dungeon of tiny, concrete cells nicknamed \u201cthe human slaughterhouse.\u201d NBC News went there Tuesday and found evidence of barbaric conditions \u2014 as well as the desperation of Syrians searching for their loved ones.",
      "During the Assad family\u2019s 50-year rule, a network of facilities like Saydnaya were patrolled by armed guards, ensuring those who went in could not come out. The regime used the prisons to detain, torture and kill tens of thousands of Syrians, some for criticizing the government or other trumped-up allegations, according to rights groups, whistleblowers and global officials.",
      "Now, with Bashar al-Assad and his enforcers gone, the tree-lined entrance to Saydnaya is packed with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of cars. People have come from all over Syria to see if their loved ones are still inside, partly motivated by rumors of a secret wing detaining starving captives.They came armed with pry bars, pickaxes and their bare hands. At one point a bulldozer showed up, all to hack away at the jail\u2019s edifice in the hope of revealing a hidden cache of abductees.",
      "Outside the building itself \u2014 a hulking, brutalist cube in dilapidated off-white \u2014 crowds of mostly men gathered, some of them shouting to ask whether anyone had seen their sons, brothers or uncles believed detained by the regime. One of these men, a self-appointed organizer, called out names from a filthy document apparently recovered from one of the administrative rooms.",
      "These documents littered the floor, a concern for international legal scholars who have stressed the importance of maintaining these records for use as evidence of these crimes.",
      "These places were not secret, but well known among Syrians, documented by rights groups and widely reported in the news media. Nevertheless, Tuesday brought a tableau of intense emotions, with people crying and screaming\u00a0as they saw behind the curtain of their toppled police state for the first time.Inside, concrete cells with white open bars were large enough to accommodate four people at most \u2014 but from the detritus appeared to have been crammed with dozens. Piles of clothes and bedrolls were lit by the smartphone flashlights of civilians combing the decaying maze for clues.",
      "One woman said her son had been missing for a decade. He was accused of being a militant; she said he was a nurse.",
      "In one room stood a large, iron device comprising two flat surfaces, large enough to fit a prisoner, and a mechanism to close them tight. People here called it the \u201cexecution press\u201d \u2014 used to crush inmates to death or to torture them.",
      "Another room featured a large metal pole stretching from one wall to the other. Prisoners would apparently be handcuffed to this with their feet off the ground and beaten. Outside, a man held at least four nooses, one covered in blood, that he said were used to put people to death.",
      "When the Syrian rebels seized Damascus on Sunday, they said they freed dozens of prisoners from Saydnaya, with video appearing to show women reluctant to leave their cells, so disbelieving were they that the tyrant who held them had been ousted.Rumors that the prison contained a secret underground \u201cred wing\u201d drew crowds of more families, as well as the White Helmets search and rescue organization, which dispatched its crews to look for such a hidden complex.",
      "Around 1:30 a.m. local time (5:30 p.m. ET Monday), the White Helmets said there was no evidence of any hidden chamber or rooms, sharing the \u201cprofound disappointment of the families of the thousands who remain missing and whose fates remain unknown.\u201d",
      "Nevertheless, people were still using hand tools to knock through sections of floors and walls, presumably still looking for hatches or doors, when NBC News visited Tuesday.Saydnaya may be the most infamous but it is far from the only place where Assad and Hafez Assad, his predecessor and father,\u00a0visited the darkest horrors upon their own people. The dynasty built and operated a network of detention centers scattered across Syria, according to the human rights group Amnesty International.",
      "The Human Rights Data Analysis Group, an independent scientific human rights organization based in San Francisco, has counted at least 17,723 people killed in Syrian custody from 2011 to 2015 \u2014 around 300 every week \u2014 almost certainly a vast undercount, it says.",
      "Prisoners in Saydnaya \u201care regularly tortured, usually through severe beatings and sexual violence,\u201d Amnesty International said in a landmark 2017 report, which drew on survivors\u2019 accounts and other sources. \u201cThey are denied adequate food, water, medicine, medical care and sanitation, which has led to the rampant spread of infection and disease.\u201d",
      "Even during these torture sessions, total \u201csilence is enforced,\u201d it said, contributing to \u201cmany detainees\u201d developing \u201cserious mental illnesses such as psychosis.\u201d All of this seemed \u201cdesigned to inflict maximal physical and psychological suffering. Their apparent goal is to humiliate, degrade, dehumanize and to destroy any sense of dignity or hope,\u201d it said.",
      "Hafez Assad began this policy of systematic and secretive state violence in the 1980s, making an estimated 17,000 Syrians disappear between then and 2000, Amnesty said. But the \u201cgovernment\u2019s violations against detainees have increased drastically in magnitude and severity\u201d since 2011, it added.That was the year Syrians began peacefully protesting against the regime as part of the younger Assad violently crushed the demonstrators, leading to the armed uprising that became the civil war.",
      "The conflict has seen more than 350,000 deaths documented by the United Nations, which says this is \u201ccertainly an undercount.\u201d Now, Syrians hope their country can transition to something that does not involve such loss nor the abuses meted out at Saydnaya.",
      "Richard Engel and Gabe Joselow reported from Damascus and Alexander Smith from London."

    "summary": "Russia is providing sanctuary to Bashar al-Assad, after the swift collapse of the Syrian leader's regime, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "Russia is providing sanctuary to Bashar al-Assad, having transported the former Syrian leader there \u201cin the most secure way possible\u201d after the swift collapse of his regime, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister told NBC News in an exclusive interview Tuesday.",
      "\u201cHe is secured, and it shows that Russia acts as required in such an extraordinary situation,\u201d Sergei Ryabkov said, becoming the first Russian official to confirm Assad\u2019s presence in the country.",
      "\u201cI have no idea what is going on with him right now,\u201d Ryabkov said, adding that it \u201cwould be very wrong for me to elaborate on what happened and how it was resolved.\u201d",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has been dealt a huge blow by the collapse of a regime to which he gave his full support, helping Assad cling to power after Syria descended into civil war and maintain his family\u2019s brutal dynasty, which began in 1971.",
      "And Ryabkov said Russia would continue to support the Syrian leader whose regime has been accused by human rights groups, whistleblowers and former detainees of attacks with chemical weapons and barrel bombs and other war crimes, as well as murder, systematic torture and the enforced disappearance of tens of thousands of people since the 2011 mass uprising, which sparked that conflict.",
      "\u201cRussia is not a party to the convention that established the International Criminal Court,\u201d Ryabkov said when asked if the Kremlin would hand over Assad for trial.",
      "Syria has not joined the court, which is based in the Hague, Netherlands, and has not accepted its jurisdiction. Russia and China blocked an attempt to impose its jurisdiction in 2014. The United States and Israel also do not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC, which has no police to enforce its warrants.",
      "Separately, in March 2023, the court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for \u201cwar crimes\u201d in overseeing the unlawful abduction and deportation of children\u00a0from Ukraine to Russia.",
      "And last month, the ICC issued\u00a0arrest warrants\u00a0for Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0and his former Defense Minister\u00a0Yoav Gallant over alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes in Gaza. Israel\u00a0rejected the charges and the U.S. said it rejected the decision.",
      "Assad \u201cwas accused by the same group of countries and governments that continuously defeat attempts to live their own ways as it happened in Iraq, in Libya and in many more,\u201d Ryabkov said, adding that it was \u201camazing, but it is also very revealing,\u201d that the U.S. \u201cconfigures its reaction and response\u201d depending on whom the court is prosecuting.",
      "Whoever ends up governing Syria, be it the  Hayat Tahrir al-Sham\u00a0(HTS) militant group, which led rebel forces as they stormed across Syria, or someone else, Ryabkov said, Russia \u201cforcefully and strongly\u201d believes that Syria \u201cshould be sovereign, unified and integral.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not have a situation there, hopefully, that will mean separation of parts of Syria from one another,\u201d he added.",
      "He also urged Israel \u201cto seriously consider what is going on in the Golan Heights,\u201d after Netanyahu ordered his military to seize control of the demilitarized and U.N.-patrolled buffer zone with Syria that was established under a 1974 cease-fire agreement. Israel, Ryabkov said, should observe that agreement and it should \u201cnot infringe\u201d on Syria\u2019s territorial integrity.",
      "One thing Russia did share with the U.S. was concerns about the potential for the re-emergence of the Islamic State terrorist group in Syria, he said.\u00a0The U.S. has launched multiple airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria, where it maintains a small force.",
      "On a separate matter, Ryabkov added that the Kremlin would \u201cdefinitely be prepared to consider\u201d another prisoner swap, similar to the one in August that resulted in the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and three other U.S. residents from Russian captivity.",
      "Deals like this required \u201ca multiphased or multistep approach on both sides,\u201d including in some cases, the pardoning of those serving sentences. Several other countries, including Germany and Slovenia, were involved in the deal mediated by Turkey.",
      "While he did not \u201cwant to pre-empt anything,\u201d Ryabkov said such deals help improve the relationship between Russia and the U.S., adding that a new deal would be \"a healthy step forward, especially at the beginning of the next administration.\u201d"

      "U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens is in Beirut, Lebanon, as part of efforts to bring Austin Tice home, a U.S. official with direct knowledge told NBC News. The official added that the government is reaching out to anyone in Syria or the region who can help.",
      "Hadi al-Bahra, president of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, told NBC News that the transitional government would make it a priority to investigate the whereabouts of those who disappeared under the Assad regime.",
      "Marc Tice believes there is every indication that the new leadership is committed to the return of foreign prisoners as the rebel groups have publicly said.",
      "\"It's just as Debra said, a matter of time,\" he said. \"They have to go through a lot of locations and, you know, do a lot of door opening. And we're sure Austin is behind one of those doors.\"",

    "summary": "The Assad regime's fall marks a damaging defeat for Iran, the latest in a string of setbacks that have punctured assumptions about Tehran\u2019s power in the region.",
    "story": [
      "The swift collapse of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s Syrian regime represents a devastating defeat for Iran, the latest in a string of setbacks that have punctured long held assumptions in the West about Tehran\u2019s military prowess.",
      "In recent months, Iran has proved unable to thwart Israeli covert operations from targeting key figures in the regime, defend itself from damaging Israeli airstrikes, or protect an ally next door that was a linchpin in its regional proxy network, dubbed the \u201caxis of resistance.\u201d",
      "For decades, Syria has served as a vital land bridge to Iran\u2019s Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, allowing Tehran to ferry weapons to its partners across the Syrian border. After a mass uprising against Assad in 2011, Russia provided air power for Damascus and Iran propped up the brutal ruler with weapons, cash, Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers and militants from Iranian-backed proxy forces in Lebanon, Iraq and elsewhere.",
      "But when Syrian rebel forces seized Aleppo last month against poorly trained, demotivated Syrian army troops, Iran was caught off guard at a difficult moment, with its military depleted from Israeli air raids and its proxy forces in Lebanon decimated from fighting with Israel, current and former U.S. officials said. As the rebels pressed ahead, there was no concerted effort to stop the advance with Russian warplanes or Iranian-backed proxy forces.",
      "The dramatic events over the weekend marked \u201ca fundamental change in the equation of the entire Middle East,\u201d a senior Biden administration official told reporters on Sunday.\u201cAssad was effectively abandoned because his only friends ... Iran, Hezbollah and Russia, no longer had the capacity to help,\u201d the official added.",
      "Iran\u2019s weakened position has challenged prevailing assumptions in Washington and other capitals about Iran\u2019s power and resilience, as well as expectations about how a direct clash between Israel and Iran would play out, former U.S. intelligence officials and experts said.",
      "\u201cYou have a series of myths that have evaporated over the last year,\u201d said one former U.S. official.",
      "The United States and other governments had feared an Israeli attack on Iran would produce an overwhelming response against Israel by Iran\u2019s proxies. There also was a widespread view that Iran\u2019s vast missile arsenal would deter Israel from ever directly attacking, and if it did, Tehran might overwhelm Israeli air defenses in retaliation.",
      "And there were fears that a direct clash between Iran and Israel would result in an open-ended conflagration that would draw in the United States and other countries.",
      "None of those scenarios came to pass.",
      "Israeli air raids against Iran did not trigger a crippling response from Iran\u2019s proxies in Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq or Yemen. It was unclear whether those proxy forces lacked the means and the will to act more aggressively, or whether Tehran\u2019s leadership was reluctant to confront Israel directly, former officials said.",
      "With crucial help from the United States and its allies, Israel was able to shoot down most of the ballistic missiles and drones launched by Iran. Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia armed and trained by Iran, have proved no match for Israel\u2019s military and intelligence operations, which have killed much of its leadership and penetrated its communications.",
      "Those incorrect assumptions about Iran \u201cshaped and indeed constrained regional and U.S. policy on Iran,\u201d said Norman Roule,\u00a0former senior U.S. intelligence official and senior adviser to United Against Nuclear Iran, a nonprofit that focuses on combating threats posed by Iran.",
      "The loss of Syria as a reliable and subservient ally has likely irreparably damaged Iran\u2019s proxy network, which Tehran viewed as a defensive wall protecting Iran and a way of fighting countries with more powerful conventional militaries, current and former U.S. officials said.",
      "\u201cThe fall of Assad really puts a big question mark around whether the \u2018axis of resistance\u2019 is still feasible,\u201d said Alex Vatanka of the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cIran paid billions in the last two decades to establish this \u2018forward defense\u2019 model \u2014 and for a long time it delivered results,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cBut once under pressure, the model and the Arab partners of Iran have proven to lack the capacity to withstand pressure,\" Vatanka added. \"It began with Hezbollah and now Assad.\"",
      "Mohammad Ali Abtahi, a former vice president of Iran,\u00a0wrote on social media\u00a0shortly before the Assad government collapsed that the fall of the regime \u201cwould be one of the most significant events in the history of the Middle East.\u201d Abtahi added that \u201cresistance in the region would be left without support. Israel would become the dominant force.\u201d",
      "Recent events, including the failure to fend off anti-regime rebel forces in Syria over the past two weeks, have exposed a \u201crot\u201d inside Iran\u2019s military and security apparatus, Roule said.",
      "\u201cStarting with the killing of Soleimani in 2020, Iran faced a series of setbacks and defeats that exposed weaknesses and failures in Iran\u2019s intelligence and security services,\u201d Roule said, referring to Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the leader of the Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Quds Force, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad in January 2020.",
      "\u201cOver the past year, Israel accelerated this rot through its killing of a large number of experienced IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) and Hezbollah officers involved in Syria,\u201d he said.",
      "Those officers had decades of experience in Syria and a network of contacts among the militants in Iran\u2019s proxy network, including Iraqis, Afghans, Pakistanis, Yemenis and others.",
      "\u201cWhen those officers and their \u2018rolodex\u2019 were lost, Iran\u2019s bureaucratic cohesion and efficiency suffered,\u201d Roule said.",
      "Iran\u2019s intelligence services appear incapable of giving their leaders advance warning about direct threats or disrupting hostile covert operations, according to Roule and other analysts.",
      "It was unclear why commanders in the Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Quds Force, which oversees the proxy network and has worked closely with the Syrian army, did not take decisive action to rescue the Assad regime\u2019s forces.\u00a0In both Lebanon and Syria in recent months, Iran has chosen not to deploy its own forces in significant numbers to aid its partners.",
      "Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, \u201chas traditionally refused to allow Iranian forces to risk themselves to protect proxies,\u201d Roule said.",
      "The loss of Syria has undermined the image Iran cultivated about its Quds Force being an elite military unit able to defeat its adversaries and protect Shiite populations abroad.",
      "Iran now may have second thoughts about the Oct. 7 attack on Israel last year by Iranian-backed Hamas militants in Gaza, which Tehran applauded at the time.\u00a0The attack, masterminded by the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, caught Israel by surprise but set off a chain of events that have undermined Iran on multiple fronts, culminating in the demise of the Assad regime, according to Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA officer with experience in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian axis of resistance has crumbled thanks to one person, Yahya Sinwar, who started this on October 7,\u201d Polymeropoulos said.",
      "Although Iran has suffered a blow in the short term, it will most likely seek to rebuild its proxy forces, possibly by using Yemen as a hub or exploiting possible chaos in Syria after Assad\u2019s exit.",
      "The United States and Arab partners will need to cut off Iran\u2019s ability to dispatch weapons and trainers to Lebanon to ensure that Tehran does not rebuild its militant network, said Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., a former U.S. diplomat.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s in our national security interest that we cut off Iran\u2019s capabilities in Syria because that\u2019s how they were transitioning and transferring weapons to Hezbollah, through the ground as well as overflight over Iraq and Syria,\u201d Kim told MSNBC. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re able to sever this right now, this could be not just a setback but a devastating blow.\u201d",
      "With its air defenses, missile arsenal and regional status damaged, Iran will have to decide how to manage its nuclear program and how to approach the new U.S. administration under President-elect Donald Trump, who imposed severe economic sanctions on Tehran during his first term. Those sanctions have remained in place, and Iran has continued to enrich uranium to levels close to weapons-grade while refusing to fully cooperate with U.N. inspectors over its nuclear program.",
      "But Iran so far has opted to stop short of building nuclear weapons, and may look for a diplomatic compromise with the United States and other powers as it tries to regroup, experts said.",
      "\u201cI think Iran will think twice before weaponizing and will maintain the nuclear card as a bargaining chip, and for now attempt compromises with its foreign opponents,\u201d Vatanka said."

      "And just outside Damascus, celebrating crowds tossed a noose around the towering statue of Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad, the dictator who first imposed his iron grip on Syria a half-century ago, and toppled it to the ground. Then they chained it to the back of a truck and dragged it through the streets past cheering crowds.",
      "Everywhere, it seemed, the celebrations were accompanied by the sounds of rebels firing their AK-47s into the air, by honking horns, and by the sounds of Syrians of all ages yelling \"Hurriyah! Hurriyah!\" \u2014 or \"Freedom! Freedom!\"",
      "The streets were littered in places with the discarded uniforms of Assad's soldiers, who dispersed before the\u00a0Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militants entered Damascus and all but ended a bloody 13-year civil war that had torn this ancient land apart.",
      "Follow along for live coverage",

      "In recent years he\u2019s also taken to using his real name, Ahmad al-Sharaa.",
      "Al-Jolani ordered his men to not harm civilians and to stop looting, although Syrians could be seen removing furniture and other items from Assad's abandoned palaces and eyeing the fleet of luxury cars the dictator kept in a garage.",
      "One of the first things al-Jolani's forces did was burst into Assad's brutal jails and free thousands of prisoners, many of whom had been held for decades in horrific conditions under which rape and other sexual torture were rampant.",
      "But al-Jolani heads a militant group that was once Al Qaeda\u2019s Syria branch and which both the U.S. and United Nations have designated a terrorist organization. And a wary world was watching to see whether Syria was replacing one despot with another.",

      "So far, most Syrians appeared to be taking al-Jolani at his word.",
      "After Damascus fell, Syria\u2019s prime minister, Ghazi al-Jalali, said in a statement that he does not intend to leave \u201cexcept in a peaceful manner that ensures the continued functioning of public institutions and state facilities, promoting security and reassurance for our fellow citizens.\u201d",
